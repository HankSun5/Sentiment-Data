The lawsuit came just as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) unveiled a global system designed to help companies better manage and protect their intellectual property. Musk’s xAI in legal battle with ex-engineer Musk’s xAI filed its complain t on Thursday, August 28, in a California federal court, alleging that former employee Xuechen Li stole confidential material tied to Grok, the company’s conversational AI chatbot, and carried it to his new role at OpenAI earlier this month. According to the filing, Li helped train and develop Grok during his tenure at xAI, which began last year. The company alleges he downloaded and concealed files shortly after accepting a job offer from OpenAI and selling $7 million of his xAI stock in July. The lawsuit claims Li admitted to theft during a meeting on August 14, but investigators later discovered additional sensitive material on his devices. xAI is seeking monetary damages and a restraining order preventing Li from working for OpenAI. It’s important to note that OpenAI itself is not a defendant in the case. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 before leaving its board three years later, has become one of the company’s fiercest critics. He is currently pursuing separate lawsuits against OpenAI and chief executive Sam Altman for allegedly abandoning its initial non-profit mission, and earlier this week filed an antitrust case against OpenAI and Apple in Texas over alleged monopolization of AI chatbots on Apple devices. TSMC promotes trade secrets registry While Musk’s startup opted for litigation, TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, took a more systematic approach to trade secret protection. The Taiwanese company said it would begin marketing its proprietary registry system to partners in Europe and the US. The system, in development since 2013, functions as a secure database of confidential information, ranging from chip designs to manufacturing processes. To date, 20 local firms including ASE Technology Holding have adopted the platform. TSMC associate general counsel Fortune Shieh said that the registry integrates with HR and IT systems and uses artificial intelligence to track projects, joint ventures and standout talent. The database now contains more than 610,000 entries. “If our suppliers also adopt this trade secret registration and management system… it can help them build a stronger innovation culture and more systematic management… and in turn, we benefit from that as well,” Shieh said. The company mentioned that cybersecurity had been “a fundamental and necessary consideration” from the outset, with automatic encryption designed to render files unreadable even if hacked. Rising risks for global innovators Despite such precautions and systems in place, TSMC has itself faced theft incidents . Earlier this week, Taiwanese prosecutors indicted three individuals accused of stealing its trade secrets to benefit Japan’s Tokyo Electron. The company has vowed a “zero-tolerance” policy and increased internal monitoring following recent breaches. While xAI seeks legal redress for alleged misconduct by an individual employee, TSMC is institutionalizing and about to commercialize a framework aimed at preventing such disputes. The potential for leaks or divulging of intellectual property has long been a major headache for businesses, and in recent times, that risk has been elevated in the AI and semiconductor space as firms compete for scarce experts and breakthroughs. This gives insiders access to commercially critical data which can be difficult to manage. Litigation may be necessary to punish violations, but systems that catalogue and protect intellectual assets could prove more effective in deterring breaches and making sure of lasting innovation.

Disappointing U.S. inflation data is the key factor behind today’s fall, with Bitcoin dropping by 4% in the past 24 hours, and Ethereum by 6%. However, this article will look at three of the most promising up-and-coming altcoins, all of which could soon bring big returns when they list for the first time. Each of them combine strong fundamentals with growing online communities, giving them the potential to rank among the best meme coins in the market. Next 100x Crypto to Buy Now – 29 August Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) With over $12.7 million raised, layer-two project Bitcoin Hyper lays claim to one of the biggest presales of 2025, and it could have one of the biggest launches of the year as well. Bitcoin Hyper’s sale is performing so well because of its enviable fundamentals, with the project about to launch a layer-two network for Bitcoin. Unlike the preexisting Lightning Network, which is focused mostly on payments, Bitcoin Hyper will provide a DeFi and smart contract layer for Bitcoin. In other words, it will enable BTC holders to tap into the coin’s enormous value, hopefully unlocking further gains in the process. They can deposit Bitcoin with the L2’s smart contract, which will then provide them with a commensurate quantity of HYPER in return. They will then be able to use HYPER within the network’s growing ecosystem of DeFi apps and protocols. HYPER will also be necessary to pay for Bitcoin Hyper’s transaction fees, giving the coin lots of utility. With $HYPER you're always securing the bag. From Payments to dApps. Hyper does it all. https://t.co/VNG0P4FWNQ pic.twitter.com/yAPbP2G73a — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) August 27, 2025 Investors can buy it now by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website , where it’s currently selling at $0.012825. Visit the Official Website Here Maxi Doge (MAXI) Another potential 100x crypto, Maxi Doge is an ERC-20 meme token with a community- and trading-focused twist. It opened its own presale a few weeks ago and has now attracted $1.6 million in funding so far, with this figure increasing fast. While Maxi Doge is obviously Dogecoin themed, it’s aiming to be more than a simple meme token, with the coin working on building an online community of likeminded traders. It will operate Telegram and Discord channels, where it will organise regular trading competitions, which will serve to reward the best-performing traders and generate more engagement. These channels will also serve as forums where community members can share trading tips and strategies, while even coordinating collective action. On top of this, Maxi Doge will maintain a Maxi Fund that it will use to support new partnerships and ad campaigns. This fund will equal 25% of MAXI’s overall supply (of 150.24 billion), giving it plenty of ammunition. Given the enduring popularity of Dogecoin-themed coins, Maxi Doge has every chance of performing well once it lists, and traders can join its sale by going to its official website . Visit the Official Website Here Snorter Token (SNORT) Another coin with a strong chance of becoming the next 100x crypto to watch, Snorter (SNORT) is a Solana- and Ethereum-based trading bot . More specifically, it’s an automated sniping bot, which investors can use to spot tokens before they rally, making trades ahead of the market. It has already raised $3.5 million in its presale, while its official X account already has over 14,000 followers. This is a very encouraging sign of its future growth, and of all the new coins currently holding presales right now, Snorter has some of the strongest fundamentals. Not only will its bot snipe on behalf of users, but it will offer a wide range of other features, including copy trading, atomic swaps, limit orders, and protection against dumps. This makes it a hugely comprehensive bot, with the native token SNORT necessary to gain access to its features. This means that SNORT could attract plenty of demand in the event of Snort becoming popular. It will have a max supply of 500 million SNORT, with holders able to stake the token for a passive income. How to trade like a pro with Snorter: Step 1: Paste a token address. Step 2: Sit back. Snorter watches liquidity like a hawk on caffeine. Step 3: The instant funds drop in, I pounce. Buy executed.

This single transaction, valued at approximately $249 million, immediately sparked widespread discussion and speculation across the crypto market. Such large movements often signal important underlying shifts, making it crucial to understand what this particular event might signify for investors and the broader ecosystem. What Exactly Happened with This Bitcoin Transfer? On a recent day, Whale Alert, a popular blockchain transaction tracker, reported a substantial Bitcoin transfer . Specifically, 2,300 BTC departed from a wallet associated with Coinbase Institutional. The destination was an unidentified wallet address, making the precise intent behind the move unclear. Coinbase Institutional serves as a prime brokerage platform for institutional investors, offering advanced trading, custody, and financing services for digital assets. Source: Coinbase Institutional Amount: 2,300 BTC Value: Approximately $249 million at the time of transfer Destination: An unknown, unlabelled wallet address This specific Bitcoin transfer , due to its size and the institutional origin, naturally draws considerable attention. It highlights the ongoing activity within the institutional crypto space, which often operates with greater discretion than retail markets. Why Do Large Bitcoin Transfers Matter? Every major Bitcoin transfer involving ‘whale’ wallets—those holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency—can have a ripple effect. These movements are often interpreted as potential indicators of market sentiment or strategic plays by large holders. When institutions are involved, the stakes can feel even higher. Investors closely monitor such transactions because they could precede significant market events, like large-scale buying or selling, or simply represent internal operational adjustments. Understanding these transfers helps in gauging the overall health and direction of the market. While not every large transfer leads to immediate price action, consistent patterns of institutional movements can provide valuable insights into evolving market dynamics and adoption trends. Unpacking the Reasons Behind This Bitcoin Transfer When a substantial Bitcoin transfer occurs from an institutional platform to an unknown wallet, several possibilities emerge regarding the motivation. It is important to remember that without direct confirmation, these remain speculative: Internal Rebalancing: Institutions frequently move funds between hot and cold storage wallets for security or operational efficiency. This could be a shift to more secure, offline cold storage. Over-The-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large blocks of Bitcoin are often traded directly between parties via OTC desks to avoid impacting exchange order books. The unknown wallet could belong to the buyer in such a deal. Custody Changes: An institution might be moving assets to a different custodian or setting up a new custody solution. Strategic Positioning: The transfer could be preparation for a future strategic move, though its exact nature would be unknown. Therefore, while the destination is ‘unknown’ to the public, it is almost certainly known to the transferring entity, serving a specific purpose within their operational framework. What Are the Market Implications of Such a Bitcoin Transfer? The immediate market reaction to a large Bitcoin transfer is often one of speculation and heightened observation. While a single transfer rarely dictates market direction, it contributes to the overall narrative. Here’s what we often see: Increased Scrutiny: Analysts and traders intensify their monitoring of on-chain data for follow-up transactions. Sentiment Shifts: Depending on prevailing market conditions, such a move can fuel either bullish anticipation (e.g., if seen as accumulation for an OTC deal) or bearish concerns (e.g., if perceived as preparation for a large sell-off). Liquidity Considerations: Moving a significant amount of BTC off an exchange can sometimes be interpreted as reducing available supply on exchanges, which could, in theory, impact liquidity. However, it is crucial for investors to avoid knee-jerk reactions. The true impact of this transfer will only become clear with subsequent events or further transparency from the involved parties. Concluding Thoughts on This Monumental Move This recent Bitcoin transfer of 2,300 BTC from Coinbase Institutional to an unknown wallet serves as a potent reminder of the dynamic and often opaque nature of institutional cryptocurrency movements. While the exact reasons remain undisclosed, such events underscore the growing involvement of major players in the crypto space. It reinforces the importance of monitoring on-chain data as a key tool for market analysis, even as we acknowledge its limitations in revealing true intent. As the crypto market matures, these institutional flows will continue to be a focal point for understanding market trends and potential future directions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘Coinbase Institutional’ mean? A: Coinbase Institutional is Coinbase’s platform tailored for institutional investors, offering services like advanced trading, secure custody, and financing for large-scale digital asset operations. It caters to hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. Q2: Why is a Bitcoin transfer to an ‘unknown wallet’ significant? A: An ‘unknown wallet’ simply means the address is not publicly linked to a known entity (like an exchange or major fund). Its significance lies in the mystery it creates, leading to speculation about the owner’s identity and the purpose of the large transaction. Q3: Do these large transfers always affect Bitcoin’s price? A: Not always directly or immediately. While large transfers can spark speculation and influence sentiment, they don’t automatically cause price swings. The actual impact depends on whether the transferred Bitcoin is then sold, bought, or simply held, and how the broader market interprets the move. Q4: How can I track similar Bitcoin transfers? A: Services like Whale Alert provide real-time updates on significant blockchain transactions. On-chain analytics platforms also offer tools to track large movements and analyze wallet activities, helping users stay informed about market flows. Q5: Is this a sign of institutional selling or buying? A: It’s difficult to say definitively. A transfer from an institutional platform could precede either. It might be a move to an OTC desk for a sale, or it could be a consolidation of assets into cold storage after a large purchase. Without more information, it’s pure speculation.

The transaction is the Bank’s first use of a collateralized loan obligation, a structure common on Wall Street but until now, unused by the development lender. The deal targets institutional investors hungry for yield and pushes private capital into markets where businesses typically face serious financing hurdles. The bonds are backed by debt issued to 57 different companies across Asia, South America, and Eastern Europe. That’s according to Yinni Li, a credit analyst at Moody’s Ratings, who reviewed the deal. Companies involved span sectors like telecommunications, food, and beverage production. The idea is to take loan exposures from the World Bank’s book, package them into securities, and sell them off. This would supposedly free up space on the Bank’s balance sheet to issue new loans while passing credit risk to investors. Moody’s rates $320 million piece Aaa, Goldman structures the deal The largest slice of the bonds, $320 million, was rated Aaa by Moody’s, the agency’s highest rating. This portion pays an interest rate of 1.3 percentage points over a benchmark tied to market rates. Moody’s did not assess the creditworthiness of the underlying loans themselves, only the senior tranche. The Bank kept the structure standard: risk is carved into tranches, the safest at the top, and more volatile risk below. This lets cautious investors grab high-rated debt while others take bigger bets on the lower-rated layers. Goldman Sachs worked with the World Bank on the design and execution of the transaction. The World Bank hasn’t done this before, but Wall Street has. These types of deals were heavily used before the 2008 financial crisis. Back then, toxic mortgages were bundled into seemingly safe securities, many with top ratings, until the entire structure collapsed. Since that blow-up, securitization became a dirty word for a while. But in the last few years, it has come roaring back. There is now over $1.3 trillion in global CLO issuance. A growing slice of that belongs to private credit CLOs, which are gaining traction fast. Retail investors are also jumping in, with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that buy U.S. CLOs pulling in serious inflows. As of earlier this month, ETFs linked to these types of loans managed over $34 billion in assets. World Bank plans more deals to push risk into private hands This deal isn’t just a one-off trial. The World Bank is actively building out an entire emerging-market securitization platform. That was outlined in a November presentation, where it said more transactions were coming. The Bank wants to expand its lending by taking some of its old loans off its books and handing the exposure to private institutions. That’s a key step in helping it lend more without ballooning its own balance sheet. Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank, told Bloomberg last month, “It’s the first time the World Bank has done this.” He confirmed that Goldman Sachs helped structure the product. Ajay said it was just one part of a broader strategy. Other pieces include debt-for-development swaps, which are also in play as tools to scale up investment into poorer nations. It’s not like no one has done this before. Other issuers have securitized emerging-market loans, though deals remain rare. In 2023, Bayfront Infrastructure Capital, based in Singapore, issued a $410 million CLO backed by revenues from project loans and bonds. That deal covered regions including the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, the Americas, and Africa. Like the World Bank’s deal, it relied on turning illiquid debt tied to infrastructure and development into investable products for global markets.

The panel left the levies in place until October 14 so the administration can seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Soon after the decision, Trump said in a Truthsocial post that the tariffs remain in place and vowed to keep them despite the ruling. He argued the appeals court was wrong and predicted the Supreme Court would ultimately side with his administration. He warned that ending the tariffs would hurt the U.S. economy, saying they are needed to counter large trade deficits and what he calls unfair foreign tariffs and non-tariff barriers. He said the measures protect American manufacturers, farmers, and other workers. Tariffs have been central to Trump’s foreign policy in his second term. He has used them to press trading partners and to seek new terms on goods sold into the United States. The steps have given Washington leverage for economic concessions, while also adding to market swings. Court says emergency law does not include tariff powers In its opinion, the court said the emergency statute the administration relied on does not grant taxing power . “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,” the court wrote as per Reuters . The case was decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. The panel reviewed the legality of what Trump has called “reciprocal” tariffs announced in April as part of his trade fight, as well as a separate round from February aimed at China, Canada and Mexico. The ruling does not touch measures issued under other laws, including the administration’s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Trump defended both rounds, and newer ones, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows a president to address “unusual and extraordinary” threats during national emergencies. The judges concluded that Congress did not grant tariff authority when it passed that law. “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,” the opinion said. “The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President’s power to impose tariffs.” Passed in 1977, the law has been used to impose sanctions or freeze assets, not to set border taxes. Trump is the first president to invoke IEEPA for tariffs, saying the steps were needed because of trade imbalances, reduced U.S. industrial strength and the flow of drugs across borders. Justice Department argued emergency powers allow trade restrictions The Justice Department argued in court that IEEPA’s emergency powers include the ability to “regulate” imports or stop them entirely, which in its view permits the use of duties. Trump declared a national emergency in April, citing decades of trade deficits and arguing that continued shortfalls weaken U.S. manufacturing and military readiness. He said the February tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico were justified because those governments were not doing enough to curb illegal fentanyl reaching the United States, a claim the three countries have rejected. The appeals court ruled on two cases at once. One filed by five small U.S. firms and another from 12 Democratic-led states. Both challenged the use of IEEPA for tariffs. They said the Constitution assigns Congress, not the president, the power to levy taxes and tariffs, and that any handoff of that power must be clear and limited. Another federal court in Washington has also concluded that IEEPA does not authorize Trump’s tariffs, and the government has appealed that decision. In all, at least eight lawsuits have been filed against the administration’s tariff program, including one brought by the state of California. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Such large-scale movements often signal potential shifts in market dynamics, making this particular Bitcoin transfer a focal point for anyone watching the crypto space. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Transfer Signify? The core of this news revolves around the impressive volume: 2,300 BTC. To put this into perspective, this is a considerable amount of Bitcoin, representing a significant portion of the total circulating supply. The fact that it originated from Coinbase Institutional, a platform designed for large-scale institutional investors, adds another layer of intrigue. Institutional players typically manage vast sums, and their actions can have ripple effects across the market. Therefore, any major Bitcoin transfer from such an entity is closely scrutinized. This particular transaction involves: Origin: Coinbase Institutional, a trusted custodian for major investors. Destination: An unknown wallet, meaning the recipient’s identity is not publicly linked to an exchange or known entity. Value: Approximately $249 million at the time of the transfer, highlighting its financial weight. Why Are Institutional BTC Transfers So Closely Watched? When institutional entities engage in a large Bitcoin transfer , it often provides insights into their strategies and market sentiment. These aren’t small retail trades; they are carefully calculated moves. Here’s why such transfers matter: Market Sentiment Indicator: A move from an institutional custodian could indicate a potential sale (if moving to an exchange) or long-term holding (if moving to a private, cold storage wallet). Liquidity Impact: A sudden influx or outflow of such a large amount can temporarily affect market liquidity and price. Security Considerations: Institutions prioritize security. Moving funds to an unknown wallet could mean enhanced self-custody or preparation for an over-the-counter (OTC) trade, which bypasses public exchanges. Regulatory Compliance: Institutional actions are often bound by stricter regulatory frameworks, making their moves more deliberate and impactful. Understanding these motivations helps us interpret the broader implications of a significant Bitcoin transfer . Who Could Be Behind This Significant BTC Transfer? The mystery of the “unknown wallet” is perhaps the most captivating aspect of this Bitcoin transfer . While we cannot pinpoint the exact identity, several possibilities exist: Institutional Rebalancing: The institution might be rebalancing its portfolio, moving funds to a different custody solution, or preparing for a new investment strategy. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: Large transactions often occur via OTC desks to avoid market disruption. The BTC might be moving to a buyer’s wallet directly after an OTC sale. Large Individual Investor (Whale): While from Coinbase Institutional, the ultimate beneficiary could be a high-net-worth individual who uses institutional services for their large holdings. Exchange Internal Movement: Less likely given “unknown wallet” but sometimes exchanges move funds between their own cold storage addresses for operational reasons. The anonymity of blockchain transactions, while a core feature, also fuels speculation in cases like this. What are the Potential Market Impacts of Such a Bitcoin Transfer? A Bitcoin transfer of this magnitude inevitably leads to market speculation. While it’s crucial not to jump to conclusions, here are some potential impacts: Short-term Volatility: The news itself can create uncertainty, leading to minor price fluctuations as traders react. Long-term Holding Signal: If the funds are moving to a cold storage address, it could signal a bullish long-term outlook from the institution, indicating they intend to hold rather relevant keyword e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.}} {{insert future oriented activity e.g. price action, institutional adoption, etc.}}.than sell. Selling Pressure Concern: Conversely, if the funds are eventually moved to an exchange, it could suggest an impending sale, potentially creating selling pressure. However, this particular transfer is to an unknown wallet, not directly to an exchange. Increased Scrutiny: Such events draw more attention to Bitcoin’s institutional adoption and the movements of major players. For investors, the key takeaway is to monitor follow-up movements and broader market trends rather than reacting impulsively to a single large transaction. This recent Bitcoin transfer from Coinbase Institutional highlights the dynamic and often mysterious nature of large-scale cryptocurrency movements. While the immediate implications remain speculative, it underscores the growing influence of institutional players in the crypto market. Keeping an eye on these “whale” movements offers a glimpse into potential future trends and investor sentiment, reminding us that every major transaction tells a part of the evolving crypto story. Frequently Asked Questions About BTC Transfers What is Coinbase Institutional? Coinbase Institutional is a suite of services offered by Coinbase designed for large institutional clients, including asset managers, hedge funds, and corporations, providing advanced trading tools, custody solutions, and prime brokerage services for cryptocurrencies. What does “unknown wallet” mean in a crypto transaction? “Unknown wallet” typically refers to a cryptocurrency address that is not publicly associated with a known entity like an exchange, a specific company, or a prominent individual. It could be a private cold storage wallet, an address for an OTC trade, or simply an unlabelled address. Why do large Bitcoin transfers generate so much interest? Large Bitcoin transfers , often called “whale movements,” are closely watched because they can signal significant market events. These could include institutional buying or selling, rebalancing of large portfolios, or preparations for major over-the-counter trades, all of which can influence market sentiment and price action. Does this Bitcoin transfer necessarily mean a sale is imminent? Not necessarily. While moving funds to an exchange often precedes a sale, moving them to an unknown wallet could mean various things: enhanced self-custody, preparation for an OTC deal, or simply an internal transfer for strategic reasons. Without further information, it’s speculative to assume an immediate sale. Did you find this analysis of the recent massive Bitcoin transfer insightful?

The figure, while slightly down 5.3% from the prior quarter, represents a 1.9% increase year-over-year, supported by growing management fees, improved treasury performance, and strong momentum in physically backed products. The company attributed the results to a surge in digital asset prices and rising institutional inflows. Bitcoin and Ethereum advanced by 29% and 37% during the quarter, pushing CoinShares’ assets under management (AUM) to $3.5 billion, a 26% increase from the previous quarter. This growth came despite continued outflows from its legacy derivatives-based products, highlighting shifting investor preference toward physically backed exchange-traded products (ETPs). Financial Performance and Market Drivers According to the company’s Q2 earnings report , asset management fees generated $30 million, compared with $28.3 million in the same period last year. Capital markets income came in at $11.3 million, slightly below the $14.6 million posted in Q2 2024, while adjusted EBITDA reached $26.3 million. Basic earnings per share stood at $0.49, marginally above the $0.47 a year earlier. CoinShares’ spot crypto ETPs attracted $170 million in net inflows, the second-highest on record, driving much of the growth in AUM. These inflows were boosted by the integration of Valkyrie ETFs into the CoinShares brand after last year’s acquisition. In addition, the firm’s proprietary BLOCK Index rose 53.7%, outperforming leading equity benchmarks , reflecting broader strength across digital asset markets. Within its capital markets division, Ethereum staking contributed $4.3 million, while delta-neutral trading strategies and lending added $2.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Liquidity provisioning generated $1.5 million, a slight dip compared with earlier quarters. The company’s treasury also swung back into positive territory, with $7.8 million in unrealized gains, compared with a $3 million loss in Q1 and a $0.4 million loss in the same period last year. Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marie Mognetti noted that the quarter demonstrated resilience across all business units: “We saw a significant recovery in digital asset pricing . While average prices across Q1 and Q2 were relatively similar, we closed H1 2025 with strong AUM and a favorable outlook.” Strategic Expansion and US Listing Plans Looking ahead, CoinShares is positioning itself for further growth , with plans to pursue a US stock exchange listing. The company is currently listed on Nasdaq Stockholm but sees the US as a market offering greater liquidity, higher valuations, and stronger investor appetite for digital asset firms. “The move from Sweden to the US will unlock substantial value for shareholders by entering a market with significant breadth and depth,” Mognetti said, pointing to recent listings by Circle and Bullish, which experienced strong demand and immediate share price gains. The company also highlighted a supportive policy environment in the US, citing recent legislative progress and an administration signaling openness to crypto innovation . Mognetti said clarity on the timing of the listing should be available within this quarter, with the firm aiming to capitalize on current momentum in both digital asset markets and regulatory developments.

50884583,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=812577,1756508411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50884583.jpeg,TRON Faces Key Resistance With Potential Breakout Target at $0.50,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/tron-trx/tron-faces-key-resistance-with-potential-breakout-target-at-0-50/,"TRON (TRX) has been experiencing muted performance in recent weeks, trading at $0.3389 at the time of writing. This represents a 21.4% decline from its all-time high of $0.4313, recorded late last year. Despite relatively stable price levels in recent days, the lack of upward momentum suggests investors might be carefully watching for a catalyst that could determine the token’s next major move. Amid this market setting, analysts are closely tracking TRON’s on-chain data. One key observation comes from CryptoQuant contributor CryptoOnchain, who examined network activity and resistance levels. According to the analyst, TRX is currently testing its historical resistance zone, a level that could prove decisive in whether the asset pushes toward higher targets or risks another setback. Related Reading: Extreme Greed Grips TRON: Could a Market Pullback Be Next? TRON Network Activity and Potential Breakout CryptoOnchain noted that TRON’s network activity is at record levels, with daily active addresses (DAA) surpassing 2.6 million, the highest figure in its history. This surge in user activity reflects strong underlying demand for the network, even while TRX’s price has struggled to break higher. Historically, such growth in addresses has acted as a fundamental driver for price strength, signaling that demand for TRON’s blockchain services remains resilient. The analyst highlighted that TRX sits just below its historical resistance. If the token were to close above its all-time high and sustain that level, the breakout target could range between $0.48 and $0.52, aligning with TRON’s On-Chain Value Bands metric. However, CryptoOnchain cautioned that this scenario depends heavily on TRON maintaining its active address momentum. A decline in DAA could undermine the bullish setup, exposing TRX to downside risk. The outlook also ties into broader market conditions. The CryptoQuant analyst believes that a potential altseason, a period of significant gains across altcoins, could provide the momentum needed for TRX to achieve a breakout. In this context, continued high network demand and user activity would support further price appreciation. Whale Activity and Stablecoin Dynamics In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha examined stablecoin flows on the TRON network, particularly the activity of large wallets. Data showed that in the past 24 hours, wallets holding over $100 million in USDT dominated TRON’s transaction volume, coinciding with Bitcoin regaining momentum above the $110,000 level. This concentration of large transfers is significant because it often precedes shifts in broader crypto market sentiment. A notable example occurred on August 12, when $100M+ wallets moved approximately $3.9 billion in USDT across the TRON network. That wave of transfers directly coincided with a 5% rally in Bitcoin, highlighting the role of stablecoin liquidity in driving market cycles. Related Reading: TRON Spot Market Signals Relief – Seller Dominance Weakens After Cycle High Taha added that the distribution of daily USDT wallet changes reinforces this trend. Wallets with balances above $100M accounted for nearly 35–36% of total daily activity, a level nearly identical to August’s inflows. Such concentrated whale activity suggests that stablecoin flows on TRON remain a leading indicator for market positioning and potential capital rotations into risk assets like TRX and Bitcoin.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) price drop has raised doubts about its long-term sustainability, as a 95% plunge in burn rate undermines one of its strongest supply-side arguments. In contrast, Pi Network (PI) technical analysis shows a token at a crossroads: a triple-bottom near $0.33 hints at potential reversal, yet broader adoption and liquidity remain limited until exchange access expands. Then comes a project rewriting presale history, BlockDAG . With $386M raised, 25.8 billion coins sold at $0.03 in Batch 30, and over 200,000 holders already onboard, BlockDAG represents not just speculative momentum but structural strength. Weighing the best crypto to buy, the divergence is clear: one project falters, one hesitates, and one accelerates toward dominance. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Collapses as Price Faces Pressure Shiba Inu’s burn mechanism has taken a sharp downturn, sparking concern among traders. Data shows that only 9.43 million SHIB tokens were burned this past week, a steep 95% decline from previous levels. Daily burns also plunged by 95%, with fewer than 170,000 SHIB removed in 24 hours. This slowdown is troubling because token burns are central to Shiba Inu’s supply control strategy. A weaker burn rate means fewer tokens leave circulation, potentially limiting long-term value growth. Despite the setback, SHIB managed a modest 3.25% recovery in price, bouncing after a weekend drop of over 12%. The coin now trades near $0.00001210, but slipped slightly after the rebound. Pi Network at a Crossroads: $0.33 Support Could Decide Its Fate? Pi Network is testing a crucial $0.33 support level, with a triple-bottom pattern hinting at a possible reversal. Holding this floor could spark a move toward $0.50-$0.85, but losing it risks a fall below $0.30. The token remains in consolidation, yet activity within its ecosystem shows resilience. A recent hackathon attracted 2,100 developers, and institutional confidence has grown with Ulu Ventures backing the project. Attention now turns to September’s Stellar Protocol 23 upgrade, expected to deliver faster transactions and smart contract support. While this improves fundamentals, analysts note real price momentum will require stronger demand and broader listings. BlockDAG’s 200,000 Holder Milestone Sparks FOMO Ahead of Launch BlockDAG has crossed a major milestone with over 200,000 holders secured even before launch, setting a new benchmark in community-driven presales. This early density of participation is more than numbers; it’s evidence of strong conviction. With Batch 30 priced at $0.03, the presale has already raised more than $386 million and sold 25.8 billion coins, making it one of the largest pre-mainnet fundraises in years. The strength of this community isn’t just in holding tokens. Adoption is reinforced by over 19,000 miners sold and more than 3 million users on the X1 mining app, creating a blend of retail activity and infrastructure support that most projects struggle to achieve post-launch. This means BlockDAG will enter public markets with built-in liquidity, governance readiness, and user activity already in place. The implication is clear: this scale of commitment positions BlockDAG among the most prepared projects in the sector, combining deep funding, active adoption, and broad retail participation. Analysts speculate that if momentum continues, the $1 price target could be a realistic post-launch scenario, underpinned by one of the strongest pre-launch ecosystems in recent years. Why BlockDAG, Not SHIB or Pi, Holds the Real 2025 Advantage Markets reward scale, participation, and resilience. Shiba Inu may remain a community favorite, but the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price drop exposes weaknesses in its burn-driven model. Pi Network, despite its technical analysis at $0.33, carries promise yet lacks the market depth to guarantee sustained upward movement. However, BlockDAG, with 3M+ X1 app users, 19,000 miners sold, and over 200,000 holders, has achieved before launch what many Layer-1s struggle to secure years later. Analysts suggest a realistic path to $1 post-listing, translating into over 30x ROI for Batch 30 buyers. BlockDAG embodies the infrastructure, liquidity, and confidence needed to enter the top crypto tier of 2025.

In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $48 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $8.52 Market cap $179.09M 24-hour trading volume $63.48M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2023 24-hour high $9.13 24-hour low $8.34 ORDI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 5.97% 50-day SMA $9.84 200-day SMA $16.13 Sentiment Bearish Green days 14/30 (47%) ORDI price analysis: ORDI drops below $10 On the day of writing (August 29), ORDI’s price dropped by 4.54% in 24 hours and 10.44% in the last thirty days. Its trading volume, however, rose by 24.35% showing more trader conviction in the price trend. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades below the Williams alligator trendlines, signaling a bearish market. The coin has registered negative momentum over the last five days. The MACD and signal lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, signaling a bearish market. At the same time, the relative strength index is in neutral territory at 44.10. It is oversold when the RSI drops below 30. ORDI’s 24-hour drop is likely driven by Bitcoin’s correction. BTC’s ability to hold $105k support – a break below could trigger cascading liquidations in high-beta alts like ORDI. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI is moving downwards at the $9 mark, with neutral RSI (38.79) and MACD confirmation. ORDI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 7.98 BUY SMA 5 8.55 SELL SMA 10 9.16 SELL SMA 21 9.54 SELL SMA 50 9.84 SELL SMA 100 9.40 SELL SMA 200 16.13 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 9.28 SELL EMA 5 9.26 SELL EMA 10 9.00 SELL EMA 21 8.74 SEL EMA 50 9.69 SELL EMA 100 13.47 SELL EMA 200 20.18 SELL What to expect from ORDI price analysis next? ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. Over the short term, ORDI remains correlated with Bitcoin, which is just below $110,000. The charts show it will continue downwards. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Why is ORDI up? ORDI is in a bull run this month. The rise in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market’s sentiment. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10.",Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|ORDI|ZRX|BTC|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-29 23:05:00

Are you watching the cryptocurrency markets for the next big move? Many eyes are on Solana (SOL), with a prominent analyst predicting a substantial Solana (SOL) rally . This forecast is sparking excitement across the crypto community, suggesting SOL could be on the brink of a major upward trend. What’s Fueling the Anticipated Solana (SOL) Rally? An influential, anonymous analyst known as Bluntz, boasting over 327,000 followers on X, has shared a compelling prediction for Solana. As reported by The Daily Hodl, Bluntz anticipates a significant Solana (SOL) rally once its current consolidation phase concludes. This isn’t just a hopeful guess; it’s based on technical chart analysis that often provides valuable insights into market movements. Bluntz points to Solana’s price action over the past 36 days, noting it has been trading within a defined range. During this period, a specific chart pattern has emerged: the ascending triangle. This pattern is widely recognized in technical analysis as a bullish indicator, often preceding an upward price breakout. It suggests that buyers are steadily pushing the price higher, despite temporary resistance levels. Understanding the Bullish Ascending Triangle for SOL For those new to technical analysis, an ascending triangle forms when there’s a flat upper resistance line and a rising lower trendline connecting higher lows. This pattern indicates that while the asset faces resistance at a certain price point, buying pressure is consistently increasing, preventing the price from dropping to previous lows. Eventually, this mounting pressure often leads to a decisive break above the resistance, triggering a significant upward move — precisely what’s expected for a potential Solana (SOL) rally . Bluntz’s analysis isn’t without historical context. The analyst drew a fascinating parallel to a previous period where Solana traded in a range for an extended 166 days. Following that prolonged consolidation, SOL experienced a remarkable surge, significantly outperforming Bitcoin. This historical precedent adds weight to the current prediction, suggesting that history might be poised to repeat itself for Solana. Historical Precedent: A Glimpse into Solana’s Potential The comparison to Solana’s past performance is crucial. When an asset consolidates for an extended period, it often builds up energy for a powerful move. The longer the consolidation, the more significant the eventual breakout can be. Bluntz’s observation highlights this, implying that the current 36-day consolidation, while shorter than the previous 166-day stretch, could still be setting the stage for a substantial Solana (SOL) rally . Investors often look for such patterns to time their entries and exits, aiming to capitalize on anticipated price swings. What does this mean for the average investor or enthusiast? It suggests a period of potential volatility but also significant opportunity. Monitoring the breakout point of this ascending triangle will be key. A confirmed breakout, typically accompanied by increased trading volume, would be a strong signal that the predicted Solana (SOL) rally is underway. However, it’s always important to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results, and market conditions can change rapidly. Key Takeaways for Solana Investors Eyeing a Rally If you’re considering Solana, here are some points to keep in mind: Bullish Pattern: The ascending triangle is a strong technical indicator for a potential upward move. Analyst Insight: Bluntz’s prediction, backed by a significant following and historical context, adds credibility. Historical Parallel: Solana has previously seen massive gains after extended consolidation periods. Monitoring is Key: Watch for a confirmed breakout above the triangle’s resistance line, ideally with high volume, to signal the start of the Solana (SOL) rally . While the prospect of a major Solana (SOL) rally is exciting, remember to conduct your own research and consider market risks. Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and predictions are not guarantees. However, for those tracking SOL, this technical setup offers a compelling narrative for potential growth. Summary: The crypto community is buzzing about a potential Solana (SOL) rally , driven by an analyst’s observation of a bullish ascending triangle pattern. Drawing parallels to past performance where SOL significantly outperformed Bitcoin after a consolidation phase, the current setup suggests a strong upward breakout could be imminent. While technical analysis provides valuable clues, vigilance and personal research remain paramount in navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency investments. Frequently Asked Questions About the Solana (SOL) Rally Q1: What is an ascending triangle pattern in crypto? An ascending triangle is a bullish chart pattern characterized by a flat resistance line and a rising support line, indicating increasing buying pressure and often preceding an upward price breakout. Q2: Who is Bluntz, the analyst mentioned? Bluntz is an anonymous but highly followed crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) with over 327,000 followers, known for technical analysis predictions based on chart patterns. Q3: What makes Solana (SOL) attractive for a rally? Solana’s current formation of a bullish ascending triangle pattern, combined with historical precedents of significant rallies after consolidation phases, makes it attractive for a potential upward move. Q4: How reliable are technical analysis predictions like this? Technical analysis provides valuable insights and probabilities based on historical price action. While not guarantees, patterns like the ascending triangle are widely respected, but market conditions can always shift rapidly. Q5: What should investors do if a Solana (SOL) rally occurs?

Ethereum is now above $4,600, after a recent dip. Analysts are saying the recent surge of inflows into ETFs may be hinting at future altcoin and presale rallies. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the presale that benefits the most from Ethereum’s momentum. Ethereum: ETF Inflows Signal Strong Institutional Confidence Ethereum is currently priced around $4,602, representing a 5% increase in the last 24 hours and a 71% increase in 1-year. The price of ETH had fallen to the low of $4,413 before it bounced back. The main engine behind the demand appears to be institutional, as U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs witnessed net inflows of almost $444 million during the previous trading session—almost twice as much the inflows into Bitcoin ETFs over that time. Fidelity’s (FETH) offering added $129 million, demonstrating strong competitive spirit from issuers. In fact, Strong inflows were noted to BlackRock’s ETHA, which topped the pecking order with over $314 million in inflows. The total assets under management for Ethereum ETFs have increased to almost $13 billion since launch. This shows that institutions are not just sitting on their hands but rather buying the dip. This difference between money flowing into the ETF and the spot prices becoming volatile shows a long-term faith in Ethereum’s fundamentals, say analysts. Why Presales Are Attracting Smart Money Since Ethereum and Bitcoin are now firmly upper class, attention has broadly shifted to lower cap altcoins and pre-sales as investors seek the exponential returns that are no longer possible from either of the two majors. The 14,000% return on investment in Ethereum is what presales can achieve. This cycle, analysts believe, new projects that combine transparency, audits, and scarcity could again take many projects to similar heights. Most presales below $0.01 are particularly fascinating as you have two-thirds of the market. Whales and retail traders can position themselves early on before the valuation increases on exchanges. August’s rise in Bankman-Fried’s token search and whale-backed inflows indicates that smart money is already seeking out the most credible opportunities in this category. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The “Next Big Thing” Under $0.01 Analysts are saying that MAGACOIN FINANCE is the ‘Next Big Thing,’ as Ethereum-ETF hype is generating new excitement over presale trading under $0.01. Security and transparency are driving investor interest in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With a completed audit by Hashex and strong team disclosures, it’s positioned to be one of the top crypto presales of the year — not just in hype, but in real fundamentals. Experts believe whales have begun to accumulate their positions, while the rapid increase in Google search interest suggests growing awareness in the broader market. Investors are buying in now ahead of presale allocations as demand prompts prices to rally higher. With a potential ROI of up to 65x, people are reaping significant benefits, with thousands of KYC-verified investors on board. Due to its limited supply, time is running out quickly to buy one of the best cryptos for 2025. Conclusion Ethereum’s price boom following the ETF approval shows that institutional money is here to stay, say analysts, but they expect the next chapter to be a presale bonanza. With its double audits, transparent team, whale demand, and sub-$0.01 entry point, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being branded as the ‘next big thing’ under $0.01. Analysts warn that early allocations may not last long.

The move comes as the court weighs whether Trump had the constitutional authority to dismiss her earlier this week. The case is unprecedented. No U.S. president has ever attempted to remove a sitting member of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. Its outcome could reshape the balance of power between the presidency and the central bank, which was designed to operate independently of political influence. Arguments were heard on Friday by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington. She heard from lawyers for Trump and for Cook during a hearing that stretched to nearly two hours. Cobb requested further filings from both sides by Tuesday. The judge did not immediately rule. Instead, she said she would make up her mind before the Fed’s next policy meeting, on Sept. 17. The meeting is key partly because if she were to be reinstated, Cook would vote on interest rates as one of 12 Federal Open Market Committee members. Trump’s legal team described Cook’s claim as “meritless” and unlikely to succeed, arguing that the president had the authority to fire her “for cause” and that the evidence supporting his action was strong. Cook’s attorneys argued that her due process rights had been violated. They noted that she never had an opportunity to defend herself against the charges and warned that upholding Trump’s action would undermine the Fed’s independence. Trump uses mortgage allegations to justify firing The firing came after accusations from Bill Pulte , a Trump supporter and head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that Cook lied on mortgage applications. He accused her of describing two properties as her “principal residence” in 2021, which entitles someone to better terms on a loan. This week, Pulte added a new allegation, claiming Cook had also labeled a third property as her second home. He referred all three claims to the Justice Department, though Cook has not been charged with any crime. Trump pounced on Pulte’s claims in a letter he posted to Truth Social, stating that Cook had been fired “for cause.” In practice, the term is reserved for the most serious cases of malfeasance and has never before been adjudicated by a court as it applies to a Fed governor. Cook has rejected the allegations. She said she has “no wish to be bullied” out of her job, and in the week since the complaints were reported, she has sought to deliver correct details about her financial history. Trump tests central bank independence Now the case is shining a light on the independence of the Federal Reserve. For more than 100 years, presidents have refrained from direct intervention in the makeup of the Fed’s board. Trump’s decision to fire Cook violates that tradition. Judge Cobb also expressed skepticism at elements of both sides’ arguments. She pressed Trump’s lawyers about what the president — and the president alone — can determine as “cause.” She also raised concerns about whether Cook had been adequately notified before her dismissal. If Cobb ruled against Trump, Cook would surely get her seat back, at least for now. If she favors the president, Cook would remain removed, and the case could move toward a full trial or possibly the Supreme Court. The ruling is of enormous significance for financial markets. The Fed has held interest rates steady at 4.25–4.5 percent this year despite pressure from Trump to reduce them. The president has also repeatedly lashed out at Jerome Powell, who chairs the Fed, calling him a “numbskull” for not cutting the cost of borrowing. As the legal fight continues, Cook is kept out of her office. Her future, and the power balance between the White House and the Federal Reserve, will rest on Judge Cobb’s ruling, expected in the next few days. Get seen where it counts.

Recent movements show ETH has dipped below a critical support trendline, a development closely watched by analysts and investors alike. This break suggests a potentially challenging period ahead for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. What Does the Trendline Break Mean for Ethereum Price? Ethereum (ETH) recently fell below the $4,300 mark, breaching a key support trendline that Fundstrat founder Tom Lee had previously identified. This specific trendline acted as a crucial psychological and technical barrier. Its failure indicates a shift in market sentiment, moving from bullish to a more cautious or even bearish outlook. According to Cointelegraph’s analysis, the immediate next significant support level for the Ethereum price is now seen at $4,180. Traders and investors are closely monitoring this point, as its ability to hold will be vital in determining ETH’s short-term direction. Understanding the Bearish Signals for ETH Several factors contribute to this current bearish outlook for the Ethereum price . Cointelegraph’s report highlights a confluence of signals: Historical Weakness: Ethereum has a history of showing price weakness during the month of September. While past performance does not guarantee future results, this pattern often influences market psychology. Declining Open Interest: There has been a continuous decline in open interest, which represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts (like futures or options) that have not been settled. A decrease often signals that money is flowing out of the market, reducing liquidity and speculative activity. Negative Funding Rates: Funding rates in the perpetual futures market have turned negative. This suggests that traders holding short positions (betting on a price drop) are paying those holding long positions (betting on a price rise). It indicates a dominance of bearish sentiment and a willingness to pay to maintain short positions. These combined indicators paint a picture of increased selling pressure and reduced confidence among derivatives traders. Where Could Ethereum Price Go Next? Navigating Key Support Levels While $4,180 is the immediate support level, the broader context suggests that a decisive rebound might not be straightforward. The current decline follows a prolonged bull market, making a quick recovery less likely. Market corrections after extended upward trends can often be deep and take time to resolve. Cointelegraph warns that if the $4,180 support level fails to hold, traders should prepare for a potential drop to $3,100. This level would represent a more significant retracement and could test the conviction of many investors. Monitoring these key levels is essential for anyone involved in the Ethereum market. Actionable Insights for Navigating Volatility Given the current market dynamics, what steps can investors and traders take? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Key Levels: Keep a close eye on $4,180 and $3,100. These are critical junctures that could dictate future price action. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies. This includes setting stop-losses for trades and only investing capital you can afford to lose. Dollar-Cost Averaging: For long-term investors, consider dollar-cost averaging. This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the Ethereum price , which can help mitigate risk during volatile periods. Stay Informed: Continue to follow reputable news sources and expert analyses to understand market sentiment and potential catalysts for change. Understanding these market signals allows you to make more informed decisions rather than reacting purely on emotion. Summary: A Critical Juncture for Ethereum The recent break below Tom Lee’s trendline marks a significant moment for the Ethereum price . With key support levels at $4,180 and potentially $3,100 in focus, the market is signaling a period of caution. The combination of historical patterns, declining open interest, and negative funding rates suggests that bears currently hold the upper hand. While volatility is a constant in the crypto world, staying informed and adopting a strategic approach will be paramount for navigating these challenging waters. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Tom Lee trendline for Ethereum? The Tom Lee trendline refers to a significant support level identified by Fundstrat’s Tom Lee. Breaking below this line typically signals a bearish shift in market sentiment and potential further price declines for Ethereum. Why is the Ethereum price currently falling? The current decline in Ethereum’s price is attributed to several factors, including historical September weakness, a continuous drop in open interest, and negative funding rates in the perpetual futures market, all indicating a bearish sentiment. What are the key support levels to watch for ETH? The immediate key support level to watch for ETH is $4,180. If this level does not hold, the next significant support is anticipated around $3,100. What do negative funding rates mean for Ethereum? Negative funding rates in the perpetual futures market mean that traders holding short positions (betting on a price decrease) are paying traders holding long positions. This indicates a dominant bearish sentiment in the market. Should I sell my ETH now that the price is falling? Investment decisions depend on individual financial goals and risk tolerance. It’s crucial to conduct your own research, consider professional financial advice, and implement risk management strategies rather than making impulsive decisions based on short-term price movements. Is a quick rebound for Ethereum likely after this drop? Analysts suggest that a decisive rebound is unlikely in the short term, especially since the current decline follows a prolonged bull market. Corrections after extended upward trends can often be deeper and require more time to recover. Did you find this analysis helpful?

A significant development recently emerged from a U.S. appeals court regarding the legality of Trump administration tariffs . This ruling, while not directly about digital assets, highlights the interconnectedness of global economics and policy, which often influences investor sentiment and, by extension, the crypto market. What’s the Verdict? A Crucial Decision on Trump Administration Tariffs A U.S. appeals court has delivered a pivotal decision, ruling that most of the Trump administration tariffs imposed during the previous presidential term are, in fact, illegal. This news, initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, marks a substantial legal challenge to the trade policies of that era. However, it is important to note a key detail: the court also stated that these tariffs may remain in place for the time being. This allows for further litigation to proceed, meaning the immediate impact on goods and prices is not an abrupt change, but rather a prolonged process. Understanding the Legal Battle: Why Were These Tariffs Challenged? The tariffs in question were primarily imposed on goods from various countries, most notably China, under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The Trump administration argued these tariffs were necessary to address unfair trade practices. The legal challenge centered on whether the administration exceeded its authority in imposing these tariffs, particularly regarding the scope and justification for their continuation and expansion. The appeals court’s ruling suggests a finding that the executive branch overstepped its statutory powers in the implementation of a significant portion of these Trump administration tariffs . What Does This Mean for Businesses and the Economy? This ruling introduces a layer of uncertainty and potential change for businesses that have been operating under the weight of these tariffs for years. Here are some key implications: Potential Relief for Importers: If the ruling stands and tariffs are eventually removed, importers could see reduced costs for affected goods. Consumer Impact: Lower import costs could, in theory, translate to lower prices for consumers, boosting purchasing power. Trade Policy Scrutiny: The decision puts future presidential administrations on notice regarding the limits of their authority in imposing trade barriers. Market Reaction: While not immediate, the long-term prospect of tariff adjustments can influence investor confidence and supply chain strategies. This legal challenge to the Trump administration tariffs underscores the intricate balance between executive power and legislative oversight in trade matters. The Road Ahead: Will Trump Administration Tariffs Be Lifted? The court’s decision that the tariffs may remain in place while litigation proceeds means the saga is far from over. This ongoing legal battle could involve: Appeals: The government could appeal this decision to a higher court, potentially even the Supreme Court. Remand to Lower Courts: The case might be sent back to a lower court for further proceedings consistent with the appeals court’s findings. Negotiations: The current administration might also use this ruling as leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. Therefore, while the ruling is a significant legal blow, the actual removal or modification of these Trump administration tariffs is not guaranteed to happen quickly and will depend on the subsequent legal and political developments. The Broader Impact on Global Markets and Crypto Major economic news, such as this ruling on Trump administration tariffs , often affects investor sentiment across all asset classes. Here’s how it connects to the crypto world: Macroeconomic Sensitivity: The crypto market, particularly Bitcoin, is increasingly sensitive to macroeconomic indicators and global trade relations. Positive or negative shifts in the global economic outlook can influence investor risk appetite. Inflation and Supply Chains: Tariffs can contribute to inflation by increasing import costs. A potential reduction or removal of these tariffs could ease inflationary pressures, which might be seen as a positive for assets like Bitcoin, often viewed as a hedge against traditional economic instability. Investor Confidence: A clearer, more predictable global trade environment can foster greater investor confidence, potentially encouraging broader investment across various markets, including digital assets. While the link is indirect, a healthier global economy and stable trade relations generally create a more favorable environment for all investments, including cryptocurrencies. This crucial appeals court ruling on Trump administration tariffs highlights the ongoing complexities of international trade policy. While the tariffs remain in place for now, the legal precedent set could have far-reaching implications for future trade strategies and the broader economic landscape. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, understanding these macro-level shifts is vital, as they often shape the underlying currents of market sentiment and investment flows. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly did the appeals court rule regarding Trump administration tariffs? The U.S. appeals court ruled that most of the Trump administration tariffs were illegal, finding that the administration exceeded its legal authority in their implementation. Why were these tariffs considered illegal? The ruling suggests that the legal basis for imposing and continuing these specific tariffs under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 was not sufficiently met or that the executive branch overstepped its statutory powers. Will the tariffs be removed immediately? No, the court stated that the tariffs may remain in place for the time being while further litigation proceeds. This means the process for their potential removal or modification will likely be lengthy. How might this ruling impact the US economy? If the ruling ultimately leads to the removal of these tariffs, it could potentially lower import costs for businesses, ease inflationary pressures, and result in lower prices for consumers, influencing overall economic activity. Could this ruling affect future trade policy? Absolutely. This decision sets a precedent that could limit the scope of executive power in imposing tariffs under Section 301, influencing how future administrations approach trade disputes and implement trade policies. Is there any direct impact on the cryptocurrency market? While there’s no direct impact, macroeconomic shifts resulting from trade policy changes, such as reduced inflation or increased global economic stability, can indirectly influence investor sentiment and risk appetite, which in turn can affect the cryptocurrency market.

Ethereum is now above $4,600, after a recent dip. Analysts are saying the recent surge of inflows into ETFs may be hinting at future altcoin and presale rallies. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the presale that benefits the most from Ethereum’s momentum. Ethereum: ETF Inflows Signal Strong Institutional Confidence Ethereum is currently priced around $4,602, representing a 5% increase in the last 24 hours and a 71% increase in 1-year. The price of ETH had fallen to the low of $4,413 before it bounced back. The main engine behind the demand appears to be institutional, as U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs witnessed net inflows of almost $444 million during the previous trading session—almost twice as much the inflows into Bitcoin ETFs over that time. Fidelity’s (FETH) offering added $129 million, demonstrating strong competitive spirit from issuers. In fact, Strong inflows were noted to BlackRock’s ETHA, which topped the pecking order with over $314 million in inflows. The total assets under management for Ethereum ETFs have increased to almost $13 billion since launch. This shows that institutions are not just sitting on their hands but rather buying the dip. This difference between money flowing into the ETF and the spot prices becoming volatile shows a long-term faith in Ethereum’s fundamentals, say analysts. Why Presales Are Attracting Smart Money Since Ethereum and Bitcoin are now firmly upper class, attention has broadly shifted to lower cap altcoins and pre-sales as investors seek the exponential returns that are no longer possible from either of the two majors. The 14,000% return on investment in Ethereum is what presales can achieve. This cycle, analysts believe, new projects that combine transparency, audits, and scarcity could again take many projects to similar heights. Most presales below $0.01 are particularly fascinating as you have two-thirds of the market. Whales and retail traders can position themselves early on before the valuation increases on exchanges. August’s rise in Bankman-Fried’s token search and whale-backed inflows indicates that smart money is already seeking out the most credible opportunities in this category. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The “Next Big Thing” Under $0.01 Analysts are saying that MAGACOIN FINANCE is the ‘Next Big Thing,’ as Ethereum-ETF hype is generating new excitement over presale trading under $0.01. Security and transparency are driving investor interest in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With a completed audit by Hashex and strong team disclosures, it’s positioned to be one of the top crypto presales of the year — not just in hype, but in real fundamentals. Experts believe whales have begun to accumulate their positions, while the rapid increase in Google search interest suggests growing awareness in the broader market. Investors are buying in now ahead of presale allocations as demand prompts prices to rally higher. With a potential ROI of up to 65x, people are reaping significant benefits, with thousands of KYC-verified investors on board. Due to its limited supply, time is running out quickly to buy one of the best cryptos for 2025. Conclusion Ethereum’s price boom following the ETF approval shows that institutional money is here to stay, say analysts, but they expect the next chapter to be a presale bonanza. With its double audits, transparent team, whale demand, and sub-$0.01 entry point, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being branded as the ‘next big thing’ under $0.01. Analysts warn that early allocations may not last long.

Investors in 2025 are no longer satisfied with meme coins or speculative tokens that do not have practical use. Instead, a long-term growth needs cryptocurrencies more than ever before to solve real-world issues, drive to use the power, and build strong communities. Altcoins with utility have also been resistant to being sensitive to market cycles. Not only do they provide short term profits to the investors, but they can also give profits in the long-term. With real use cases, tokens stand a much better chance of surviving and flourishing as adoption increases. Why Utility Matters in 2025 Short-term prices might be pushed higher by speculation, but the projects with practical implications will hold out. For example, Ethereum has emerged as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), and XRP has remained the leader in cross-border payments. With the rising adoption in the world, sustainability becomes the critical measure of utility. The Altcoins to Watch Ethereum (ETH): The smart contract leader. Cardano (ADA): Energy-efficient and research-driven. Solana (SOL): High-speed transactions for DeFi and NFTs. XRP (XRP): Cross-border settlement. Avalanche (AVAX): DeFi-focused scalability. Polkadot (DOT): Blockchain interoperability. Chainlink (LINK): Secure oracle solutions. Polygon (MATIC): Ethereum layer-2 scaling. Immutable X (IMX): Gaming and NFT infrastructure. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA): A scarcity-driven, high-growth contender. Integrating High ROI and Utility Among these established players, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one of the newest and most exciting opportunities. Contrary to other small-cap tokens that exist purely as speculation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a community ecosystem that can reward holders by its scarcity and security . According to analysts, early investors would have the opportunity to make 50x gains , which puts it on par with early-stage successes like DOGE and SHIBA. Its dedication to providing development and practical use makes it one of the rare new altcoins with both short-term gains and long-term utility. Conclusion The smartest investments today lie in high above and beyond hype projects in 2025. Altcoins , however, that have strong real-world use, such as Ethereum and Solana, and upcoming contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE , are the most probable to promise sustainable growth. The utility based long term portfolios will be in a good position to perform better with more adoptions.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-will-pump-to-10-soon-heres-why/,"Host of Crypto Crusaders Levihas once made a bullish call for XRP. He predicted that the digital asset would soon rise to $10, the closest 2-digit price. In a new tweet, where a viral video is captioned, Levi wrote, “$10 PER XRP INCOMING SOON!” In the video, a woman openly admitted she did not know much about investing and asked for help in understanding what to do. In response, Brazilian-American influencer Camilla Araujo shared her investment decision, saying she holds approximately 1.3 million XRP. She went further to note that the current price was around “$2 and something cents,” adding that the community widely expected a move to $10. According to her, such a price would secure her financial future and effectively set her up for life. $10 PER #XRP INCOMING SOON! pic.twitter.com/gnMwnBIWFI — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 28, 2025 Broader Market Context and Expert Views Levi’s tweet aligns with growing sentiment in the digital asset market that XRP could soon reach higher price levels. A recent report from Times Tabloid referenced Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL), a prominent voice in the cryptocurrency space, who has been vocal about XRP’s potential to climb to $10. Cobb suggested that the market is entering altseason, a period where altcoins outperform, and predicted that a $10 valuation for XRP will be considered normal during this phase. Supporting this view, veteran trader Peter Brandt has also confirmed that altseason for 2025 is already underway. Brandt’s recognition of the market shift has added weight to bullish forecasts surrounding XRP. With the asset currently trading well above its levels from the same period last year, the trajectory points to continued strength if market conditions remain favorable. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Fundamental Position Beyond market speculation, XRP’s established position as a payments-focused digital asset contributes to confidence in its long-term outlook. The token has consistently maintained relevance in the broader financial ecosystem due to its efficiency and role in cross-border transactions . Advocates highlight factors such as Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions , the expansion of adoption, and progress in regulatory clarity as supportive elements for XRP’s growth. Additionally, the token’s utility in payment systems provides a foundation that many argue will help sustain momentum even in volatile conditions. XRP’s Move Toward $10 The projection of $10 per XRP continues to gain traction among analysts and investors, and Levi’s tweet amplified that sentiment with a clear, confident statement. The viral video he shared also underscored how strongly the XRP community views this target, with holders openly expressing expectations of significant financial change if the price level is reached. While the exact timing remains uncertain, the combination of technical market cycles, expert forecasts, and growing adoption reinforces the belief that XRP could realistically achieve this milestone.

The question is whether LINK can push past this barrier and ignite a bigger rally, or if a pullback comes first. Parabolic Surge Stalls Below $76.60 Resistance According to Alpha Crypto Signal, in a recent update shared on X, Chainlink has shown remarkable strength with a parabolic move before entering a consolidation phase just below the $26.60 horizontal resistance zone. This level has now become the focal point, as traders watch closely to see if momentum will carry LINK beyond it. Related Reading: LINK Price Climbs Following Chainlink’s Deal With US Commerce Department, Eyes $30 Alpha Crypto Signal noted that the momentum behind LINK’s move was powerful, and a breakout above $26.60 should not come as a surprise in the coming sessions. Such a development could potentially trigger another leg higher. Still, the analyst cautioned that broader market conditions point to the possibility of a correction. If LINK fails to sustain current levels, the altcoin is likely to dump below the marked boxed zone. However, Alpha Crypto Signal described it as a must-buy opportunity, presenting traders with an ideal entry point at discounted levels. To prepare for such a scenario, Alpha Crypto Signal plans to place spot limit buy orders below the boxed zone, with the intention of patiently waiting for price action to align with the setup. This strategy reflects a balanced approach—ready to capitalize on both potential downside dips and upside breakouts. On the flip side, if Chainlink manages to break out of the $26.60 resistance with significant trading volume, Alpha Crypto Signal emphasized that the plan would need to be adjusted accordingly. For now, the analyst recommends keeping LINK on the radar, as it sits at a pivotal point where the next big move could soon unfold. Market Confidence Returns With Chainlink Buyers Stepping In Trader Rai, in his latest analysis on the 15-minute timeframe, highlighted that Chainlink has shown strong resilience after bouncing from its support zone. This rebound signals renewed strength in the market, with buyers beginning to take control of short-term price action. Related Reading: Chainlink Whales Scoop Up $150 Million LINK In Two Weeks – More Gains Ahead? The chart further suggests that buyers are targeting a retest of the $24.30 resistance level. This zone stands out as a critical barrier, and a successful test could determine whether LINK is ready to extend its upward trajectory. If the breakout above $24.30 holds with sufficient volume, LINK may confirm a continuation pattern toward higher levels. Such a move would mark a key shift in sentiment, giving bulls the upper hand and potentially paving the way for a stronger rally in the near term.

50886545,569544,1756512013,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50886545.jpeg,Tron Cuts Network Fees By 60% To Strengthen Position In Stablecoin Market,https://bitcoinist.com/tron-cuts-network-fees-by-60/,"The Tron (TRX) network has made headlines by approving a significant reduction in transaction fees, cutting them by up to 60% following a majority vote within the community, as rising fees have been seen as a barrier to user participation and ecosystem development. Fee Adjustments On Tron The proposal to lower fees was driven by rising transaction costs that have accompanied an increase in TRX’s value, the network’s native token, which has doubled since 2024. The proposal alleged that while higher fees are essential for the Tron network’s overall security and stability, they have also eroded Tron’s competitive edge, making it imperative to adjust them. The increase in TRX prices has led to a corresponding rise in fees for transactions, particularly affecting Tether’s USDT stablecoin and other contracts on the platform. As a result, the earlier 50% reduction in energy unit prices, established by a previous proposal, has been negated, prompting this latest response from the Tron Super Representative community. As of this writing, TRX trades at $0.33, up by 107% year-to-date, being in the top performers in the cryptocurrency market during the same period, outpacing tokens like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins such as Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). Short-Term Profit Impact Expected Justin Sun, the founder of Tron and a prominent figure in the crypto space, announced this decision on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). He highlighted that the upcoming fee reduction will be the largest fee cut since the network’s inception back in 2017 along with the TRON Foundation. Sun alleged that in the short term, this reduction is expected to impact the networ’s profitability, given that the network relies on transaction fees as a primary revenue source. However, Sun expressed confidence that the long-term benefits would outweigh these initial drawbacks. By encouraging increased user engagement and higher transaction volumes , Tron aims to foster a more vibrant ecosystem that ultimately enhances profitability. To ensure that the fee structure remains competitive and sustainable, the network’s Super Representative community plans to conduct quarterly reviews of network fees. These assessments will take into account various factors, including fluctuations in TRX prices, levels of network activity , and overall growth rates. In his social media post, Sun further stated: On August 26, 2025, the Tron Super Representative community proposed to reduce Tron network fees by 60%. This is the largest fee reduction since the founding of the Tron network. The proposal has already passed and will take effect at 20:00 (GMT+8) this Friday Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Crypto News|crypto|crypto news|Cryptocurrency|Justin Sun|Tron Network|Tron news|Tron transaction fees|TRX price|TRXUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRX|ADA|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-30 00:00:13
50886642,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=176798,1756512030,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/50886642.jpeg,"MAGACOIN FINANCE Shows in Whale Wallets Next to AVAX, DOGE, and LINK",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/magacoin-finance-shows-in-whale-wallets-next-to-avax-doge-and-link/,"Whales are on the move again and their wallets say it all. Big investors are stacking Avalanche (AVAX), Dogecoin (DOGE), Chainlink (LINK), and MAGACOIN FINANCE — a mix of established tokens and one altcoin that’s quickly building hype. To those paying attention to market trends, such movement indicates what the smart money is up to. And right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE showing up next to these names is catching plenty of attention. Avalanche (AVAX) Price Builds Confidence Avalanche is in the green today, trading at $24.47 and is up 5.23% in the last 24 hours. What’s catching attention though isn’t just the price pump. The level of trading volumes has declined steeply, and this is an indicator that holders are not keen on selling. It is the level of quiet confidence that is typically observed before stronger price action. In May-August, the number of transactions increased more than twice, reaching $30 million throughput. That is a massive boost to AVAX since a larger network usage results in increased tokens being burned. Add the hype around Grayscale Avalanche ETF submission, and it is understandable why investors would expect AVAX to rally up to $53.98 in the short term. The crucial level to consider in case of a bullish failure is $16.05, although the market remains on the upward trajectory. Dogecoin (DOGE) Bulls Target $0.30 Dogecoin price has been trading sideways for weeks, but now it’s knocking on a critical resistance level. Traders are closely monitoring price activity around $0.23. A clean breakout above it could send DOGE running toward $0.26, $0.28, and even $0.30. Analysts cite a symmetrical triangle pattern which seems to be close to completion. If this plays out, Dogecoin could have an impulsive breakout, the kind that usually comes after a long period of consolidation. Support levels are intact of $0.21 and $0.19, providing a strong foundation to the bulls. Currently, traders are waiting to see daily close above the $0.23 mark as the signal to go ahead. Source :X Chainlink (LINK) ETF Filing Sparks Buzz Chainlink just received a stretch by Bitwise submitting the first U.S. Chainlink ETF to SEC. The filing refers to Coinbase Custody for storage and the product is intended to permit in-kind redemptions and creation, which would be the ability to trade using the LINK directly, rather than by converting it to cash. Following the announcement, LINK surged 4.2% in one day to reach $24.33. In the past month, LINK has gained in excess of 26%. Such a move has attracted the interest of both retail and institutional traders that see a regulated entry into altcoins. Although this ETF is way off its all-time high of $53, there is a growing hope that a steady climb in LINK price could be on the way once this ETF materializes. Source: CoinMarketCap MAGACOIN FINANCE Draws Whales With Strong ROI Hopes Whales are streaming to MAGACOIN FINANCE, signaling growing confidence in what analysts call one of 2025’s breakout altcoins. With forecasts of up to 1200% ROI , the project is drawing heavy attention as investor demand accelerates. Confidence is further reinforced by a smart contract audit passed by leading blockchain firms, confirming MAGA’s transparency and security. Together with whale accumulation and an increased FOMO, MAGA is solidifying as one of the altcoins to monitor prior to the next bull cycle. Final Take AVAX is gaining strength from rising adoption, DOGE looks ready for a breakout, and LINK is getting ETF-fueled attention. But the interesting part is that MAGACOIN FINANCE now shows up in the same whale wallets. For a new altcoin, that’s a strong sign. As Bullish whales continue to accumulate , MAGACOIN FINANCE may be in it to win it in the new bout of post-merger euphoria.

Tron has stepped into the spotlight as rising network fees push its leadership to reevaluate the protocol’s transaction model. Toncoin, meanwhile, is showing signs of weakness, slipping in momentum as trading volume declines and investors hesitate. Both projects underscore how blockchain ecosystems must constantly adapt to technical and economic pressures to remain competitive. Yet while TRX and TON wrestle with immediate challenges, BlockDAG is building on firm foundations. With $386 million raised in its presale at a current batch 30 price of $0.03, BlockDAG is showcasing growth through strategic initiatives. Its referral program rewards early adoption, Dashboard V4 transforms presale transparency, and its headline appearance at Token2049 Singapore this October sets the stage for global visibility. In a market where many projects are reacting, BlockDAG is proactively positioning itself as a front-runner. Tron: Fee Models Under Fire as TRX Gains Momentum Tron (TRX) is facing scrutiny as its bull market surge drives up transaction fees, highlighting the tension between token appreciation and user accessibility. Founder Justin Sun acknowledged the issue, confirming that rising TRX value has increased costs for developers and users, a trend that risks eroding Tron’s reputation as a low-cost, fast blockchain. The network’s Super Representatives are leading a review of the fee structure, exploring ways to keep costs aligned with Tron’s affordability goals. Their ability to make real-time protocol adjustments is a strength, ensuring the network remains responsive in the face of shifting market conditions. Still, the challenge is clear: without proper balance, users may look toward alternatives like Solana or Avalanche, both of which offer speed with lower fees. Tron’s proactive approach reflects its commitment to user experience over short-term gains. If the Super Representatives succeed in refining fees while maintaining growth, Tron could preserve its competitive edge during this bull market. Toncoin: Mixed Signals and Cautious Market Sentiment Toncoin (TON) currently trades at $3.24, up just over 1% in 24 hours, but its broader picture is less encouraging. Trading volume has declined 15% to $207 million, and open interest has slipped, showing reduced investor participation. Over the past week, TON has fallen more than 5%, diverging from broader market gains and leaving traders wary of its near-term direction. Critical levels remain in focus. If TON can hold its current support, analysts see recovery potential toward $3.89, with $4.43 as a longer-term upside target. However, failure to maintain support risks a slide toward $2.80, which would mark a sharp reversal in sentiment. Technical indicators echo the uncertainty: RSI sits at a neutral 45, while the MACD shows faint bullish momentum but with slowing histogram signals. Caution defines market behavior around TON. Until volume strengthens and resistance at $3.89 is reclaimed, Toncoin risks drifting in consolidation or facing deeper corrections if sentiment weakens further. $386M Raised and Counting: BlockDAG Storms Token2049 Stage With Confidence While Tron and Toncoin explore immediate market pressures, BlockDAG continues to build a story of scale, engagement, and global visibility. Its presale has raised $386 million to date, advancing to batch 30 with tokens priced at $0.03 and a launch price set at $0.05. Early participants who joined at $0.001 in batch 1 have already seen ROI in the thousands of percent, while current buyers still hold over 1,500% upside potential. BlockDAG’s strategy is not confined to fundraising. The referral program incentivizes growth by rewarding users with a 25% commission in BDAG for each new buyer referred, while the referred party also secures a 5% bonus. This structure encourages organic expansion and community-driven momentum. At the same time, Dashboard V4 has set a new benchmark in presale transparency. It acts as a live exchange simulator with wallet tracking, real-time order books, leaderboard rankings, and gamified referral metrics. This feature instills confidence among buyers by mirroring a post-launch trading environment and ensuring visibility of activity before BDAG lists on exchanges. Perhaps the most impactful near-term milestone is BlockDAG’s confirmed presence at Token2049 Singapore in October. With over 25,000 attendees and 7,000 companies expected, it is Asia’s most prominent Web3 event. BlockDAG is not just attending—it is marking the occasion with a 2049% presale bonus valid until October 1, amplifying investor enthusiasm and spotlighting the project on a global stage. By combining strong capital backing, real adoption through referrals, presale transparency, and international visibility, BlockDAG is proving itself more than just another presale, it is growing as a contender for long-term leadership. Summing Up! Tron’s fee model review highlights the growing pains of a network balancing token appreciation with user affordability. Toncoin’s slipping volume and cautious sentiment show how fragile market confidence can be without technical breakouts. Both projects reflect the challenges of maintaining competitiveness in a crowded field. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is demonstrating how preparation and execution can create stability amid volatility. With $386 million raised, a $0.03 batch price, a powerful referral program, and Dashboard V4 transparency, it has already laid down critical infrastructure. Its upcoming Token2049 Singapore appearance, enhanced by a 2049% presale bonus, signals ambition not just to participate in the global conversation, but to lead it. For investors scanning the market, the contrast is sharp. Tron and Toncoin may offer short-term plays, but BlockDAG represents structured growth with long-term upside, a rare combination in today’s crypto market.

A Reuters report citing three sources familiar with the matter indicates that Google will face a “modest” fine subsequently marking a shift in EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera’s stance on Big Tech violations from predecessor Margrethe Vestager’s heavy-handedness, focusing on harsh penalties. The EU wants Google and peers to comply with regulations This comes after a four-year long investigation which was a result of a complaint from the European Publishers Council, which led to charges against the search engine giant in 2023. The allegations levelled against Google were that it favoured its own advertising services ahead of its competitors. According to the sources , Ribera’s focus is on getting tech firms to end anti-competitive practices as opposed to punishing them with hefty fines. As a result, the fine is expected not to be in the scale of a record 4.3 billion euro that was imposed on Google by the bloc’s competition enforcer in 2018 over using its Android mobile operating system to suppress competitors. Earlier in 2017, Google was also hit with a 2.42-billion-euro penalty for using its own price comparison shopping service to gain an unfair advantage over smaller European competitors. In 2019, the search engine giant was slapped with a 1.49 billion euro fine for abusing its dominance to stop websites using brokers other than its AdSense platform. The EU competition enforcer did not comment on the matter. Google referred to a 2023 blog post in which it criticized the Commission for what it termed a flawed understanding of the adtech sector, adding that publishers and advertisers have vast options. Last year, Google’s advertising revenue, including from search services, Google Play, Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Ad Manager, AdMob and AdSense reached $264 billion or 75.6% of total revenue. It is the world’s most dominant digital advertising platform. Google won’t be forced to divest part of its adtech business However, Reuters indicates that the company does not give out revenue figures for its adtech business which relates to advertising and not search. With the latest information coming out, Ribera is not expected to ask Google to dispose part of its adtech business although her predecessor had made such suggestions that the tech giant could divest its DoubleClick for Publishers tool and AdX ad exchange, according to what the sources revealed. This is not the first instance in which Google is having a clash with EU over unfair practices. In July this year, a coalition of independent publishers lodged an antitrust complaint with the EU accusing the company of its dominant search position by using their material to power its AI Overviews without offering an opt‑out. The publishers also sought an interim injunction, warning that continued use would inflict irreversible damage to their readership and revenues. Apart from this case, also earlier this year, a UK’s competition watchdog launched an investigation into the search engine giant’s dominance in search and search advertising. With these and many other cases, Google has accused the EU of hampering innovation and tech firms from flourishing in the region because of tough rules, subsequently short-changing consumers. Google’s sentiments are also echoed by others in the tech sector with a survey by European tech founders revealing widespread concerns over the bloc’s regulatory environment.

This notable drop signals a decisive move into ‘fear territory,’ causing many investors to pause and carefully assess the current landscape. Understanding this pivotal index is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool developed by Alternative.me to gauge overall market sentiment. It operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed.’ Essentially, it provides a quick snapshot of how emotionally charged the crypto market is at any given moment. But how exactly is this sentiment measured? The index considers several key factors, each contributing to the overall score: Volatility (25%): Measures how much the market moves, often indicating uncertainty. Trading Volume (25%): Reflects the level of buying and selling activity across the market. Social Media Mentions (15%): Analyzes the frequency and sentiment of crypto-related discussions online. Surveys (15%): Gathers direct polls of investor sentiment (though currently paused). Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks how often crypto-related terms are searched, indicating public interest. These diverse factors combine to give a comprehensive view, helping investors understand if the market is driven by rational decisions or emotional impulses. What Does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index of 39 Mean for Investors? Recently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index saw an 11-point decline from its previous day’s reading, settling at 39. This significant dip pushes market sentiment firmly into the ‘fear’ category. What does this actually mean for you as an investor? When the index enters fear territory, it suggests that investors are becoming increasingly cautious, worried, and perhaps even engaging in panic-selling. This sentiment can be triggered by various factors, such as negative news, significant price drops, regulatory concerns, or broader economic uncertainties. It often reflects a lack of confidence in the short-term outlook for cryptocurrencies. Historically, periods of extreme fear have sometimes presented unique opportunities for long-term investors. However, they also come with heightened risks, as market downturns can intensify rapidly. It is a time for careful consideration, not impulsive reactions. How Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Impact Your Strategy? For many, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index acts as a contrarian indicator. The old adage, ‘Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,’ perfectly encapsulates this approach. When the index shows extreme fear, it might suggest that the market is oversold and could be due for a rebound, potentially offering attractive entry points for those with a higher risk tolerance. Conversely, when the index hits ‘Extreme Greed,’ it could signal an overheated market ripe for a correction. This is often when asset prices are at their peak, driven by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), and a pullback might be imminent. Recognizing these patterns can help inform your decisions. It is important to remember, however, that the index is just one tool among many. It should complement, not replace, your own thorough research and robust risk management strategies. Relying solely on a single indicator can be misleading and lead to poor outcomes. Navigating Market Apprehension: Actionable Tips for Crypto Investors With the Crypto Fear & Greed Index now showing fear, how can you navigate these uncertain times effectively? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Keep up with reliable news sources and market analysis. Understand the underlying reasons for market shifts, rather than reacting solely to price movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: Spreading your investments across different assets can help mitigate risk during volatile periods. Practice Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set clear stop-loss orders and stick to your predefined investment plan. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Regularly investing a fixed amount, regardless of price, can help smooth out volatility over time and reduce the impact of short-term dips. Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Short-term fluctuations are common in crypto. Focusing on the long-term potential of projects can help you weather temporary downturns. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Fear can lead to impulsive selling, while greed can lead to reckless buying. Always stick to a well-thought-out strategy rather than succumbing to market emotions. The recent drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 39 serves as a crucial reminder of the inherent volatility and emotional swings within the cryptocurrency market. While fear can be unsettling, it also presents an opportunity for informed investors to re-evaluate their positions and potentially identify strategic entry or exit points. By understanding the index and combining it with sound investment principles, you can make more rational decisions, even when market sentiment turns apprehensive. Stay calm, stay informed, and always prioritize your long-term financial goals. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from ‘Extreme Fear’ (0) to ‘Extreme Greed’ (100). Q2: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? A: It is calculated based on factors like volatility, trading volume, social media mentions, surveys, Bitcoin’s market cap dominance, and Google search volume.

A: While some view extreme fear as a potential buying opportunity (contrarian investing), it’s not a standalone signal. Always combine it with your own research and risk management strategy.

The U.S. Justice Department has announced a pivotal US tariff appeal , challenging a court decision that declared many of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies illegal. This move signals a determined effort to defend past trade strategies and has substantial implications for businesses and consumers worldwide. What Sparked the US Tariff Appeal? The core of this dispute lies in a prior court ruling. This decision found that the Trump administration had overstepped its authority by imposing tariffs on billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese goods. The court specifically cited the use of Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 as exceeding the legal framework. President Trump’s administration initiated these tariffs as a measure to address perceived unfair trade practices by China. These policies aimed to protect American industries and jobs, but they also led to increased costs for many imported goods. The Justice Department’s Stance: Why Pursue this US Tariff Appeal? The U.S. Attorney General has clearly stated the intention to appeal. The Justice Department believes the initial court ruling was incorrect in its interpretation of executive authority regarding trade. They argue that the President possesses broad powers to implement tariffs under specific trade laws. Key arguments for the US tariff appeal include: Executive Authority: The department asserts that the President’s actions fell within the scope of powers granted by Congress for trade enforcement. National Security: Some tariffs were justified on national security grounds, a claim often used in trade disputes. Precedent: Allowing the ruling to stand could set a precedent that limits future administrations’ ability to respond swiftly to trade challenges. This appeal is not merely about past policies; it’s about defining the boundaries of presidential power in trade matters for the future. Potential Impact of the US Tariff Appeal on Global Trade The outcome of this US tariff appeal will have far-reaching consequences. For businesses, it could mean continued uncertainty regarding import costs and supply chains. Industries that rely heavily on imported components or materials from China are particularly vulnerable. Consider these potential impacts: Economic Stability: A reversal could re-introduce or validate tariffs, potentially leading to higher consumer prices and inflation. Trade Relations: It will undoubtedly influence the U.S.’s trade relationships, especially with China, and potentially affect ongoing negotiations. Legal Precedent: The final decision will clarify the extent of presidential power in trade policy, shaping how future administrations approach trade disputes. The global economy is interconnected, and shifts in one major player’s trade policy ripple across markets. What Comes Next in the US Tariff Appeal Process? The legal process for this US tariff appeal will involve several stages. The case will likely move through higher courts, potentially reaching the Supreme Court. This journey can be lengthy, often spanning months or even years. During this period, businesses and policymakers will closely monitor developments. The legal arguments will focus on statutory interpretation and constitutional law, specifically concerning the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches in trade matters. Stakeholders must stay informed to adapt to potential policy changes. The U.S. Justice Department’s decision to appeal the tariff ruling marks a critical juncture in American trade policy. This ongoing legal battle will not only determine the legality of past actions but also set a precedent for future executive authority in trade. Its resolution will undoubtedly shape the economic landscape for years to come, influencing everything from consumer prices to international diplomatic relations. Staying abreast of these developments is essential for anyone involved in global commerce. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the main reason for the US tariff appeal? The U.S. Justice Department is appealing a court ruling that found many of President Trump’s tariff policies on Chinese goods to be illegal. They aim to defend the executive branch’s authority in trade matters. Which specific trade policies are being challenged in the appeal? The appeal specifically targets the tariffs imposed under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 on various Chinese imports during the Trump administration. How could this US tariff appeal affect American businesses? If the appeal is successful, it could validate the imposition of tariffs, potentially leading to increased costs for businesses that import goods from China and creating uncertainty in supply chains. What does the term ‘executive authority’ mean in this context? ‘Executive authority’ refers to the powers granted to the President to act on behalf of the government, including the ability to implement trade policies and tariffs, which is at the heart of this legal dispute. How long is the US tariff appeal process expected to take? The appeal process can be lengthy, potentially taking months or even years as the case moves through higher courts, possibly up to the Supreme Court. Will this appeal impact current U.S. trade relations with China? Yes, the outcome of this appeal will significantly influence ongoing and future trade relations between the U.S. and China, potentially altering negotiation strategies and trade agreements.

Backed by a completed Hashex audit and a fully KYC-verified team, the project is drawing serious investor attention for combining early-stage upside with real protections. Today’s update covers fresh listing progress, funding milestones, and what the next weeks could mean for pricing, liquidity, and community growth at scale. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Exchange Listings, Liquidity Plans Take Shape The team reports steady progress on listings, with an initial DEX launch planned to establish on-chain liquidity, followed by staged CEX listings to broaden reach. This two-step approach is designed to reduce slippage at launch, support healthier price discovery, and make MAGACOIN FINANCE accessible to both DeFi natives and centralized exchange users. Listing windows have been aligned with final presale tranches so that newly unlocked demand meets prepared liquidity from day one. Presale Milestones: Nearing Sellout at Sub-$0.005 Investor demand has exceeded the presale beyond significant levels, with over $13 million raised from more than 12,000 unique contributors and community headcount exceeding 25,000 people via official channels. Pricing remains below $0.005 in the current tranche, but the allocation is reported to be over 90% sold. That combination—low entry with shrinking supply—has accelerated FOMO while keeping distribution broad enough to avoid unhealthy whale concentration at launch. Security and Compliance: Built to Withstand Due Diligence MAGACOIN FINANCE emphasizes verifiable trust signals rather than hype. The smart contract has passed a full Hashex audit , adding a layer of assurance. The core team is fully KYC-verified, and wallet transparency, liquidity locks, and clear vesting schedules are all documented. Tokenomics for Multi-Cycle Growth The token model is structured to scale across multiple bull cycles, with emissions and unlocks mapped to roadmap delivery instead of arbitrary dates. Utility features slated for rollout after listing aim to deepen on-chain activity and create natural demand sinks, supporting sustainable volume rather than one-off spikes. By aligning incentives for holders, contributors, and market-makers, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning for steady liquidity and reduced volatility as the ecosystem expands. What to Watch Next When the presale allocation is coming to an end, you should still monitor the final tranche availability, any additional audit artifacts being published, and the precise order of DEX and CEX listings. Events that could move the market in the near future are the trading pairs coming through, the initial liquidity depth at the actual launch, and the first utility releases’ timing. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s first quarters on public markets will be influenced by these steps being taken, which will also provide early price discovery and set the mood. Bottom line With exchange listings approaching, a near-sold-out presale under $0.005, audited code, a KYC-verified team, and protective tokenomics, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to look like one of 2025’s most credible—and most closely watched—presale stories.

At first glance, the chart presents a bearish setup, reinforced by the prominent red arrow pointing downward. However, a closer examination reveals that the chart is inverted. What may initially seem like a bearish call is, in fact, a bullish projection. The chart depicts a symmetrical triangle , and the analyst anticipates that XRP is nearing a breakout from this formation. I guess that's it for XRP. pic.twitter.com/RB2RjsoVxE — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) August 28, 2025 XRP’s Performance Within the Triangle XRP entered July with a powerful rally, reaching an all-time high of $3.65 . However, the asset’s momentum stalled toward the end of the month, and the converging trendlines show that it had traded within a tightening range. The price has oscillated between support and resistance, dipping below $3 multiple times and attempting multiple failed breakouts. This consistent pattern of repeated rejections at the upper boundary while maintaining higher lows along the bottom trendline has defined the symmetrical triangle that now dominates the short-term outlook. At the time of Xoom’s analysis, the digital asset traded around $2.96, close to the upper boundary of the triangle. The structure shows that the token has found a firm base above $2.9. This consolidation reflects both the caution and strength in the market as traders position for the next decisive move. Why the Breakout Matters The symmetrical triangle is typically a continuation pattern, but it can also signal reversals depending on market conditions. In this case, the analyst interprets the setup as bullish. Despite the visual prediction of a bearish breakdown, the chart’s inversion shows the expectation of an upward move once XRP breaks through the upper resistance trendline. Such a breakout would represent more than a short-term rally. It would confirm that XRP has absorbed the recent selling pressure within the triangle and is now ready to extend higher. The multiple tests of the upper boundary strengthen this outlook, suggesting that resistance may soon give way. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Targets After Confirmation If XRP manages to break convincingly above the triangle, price targets could extend significantly higher than current levels. A measured move from the triangle suggests a rise toward $3.9, which would mark a new all-time high for the digital asset. For now, XRP remains confined within the symmetrical triangle. Still, its consistent performance inside the pattern indicates that a breakout decision point is approaching, with a high chance of a price rally once the breakout is confirmed.

Grayscale, a leading digital asset manager, has officially updated its S-1 filings for spot Cardano (ADA) and Polygon (POL) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This move is a significant step forward for the broader adoption of Grayscale Crypto ETFs , potentially opening new avenues for mainstream investment in these prominent cryptocurrencies. What Do Grayscale Crypto ETFs Mean for Investors? When we talk about Grayscale Crypto ETFs , we’re discussing a financial product that allows investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies like ADA and POL without directly owning the underlying assets. These ETFs track the price of the cryptocurrencies, offering a regulated and potentially more accessible way to participate in the digital asset market. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart highlighted these updated S-1 filings, underscoring the ongoing efforts by asset managers to bring diverse crypto products to market. The updated S-1 filings are essentially registration statements required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for new securities. For spot crypto ETFs, these filings are crucial. They provide detailed information about the fund’s structure, risks, and operations, aiming to ensure transparency for potential investors. Why Are Spot ADA and POL ETFs Gaining Traction? Cardano (ADA) and Polygon (POL) are not just any cryptocurrencies; they represent significant innovation within the blockchain space. Cardano is known for its research-driven approach to development and peer-reviewed academic studies, aiming for a highly secure and sustainable platform. Polygon, on the other hand, is a scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to improve transaction speeds and reduce costs, making decentralized applications more practical. The potential introduction of spot ETFs for these assets reflects a growing institutional interest beyond just Bitcoin and and Ethereum. It signifies a maturation of the crypto market, where more diverse, high-potential assets are being considered for regulated investment vehicles. This expansion could offer investors: Diversification: A broader range of crypto assets within a regulated framework. Accessibility: Easier access through traditional brokerage accounts. Professional Management: Funds managed by experienced asset managers like Grayscale. What Are the Next Steps for Grayscale Crypto ETFs? While updated S-1 filings are a positive sign, they are just one step in a multi-stage approval process. The SEC still needs to review and approve these filings, which can be a lengthy and unpredictable journey. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, particularly spot ETFs, remains complex in the United States. However, the consistent efforts by firms like Grayscale demonstrate a strong commitment to navigating these challenges. Historically, the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs paved the way for broader acceptance. Many market observers believe that if more spot Grayscale Crypto ETFs are approved, it could lead to increased institutional adoption and liquidity for the underlying assets. This would be a tremendous boost for the entire crypto ecosystem, providing greater legitimacy and stability. Navigating the Future: Benefits and Potential Roadblocks The introduction of Grayscale Crypto ETFs for ADA and POL offers compelling benefits, but it also comes with potential hurdles: Benefits: Reduced Custody Risk: Investors don’t directly handle crypto storage. Market Efficiency: Potential for better price discovery and arbitrage opportunities. Broader Investor Base: Attracts traditional investors who prefer regulated products. Potential Roadblocks: Regulatory Uncertainty: The SEC’s stance on non-Bitcoin/Ethereum spot ETFs is still evolving. Market Volatility: Crypto markets are inherently volatile, which can impact ETF performance. Fees: ETFs typically come with management fees, which can eat into returns. Despite these challenges, the continuous updates from Grayscale underscore the industry’s determination to integrate digital assets into traditional finance. This commitment could unlock significant value for investors seeking exposure to the innovative potential of Cardano and Polygon. In conclusion, Grayscale’s updated S-1 filings for spot ADA and POL ETFs are a significant development, signaling growing momentum for diversified Grayscale Crypto ETFs . While regulatory hurdles remain, these efforts reflect a maturing market and increasing institutional interest in a wider array of digital assets. Keep an eye on these developments; they could redefine how we invest in the future of finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are spot crypto ETFs?

The crypto world is buzzing with news as the Altcoin Season Index , provided by CoinMarketCap, has recently climbed to a significant 58. This one-point increase from the previous day signals a notable shift, suggesting that altcoins are gaining momentum against Bitcoin. But what exactly does this number mean for you and your digital assets? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: What Does 58 Mean? The Altcoin Season Index is a crucial metric for investors. It measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. A reading closer to 100 indicates a stronger trend where altcoins are broadly outperforming Bitcoin. Specifically, an ""altcoin season"" is declared when 75% of these top coins surpass Bitcoin’s performance during that 90-day period. Reaching 58 on this index tells us that a substantial number of altcoins are currently showing stronger price action compared to Bitcoin. While not yet at the ""official"" 75% threshold for a full altcoin season, this upward movement is a clear indicator of growing investor interest and capital flow into the broader altcoin market. Therefore, many traders and investors closely monitor this index for potential opportunities. Why the Altcoin Season Index Matters for Your Portfolio The rising Altcoin Season Index has several implications for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Firstly, it often suggests a period where diversified portfolios, including a mix of promising altcoins, might see better returns than those solely focused on Bitcoin. Secondly, it highlights specific sectors or narratives within the altcoin space that are attracting significant attention. Key benefits of a rising index include: Diversification potential: Exploring altcoins can spread risk and enhance returns. Higher growth potential: Many altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps, can experience rapid price appreciation. Innovation spotlight: A rising index often shines a light on innovative projects and emerging technologies. However, it is essential to remember that higher potential returns often come with increased risk. Therefore, always conduct thorough research before investing. Navigating the Altcoin Landscape: Tips for Investors With the Altcoin Season Index showing strength, how can you effectively navigate this dynamic market? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Research (DYOR): Understand the fundamentals of any altcoin before investing. Look at its use case, team, technology, and community. Risk Management: Allocate only what you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Diversify Wisely: Instead of putting all your funds into one altcoin, spread your investments across several promising projects. Stay Informed: Keep up with market news, project updates, and broader economic trends that can influence altcoin performance. The crypto market moves quickly, so staying vigilant and adaptable is key to success during periods of heightened altcoin activity. Challenges and Considerations in an Altcoin-Favorable Market While the rising Altcoin Season Index brings exciting prospects, it also presents certain challenges. Volatility is a primary concern, as altcoins can experience more drastic price swings than Bitcoin. Additionally, the sheer number of altcoins makes it challenging to identify truly valuable projects from those with less long-term potential. Potential challenges include: Increased Volatility: Altcoin prices can be highly unpredictable. Scam Projects: The market can attract projects lacking genuine utility or with malicious intent. Liquidity Issues: Some smaller altcoins may have low trading volumes, making it difficult to buy or sell large positions without impacting the price. Therefore, a cautious and informed approach is always recommended, even when the market sentiment appears bullish for altcoins. Conclusion: The Future of Altcoins Looks Promising The climb of the Altcoin Season Index to 58 is a compelling signal for the cryptocurrency market. It underscores a growing confidence in altcoins and their potential to outperform Bitcoin in the short to medium term. While this doesn’t guarantee a full-blown altcoin season, it certainly creates an environment ripe with opportunities for those who are prepared to research and manage their risks effectively. This period encourages a closer look at the innovative projects shaping the future of decentralized finance and beyond. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index?

It helps indicate whether altcoins are generally outperforming Bitcoin. Q2: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 58 signify? A reading of 58 means that a significant number of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. While not yet the 75% threshold for a declared ""altcoin season,"" it shows strong positive momentum for the altcoin market. Q3: How is an ""Altcoin Season"" officially declared? An Altcoin Season is officially declared when 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin in price performance over the preceding 90 days. Q4: Is now a good time to invest in altcoins? The rising Altcoin Season Index suggests a favorable environment for altcoins. However, all investments carry risk. It’s crucial to conduct your own research (DYOR), understand individual project fundamentals, and manage your risk exposure carefully before investing. Q5: What are the risks associated with investing during an altcoin-favorable period? Key risks include high volatility, the presence of scam projects, and potential liquidity issues for smaller altcoins. Always approach with caution and a well-defined investment strategy.

Bitcoin Illiquid Supply On Binance Hit Record Highs According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, Bitcoin’s illiquid supply recently touched new highs on the Binance exchange. In contrast, BTC’s liquid supply has seen a significant decline. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment On Binance Turns Bullish – But Is The Market Setting A Trap? The CryptoQuant contributor shared the following chart which shows the difference between BTC’s liquid vs illiquid supply on Binance. Bitcoin recently hit a fresh all-time high (ATH) above $120,000 before a price correction, showing that the market is currently in a state of “liquidity scarcity” supporting an upward trend. A high level of illiquid supply essentially means that more BTC is locked away in wallets with minimal movement, effectively removing it from circulation on exchanges. This reduces the amount of Bitcoin available for trading. A lack of BTC readily available on exchanges increases buying pressure on the limited supply that remains. This dynamic helps explain how BTC has continued to reach new highs even without massive inflows of external liquidity. That said, there remain some risks. BTC’s low liquid supply means that whales or large holders can exert significant pressure on the cryptocurrency through any sudden sell-off. Such pressure could result in sharp price correction for the digital asset due to the lack of liquidity to absorb the new supply. At the same time, current on-chain data indicates that whales and institutions appear to be adopting a “hold for the long haul” strategy, underscoring their confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term strategic asset. However, analysts caution that any sudden shift in this behavior would be felt almost immediately across the market. BTC In A “Fragile Bull Run” Arab Chain described the present market situation as a contradictory one. On one hand, rising illiquid supply provides a foundation for further price appreciation. On the other, the lack of liquid supply creates a fragile market structure where even moderate selling could cause significant volatility. Related Reading: More Pain For Bitcoin? Open Interest Surpasses $40 Billion As Longs Crowd In As a result, Bitcoin is currently in a “fragile bull run” in that it is supported by long-term holders but susceptible to sudden selling from whales. However, if BTC illiquid supply continues to rise, then it could move toward levels exceeding $150,000 by the end of 2025. On the flipside, if the liquid supply increases due to persistent sell-offs, then the market could face challenges, leading to a price decline to as low as the $90,000 to $100,000 range. Despite BTC’s fragile price momentum, some experts continue to remain optimistic. Crypto analyst Timothy Peterson recently predicted that BTC can surge as high as $160,000 by Christmas. At press time, BTC trades at $109,286, down 3% in the past 24 hours.

Hedera, on the other hand, stands at a technical crossroads, with its ability to defend critical support likely dictating whether it can graduate from promise to performance. Yet it is BlockDAG that is drawing the sharpest spotlight. With over $386 million raised and a bold $600 million presale target, BlockDAG isn’t just participating in the altcoin race, it is redrawing the track. Its design prioritizes scalability, liquidity, and developer incentives at a magnitude few competitors can match. If Dogecoin shows cultural stickiness and Hedera reflects institutional curiosity, BlockDAG represents a decisive economic moat. It isn’t hype, it’s an infrastructure play with grassroots momentum, setting itself apart as the most ambitious Layer 1 bet this year. BlockDAG’s $600M Presale Sets Stage for Explosive Breakout BlockDAG is quickly emerging as the most watched Layer 1 project of 2025, and its bold $600M presale target signals confidence few rivals can match. With $386M already raised, the project is more than halfway there, positioning itself among the most ambitious fundraising efforts in crypto history. Unlike smaller-scale raises that often burn out, BlockDAG’s strategy is designed to fuel global liquidity, infrastructure scaling, and developer incentives, giving it a runway that could rival Avalanche or Aptos, but with stronger grassroots momentum. The technical backdrop adds to the buzz. Just as Dogecoin and Hedera (HBAR) are testing critical support zones before potential breakouts, BlockDAG is consolidating ahead of its own inflection point. Analysts suggest that once its presale crosses key thresholds, momentum could snowball into one of the sharpest rallies the market has seen. The sheer scale of its raise becomes a moat, an economic shield that sets it apart from hype-driven projects. For investors, this is more than a presale, it’s a chance to enter early into a project built for scale, liquidity, and sustainability. With upside potential amplified by strong demand and defined growth plans, BlockDAG is shaping up as the FOMO play of the year. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Poised for a Breakout Toward New Highs Dogecoin (DOGE) has been holding firm above the $0.21 mark, and this stability is drawing attention. Unlike past rallies that were driven almost entirely by hype, the current move shows signs of stronger market structure. Analysts suggest that if DOGE can maintain this base, the next logical milestone is $0.30, a level that could ignite broader momentum. Pushing further, the key resistance lies at $0.48, its previous high. A successful break above that zone could set the stage for a new all-time high. The $0.16–$0.17 range has repeatedly acted as a springboard, with buyers stepping in to defend dips. This recurring demand hints that the market isn’t just speculative, it’s finding sustainable interest. Of course, risks remain. A drop below $0.21 could invite a correction, but for now, the bias leans upward. For investors, this presents a balanced risk-reward scenario: steady support below and significant upside potential ahead. HBAR Holding Critical Support Signals Big Move Ahead Hedera (HBAR) is perched at a pivotal technical level, trading around $0.234 as it shapes a descending triangle, a chart pattern that often precedes either a sharp breakout or a steep correction. Despite ongoing pressure, HBAR has repeatedly defended its crucial $0.226 support, suggesting strong buying interest and accumulation from long-term investors. A decisive push above the 50-day moving average, now hovering near $0.245, could trigger a rally toward $0.305, delivering more than 30% upside in the short term. Conversely, failure to maintain the $0.226 zone would expose HBAR to a pullback in the $0.16–$0.20 range, erasing recent gains and dampening momentum. For investors, this creates a defined risk-reward scenario: clear downside protection with significant upside potential if bullish momentum returns. With volatility high across altcoins, HBAR’s technical setup stands out as one of the more watchable plays for traders seeking timely entry points. Final Word: BlockDAG Emerges as the Defining Altcoin of 2025 If Dogecoin is the nostalgia play and Hedera is the cautious bet, BlockDAG is the strategic entry point for investors seeking asymmetric upside backed by robust fundamentals. Unlike its rivals, BlockDAG is not merely riding speculative waves; its $386M presale already demonstrates deep conviction from investors. The massive capital inflow translates into liquidity, developer incentives, and infrastructure scaling, factors that elevate it beyond hype. In the fast-paced crypto market of 2025, where Dogecoin thrives on sentiment and Hedera wrestles with adoption hurdles, BlockDAG’s $600M presale stands as the strongest economic moat. It is not just competing; it is rewriting the competitive landscape and positioning itself as the defining altcoin of 2025. With its presale momentum accelerating and investor confidence surging, BlockDAG is laying the groundwork for sustainable dominance, turning early participation into a generational opportunity that could outpace both legacy tokens and new entrants.

Both sit at the center of the ETF conversation, and both have fuel from institutions and community traction. Cardano’s ETF decision has a new timeline, while Avalanche has filings, custodians, and tokenization moves lining up. Near the end of this piece, you’ll also meet MAGACOIN FINANCE —fresh, fast-growing, HashEx-audited, and pitched by many as a candidate for best crypto presale 2025 in a cycle where early entries matter. Cardano: ETF Clock Ticks, Institutions Circle The SEC pushed the Cardano ETF decision to October 26, 2025 , giving the market a clear date to watch. Traders track approval odds that sit near the top of the range—Polymarket around 79% and well-known ETF watchers calling it near 90%. That sets the tone for Cardano price prediction 2025, where the path often hinges on the approval window and liquidity that may follow. Institutional signals keep building. Franklin Templeton runs Cardano nodes and has been in direct talks with leadership about blockchain adoption. On-chain data shows large holders snapping up ~200 million ADA (about $157 million) in a short 48-hour window in Q3. Governance is active too: the community approved a development fund of about $71 million (96 million ADA) with strong support. ADA joined the Nasdaq Crypto Index in mid-Q3 2025, it returned to major U.S. platforms like Bitstamp and Binance US, and a joint SEC-CFTC effort dubbed “Project Crypto” aims to clarify token categories—an umbrella step many view as tailwind for altcoin ETFs. For investors building a list of sltcoins to watch 2025 , ADA belongs in the conversation. Avalanche: Filings, Custody, and Tokenization Heat Grayscale filed to convert its Avalanche Trust into a spot ETF (late Q3 2025), with listing plans on Nasdaq. There’s competition in motion—VanEck submitted an AVAX ETF application in March 2025, and Nasdaq filed 19b-4 docs that same month. The proposed Grayscale fund taps Coinbase Custody, while BNY Mellon handles admin and transfer agent duties. Creations and redemptions would be cash-based, and as much as 85% of holdings may be staked to capture rewards. Institutions are testing the rails. SkyBridge plans to tokenize $300 million (about 10% of AUM) on Avalanche. Wyoming launched the FRNT stablecoin on Avalanche alongside six other chains. In Europe, Crypto Finance (a Deutsche Börse Group unit) integrated AVAX for institutional access in Q3 2025. All of that informs Avalanche crypto price prediction chatter. Analysts flag a short-run band around $28–$33, while more speculative takes stretch toward $500 if institutional use grows. With AVAX trading in the low-to-mid $20s range at times this year, many list it among best crypto to buy now . MAGACOIN FINANCE: Retail Floodgates and a Fresh Narrative As ETF hype builds, traders are eyeing ADA and AVAX—yet the real heat, some say, sits with MAGACOIN FINANCE, a sale gaining speed as retail flows pick up. The project has passed an independent smart-contract audit by HashEx , one of the top names in blockchain security. That box ticked, the narrative shifts to access and timing—exactly why many tag MAGACOIN FINANCE as a fit for best crypto presale 2025 lists . With a crowd projecting up to 11000% upside, buyers argue that missing early allocations could sting if ETF tailwinds lift the whole market. Final Take: Three Paths Before the Peak ETF headlines give traders three angles. Cardano has a hard date and strong odds.. Avalanche stacks filings, custodians, and real-world tokenization. And MAGACOIN FINANCE slots in as the rising new play—HashEx-audited, gaining speed with retail, and pitched for best crypto presale 2025 lists. If you’re building a shortlist of the best altcoins to buy now or the best crypto to buy now, ADA and AVAX give the ETF-focused route, while MAGACOIN FINANCE adds the high-beta wildcard.

In a series of direct posts, he stated that he does not support Ripple holders and even joked that he would mock anyone who sent him a private message. ZachXBT Calls XRP Holders “Exit Liquidity” For Insiders In his posts, ZachXBT explained why he keeps his distance from the XRP community. “I do not currently assist the XRP community and will make fun of anyone who sends me a DM,” he wrote. He went further to say that Ripple holders are not worth supporting because they provide “nothing of value to the industry except exit liquidity for insiders .” The on-chain detective also noted that the supply of XRP remains heavily controlled by insiders. In his view, this makes the token less attractive and prevents fair growth. He added that the community around XRP behaves more like a cult than a group trying to build real technology. According to him, Ripple holders focus too much on hype, price promotion, and defending their token, rather than driving innovation. ZachXBT grouped XRP holders with other communities he sees as structurally weak. He says that they share the same problems: strong promotion, defensive attitudes, and little to no useful progress. Due to his reputation as a respected blockchain investigator, his comments drew attention, despite being divisive. Because he has exposed crypto scams and shady financial transactions , ZachXBT has gained influence over time, and his words now carry more weight. On-Chain Detective Rejects MLM Chains And Community Shilling ZachXBT also explained that his criticism goes beyond XRP alone. He said, “I discriminate against MLM chains,” comparing many projects in the market to pyramid schemes. In his view, these chains operate with little real utility but rely on hype, recruiting new buyers, and constant shilling by communities to keep the system alive. He described a pattern of insider enrichment, where early insiders and influencers cash out with profits while late retail buyers are left holding losses. This setup, he argued, also suits the XRP community, as it is more about aggressive promotion than genuine innovation. ZachXBT also discussed the behavior of these communities. He described their behavior as cult-like, with members becoming very defensive and spending more energy on pushing “numbers go up” rather than creating long-term value. In his opinion, this is one of the reasons why these projects do not advance the crypto industry. ZachXBT’s comments may prompt the crypto space to reassess XRP, its community support, and whether the token’s future lies in real utility or is simply an asset used by insiders for profit. A fresh wave of verbal shrapnel could happen within the XRP community, as some agree with him while others defend Ripple’s token.",XRP|ripple|Ripple investors|ripple news|Ripple price|XPRUSD|XRP community|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-30 01:00:35

This decline has sparked significant criticism on social media, particularly against the crypto exchange Binance, which some investors accuse of contributing to the current market slump. Binance Behind The Bitcoin Price Slump? Market analyst DeFitracer shared insights on social media site X (formerly Twitter), questioning why the market is experiencing a sell-off despite what he describes as an oversaturation of positive catalysts. These include record inflows into crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) anticipated for next month. Yet, he points out, “we’re still dumping—why?” Related Reading: LINK Price Climbs Following Chainlink’s Deal With US Commerce Department, Eyes $30 According to DeFitracer, the ongoing sell-offs appear to be orchestrated by Binance, which he claims is using a third party, market maker Wintermute, to execute its trades. This strategy, he argues, is designed to set a bearish trend that retail investors follow, ultimately benefiting Binance through profits from futures liquidations. In fact, 2024 saw $344 million liquidated in a single day on the exchange, and current market manipulations may yield similar results, he asserts. As of press time, the market’s leading cryptocurrency trades at $108,295, meaning a 12% retrace from all-time high (ATH) levels of $124,000 reached earlier in the month. Three-Phase Reaction To Crypto Sell-Off DeFitracer also highlighted significant activity surrounding Solana (SOL). The analyst indicates that beyond Bitcoin, Binance has also been offloading SOL, potentially driven by an alleged desire to curb competition with its own token, Binance Coin (BNB), which currently has a market cap of $117 billion compared to SOL’s $102 billion. The analyst also said in his analysis that this activity raises questions about where Binance is sourcing its Solana, as their proof-of-reserves only shows client funds, suggesting that customer assets might be at risk in these trading maneuvers. DeFitracer added that these movements echo the practices of collapsed exchanges like FTX, which similarly utilized client funds through its trading arm Alameda Research: This is a terrible look for the exchange. User funds should stay safe – not be used for market games. FTX pulled the same move with client funds through Alameda Research.

The chart shared by Brandt shows XRP against USDT on Binance , plotted with daily bars. The technical structure displayed highlights a descending formation with a support level marked at approximately $2.78. His analysis suggests that this level is crucial to monitor, as its loss could signal further downside pressure. I post what I see. I assume strong opinions — always weakly held. I am wrong as often as I am right. If you are offended by my charts, then that is your problem The chart of XRP is potentially very negative pic.twitter.com/r7PjhCSK1A — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) August 29, 2025 Market interpretation from other traders Brandt’s post generated additional interpretations from market participants. One X user, Dies Zero, remarked that the XRP chart is giving off a “clear warning.” According to his reading, the structure resembles a descending triangle, with the $2.78 region acting as the critical line in the sand. He noted that a breakdown below this level could open the way for a sharper decline. He added that while a bounce is possible, momentum is currently fading, and unless buyers enter the market decisively, the overall setup appears bearish. Dies Zero concluded by emphasizing the principle of trading the chart rather than relying on emotions. Another X user, ALTucard, responded to the analysis by pointing out the significance of Brandt’s reputation. He suggested that when an experienced market figure of Brandt’s stature issues a negative view on a chart, it is worth taking seriously. ALTucard also highlighted Brandt’s comment about holding strong but flexible opinions, calling it “the most pro advice you can get on this app.” He further remarked that Brandt’s bearish take is likely to cause disappointment among sections of the XRP community . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Technical structure and implications The chart presented by Brandt indicates XRP consolidating after a sharp advance earlier in the summer. The move from under $2.00 to above $3.80 in July has since given way to a downward-sloping pattern, with lower highs forming against a relatively flat support zone. The descending triangle structure, often interpreted as a bearish continuation pattern, becomes particularly significant if the lower boundary is breached. The key level identified at $2.7830 represents the immediate threshold traders are watching. Should price remain above this support, XRP could continue trading within the tightening range, with the potential for a breakout in either direction. However, a decisive close below that point would likely be interpreted as confirmation of weakness, with the possibility of extended downside. Brandt’s long-standing presence in the markets gives weight to his observations, though he remains transparent about the fallibility of any single forecast. His commentary underscores the importance of technical discipline and the willingness to change views as market structures evolve. Traders engaging with XRP will be watching closely how the price behaves around the $2.78 support zone in the coming sessions, as this area could determine whether consolidation continues or if a deeper correction unfolds.

Several asset managers, including Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, Fidelity, Grayscale, CoinShares, and Bitwise, have all submitted amended S-1 registration statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These new filings are not entirely new proposals. Instead, they illuminate prior submissions , demonstrating that issuers continuously dialogue with regulators. Industry observers consider a figure of that magnitude as evidence that something is happening behind the scenes, even if a green light hasn’t been given. The changes are not superficial. Certain filings provide granular details about staking strategies, fee regimes, and redemption mechanisms. For example, the digital asset investment firm Grayscale announced plans to levy a 2.5% fee that would be paid in Solana tokens. Others have specified how in-kind redemptions might work, as one could convert ETF shares into Solana rather than cash. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart recently observed that the flood of filings demonstrates that the SEC is working with several firms concurrently. The increasing number of submissions proves Solana’s ascent into a serious institutional-grade product. It is now viewed as no longer a purely retailer-driven token but one that large managers can’t wait to package for regulated markets. In addition to the historical audit trail, he says that Solana’s GDP data implementation proves that the network has begun to be seen as legitimate beyond finance products. Marinade takes sole staking role as custody and transparency improve One of the most significant updates in Canary Capital’s revised filing is the designation of Marinade Select as the exclusive staking provider for its proposed Solana ETF, marking the first time a U.S. ETF has outlined a clear, institutional-grade staking framework. According to the filing, most of the ETF’s Solana holdings will be staked with Marinade for at least two years. Staking rewards will be auto-compounded after fees, aiding in bumping the fund’s net asset value. This introduces a yield factor to the ETF, and may make it more appealing to investors than pure passive crypto offerings. More specificity has also been outlined on custody arrangements. Assets will be divided between hot and cold wallets, with the custodian exclusively holding private keys. Investors themselves will not handle the tokens, but the filings warn that custody risks, like hacks or system failures, cannot be eliminated. In response to concerns about transparency, the ETF’s website will disclose daily information such as net asset value, full holdings, and whether the shares are trading at a premium or discount. The updated filings also include a discussion of the risks, updated to cover some recent accusations more thoroughly. They also now accommodate the ability that validators fail, the network goes offline, slashing might occur, or the trust may ignore certain forks and airdrops. Staking rules shape Solana ETF prospects While several players are tweaking their proposals and others are in the regulators’ review process, the Solana ETF race is heating up. There will likely be a vested Solana ETF, as most crypto ETFs are pure play, except Ethereum, where the SEC had more comfort, given the amount of physical ETH. The stakes are significant. Approval would signal that investors could get regulated exposure to Solana just as they now can with Bitcoin and Ethereum. These ETFs will pioneer new yield-generating strategies inside a regulated product if staking capabilities are allowed. The push indicates a broader trend for asset managers: cooperation with regulators, not confrontation. Issuers intend to conform to the SEC-led standards by revising and providing clarity. For investors, it signals the possibility that Solana, a risky, experimental blockchain not long ago, is on its way to becoming a mainstream financial asset. The result is still far from certain, but the latest filings suggest clear advances. The SEC’s response will not just impact Solana, but it could also determine the fate of crypto ETFs in the U.S. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Investors are shifting focus toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Early MUTM investors will get an ROI of a minimum of 300% post-listing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already reached over $15.1 million and has achieved 15800+ investors so far. This altcoin has begun drawing notable traction among early adopters and DeFi enthusiasts, sparking attention away from major players like XRP. XRP Forecast: Rally to $5 May Take Time Despite Positive Drivers XRP is trading at $2.99, currently held within a narrow consolidation range just below the $3 resistance level. Analysts acknowledge the token’s bullish potential, tied to waning legal uncertainty, expanding On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) adoption, and possible ETF traction, but caution that renewed pullbacks or lackluster volume could delay a breakout toward the $5 target. As XRP navigates its technical hurdles, investor attention is also shifting toward newer tokens like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in presale round six and is priced at $0.035 per token. Once the round is complete, the price rises 14.29% to $0.04 as demand surges and early adopters show faith in the project. The presale has gathered over 15,800 investors and over $15.1 million in capital, with signals of early traction and investor interest. A USD-Pegged Stablecoin on Ethereum Mutuum Finance will launch a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain as a stable, secure, and transparent form of value storage. The stablecoin will be a stable digital currency for daily transactions, decentralized applications, and long-term portfolio stability. Though algorithmic stablecoins have in the past been exposed to market volatility, this asset shall be created with the aim of eradicating speculation and not being limited by the burden of high volatility. Dual-Lending: Future-Proof DeFi Infrastructure Mutuum Finance involves a two-way lending approach in which automation is mixed with user-initiated intervention to provide a very efficient and interactive decentralized financial system. Peer-to-Contract lending is done using self-executing smart contracts, which facilitate lending and borrowing without the need for intervention on their part. Interest rates compound automatically in real time based on supply and demand within the market, and it is transparent and autonomous. Peer-to-Peer lending takes a step ahead and lets the lenders and borrowers negotiate with each other. Here, the intermediaries are skirted and the users are given more control to negotiate and agree on terms and transactions and grant access and convenience of a platform. Through this dual approach, Mutuum Finance is a safe and future-resistant infrastructure that functions to promote financial inclusion, achieve solid returns, and deliver opportunity to retail and institutional players in equal proportions. Its focus on security, transparency, and scalability serves as the basis for an expansion-led and sustainable DeFi market. Mutuum Finance Provides Stability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has announced the official Bug Bounty Program with a reward pool of $50,000 USDT. Four severities will be chosen by the project: critical, major, minor, and low. The project is also launching a $100,000 giveaway with the project community. 10 investors are in line to receive $10,000 Mutuum Finance tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in presale Stage 6 at $0.035, having raised $15.1M from 15,800+ investors. The price will rise to $0.04 next phase. As XRP consolidates, this project is gaining fast traction with its dual-lending model and stablecoin plans. Join the presale before the price moves up.

Each has carved out a different narrative, appealing to unique segments of the market. Together, they represent the breadth of opportunity heading into the next cycle, with analysts forecasting strong upside for those positioning early. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Best Crypto Presale Pick MAGACOIN FINANCE has officially broken into the top presale lists for August 2025, joining AVAX and PEPE as one of the best cryptos to buy this year. Analysts highlight that forecasts of up to 40x returns are already fueling demand, with presale slots disappearing faster than expected. The project’s inclusion alongside major names underscores its legitimacy credentials that have been bolstered by its audited smart contracts , which separate it from typical meme-driven launches. These factors have helped MAGACOIN FINANCE move beyond speculation, positioning it as a serious presale contender heading into the next bull cycle. Momentum is building rapidly as investors rush to secure allocations before listings go live. Analysts warn that waiting too long could mean missing the narrow entry window, as enthusiasm around MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to grow . AVAX — Enterprise Adoption and Partnerships Avalanche (AVAX) continues to dominate discussions thanks to its ongoing enterprise adoption push. Trading around $39, AVAX has held firm despite wider market turbulence, with analysts eyeing a breakout if it can reclaim resistance at $41. The blockchain’s subnet architecture remains its standout feature, enabling custom chains tailored for specific industries. Recent high-profile partnerships with traditional finance and technology companies have further bolstered confidence. With decentralized applications gaining traction across DeFi and gaming, AVAX is being positioned as a hybrid player—appealing to both institutions and retail investors. Forecasts suggest price targets between $60 and $70 into Q4 2025 if momentum continues. PEPE — Meme Energy Meets Market Cycles PEPE remains a fascinating case study in meme-driven value. Despite intense volatility, the coin has kept a strong foothold among retail communities that prize viral branding and cultural stickiness. Analysts argue that meme tokens like PEPE thrive in bullish upswings, and if market sentiment improves, PEPE could deliver another round of oversized returns. For now, trading action has been choppy, but its engaged user base ensures liquidity and visibility. Many market watchers believe PEPE has the potential to remain a breakout contender in the meme coin space, particularly as newer investors continue to chase high-risk, high-reward narratives. Final Outlook — Three Paths to Growth Taken together, AVAX, PEPE, and MAGACOIN FINANCE represent three very different approaches to capturing investor capital in 2025. AVAX focuses on scalability and partnerships, PEPE thrives on retail engagement, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is defining itself as a legitimate, audited, and community-driven presale with some of the highest ROI projections of the year. For investors weighing where to allocate capital, the choice may depend on risk appetite. Those seeking steady institutional-grade growth may lean toward AVAX, meme enthusiasts may continue to bet on PEPE, while opportunistic buyers looking for high-upside presale plays are increasingly turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE.

This anonymous investor recently deposited a staggering $11.68 million in USDC onto the Hyperliquid platform, with the clear intention of acquiring Solana (SOL). Such large-scale transactions often signal notable shifts or strong convictions within the market, making this particular move by the Solana whale highly newsworthy and impactful for the Solana ecosystem. What Just Happened: A Solana Whale’s Bold Move? Over the past eight hours, an unidentified but undeniably powerful market participant, often referred to as a “whale” due to their immense capital, channeled 11.68 million USDC into Hyperliquid. Onchainlens first reported this significant deposit. This wasn’t just a deposit; it was a strategic allocation aimed directly at accumulating Solana’s native token, SOL. So far, this prominent Solana whale has successfully purchased 28,390 SOL. Interestingly, their buying spree isn’t over. Reports indicate that the investor still has substantial outstanding buy orders, suggesting a continued bullish outlook on SOL. This sustained buying pressure from a single entity can certainly influence market sentiment and price action, creating a ripple effect across the entire crypto space. Why Hyperliquid? Understanding the Solana Whale’s Platform Choice The choice of Hyperliquid for such a massive transaction is also noteworthy. Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual exchange known for its high liquidity and low latency. Whales often opt for platforms that can handle large orders without significant slippage, ensuring their trades execute efficiently and at favorable prices. This decision by the Solana whale underscores the platform’s growing prominence among serious traders and institutional players. Deep Liquidity: This is essential for executing large buy orders without moving the market against the buyer, preserving value. Decentralized Nature: Offers a level of privacy and control that centralized exchanges might not always provide, appealing to large entities. Efficiency: Fast execution speeds are crucial when dealing with millions of dollars, minimizing exposure to market volatility. Understanding why this particular Solana whale chose Hyperliquid gives us insight into their operational strategy and priorities, highlighting the features they value most in a trading environment. The Impact of a Solana Whale on Market Dynamics When a large investor, or a “whale,” makes such a significant move, it rarely goes unnoticed. Their actions can have a ripple effect across the entire market, influencing both sentiment and price. For Solana, this deposit could be interpreted in several ways: Increased Confidence: A major investor putting millions into SOL can bolster confidence among smaller holders and potential buyers, validating the asset. Potential Price Catalyst: Sustained buying pressure, especially from a single large entity, can contribute to upward price momentum for SOL. Liquidity Shift: Moving such a large sum of USDC into a trading pair effectively increases the liquidity available for SOL purchases on that platform, facilitating further trading. However, it is important to remember that while a Solana whale ‘s actions are influential, they are not always indicative of future market performance. The crypto market remains volatile, and careful analysis is always recommended before making investment decisions. What Does This Solana Whale Activity Mean for SOL? This substantial investment by the anonymous Solana whale suggests a strong belief in Solana’s long-term potential or a strategic short-term play. It highlights the continued institutional and large-scale investor interest in the Solana ecosystem. As the whale continues to execute their outstanding buy orders, we could see further price action for SOL. For everyday investors, observing these large movements can provide valuable context. It prompts questions about Solana’s fundamentals, its ecosystem growth, and its competitive position in the broader crypto landscape. Ultimately, this move adds another layer of intrigue to the dynamic world of cryptocurrency investments, showcasing the power of significant capital. In conclusion, the recent $11.7 million USDC deposit by an anonymous Solana whale on Hyperliquid to acquire SOL is a powerful signal. It demonstrates significant capital flowing into the Solana ecosystem and highlights the strategic decisions made by major market players. As this investor continues their buying, the crypto community will be watching closely for the ensuing market reactions. This event underscores the vibrant and often unpredictable nature of the digital asset space, offering a glimpse into the forces shaping its future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

On-Chain Data Points to Explosive Cycle Peak,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-next-stop-183k-on-chain-data-points-to-explosive-cycle-peak/,"Bitcoin remains under pressure after sliding from its all-time high above $124,000 earlier this month. At the time of writing, the asset trades at $110,219, reflecting a weekly decline of about 2% and a broader drop of more than 10% from its peak. Despite the correction, analysts continue to examine on-chain data for signs of the market’s next direction. Among the latest insights, CryptoQuant contributor CryptoOnchain highlighted the significance of the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Price Bands, a long-observed metric used to assess market cycles. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s current positioning above key support bands suggests the uptrend remains intact, but with room for both continued growth and potential volatility. Related Reading: JPMorgan Says Bitcoin Is ‘Undervalued’—But By How Much? MVRV Price Bands Point to Potential Cycle Top The MVRV Price Bands model has historically been used to identify both bottoms and tops in Bitcoin’s long-term cycles. CryptoOnchain noted that the model’s lower band, often referred to as the “floor price,” reliably marked market lows in 2018 and 2022, while the upper band highlighted cycle peaks such as 2017 and 2021. Currently, Bitcoin’s trading price is positioned well above the model’s floor price of around $52,300 and its median support level of approximately $91,600. This indicates what the analyst referred to as a “healthy uptrend” with persistent activity from long-term holders. Importantly, the model’s projected ceiling price suggests that Bitcoin could reach as high as $183,000 by August 2025, assuming historical trends remain consistent. The analyst emphasized that while the ceiling level offers a potential target, traders should monitor the mid-price band for signs of weakening momentum. A decisive move below this level could indicate a shift in trend, raising the possibility of deeper corrections even within a bullish cycle. Bitcoin Cost Basis Trends Reflect Market Behavior A separate analysis by CryptoQuant contributor BorisD provided additional context by examining the cost basis of Bitcoin investors on Binance. Data shows that the average deposit address cost basis on Binance has risen from $44,000 earlier this year to $62,000. This suggests that investors are actively accumulating at higher price zones, particularly around Bitcoin’s recent peaks. New whale investors, defined as large-scale buyers with significant holdings, currently hold an average cost basis of $108,000, which is emerging as a key support level. According to BorisD, this level could serve as the foundation for the next leg of upward momentum if demand persists. At the same time, miner-linked wallets showed a slight reduction in their average cost basis from $58,000 to $54,000, hinting at modest selling pressure from mining operations. Related Reading: Bitcoin And The September Curse: Can This Time Be Different? Long-term holders, meanwhile, remain well positioned, with a cost basis near $40,000. This region has historically been considered a strong accumulation zone, providing resilience during broader market corrections. BorisD pointed out that cost basis levels often track closely with price behavior and can act as both support and resistance during volatile swings.

Just months after a staggering $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI , a key partner in its ambitious Meta AI endeavors, cracks are already beginning to show. For those following the volatile cryptocurrency markets, the rapid shifts in the tech landscape offer a parallel narrative of high stakes and uncertain outcomes. Meta AI’s Billion-Dollar Bet: What Went Wrong? Meta’s significant investment in Scale AI, bringing on CEO Alexandr Wang and several top executives to run Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), was touted as a pivotal move to bolster its Meta AI capabilities. This strategic alliance was designed to accelerate Meta’s journey toward AI superintelligence. However, the initial promise seems to be fading. One notable departure is Ruben Mayer, former Senior Vice President of GenAI Product and Operations at Scale AI, who left Meta after just two months. Mayer, who oversaw AI data operations teams and reported directly to Wang, was not integrated into TBD Labs, the core unit responsible for building AI superintelligence. This raises immediate questions about the strategic alignment and the effectiveness of such a massive capital injection. The Fraying Threads of the Scale AI Partnership The relationship between Meta and Scale AI appears more complex than initially perceived. Beyond executive departures, there are significant concerns regarding data quality that threaten to unravel the Scale AI partnership . Sources indicate that researchers within Meta’s elite TBD Labs view Scale AI’s data as subpar. This perception is particularly striking given Meta’s multi-billion-dollar investment. Historically, Scale AI built its business on a crowdsourcing model that utilized a large, low-cost workforce for simple data annotation tasks. While effective for earlier AI models, modern, sophisticated AI now demands high-quality, expert-annotated data from specialists such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists. Competitors like Surge AI and Mercor, built on a foundation of highly paid, specialized talent from the outset, have been rapidly gaining ground, challenging Scale AI’s market position. Indeed, Meta, it turns out, is not putting all its eggs in one basket, actively working with these very competitors for its data needs. Why Quality Matters: The Role of AI Data Vendors The reliance on multiple AI data vendors highlights a critical challenge in the development of advanced AI: the paramount importance of data quality. While Meta has been working with Mercor and Surge AI even before TBD Labs was established, the continued and deepening reliance on these alternatives, post-investment in Scale AI, underscores a fundamental issue. High-quality data is the lifeblood of sophisticated AI models. If the foundational data is flawed or insufficient, even the most advanced algorithms will struggle to perform optimally. This situation puts Scale AI in a precarious position, especially after losing major clients like OpenAI and Google shortly after Meta’s investment, which led to 200 layoffs in its data labeling business. The market is clearly shifting towards vendors who can consistently deliver superior, expert-driven data, proving that even a massive investment cannot override the demand for quality. The Intense Battle for AI Talent Wars The internal dynamics at Meta’s AI unit have become increasingly chaotic, mirroring the broader AI talent wars gripping the tech industry. Bringing in top researchers from OpenAI and Scale AI, including Alexandr Wang, was intended to accelerate Meta’s AI ambitions. However, new talent has reportedly expressed frustration with navigating Meta’s corporate bureaucracy. Simultaneously, Meta’s existing GenAI team has seen its scope diminished, leading to a wave of departures. High-profile researchers like Rishabh Agarwal, Director of product management for generative AI Chaya Nayak, and research engineer Rohan Varma have announced their exits. Agarwal’s statement, citing Mark Zuckerberg’s own advice about taking risks, speaks volumes about the internal unrest and the allure of more agile environments. The ability to attract and, more importantly, retain top-tier AI talent is proving to be a formidable challenge for Meta, as researchers seek environments where they can make the greatest impact. Navigating Zuckerberg AI Strategy Amidst Internal Turmoil Mark Zuckerberg’s aggressive push into AI, following the lackluster launch of Llama 4, aimed to quickly catch up with industry leaders like OpenAI and Google. This involved striking major deals, recruiting top talent from rivals, and acquiring AI startups such as Play AI and WaveForms AI. The appointment of Alexandr Wang, not a traditional AI researcher by background, to lead MSL was an unconventional but calculated move, potentially aimed at leveraging Wang’s founder experience and network to attract more talent. However, the current turmoil suggests that even a massive investment and strategic hires might not be enough to smoothly execute the ambitious Zuckerberg AI strategy . The company is investing billions in data center buildouts, like the $50 billion Hyperion in Louisiana, to power these ambitions, yet internal friction and talent retention issues persist. The question remains: can Meta stabilize its AI operations and effectively harness this talent to launch its next-generation AI model by year-end? The journey to AI superintelligence is proving to be a treacherous one for the tech giant. The narrative surrounding Meta’s investment in Scale AI is one of ambitious vision meeting complex realities. What began as a strategic alliance, intended to solidify Meta’s position in the AI race, is now experiencing significant strain. From executive departures and data quality disputes to intense internal talent churn and the broader challenges of integrating diverse corporate cultures, the path to AI supremacy is fraught with obstacles. The ability of Meta to overcome these hurdles, refine its partnerships, and foster a cohesive, innovative environment will be critical in determining its future success in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. The unraveling of this key partnership highlights the intricate dance of technology, talent, and strategic execution in the pursuit of artificial superintelligence.

50890668,569587,1756519246,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50890668.jpeg,Bitcoin To Hit $1 Million? Eric Trump Shares Optimistic Outlook On Cryptocurrency,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-to-hit-1-million-eric-trump-shares/,"At the Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong, Eric Trump, the son of President Donald Trump, predicted that the market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) could soar to $1 million within the next few years, which could represent a major 825% increase from current levels. Eric Trump Bullish On Bitcoin As reported by Reuters earlier on Friday, during a panel discussion, Eric Trump emphasized China’s significant influence in the cryptocurrency sector, referring to the country as “a hell of a power” in driving crypto innovation. Nevertheless, China still seems far from the US’s role in adopting cryptocurrencies, as the Asian country continues to face significant restrictions on operating digital assets. Despite these restrictions by regulators since 2021, Mainland China is reportedly exploring yuan-backed stablecoins to enhance its global usage. Meanwhile, Hong Kong has taken steps to establish itself as a digital asset hub, passing a stablecoin bill in May. On the other hand, under President Trump’s leadership, the United States has proposed establishing a Bitcoin reserve and passing three key crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act, which could accelerate the use of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies in everyday transactions. This has significantly contributed to the broader market’s price surge with Bitcoin reaching a new record of $124,000 on August 14, and Ethereum (ETH) also reaching an all-time high (ATH) just below the $5,000 mark last weekend. Despite the cryptocurrency’s recent dip toward $108,000, Eric Trump confidently stated, “There’s no question Bitcoin hits $1 million,” citing strong institutional demand and the cryptocurrency’s limited supply as key factors supporting his optimism. Crypto Talks Between Trump And Xi Jinping? When asked if President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping might soon discuss cryptocurrencies, Eric Trump suggested that both nations likely possess a deeper understanding of digital currencies than most other countries. He highlighted the support the Bitcoin community has shown for his father, expressing hope that such backing would yield significant returns for both the community and the Trump family. In recent months, the Trump family has ventured into various cryptocurrency initiatives, including the launch of a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, a stablecoin, a Bitcoin mining operation, and the applications of crypto-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Notably, American Bitcoin, a new crypto miner founded in collaboration with Hut 8 and backed by Eric Trump and his brother, Donald Trump Jr., is preparing for a Nasdaq listing next month. Reuters also reported that during the same conference, crypto exchange Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) remarked that the US is setting a precedent for progressive regulations that could prompt other governments to take similar actions.

In a development that has captured widespread attention, a substantial amount of Ethereum (ETH) found its way to Coinbase Prime, sparking immediate discussions about market sentiment and potential future price action. This event highlights the influential power of large capital movements in the volatile cryptocurrency landscape. Who is This Key ETH/BTC Investor Making Waves? Reports from AmberCN indicate that James Fickel, a well-known ETH/BTC investor , recently deposited a staggering 39,800 ETH to Coinbase Prime. This massive deposit, valued at approximately $172 million, occurred just hours ago, drawing immediate scrutiny from market watchers. Such large movements by individual investors, often referred to as ‘whales,’ frequently signal potential shifts in market dynamics and deserve close attention. Understanding Fickel’s history provides crucial context to his latest actions. Last year, this same ETH/BTC investor faced a considerable setback, incurring a loss of around 20,600 ETH, valued at approximately $90 million at the time, from an ETH/BTC long position. This previous experience adds an intriguing layer to his current strategy, prompting widespread speculation about his intentions and what he plans next. Why Coinbase Prime? Unpacking the Institutional Choice for an ETH/BTC Investor When an ETH/BTC investor of Fickel’s caliber moves such a substantial amount of cryptocurrency, the choice of platform is often deliberate. Coinbase Prime is not just any exchange; it is a premium platform specifically designed for institutional clients, offering a suite of advanced services: Enhanced Security: Institutional-grade custody solutions provide a higher level of security for large asset holdings, crucial for substantial investments. OTC Trading: For transactions of this magnitude, an over-the-counter (OTC) desk is often preferred. OTC trades allow large blocks of assets to be bought or sold without directly impacting the public order books, thus minimizing market disruption and potential slippage. Advanced Tools: Access to sophisticated trading tools, analytics, and dedicated support caters to the complex needs of major investors and active ETH/BTC investors . This choice suggests a highly calculated move, likely aimed at executing a strategy with precision and discretion, rather than a simple retail transaction. What Does a Massive ETH Deposit Mean for the Market and Other ETH/BTC Investors? When an ETH/BTC investor like James Fickel makes such a significant deposit, several possibilities emerge, each with different implications for the broader market: Potential Selling Pressure: One immediate interpretation is that the investor might be preparing to sell a portion or all of their ETH holdings. Moving funds to an exchange often precedes a sale, especially if the investor aims to offload a large volume without significantly impacting spot market prices, potentially through OTC channels. This could lead to increased supply and downward price pressure. Strategic Rebalancing: Alternatively, the deposit could be part of a broader portfolio rebalancing strategy. Given his history, the ETH/BTC investor might be adjusting his exposure to different assets, perhaps reducing ETH to increase BTC holdings, or positioning for a new ETH/BTC trade. Preparing for New Opportunities: It’s also possible that the funds are being positioned for new investment opportunities, staking, or derivatives trading on the platform. Institutional platforms offer a range of sophisticated financial products that require on-exchange liquidity. Lessons for Aspiring ETH/BTC Investors: Navigating Whale Moves This situation offers valuable insights for both seasoned and aspiring ETH/BTC investors : Risk Management is Crucial: Fickel’s previous $90 million loss underscores the inherent risks in highly leveraged positions and the extreme volatility of crypto markets. Always prioritize robust risk management strategies. Interpret On-Chain Data: Learning to interpret large deposits, withdrawals, and other on-chain data can offer an edge in understanding potential market directions. Tools exist to track such whale movements, providing valuable context for an ETH/BTC investor . Avoid FOMO/FUD: While whale movements are important, it’s vital to conduct your own research and not solely base decisions on the actions of others. Market sentiment can shift rapidly, and independent analysis is key. Ultimately, the latest move by this prominent ETH/BTC investor could be a calculated maneuver after previous losses, a simple liquidity management decision, or a precursor to a major market play. The crypto world watches keenly to see how this substantial deposit will unfold and what its true implications are for the broader market. In conclusion, James Fickel’s $172 million ETH deposit to Coinbase Prime is a significant event that highlights the ongoing activities of major players in the crypto space. Whether it signals an impending sale, a strategic rebalance, or preparation for new ventures, such large movements underscore the dynamic nature of the market and the importance of staying informed. For any ETH/BTC investor , understanding these high-stakes actions can provide valuable perspective on potential market shifts.

This veteran market participant strategically offloaded a significant portion of their Bitcoin holdings to acquire a substantial amount of Ethereum, signaling a potentially pivotal shift in their portfolio strategy and perhaps the broader market sentiment. Unpacking the Strategic Ethereum Investment According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, this experienced investor sold approximately 2,000 BTC, valued at an impressive $221 million. Immediately following this sale, they proceeded to purchase 49,850 ETH, which was worth roughly $219 million, all within a rapid 12-hour window.

Such a large-scale Ethereum investment from an established figure often sparks considerable discussion and analysis within the crypto community. Why This Bitcoin OG Made Such a Significant Shift? The decision by an early Bitcoin adopter to rebalance their portfolio so heavily towards Ethereum raises intriguing questions. While the exact motivations remain private, several factors could influence such a strategic pivot: Ethereum’s Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum continues to be the backbone for a vast array of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFTs. Staking Rewards: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (the Merge), investors can earn passive income through staking their ETH. Scalability Solutions: Ongoing developments, including Layer 2 solutions, are addressing Ethereum’s scalability challenges, promising a more efficient network. Diversification Strategy: Even OGs recognize the importance of diversifying assets, especially as different cryptocurrencies mature and offer unique value propositions. This substantial Ethereum investment could indicate a strong belief in the network’s long-term growth trajectory and its foundational role in the decentralized web. Understanding the Market Implications of Large-Scale Ethereum Investment When an investor of this caliber makes such a significant move, it often carries weight, potentially influencing other market participants. It suggests a perceived undervalued state of Ethereum or a strong conviction in its future performance relative to Bitcoin.

A groundbreaking collaboration, the OKX Wallet campaign , has captured the attention of over 2.3 million unique addresses, marking a significant milestone in decentralized finance (DeFi) engagement. This massive turnout highlights a growing appetite for innovative reward programs and accessible blockchain experiences. What Makes the OKX Wallet Campaign a Game-Changer? This remarkable achievement stems from a joint effort between Momentum, a Sui-based ve(3,3) decentralized exchange (DEX), and OKX Wallet. Their combined campaign, hosted on OKX Wallet’s popular Cryptopedia platform, was designed as a Pre-Token Generation Event (TGE) rewards program. This strategy allowed participants to engage with the Momentum DEX and earn rewards before its official token launch, creating substantial early interest. Massive Participation: Over 2.3 million participating addresses joined the OKX Wallet campaign . Significant Trading Volume: The initiative generated an impressive $1.3 billion in trading volume. Strategic Collaboration: Momentum’s innovative ve(3,3) DEX model on Sui combined with OKX Wallet’s broad reach and Cryptopedia platform. These figures are not just numbers; they represent a powerful validation of the strategy behind the OKX Wallet campaign . They demonstrate that well-structured reward programs, especially those integrated into user-friendly platforms like Cryptopedia, can attract a vast audience and drive real economic activity within the crypto space. Driving DeFi Adoption: The Impact of the OKX Wallet Campaign The success of this campaign extends beyond its immediate numbers. It serves as a compelling case study for how to effectively onboard new users into the often-complex world of DeFi. By offering tangible rewards for early engagement, the OKX Wallet campaign lowered the barrier to entry for many, encouraging exploration of the Sui ecosystem and decentralized exchanges. Pre-TGE reward programs are becoming increasingly popular because they create a win-win scenario. Users gain early access to potential future value and learn about new protocols, while projects like Momentum build a strong, engaged community from the ground up. This approach fosters loyalty and provides crucial liquidity and testing for new platforms before their full public launch. Moreover, the ease of use provided by OKX Wallet’s Cryptopedia platform played a pivotal role, simplifying the process for millions. How Did the OKX Wallet Campaign Achieve Such Momentum? Several factors contributed to the unprecedented success of this particular OKX Wallet campaign . First, the choice of platform was crucial; Cryptopedia offers a curated environment where users can discover and participate in promising new crypto projects. Second, the clear and attractive reward structure of the Pre-TGE program provided a strong incentive. Participants understood what they stood to gain, which fueled widespread adoption. Furthermore, Momentum’s ve(3,3) DEX model, known for its efficient liquidity provision and incentive mechanisms, likely resonated with DeFi enthusiasts. The combination of a novel protocol with a highly accessible platform proved to be a powerful magnet. This initiative showcases the power of strategic partnerships and user-centric design in the competitive crypto landscape. Looking Ahead: The Future After This Successful OKX Wallet Campaign What does this mean for the future of crypto campaigns and the broader DeFi ecosystem? The massive participation in the OKX Wallet campaign sets a new benchmark for engagement. It suggests that future projects will increasingly leverage accessible platforms and innovative reward structures to attract and retain users. For the Sui blockchain, this campaign highlights its growing prominence as a robust platform for decentralized applications. While the success is undeniable, challenges remain. Sustaining such high levels of engagement post-TGE and ensuring the long-term security and stability of new protocols are ongoing tasks. However, the blueprint established by this campaign offers valuable insights for developers and marketers alike, proving that with the right strategy, crypto can truly go mainstream.

This marked a crucial turning point, ending a five-day streak of consistent inflows and drawing keen attention from investors and analysts alike. This development signals a momentary pause in the bullish momentum previously observed, prompting a closer look into the underlying factors. What Triggered the Recent Spot Bitcoin ETFs Outflow? The substantial net outflow of $126.69 million on August 29th, as reported by TraderT, was a complex interplay of various fund movements. While some funds continued to attract capital, others saw significant withdrawals, leading to the overall negative balance. This collective action paints a picture of shifting investor sentiment. Here’s a breakdown of the key movements: BlackRock’s IBIT : Managed to attract a healthy inflow of $24.61 million. WisdomTree’s BTCW : Also saw positive interest, bringing in $2.3 million. However, these positive contributions were ultimately overshadowed by larger outflows from other prominent funds: Fidelity’s FBTC : Experienced a considerable outflow of $66.2 million. Ark Invest’s ARKB : Saw an even larger withdrawal of $72.1 million. Grayscale’s GBTC : Contributed to the net outflow with $15.3 million. These figures demonstrate that even within a single trading day, the performance of individual Spot Bitcoin ETFs can vary widely, influencing the broader market sentiment. Why Do Spot Bitcoin ETFs Matter for Investors? Understanding the role of Spot Bitcoin ETFs is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto market. A Spot Bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. This makes it an attractive option for traditional investors who might be wary of direct crypto ownership or the complexities of managing digital wallets. These ETFs are particularly significant because they bridge the gap between traditional finance and the nascent digital asset space. The introduction of these regulated investment vehicles has brought new capital and increased legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class. Consequently, the net flows into and out of these ETFs are often seen as a barometer for institutional and mainstream investor interest in Bitcoin. Navigating the Challenges and Opportunities with Spot Bitcoin ETFs While Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer significant opportunities for broader market participation, they also come with inherent challenges. The volatility of Bitcoin itself means that these ETFs can experience rapid price swings, leading to both substantial gains and losses. Investors must consider their risk tolerance carefully before engaging with these products. On the opportunity front, the regulated nature of these ETFs provides a level of security and oversight that might be absent in direct crypto investments. Furthermore, they offer diversification benefits for traditional portfolios. However, the recent outflow serves as a reminder that market sentiment can shift quickly, influenced by macro-economic factors, regulatory news, or even broader market corrections. What Could This Spot Bitcoin ETFs Outflow Signal? A single day of net outflow, while noteworthy, does not necessarily indicate a long-term bearish trend for Spot Bitcoin ETFs or Bitcoin itself. Instead, it could be a normal market correction, profit-taking by some investors after a period of gains, or a reallocation of capital across different asset classes. For example, the previous five days of inflows suggest a generally positive sentiment leading up to this point. It is essential for investors to look beyond daily fluctuations and consider the broader trends. Continuous monitoring of these flows, alongside other market indicators, provides a more comprehensive understanding of the market’s health. Long-term accumulation trends, institutional adoption rates, and macroeconomic stability often play a larger role in determining the sustained performance of Bitcoin and its related investment products. The recent $126.7 million net outflow from U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs on August 29th certainly caught the market’s attention, ending a period of consistent inflows. While funds like BlackRock’s IBIT continued to see interest, larger withdrawals from Fidelity and Ark Invest shifted the overall balance. This event highlights the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the evolving landscape of institutional investment. For investors, it underscores the importance of staying informed and understanding that market movements are often a blend of various factors, from individual fund performance to broader economic sentiment. Keeping an eye on these flows provides valuable insights into the pulse of Bitcoin adoption in traditional finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF? A Spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without needing to buy, store, or manage the actual cryptocurrency. 2. Why is a net outflow significant for Spot Bitcoin ETFs? A net outflow indicates that more money is being withdrawn from these funds than invested, which can signal a shift in investor sentiment, potential profit-taking, or a reallocation of capital away from Bitcoin-related assets. 3. Which funds experienced significant outflows on August 29th? On August 29th, Fidelity’s FBTC, Ark Invest’s ARKB, and Grayscale’s GBTC recorded the largest outflows, collectively contributing to the overall net negative figure. 4. Does a single day of outflow indicate a long-term trend? Not necessarily. A single day’s outflow could be a normal market correction, short-term profit-taking, or a reaction to specific news. Investors should analyze broader trends and multiple data points to determine long-term market direction. 5. How do Spot Bitcoin ETFs differ from directly owning Bitcoin? Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a regulated and often simpler way to invest in Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts, avoiding the complexities of crypto wallets and exchanges. However, direct ownership gives you full control over your assets and potential staking/lending opportunities not available through an ETF.

With MAGACOIN Finance still priced under $0.0005, traders are eyeing it as a strategic entry with upside that could rival or even outperform others on the list. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Top Altcoin to Buy Under $5 Among all these names, MAGACOIN Finance is catching attention as the altcoin that could outperform them all . Still priced under $0.0005, analysts describe it as a safe and strategic entry point for those looking beyond the established giants. What makes MAGACOIN stand out is its positioning as both meme coin and DeFi utility asset. It combines appeal with legitimacy, supported by audits and verified infrastructure. Analysts suggest it can realistically deliver a 15x move as adoption builds. For those looking for the best crypto to buy under $5, MAGACOIN Finance offers a unique blend of affordability and structured growth potential. Ripple (XRP) Gaining Fresh Traction After SEC Case Ripple’s XRP has regained a strong foothold in the market after its long-standing legal battle with the SEC reached a conclusion. In 2023, a court ruling clarified that XRP sales on public exchanges are not securities, and by August 2025, both Ripple and the SEC dropped further appeals. This resolution has cleared a path for institutional adoption and restored investor confidence. Currently trading at around $3, XRP maintains a market cap near $179 billion, placing it among the top three crypto assets. Daily volumes exceeding $6 billion underline its liquidity, making it more suitable for large-scale use. Ripple’s payment network, now rebranded as Ripple Payments, covers more than 90 markets worldwide and integrates with fiat, stablecoins, and XRP. XRP’s blockchain has also evolved technically, introducing automated market makers (AMMs) in 2024 to deepen liquidity pools. Adoption in cross-border payment corridors, such as Japan–Philippines and regions in Africa, aligns with the global remittance market—valued at over $685 billion. Analysts forecast XRP at $5.25 by 2030, though industry voices like Bitwise and Telgaon predict far higher valuations. The clarity and ongoing adoption keep XRP firmly in the spotlight as one of the best crypto buys under $5. Cardano (ADA) Holds Long-Term Appeal Cardano (ADA) trades under $1, currently priced at $0.86, but continues to rank among the top smart contract platforms. Its layered architecture and peer-reviewed development process give it a reputation for being built with long-term resilience. Price predictions for 2025 see ADA averaging $3.45, with some forecasting highs above $5. This outlook positions ADA as one of the top five crypto buys under $5. For traders who prefer a fundamentally driven project with steady upgrades, Cardano remains a consistent choice in the altcoin space. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Expands Its Ecosystem Shiba Inu (SHIB), once seen only as a meme coin, is now trading at $0.00001249 while actively growing its ecosystem. Its Layer-2 solution, Shibarium, increases transaction throughput, while ShibaSwap, NFTs, and the Shib Metaverse create more utility. Forecasts project SHIB reaching as high as $0.00006 in 2025, with some estimates suggesting 3x to 5x growth from current levels. Community sentiment and long-term holder activity continue to support its place among the best crypto buys under $5. Sui (SUI) Gains Attention in Layer-1 Race Sui (SUI) is gaining traction as a Layer-1 blockchain built for speed and throughput. Its design has drawn attention from both developers and institutions, placing it alongside ADA and XRP in lists of top altcoins to watch under $5. Although priced modestly, its high-performance architecture and adoption by builders give SUI a place in this top 5 category. Conclusion: How to Position in This Market Ripple, Cardano, SHIB, SUI, and MAGACOIN Finance all offer entry under $5, but MAGACOIN’s current low price gives it an edge for those looking at asymmetric opportunities. With market attention turning to altcoins, early positioning could prove rewarding.

After a promising streak of inflows, these innovative investment vehicles experienced a significant net outflow, catching the keen attention of market observers and investors alike. Understanding these movements is crucial for anyone navigating the evolving digital asset landscape. What Triggered the Recent Spot ETH ETFs Outflow? On August 29, U.S. Spot ETH ETFs collectively recorded a total net outflow of a substantial $164.6 million. This figure, according to data from TraderT, marks a notable shift, breaking a streak of seven consecutive trading days that saw net inflows. The sudden reversal has prompted many to examine the underlying market sentiment. The outflows were primarily driven by several key players in the market: Grayscale’s Mini ETH fund: Led the charge with $61.3 million in outflows. Fidelity’s FETH: Saw a significant $51 million exit. Grayscale’s ETHE: Contributed $28.6 million to the total outflow. Bitwise’s ETHW: Experienced $23.7 million in withdrawals. Crucially, no spot ETH ETFs registered any inflows for the entire day. This absence of new capital entering the market alongside substantial withdrawals highlights a distinct period of investor caution or profit-taking. Decoding the Market: What Are Spot ETH ETFs? For those new to the concept, Spot ETH ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Ethereum, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency. They aim to simplify access to the crypto market for traditional investors, providing a regulated and familiar investment vehicle. The significance of these funds cannot be overstated. Inflows typically signal growing institutional and retail investor confidence in Ethereum and the broader crypto market. Conversely, outflows, like the one observed, can suggest a decrease in demand, a shift in investor strategy, or a reaction to broader economic or regulatory concerns. Therefore, monitoring these flows offers valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends for Ethereum. Implications for Ethereum and Spot ETH ETFs Investors A single day’s net outflow, even a significant one, does not necessarily signal a long-term bearish trend for Ethereum or Spot ETH ETFs . However, it serves as a critical data point for investors to consider. It could reflect: Profit-taking: Investors might be cashing out after the recent period of inflows. Market uncertainty: Broader economic concerns or upcoming regulatory decisions could lead to caution. Rebalancing portfolios: Institutional investors often adjust their holdings. For investors, understanding these dynamics is key. While short-term fluctuations are common, paying attention to sustained trends in Spot ETH ETFs flows can offer a clearer picture of market health. It emphasizes the importance of a long-term perspective when investing in volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Navigating Future Trends in Spot ETH ETFs What should investors watch for next? The landscape of Spot ETH ETFs remains dynamic. Future trends will likely be shaped by several factors: Regulatory developments: Further clarity from regulators could either bolster or dampen investor enthusiasm. Broader crypto market performance: Ethereum’s price often moves in correlation with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. Institutional adoption: Continued interest from large financial institutions will be crucial for sustained growth. The recent outflow is a reminder that the path to mainstream adoption for crypto investment products is not always linear. However, the very existence and trading activity of these ETFs highlight a growing acceptance and demand for regulated crypto exposure. Summary: The recent $164.6 million net outflow from U.S. Spot ETH ETFs on August 29 marked a notable shift after a period of consistent inflows. Led by major funds like Grayscale and Fidelity, this event saw zero new capital entering the market. While a single day’s data point, it underscores the dynamic nature of crypto investments and the need for investors to stay informed about market sentiment and broader trends. The journey of these innovative financial products continues to unfold, offering both opportunities and challenges for those looking to engage with Ethereum through regulated channels.

It details a massive USDT transfer of 200,000,000 tokens, a transaction valued at approximately $200 million. This significant sum moved from an unknown wallet directly to Galaxy Digital, a prominent player in the digital asset space. Such large-scale movements often signal important shifts and strategic plays within the market, prompting keen observers to analyze their potential implications. Unpacking the Massive USDT Transfer to Galaxy Digital Whale Alert, a widely recognized blockchain tracking service, was the first to report this substantial transaction. The movement involved 200 million Tether (USDT) tokens, which are stablecoins pegged to the US dollar. This isn’t just a routine transfer; it represents a considerable chunk of capital in the volatile cryptocurrency market. The recipient, Galaxy Digital, is a well-established financial services and investment management firm dedicated to digital assets. Their involvement immediately raises questions about the underlying purpose of such a large influx of stablecoins. This massive USDT transfer could indicate various strategic moves, from enhancing liquidity to preparing for new investments. Who Initiated This Mysterious USDT Transfer? One of the most intriguing aspects of this event is the sender: an “unknown wallet.” This designation typically refers to a cryptocurrency address that isn’t publicly linked to a known individual, institution, or exchange. While the identity remains a mystery, the sheer volume strongly suggests the involvement of a “whale.” A crypto whale is an individual or entity holding a significant amount of cryptocurrency, capable of influencing market dynamics with their trades. Understanding the motivations behind such a large USDT transfer from an anonymous source is often a key piece of the puzzle for market analysts and investors alike. What Does This Mean for Galaxy Digital and the Market? Galaxy Digital’s receipt of 200 million USDT could serve several strategic purposes. This substantial inflow could significantly enhance their operational capacity and market influence. Consider these potential uses: Boosting Liquidity: The funds could increase Galaxy Digital’s capacity to facilitate large trades or provide capital for their various ventures. Strategic Investments: They might be preparing to deploy this capital into other digital assets, promising blockchain projects, or emerging crypto technologies. Client Onboarding: The transfer could be related to managing funds for institutional clients who are increasingly entering the cryptocurrency market. Operational Expansion: It might also fund internal operations, support new product development, or expand their global services. This kind of capital injection positions Galaxy Digital to make significant moves in the market. Navigating the Broader Market Implications of Large USDT Transfers Large stablecoin movements, especially a massive USDT transfer of this magnitude, are always closely monitored by the crypto community. They can often be precursors to significant market activity or indicate shifts in sentiment. If Galaxy Digital intends to use this USDT to acquire other cryptocurrencies, it could potentially create upward price pressure on those assets. Conversely, if the stablecoins are being held for future off-ramping, it might signal a different, more cautious market sentiment. However, it’s also important to remember that USDT transfers are common for activities like arbitrage, market making, and general liquidity management, which don’t always indicate a specific directional market move. The 200,000,000 USDT transfer to Galaxy Digital stands as a compelling event in the crypto landscape. While the “unknown wallet” adds a layer of mystery, the destination provides a clear signal of ongoing institutional activity and strategic maneuvering. This movement underscores the growing sophistication and sheer scale of digital asset transactions, urging market participants to remain vigilant and informed about these significant shifts. Frequently Asked Questions About the Massive USDT Transfer What is USDT? USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin whose value is pegged to the US dollar. This means 1 USDT is intended to always be worth $1, making it a popular choice for traders to move funds quickly without the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. What is Galaxy Digital? Galaxy Digital is a diversified financial services and investment management company specializing in the digital asset, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology sectors. It provides services like asset management, trading, and investment banking. Why is a 200,000,000 USDT transfer significant? A transfer of this size, approximately $200 million, is considered a “whale” movement. It signifies a large amount of capital being repositioned, which can have various implications for market liquidity, sentiment, and potential future investments. Does an “unknown wallet” mean the transaction is suspicious? Not necessarily. “Unknown wallet” simply means the address is not publicly identified with a specific person or entity. While it adds anonymity, many legitimate large holders and institutions use unlinked wallets for privacy or operational reasons. How can I track large crypto transfers like this? Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking significant cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. Many blockchain explorers also allow users to monitor specific wallet addresses or transaction hashes. Found this analysis insightful?

The drop triggered $137 million in liquidations of leveraged long positions, catching traders off guard. The decline followed weakness in the Nasdaq 100, which fell 1.2% amid doubts over the long-term strength of the artificial intelligence sector. Trade Deficit Adds to Investor Concerns Market sentiment worsened after the U.S. reported a 22% jump in its July trade deficit. The gap between imports and exports widened to $103.6 billion, exceeding forecasts. Economists warned this could drag on economic growth in the third quarter, adding to uncertainty. Insider Sales Signal Caution Investor unease deepened after data revealed an unusual trend in insider trading activity. X user Malone_Wealth noted that the top 200 trades by executives and large shareholders last week were all sales. Major moves included Walmart’s Jim C. Walton with $961 million, Snowflake’s Frank Slootman at $164 million, and Amer Sports’ Dennis J. Wilson with $160 million. Other significant sales included Dutch Bros’ Travis Boersma at $81.5 million and Klaviyo’s Andrew Bialecki at $73.7 million. Chinese Banking Stress Adds Pressure China added another layer of concern. Its five largest banks reported record-low margins and rising delinquencies, with retail banks writing off $5.2 billion in bad loans in the first quarter—an eightfold jump year-on-year. The figures highlighted mounting risks in the Chinese financial system. AI Sector Weakness Intensifies Meanwhile, the artificial intelligence sector is showing signs of strain. Nvidia revealed that nearly half of its data center revenue comes from just two customers, raising questions about reliance. Despite delivering solid quarterly results, Nvidia shares fell 4.7% over two sessions. Super Micro Computer, a major Nvidia partner, added to concerns by warning of potential issues in its financial reporting. Its shares dropped more than 5% as a result. Bonds Reflect Risk Aversion In the bond market, investors sought safety in U.S. Treasurys. The two-year yield fell to 3.62%, its lowest level in four months and down from 3.80% the week before. This decline suggests growing risk aversion, as investors preferred lower yields in exchange for security. Outlook for Bitcoin Alongside these global risks, Bitcoin faces its own pressures. Long-dormant whales have been selling, while miners continue steady outflows. Despite these factors, analysts suggest the broader macroeconomic picture remains the primary driver of Bitcoin’s latest decline. With traders cautious ahead of the U.S. national holiday, volatility could remain elevated in the coming sessions.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-08-30 02:59:28

Solana whales are shifting to MAGACOIN FINANCE at a time when SOL is stuck in a tight range. Since Solana has continued to be rejected at greater heights, investors with large quantities of it are diversifying some of their profits with this rapidly selling presale. The timing makes sense. MAGACOIN FINANCE is already past significant price milestones of its presale and is entering the final allocation stage. The supply is drying up and demand accumulating in Telegram chats, trading desks, and the wallets of whales. It is an opportunity to get a ride on the upside to those who do as the tokens are listed on the exchanges. Solana Whales turn to MAGACOIN FINANCE Solana whales have started accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE, scooping coins in the early stages and sparking waves of FOMO across the market. MAGA’s appeal is straightforward. The project has a clear roadmap, frequent and transparent updates, and an audit by a leading blockchain security company. That foundation is giving whales confidence to enter early while the presale window is still open. On top of that, new buyers are grabbing a 50% EXTRA BONUS using the code PATRIOT50X, something that makes this final phase even more attractive. With fewer tokens left and thousands already onboarded, MAGA is shaping up as one of the most hyped presales of 2025. And this combination of scarcity, trust, and community buzz makes it hard to ignore by whales seeking short-term upsides. Solana price faces rejection but builds pressure Solana is near $189 after being rejected on several occasions at $205-$207. Such resistance has been hard to shake off and that has caused prices to stall over several weeks. The key support is at the range of $176-$180. It is in this zone that there has been the gathering of liquidity, and where buyers have been active in stepping and maintaining the trend. The daily chart also shows an ascending triangle pattern forming. That configuration tends to indicate that price is building up pressure to blow up. If Solana price manages to close above $207, analysts believe that it will rally to $300. Traders will be waiting until either a revisit of the support at $176 or the repelled rejection through resistance occurs. Why Solana might pull back before breaking higher Short-term weakness is still possible. A retrace to the $176 accumulation phase would not be out of place, considering the resistance levels above. As a matter of fact, analysts believe that such a drawdown can provide Solana the foundation it requires to jump higher. Institutions are already circling. Pantera Capital is currently raising a $1.25 billion fund to form a new Nasdaq-listed treasury company focused on staking Solana. The first $500 million from that raise could directly flow into SOL, driving new demand Both whales and institutions are positioning and thus, the long-term odds of Solana recovering are not going. Final verdict The chart of Solana is at a stalemate position at the two large levels; $176 and $207 lows and highs respectively. This can be viewed by whales as an organic consolidation process with institutions ready to purchase billions of dollars of SOL. That’s why many are patient with Solana for the long-term recovery shot toward $300. .In the short term, however, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting their attention. Its successful passed audit, scarcity of supply and presale rewarding are all contributing to demand. Whales are slowly racking up MAGA as they await the next Solana breakout. To the everyday investor, it serves as a clear indication, MAGA is the coin that holds the present-day gains, whereas Solana is the long-term investment.

SUI is facing a bearish outlook with forecasts pointing toward $2.90, highlighting weak demand and falling liquidity. Toncoin, on the other hand, shows mixed technicals and fragile momentum even after a slight daily gain. These examples reflect how unstable many altcoins still are. BlockDAG has broken away from this pattern. With more than $386 million raised in its presale and a Batch 30 price of $0.03, the project has become one of the strongest bullish cryptos heading into 2025. Its recent rollout of Dashboard V4, strong security audits, and confirmation of 20 exchange listings show real progress built on transparency and growth. While rivals deal with unstable charts, BlockDAG (BDAG) is proving why trust and delivery matter. SUI Price Prediction Suggests Short-Term Weakness SUI is under selling pressure with projections pointing toward $2.90 soon, a drop of nearly 18–20% from its current range. Analysts cite weak demand, shrinking liquidity, and hesitation among retail traders as the main reasons for this outlook. On-chain activity supports the same picture, showing lighter participation from both retail and whales, leaving the balance tilted toward sellers. Technical charts also confirm the pressure. RSI shows divergence that signals continued weakness, while MACD lines highlight selling strength. Analysts note that $2.90 is the main support zone to watch. If this level holds, a rebound could lead to recovery toward $3.20–$3.40. For now, the advice is caution. Buyers need clear confirmation through volume and momentum before looking for entry. Without that, SUI remains vulnerable to further decline unless demand quickly returns to shift the signals. Toncoin Price Momentum Fails Despite Small Gains Toncoin (TON) trades at $3.24, recording a modest 1.04% daily increase but struggling to show bullish conviction. Trading volume fell 15.21% to $207.5 million, showing weaker participation and cautious sentiment. Over the past week, TON has dropped 5.44%, diverging from wider market resilience and adding to the bearish mood. Analysts point to critical support levels. If TON can hold, Fibonacci retracements suggest potential moves toward $3.89 and $4.43. Failure to maintain support, however, risks a slide toward $2.80, a level that could heavily weaken sentiment. Current indicators add to the mixed view. RSI stands at 45.53, signaling weak momentum, while MACD shows slight bullishness but with a fading histogram, suggesting loss of strength. CoinGlass data also shows a 19% drop in trading volume and open interest slipping 0.45% to $296.9 million. Overall, Toncoin’s direction remains uncertain. Its momentum is weak, and sentiment is cautious as traders wait for stronger signals before committing. BlockDAG’s $386M Presale and 2,900% ROI Show Why It Leads Bullish Crypto Rankings While SUI and Toncoin struggle with fragile setups, BlockDAG continues to build strength through delivery. The project has already raised more than $386 million in presale funding at Batch 30, with its price climbing to $0.03. With a launch price of $0.05 expected, early backers have seen an ROI of 2,900%. A standout highlight is the release of Dashboard V4. This platform simulates post-launch trading activity with real-time BDAG charts, wallet monitoring, order book data, referral features, and leaderboard metrics. It gives users a clear, transparent view of presale activity and prepares the community for live exchange action. BlockDAG has also passed strict security checks from CertiK and Halborn. Every issue was fixed, and the system now uses multi-signature approvals and time-delay execution to add strong safeguards. This gives users confidence in a sector where security problems are often common. Liquidity is secured through 20 confirmed exchange listings, including MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, LBank, and XT.com. These listings guarantee broad market access from the first day of launch. By combining a huge presale raise, tough security, advanced dashboard tools, and confirmed liquidity, BlockDAG shows why it leads as a top bullish crypto. Its model proves that growth can be built on delivery and trust, not just speculation. BlockDAG Defines Bullish Strength in Crypto SUI’s weak chart outlook and Toncoin’s fading momentum highlight how uncertain many altcoins remain. Both face hurdles that could decide whether they recover or continue sliding. In contrast, BlockDAG has already secured its place among the leading bullish cryptos. With $386 million raised, a Batch 30 price of $0.03, and achievements like Dashboard V4, proven audits, and 20 listings, it has built real credibility even before launch. This powerful mix of progress and execution offers a path that few projects can match. While others rely on short-term speculation, BlockDAG has shown that bullish strength comes from real delivery and strong systems. By combining transparency, security, and global access, it sets the stage for long-term growth and positions itself as the next major breakout.

With the market experiencing a pullback, cryptocurrency investors and traders are taking advantage of the opportunity before a potential recovery. Across multiple crypto circles, many are asking what are the best cryptos to buy now before the next bull cycle. While big-name tokens continue to dominate watchlists, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a breakout contender, gaining attention for bringing transparency into the meme coin space. To cut through the noise, analysts have highlighted five cryptocurrencies that stand out today for their fundamentals, adoption, and long-term potential. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Transparency Sets It Apart MAGACOIN FINANCE is the breakout potential on this list. The project is fast drawing attention as one of the few meme coin presales that have prioritized safety and transparency to reinforce investors’ confidence. And that bet has paid off. Many of the investors and traders drawn to the project point to its full Hashex audit and a KYC-verified team. This mix of credibility has not only set it apart but also positioned it as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Analysts tracking it refer to MAGACOIN FINANCE as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. With thousands of investors getting in daily, those who stay on the sidelines may be left chasing rallies in months to come. 2. Bitcoin (BTC): The Market’s Anchor Bitcoin is trading around $110,000–$111,000 after a dip from $124,000. Analysts expect volatility but point to possible gains toward $114K–$118K soon. While talk of $200,000 this year feels unlikely, BTC remains the top choice for many investors searching for the best crypto to buy now. With institutional adoption growing and a $2.1 trillion market cap, it remains crypto’s anchor. 3. Ethereum (ETH): Staking and Institutional Confidence Ethereum sits near $4,600, supported by more than 30% of its supply now locked in staking. Institutional demand, ETF inflows, and ecosystem growth give ETH strong momentum. Analysts project a potential climb to $5,300 this year, keeping it on nearly every best altcoins to buy list. 4. Cardano (ADA): Aiming for a Breakout Cardano trades near $0.84, with resistance at $1.00. Analysts believe a push toward $1.20 is possible soon, with longer-term forecasts pointing to $2.00 if momentum continues. Backed by strong community funding and ecosystem upgrades, ADA remains one of the best altcoins to buy for growth-focused investors. 5. Stellar Lumens (XLM): Payments and Positive Sentiment Stellar Lumens trades around $0.40, with predictions for a rise to $0.45–$0.46 in the near term. Known for fast, low-cost payments, Stellar is benefiting from renewed optimism tied to Ripple’s legal clarity. Its fundamentals and increasing adoption make it another name in the best crypto to buy now conversation. Final Word From Bitcoin’s steady fundamentals to Ethereum’s institutional momentum, Cardano’s ecosystem, Stellar’s payments niche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s transparency, analysts say these five projects top the list of the best crypto to buy now in 2025.

Data Says No,https://bitcoinist.com/etfs-taking-over-bitcoin-trading-volume-data-no/,"On-chain data shows exchanges are still the main venue of Bitcoin trading, with Binance alone observing volume double that of the spot ETFs. US Bitcoin Spot ETFs Still Account For Just 13% Of Trading Volume In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has talked about how the US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) compare to exchanges when it comes to Bitcoin trading volume . Spot ETFs are investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to BTC without having to own it. The ETFs trade on traditional platforms, so investors who aren’t familiar with the digital asset space can easily invest into the coin through them. The spot ETFs are relatively new to the sector, having received approval from the US SEC at the start of last year. Before the ETFs, investors had to use cryptocurrency exchanges to buy BTC. Unlike with the ETFs, exchanges normally deposit actual tokens to a buyer’s wallet that they can then choose to withdraw into self-custody . For many traditional investors, though, navigating cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges can feel daunting. ETFs provide a simpler, off-chain route into Bitcoin, making them a direct competitor to exchanges. Since their inauguration, spot ETFs have quickly gained popularity, but one question arises: how do they stack up against the old exchanges? Below is a chart shared by CryptoQuant that puts into perspective the Bitcoin trading volume of the US spot ETFs compared to the major exchanges. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin spot ETFs have usually witnessed daily trading volume between $5 billion to $10 billion during the last few months. This is a notable value, but pales in comparison to what cryptocurrency exchanges witness. Binance, the largest platform in the sector, alone observes up to $18 billion in volume on peak days. In terms of percentage of trading volume occupied since Donald Trump became US President, Binance leads the market with a share of 34.69%. In contrast, the US spot ETFs only hold a Bitcoin volume dominance of 4.53%. Crypto.com (20.11%), Bybit (6.45%), and MEXC (4.62%) are all ahead of them. Based on the data, the analytics firm concludes, “exchanges remain the primary venue for trading.” A similar picture appears when looking at the spot ETFs for Ethereum, which launched in the US in mid-2024. From the above chart, it’s visible that Binance has made up for 29.07% of the total Ethereum trading volume, far ahead of the 13.08% figure of the US spot ETFs. That said, the gap here is closer than for Bitcoin. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen a plunge of around 3% over the past 24 hours that has taken its price to $108,500.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin ETFs|Bitcoin Volume|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-30 03:00:39

Solana Is Breaking Out Of An Ascending Triangle In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a triangle technical analysis (TA) pattern forming in the 12-hour price of Solana. The pattern in question is an “Ascending Triangle,” which appears whenever an asset’s price consolidates between two converging trendlines. Related Reading: Solana Social Media Hype Hits 11-Week High As Price Jumps 16% The special feature of the formation is that the upper trendline is parallel to the time-axis, while the lower one is sloped upward. This means that as the price travels between the lines, it observes its range shrink to an upside. As with any consolidation pattern, the upper line of the Ascending Triangle is likely to present resistance to the price, while the lower one support. A break out of either of these levels can signal a continuation in that direction: a surge above the triangle is a bullish sign and a fall under it a bearish one. Like the Ascending Triangle, there is also the Descending Triangle, which is quite similar except for the fact that its lower line is parallel to the time-axis instead. Generally, the probability of a breakout is considered more likely to occur beyond the resistance line in an Ascending Triangle, while in a Descending Triangle, a breakdown of support is more probable. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Ascending Triangle that has appeared in Solana’s 12-hour price: As is visible in the above graph, Solana has been trading inside the pattern for many months now and recently, it has been trying to break out of it. This attempt at a surge above the resistance line comes as SOL has been approaching the apex of the triangle. Usually, a breakout becomes more likely to occur as the price nears the end of the pattern. This is because the consolidation range gets quite narrow around the apex. The same effect may be in play for the cryptocurrency right now. In the event that the latest attempt does lead to a sustained bullish push, Solana may be looking at the $300 level, according to Martinez. This level is around where the 1.618 Fibonacci Extension level lies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Over? CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index Turns Bearish Fibonacci Extension lines are drawn on a price chart based on ratios from the Fibonacci series. The 1.618 ratio in particular corresponds to the famous Golden Ratio. If Solana does end up witnessing a rally to this target of $300, then its price would have gone up by around 46% from the current value. SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is floating around $205, up more than 5% over the last seven days.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $4.59 to $5.54. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.3942 Market Cap $632.23M Trading Volume $36.43M Circulating Supply 1.60B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.2916 24-hour High $0.4287 24-hour Low $0.3892 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 3.99% 50-Day SMA $0.3973 14-Day RSI 51.80 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 50 (Neutral) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $0.4276 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown FLOW faced rejection at $0.44 and is now consolidating lower. Support sits at $0.387-$0.393. Flow coin’s immediate short-term resistance lies at $0.401–0.417. Flow coin 1-day price analysis The 1-day price chart for August 30 shows that FLOW faced rejection from the $0.44 area and is now trading around $0.394, sitting just above the mid-Bollinger Band ($0.393). FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView Momentum signals are softening: RSI is neutral near 51, while MACD lines are close to a bearish cross. The lower Bollinger Band at $0.358 is the next key support if today’s candle closes below $0.393, while resistance remains at $0.427–0.430. Reclaiming $0.41 would shift sentiment back toward buyers, but until then, price action looks corrective. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis FLOW’s 4-hour chart shows a series of lower highs after the spike to $0.44, with price now hovering around the 50-SMA ($0.395). Resistance is layered at $0.401 and $0.417, while support is marked at $0.387. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Volume has tapered off compared to the initial surge, signaling fading momentum. Unless $0.401 is broken convincingly, sellers retain short-term control, and a retest of $0.387 support remains likely. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3887 BUY SMA 5 $0.3975 SELL SMA 10 $0.3959 SELL SMA 21 $0.3956 SELL SMA 50 $0.3973 SELL SMA 100 $0.3801 BUY SMA 200 $0.4276 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3870 BUY EMA 5 $0.3837 BUY EMA 10 $0.3794 BUY EMA 21 $0.3806 BUY EMA 50 $0.4111 SELL EMA 100 $0.4781 SELL EMA 200 $0.5585 SELL What to expect from Flow? Unless FLOW reclaims $0.401–$0.41 soon, the bias leans toward further testing of $0.387–0.358 support before any sustainable recovery attempt. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

Ethereum has a powerful foothold, SEI is gaining traction through ecosystem upgrades and institutional anticipation while MAGACOIN FINANCE is being tagged as retail-driven presale of the quarter. Experts believe that the fusion of established strength and fresh opportunity could determine the next stage of crypto adoption. Ethereum: Institutional Strength Supports Retail Confidence Ethereum is hovering around $4,600 after gaining 70% in value year-on-year and remains a key focus for retail and institutional strategies. In a single day, spot Ethereum ETFs generated almost $444 million in net inflows, making them one of the key driving factors as Bitcoin ETFs witnessed through the same period. The transactions rise 63% in the last 30 days. The active addresses growth with 26% growth is a healthy sign. Also, the exchange reserves have decreased by 4.4% to $80.7 billion, indicating accumulation not profit taking. According to the analysts, Ethereum’s healthy staking appetite indicates confidence among validators and institutions as demand soars with over $4 billion worth of ETH queued. The stability of ETH has made it a reliable option in presale and altcoin rotations ahead of Q4. SEI Network: Ecosystem Growth and Institutional Signals SEI is currently priced at $0.299 and it is up by 3.39% on the day. Analysts suggest the price could weaken short term. The potential price drop being suggested is towards the $0.23 level which may happen this September. Nonetheless, impressive ecosystem progress strengthens its long-term outlook. In August, SEI saw its strongest month ever, with $1.2 billion in DEX trading volume and 15 million active wallets, signalling real adoption. With the recent “Giga” upgrade, parallel block execution with Autobahn consensus was introduced to the SEI network, allowing over 200,000 transactions a second with complete EVM Compatibility. Its position makes it a hub for Ethereum developers seeking scalable infrastructure. Canary Capital’s staked-SEI ETF has submitted its application to the SEC and is awaiting approval. At the same time, Wyoming’s state-backed Frontier Stable Token (FRNT) has selected SEI as a host chain, further rooting SEI into real-world financial use cases. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Retail Leader in Q4 Although Ethereum and SEI are solid names, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the Q4 retail momentum. With a 2,000% ROI prediction, a KYC-verified team and thousands of investors already on board, it’s being touted one of the best presales to buy in 2025 – but limited supply means time is running out fast. Furthermore, it is more accountable than most early-stage tokens thanks to its verified team and transparent roadmap. Growth of Whale-backed inflows and speedy retail adoption are rising, according to analysts, with Google search interest and social engagement around this project increasing. As a result of MAGACOIN FINANCE’s focus on security, visibility, and scarcity, many analysts have dubbed it the presale of the year, which is expected to be retail-driven. As more investors ask what the best crypto to buy in 2025 is, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to lead the conversation. Its smart contract has been fully audited and the development team has been fully KYC-verified, offering unmatched legitimacy during a time of rising investor scrutiny. Conclusion Ethereum has continued to show its strength through institutional inflows, while the SEI narrative shows how ecosystem growth and regulatory progress can capture retail attention. However, analysts state that the highest potential retail-driven momentum in Q4 is elsewhere. Due to its dual audits, verified team and increasing community adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already being regarded as the breakout presale of Q4 2025 — and one of the most appealing opportunities before supply runs out.

CZ Says the Winner Is Clear – and It’s Not Centralization,https://cryptopotato.com/defi-vs-cex-cz-says-the-winner-is-clear-and-its-not-centralization/,"At the recent BNBDay event in Tokyo, Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said decentralized exchanges (DEXs) will eventually surpass their centralized counterparts (CEXs) in trading volume. CZ noted that while CEXs currently dominate the market due to their liquidity and user-friendly experience, the momentum is shifting toward decentralized finance (DeFi). He also added that a truly private, efficient, and user-centric DEX would have the potential to reshape the industry. The DEX Appeal The former executive expressed that if he were 20 years younger, he would focus on building both an AI-powered trading agent and a privacy-preserving perpetual DEX, as he sees the biggest opportunities for innovation. While acknowledging regulatory and liquidity hurdles, particularly in areas like real-world assets (RWA), CZ maintained that the DeFi ecosystem represents the future of finance. In the second quarter of 2025, DEXs achieved their highest-ever market share in spot trading volumes, according to a report shared by CoinGecko. While CEXs remain dominant, the report highlighted clear signs of weakening momentum. Binance, the largest CEX by market share, still led the field but saw its quarterly spot trading volume decline sharply to $1.47 trillion, down from over $2 trillion previously. Other major CEXs fared even worse. For instance, Crypto.com endured a whopping 61% drop, and Coinbase also experienced lower volumes, in a wider slowdown across centralized platforms amid growing trader migration to decentralized venues. The surge in DEX activity was driven largely by PancakeSwap, which emerged as the standout performer of the quarter. The platform’s trading volume grew more than fivefold compared to Q1, which catapulted it to the top of the decentralized exchange rankings. This growth signals increasing trader preference for non-custodial platforms that prioritize privacy, control, and flexibility over centralized infrastructure. Emergence of Hybrid CeDeFi A key factor behind the surge in DEX activity is the rise of hybrid CeDeFi platforms, which blend the strengths of centralized and decentralized models. As recently reported by Binance Research, major exchanges are increasingly channeling liquidity toward these systems, which offer users low-slippage trades, MEV protection, and faster execution while retaining the transparency of on-chain settlement. Binance Research noted that such innovations are making DEXs more scalable and competitive, effectively narrowing the gap with traditional CEXs. Meanwhile, DeFi’s flexible regulatory environment has enabled rapid experimentation and feature rollouts, which have fueled steady growth in on-chain volumes. The same cannot be said for CEXs whose spot trading remains heavily influenced by retail sentiment, macroeconomic headwinds, and volatility. The post DeFi vs. CEX?

Few examples make this clearer than comparing XRP and Cardano with BlockDAG’s current rise. While market watchers debate the XRP price forecast and scan Cardano’s charts, BlockDAG (BDAG) is showing steady growth through real usage and strong community activity. With more than $386 million raised in its presale, 25.6 billion coins sold, the project is shaping up as the best crypto for payments. Its X1 app counts millions of users, and confirmed exchange listings give it a clear path to trading. These combined factors separate it from projects that still rely only on market speculation. In a sector often driven by hype over function, BlockDAG is setting a different tone, showing why usage and adoption are just as important as price talk. XRP Holds Steady While Waiting for a Breakout The XRP price forecast is once again in focus after the coin managed to defend its $3.00 support area. Trading close to $3.09, XRP continues to find it hard to push beyond $3.30, the level that blocked its last rally. Analysts believe that clearing $3.30 could spark moves toward $3.50, $3.66, and even $4.00. Market data shows hesitation. Open Interest stands at $327 million, with no clear push from either side. Net longs have slipped, showing less buying pressure, while shorts remain unchanged. This balance has kept the price locked in place. For now, XRP staying above $3.00 is a good sign, but without new momentum or strong inflows, the sideways pattern may continue. The XRP price forecast still offers both upside chances and caution. Cardano Charts Indicate Steady Progress Cardano (ADA) continues to show signs of strength after climbing back above $0.90. Currently priced at $0.9198, it trades just below the important resistance zone between $0.93 and $1.00. If ADA closes above $1.00 on the weekly chart, it could unlock further upside targets at $1.11, $1.20–$1.25, and eventually $1.35. The overall trend looks favorable, with moving averages pointing higher and the RSI sitting at 59, reflecting healthy momentum. Several indicators confirm this outlook. The Chaikin Money Flow records consistent inflows above $15 million per week, showing ongoing demand. MACD remains on the positive side, signaling a stable uptrend, while widening Bollinger Bands suggest that larger price swings may be developing. Still, caution remains, as failure to break resistance could trigger a dip back to the $0.82–$0.86 range. Overall, Cardano’s structure supports steady gains, provided buyers sustain pressure and push prices through the $1.00 barrier. BlockDAG’s 3M Miners Mark It as the Best Crypto for Payments While XRP and Cardano trade within familiar ranges, BlockDAG is building a foundation that sets it apart. The presale has raised more than $386 million, now in Batch 30 at a price of $0.03 per BDAG coin. With 25.6 billion coins sold and an ROI already standing at 2900%, interest continues to grow. The mining network is another strength. From the X1 mobile app to the X10, X30, and X100 hardware, the project’s mining line gives both casual users and advanced miners ways to participate. This broad accessibility supports a community that can expand with demand. The July demo highlighted seamless connectivity between the X1 app and the X10 device, proving that the system is not just a plan but already in use. Exchange listings further strengthen BlockDAG’s outlook. Confirmed launches on 20 global platforms such as MEXC, BitMart, LBank, Coinstore, and XT.com mean users will have quick access to liquidity and global reach. This ensures that activity translates into trading and price discovery once live. Together, these elements $386 million raised, 3 million active miners, a 2900% ROI, and guaranteed listings, place BlockDAG in a stronger position than peers still struggling with technical levels. This combination of adoption, mining reach, and liquidity makes BlockDAG stand out as the best crypto for payments today. Final Word Comparing XRP, Cardano, and BlockDAG highlights the difference between price action and adoption. XRP’s price forecast shows support but lacks strong movement. Cardano’s technical setup shows healthy signs but needs a breakout above resistance. BlockDAG, however, is already delivering on clear milestones: $386 million raised, 25.6 billion coins sold, and 20 confirmed exchange listings. For people following the crypto space, these figures show BlockDAG is not just another presale. It is a structured project with real usage and visible growth. In a market often driven by speculation, BlockDAG’s progress makes a strong case for being the best crypto for payments going forward.

BNB, one of the industry’s leading altcoins, has staged a powerful rally thanks to institutional growth and DeFi adoption. Simultaneously, PEPE is again leading the meme coin frenzy, driven by whale accumulation and strong community support. Yet analysts say that while BNB and PEPE are generating buzz, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the major breakout play of the cycle and is set to gain momentum as one of the best opportunities. BNB: Institutional Confidence and DeFi Growth BNB is currently trading around $846, having risen by 7% daily and 8% month-to-date throughout August. The increase is driven by ecosystem milestones, including close to 58% YTD growth in BNB Chain stablecoin supply. Almost at an all-time highs for DeFi activity on BNB, there are $11.1 billion stablecoins. Institutional adoption is also strengthening. B Strategy, an investment firm, will create a reserve fund worth $1 billion to provide liquidity, build infra and drive global adoption of BNB. As BNB approaches its 5th anniversary, the chain is preparing to celebrate with series of global events and enticing rewards programs worth nearly $500,000 to its global users. BNB is a good option in Q3 for investors seeking reliability and scalability. PEPE: Meme Coin Mania Returns Currently, PEPE price stands at around $0.00001006, having seen gains of about 4% in the last 24 hours. The big players remain strong supporters of Pepecoin and have purchased 1.5% more of it this month. If the price holds at a certain level, analysts believe PEPE could rally up to $0.00001220. Besides the price action, community-driven presale activity has raised over $6 million. PEPE may be a high-risk, high-reward investment, but it has definitely been the reason behind meme coin craze this quarter. The combination of speculative energy and community engagement helps it stay at the heart of conversations about market sentiment. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Strongest Breakout Play Meme coin mania is in full swing in Q3 2025, driven by the BNB and PEPE rallies. However, analysts are betting on MAGACOIN FINANCE as the strongest breakout play. It’s been audited double by HashEx and CertiK, rated 100% safe and secure and fully transparent. MAGACOIN FINANCE is considered among the top cryptos to purchase this cycle, as it has the potential to yield a 65x ROI, while whale-backed momentum accelerates ahead of limited allocations running out. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a project that is more legitimate than speculative meme tokens. It has undergone security verification and boasts a KYC-verified team. Whale inflows and retail adoption are converging quickly, as its roadmap emphasises transparency. Analysts are warning that presale allocations are quickly tightening, creating a countdown effect like one saw in early Ethereum or Solana. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being viewed as an attractive option for investors looking for high upside but not willing to compromise on safety. Conclusion According to analysts, the strongest breakout play option in 2025 is still in presales, which provides safety as well as momentum. Furthermore, during Q3 2025, Meme coin activity clearly showed PEPE makes a major statement whilst BNB is strong as a DeFi play. With its dual audits, whale demand and forecasts of 65x upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being touted as the altcoin set to outperform BNB and PEPE this cycle – but the presale window is closing fast.

50896615,569588,1756526449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50896615.jpeg,PetroChina Eyes Stablecoin Integration As Eric Trump Praises China’s Crypto Power,https://bitcoinist.com/petrochina-eyes-stablecoin-eric-trump-praise-chinas/,"Following the recent regulatory developments in Hong Kong, Asia’s largest oil and gas producer, PetroChina, is reportedly evaluating the adoption of stablecoins for cross-border payments. PetroChina Considers Stablecoin Adoption On Friday, local news media outlets reported that PetroChina, the listed arm of state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), will explore cross-border settlement and payments using stablecoins. According to the reports, Wang Hua, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Board Secretary of PetroChina, disclosed during the half-year meeting that the company is closely monitoring the latest developments regarding the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) Stablecoin Ordinance. In May, Hong Kong’s Legislative Council officially passed the new Stablecoins Ordinance, directing any individual or entity seeking to issue a fiat-referenced stablecoin (FRS) in the jurisdiction, or any Hong Kong Dollar (HKD)-pegged token, to obtain a license from the HKMA. The ordinance, enacted on August 1, aims to reinforce regulatory oversight on the digital assets industry, while fostering innovation and “responsible, sustainable” development. Under the new framework, licensed entities are allowed to offer FRS in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, retail investors can access the tokens issued only by these qualified institutions. Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary, Paul Chan Mo-po, previously noted that stablecoins, “particularly when it is referenced to fiat currencies, (have) many use case scenarios,” including cross-border payments to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. PetroChina will reportedly initiate a viability study on the use of stablecoins for cross-border settlement and payments, marking the Chinese energy giant’s entry into the digital assets landscape under Hong Kong’s new regulatory framework. HK, China Crypto Landscape As the report noted, Wang Hua didn’t disclose a specific timeline, only stating that the company would “closely monitor policy developments and build technical capabilities.” This could suggest that PetroChina’s stablecoin exploration remains in the research phase. It’s worth noting that the HKMA established a six-month transition period and encouraged interested institutions to submit applications before September 30. Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary has stated that regulators received several applications from entities seeking to become qualified issuers. Previous reports revealed that multiple companies have applied for the HKMA license ahead of the ordinance enactment, including logistics technology firm Reitar Logtech and the overseas arm of Chinese mainland financial technology giant Ant Group. Meanwhile, e-commerce giant JD.com, through its fintech arm JD Coinlink, was testing HKD-pegged tokens under the regulator’s sandbox program earlier this year. Despite Hong Kong’s crypto push, authorities have warned about the excessive hype in the market and public opinion, raising concerns over a developing trend toward speculation as the market has become “overly enthusiastic.” Similarly, Chinese regulators have allegedly instructed firms to halt promotions and research publications related to stablecoins amid concerns that the growing interest in the sector could enable the digital asset to be exploited as a new tool for fraudulent activities. Nonetheless, Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, recently highlighted China’s role in the crypto industry. At Bitcoin Asia 2025, the American businessman affirmed that the country is a “hell of a power” in the sector, adding that the US and China likely understood digital assets “better than anyone else in the world.” “There’s no question that China is a hell of a power when it comes to this world,” Trump said, stating that he would love for President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to talk about Bitcoin.",Crypto News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Asia 2025|btc|BTCUSDT|China Bitcoin|China crypto crackdown|China Stablecoin|Eric Trump|Hong Kong stablecoin|PetroChina|PetroChina Stablecoin|stablecoin adoption|stablecoin license|Stablecoin regulation,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-30 04:00:49

Analyst Forecasts Drop To $94,000 If This Level Doesn’t Hold",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/is-the-bitcoin-rally-over-analyst-forecasts-drop-to-94000-if-this-level-doesnt-hold/,"After a short-lived recovery, Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to bounce from a crucial level to reclaim the $110,000 support. However, some analysts suggest that a retest of the $90,000 level could be the next stop for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Another Short-Lived Solana Rally? Here’s Why It May Be Different This Time Bitcoin Drops To Weekly Lows Bitcoin lost the $110,000 support for the first time in nearly two months, dipping below the lower boundary of its local range, between $108,700-$119,500. The flagship crypto hit an eight-week low of $107,900 on Friday afternoon, raising concerns for its short-term rally among investors. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggested that the market is starting to show signs of fatigue, with Bitcoin Dominance displaying cracks after carrying “the bulk of the bull market momentum.” To the analyst, BTC’s current price action signals a macro trend shift, mirroring the 2021 price action and the conditions that preceded the 2021 cycle peak. At the time, the cryptocurrency hit a peak of $60,000 in April, retraced, rallied to $70,000, and set a strong bearish divergence against the Relative Strength Index (RSI) before the bear market began. This time, Bitcoin is showing the same setup that foreshadowed the end of the last cycle, with price making higher highs while the RSI makes lower lows, Martinez explained. Among other technical signals, the analyst highlighted that the MACD indicator had turned bearish this week. He detailed that this bearish crossover aligns with the price drop and reinforces the downside risks. Meanwhile, he added that the recent death cross in the Bitcoin MVRV Momentum indicator “signals a macro momentum reversal from positive to negative. This is a historically reliable warning sign of cyclical tops.” The analyst affirmed that the on-chain evidence suggests Bitcoin’s top may be in, at least temporarily, with bias shifting bearish and a risk of retesting lower support levels. Will BTC Mirror Its 2021 Drop? Martinez also noted that the $108,700 support is crucial for BTC’s short-term performance, as a weekly close below this area would confirm a deeper trend shift, which occurred in 2021. After peaking in late 2021, the flagship crypto lost its local range above the $58,000 mark, which led to a retest of the macro range’s mid-zone and an eventual drop below the macro range’s lows in the coming months. If BTC loses its immediate technical floor, the price could retest the $104,500 and $97,000 support levels, risking a drop to the mid-zone of the macro range, around the $94,000 area. Altcoin Sherpa weighed in on the cryptocurrency’s performance, stating that Bitcoin should have strong support between the $103,000-$108,000 levels, as the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) sits around the $104,000 mark. Related Reading: XRP Shows Strength Amid $3 Retest, But Analyst Warns Of Potential Correction However, analyst Ted Pillows considers that $124,000 appears to be the local top. He explained that, historically, Bitcoin’s bottoms occur after a retest of the weekly 60 EMA, which currently sits around the $92,000 support zone and has a CME gap. “In this scenario, Bitcoin will start a reversal after 3-4 weeks and a new ATH by November/December,” Ted concluded. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $107,947, a 7.5% decline in the weekly timeframe.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently echoed the bold prediction that Bitcoin may climb to $1 million per coin within the next 5 years. I think we'll see $1M per bitcoin by 2030. Regulatory clarity is finally emerging, the US government is keeping a BTC reserve, there's a growing interest for crypto ETFs, among many other factors. (Not financial advice of course, it's impossible to guarantee) pic.twitter.com/w5EfcYFvVp — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) August 20, 2025 His outlook aligns with other prominent voices , including Robert Kiyosaki and Jack Dorsey, who see Bitcoin gaining global acceptance at an unprecedented scale. Armstrong’s position is based partly on increasing government and institutional interest. He pointed to the United States’ initiative to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and suggested that other G20 nations could eventually adopt similar measures. If this trend develops, demand from sovereign states and large institutions could become a major driver of Bitcoin’s sustained growth. Currently, Bitcoin holds a market capitalization of approximately $2.3 trillion, surpassing both silver and major corporations such as Meta. Ethereum follows with around $570 billion, while XRP stands at about $182 billion. Together, these figures form part of a global cryptocurrency market valued at $4 trillion, with Bitcoin maintaining a dominance of roughly 58%. Should Bitcoin hit $21 trillion, the entire cryptocurrency market could expand to $36 trillion. Estimating XRP’s Value in a $36 Trillion Market Projecting XRP’s future price under this scenario involves several assumptions. One straightforward approach is proportional growth. If Bitcoin grows from $110,750 to $1 million, a 764% increase, XRP could hypothetically rise by the same percentage. Based on its current price of $2.82 , this would place XRP around $26, with a market capitalization of roughly $1.57 trillion. Under the same framework, Ethereum could reach over $43,000 per token with a $5.2 trillion valuation. Can XRP Outperform Bitcoin? Some analysts argue that XRP could exceed these conservative estimates. Historical performance provides part of the reasoning. In the past year, XRP appreciated by over 400%, while Bitcoin advanced by less than 90% during the same period. If this pattern of outperformance persists, XRP could deliver several times Bitcoin’s growth. In an extreme scenario, this would push XRP’s valuation above $100 and lift its total market cap close to $6 trillion. Nonetheless, such outcomes remain speculative. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 AI-Driven Forecasts Artificial intelligence platforms have also offered their perspectives. OpenAI’s ChatGPT suggested XRP might trade between $20 and $35 if Bitcoin hits $1 million, though more optimistic cases point to $35–$68 or even higher. Google’s Gemini placed XRP’s potential range between $8 and $42, while X’s Grok AI estimated $15–$30 as a baseline, with $50–$100 possible under strong institutional adoption and favourable regulatory shifts. Factors That Could Influence XRP’s Growth Several developments could provide tangible support for XRP’s expansion. Anticipated XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), expected by October, may attract significant capital inflows, with projections of $5 billion in the first month alone, similar to the surge seen in Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. Ripple’s growing payments network is another key driver. Partnerships with major banks, including BNY, alongside the launch of RLUSD, a stablecoin tied to XRP for transaction fees, are enhancing real-world utility. Moreover, the adoption of XRP in corporate treasuries has gained momentum. As of June, eight companies across industries, including technology, energy, pharmaceuticals, and cannabis, had collectively allocated nearly $1 billion to XRP holdings . If Bitcoin achieves a $21 trillion market cap, XRP could realistically trade in the $20–$35 range, with higher values possible under favourable conditions. While projections above $100 remain highly speculative, factors such as institutional adoption, ETF launches, and Ripple’s expanding ecosystem could strengthen XRP’s long-term position.

As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $4.89 Market Cap $2.62B Trading Volume $64.19M Circulating Supply 537.42M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $5.09 24-h Low $4.82 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 4.12% 14-Day RSI 45.02 50-Day SMA $5.49 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 50 (Neutral) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $6.06 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Currently, ICP is holding above $4.72 but is still in a broader downtrend. Daily MACD is bearish with weak momentum. The 4-hour chart shows a slight bounce, but resistance is heavy near $5.00–$5.02. ICP 1-day price analysis On the daily chart for August 30, ICP trades around $4.92 after dipping to $4.80 and bouncing off the lower Bollinger Band at $4.72. The trend is still bearish with lower highs and lower lows, while MACD stays negative and aligned downward, keeping pressure on the market. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView ICP’s resistance sits near the mid-band at $5.28, and losing $4.72 on a daily close could trigger deeper downside. Holding above the lower band might stabilize the price, but bulls won’t regain control unless $5.28 is reclaimed. ICP 4-hour price analysis The 4-hour price chart shows a slight recovery after a string of red candles. Alligator lines are still fanning downward, signaling the trend hasn’t reversed. Volume remains steady at about 11M, while OBV is negative, reflecting continued distribution. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView ICP’s local resistance sits at $4.94–$5.02, with support around $4.85. A breakout over $5.02 could bring relief, but rejection would likely drag the coin’s price back toward $4.80.

Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a serious contender for the next $1 milestone, offering structured DeFi mechanisms that will generate persistent demand. While DOGE relies largely on sentiment, MUTM is built around real financial activity: lending, borrowing, and staking that directly influence token velocity and price. Meme hype vs real DeFi utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a non-custodial lending protocol that supports P2C for stablecoins and major crypto coins, alongside isolated P2P lanes for high-risk or volatile tokens. P2C pools will adjust interest rates automatically based on utilization, ensuring lenders earn optimal APYs while borrowers maintain access to liquidity. For example, as more users deposit into a pool, rates will adapt dynamically, boosting returns and encouraging continuous participation. In parallel, P2P orders will allow borrowers and lenders to negotiate terms directly — including loan duration, APR, and partial fills — isolating risk while offering higher yields for risk-tolerant participants. By converting activity into token demand through mtToken staking and the platform’s buy-and-distribute revenue mechanism of MUTM, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ensures that every lending transaction contributes to continuous buy pressure for mtToken stakers. Unlike meme tokens, this model creates a predictable demand loop anchored to actual usage rather than speculation. Presale traction and future listings Total Supply 4 billion. PHASE 6: around $15.10 million generated so far. Current price: $0.035. Holders: Over 15,850. 30% Already Sold Out of 170 million of this phase’s supply. CertiK Audit of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — Methods Manual Review, Static Analysis. Token Scan Score 95.00. CertiK Skynet Score 78.00. 12K+ Twitter Followers. Note: Phase 7 will lift the price to $0.040 (+15%). The presale momentum positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to capitalize on the next wave of crypto investment interest. Phase 6 participants are securing access before the Phase 7 price hike. Early buyers will benefit from a platform launch that will include a Layer-2 integration, significantly reducing transaction costs and accelerating settlement speeds. This will allow users to interact with borrowing and lending pools immediately, generating real utility at listing. Borrowers will have clear mechanics to maintain leverage safely. For instance, an ETH holder will post collateral at a set LTV ratio to unlock stablecoin liquidity while retaining market exposure. Repayments will burn minted stablecoins automatically, and collateral liquidation triggers will protect pool health. Such overcollateralized loans ensure that both P2C and P2P ecosystems remain secure and predictable. Security and credibility are reinforced by the CertiK audit, including a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78, along with a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program and a $100,000 giveaway for community participants. These measures establish trust for early adopters seeking a safe entry into DeFi, differentiating MUTM from purely hype-driven tokens like DOGE. Looking ahead, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will pursue expected listings on top exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, and MEXC. The beta launch, when the token goes live, will allow immediate access to platform functionality, giving users real hands-on experience with lending, borrowing, and staking. The buy-and-distribute mechanism will continuously feed token demand, particularly as Layer-2 adoption accelerates volume and efficiency. For investors tracking crypto prices today, the combination of structured lending, predictable buybacks, and upcoming exchange visibility provides a clear path for meaningful gains. With Phase 6 already 30% sold, the next stage will push prices to $0.040, offering one of the last opportunities to enter before broader market recognition. Conclusion As analysts review crypto predictions and monitor metrics like the crypto fear and greed index, one thing becomes clear: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not chasing sentiment but creating lasting utility. For crypto investment portfolios seeking exposure beyond memes, MUTM represents a structured approach to growth. Early participation in Phase 6 will position holders to capitalize on beta adoption, Layer-2 efficiencies, and a growing pool of stakers, putting MUTM on track to challenge the $1 milestone ahead of many headline coins. Traders and retail investors now face a time-sensitive choice: Phase 6 discounts will vanish soon, and Phase 7 will lift the price by 15%, making this window the last widely accessible entry before listing-driven market discovery. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up as the breakout DeFi token that combines security, utility, and demand engineering — the next $1 challenger in the crypto market.

The three coins are being discussed in the joint context, but there is evident disparity in the upside potential. ADA and ETH are being projected for solid 50x–60x growth, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is being called a possible 600x play . That has placed it under the limelight as altcoin retail traders and even whales do not wish to miss on it. Cardano Finds Stability With Institutional Backing Cardano has been able to maintain above critical price levels in 2025 despite the swings that have taken place in the entire market. A big reason is institutional demand. According to ReserveOne data, inflows into ADA have been around $73 million in this year, and the overall amount recently put in custody now exceeds $900 million. The constant allocation is an indicator that money is holding ADA as a structural, long-term asset and not a short-term speculative offering. In most cases, institutions increase their exposure when a network meets three criteria- liquidity, credible infrastructure, and maturing ecosystem. Cardano checks all those boxes through its stable volume of transactions and stable development. In the case of big players, that reduces the risk factor and shows it as a portfolio option. At the time of writing, ADA price is trading at around $0.88 with a daily increase of 2.9% but is still down by 12% over the past week. Analysts have identified a demand zone around the level of $0.84 accrued on high volume action. Maintaining this level would be an indication of further resilience and might create an opportunity to increase to the $1.20- $1.30 resistance band. Analyst Crypto Target highlighted that ADA has revisited its previous breakout point, and is making higher bottoms, which precedes and is typically a sign of bigger rallies. On the bearish side, a drop down below the $ 0.84 level would cause the price to gravitate back towards the $0.70-72 collection zone. Cardano/TetherUS 1M Chart Ethereum Balances ETF Demand and Price Resistance Ethereum has also garnered the attention of analysts as the number of institutional activity is picking up. Spot ETFs reported an inflow of over +16.9k ETH this week indicating that ETFs continued to garner interest. The exchange reserves decreased by 4.41% to slightly below $80.7 billion which can be a sign of more keeping grasp and lesser temporary sales. Such a change of direction tends to establish a less volatile or even a bullish direction. Ethereum Exchange Reserve USD However, traders have watched out for a battle zone at the price of $4,700 . The liquidation map of Ethereum is highly populated at that level and hence is both an opportunity and risk. A breakout may trigger forced buying by shorts and an extension of a rally. A miss, however, can easily be greeted by aggressive selling as leveraged longs are punched out. Standard Chartered recently described Ethereum as undervalued. Jeffrey Kendrick, head of digital asset research at the bank, said that this shows that corporate treasuries and ETFs have already consumed 4.9% of the ETH supply since June. To top that off, companies such as SharpLink Gaming have gone all-in on the accumulation plan- SharpLink announced that it has purchased another 252 million ETH in a move that takes its treasury to nearly 800,000 ETH valued at approximately $3.7 billion. The company has a cash pile of $200 million to do even more purchases which effectively means that it has put a floor on its own holdings. Moves such as these lend credibility to the argument that the Ethereum ecosystem together with its staking reward makes it one of the most attractive blue-chips in crypto. MAGACOIN FINANCE Seen as the Standout Pick Analysts have placed MAGACOIN FINANCE alongside Cardano and Ethereum in their top crypto rankings for 2025, but with a major distinction. While Cardano and Ethereum are projected for 50x–60x growth , MAGACOIN FINANCE, recently audited , is forecast for up to 600x upside, making it the standout pick. Early buyers are also securing a 50% EXTRA BONUS with code PATRIOT50X, fueling strong FOMO as the project gains traction heading into the next bull cycle. Final Word Slow steady inflows in Cardano, heavy corporate investments in Ethereum and explosive upside targets in MAGACOIN FINANCE all demonstrate how various approaches can dominate in the crypto market in 2025 . ADA is building its case as a long-term institutional asset, ETH continues to prove itself as the second-biggest player with corporate and ETF demand, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is being highlighted as the higher-risk, higher-reward opportunity that could turn heads in the next cycle. The difference is stark ADA / ETH are more secured investments with institutional support and liquidity. MAGACOIN FINANCE is the outlier that analysts are predicting could generate outperformance in case it meets its projections. The fact is that, when it comes to the future of traders, it is not about making a single choice, but about learning how each fits in the overall scheme of things. Some will lean on Cardano’s stability, others will ride Ethereum’s institutional wave, but those chasing the biggest upside are starting to look closely at MAGACOIN FINANCE.

The stock currently trades at little or no premium to its Bitcoin holdings, with future value highly dependent on BTC price and share dilution. Scenario modeling suggests a potential 56.6% upside by 2028, but this is subject to high discount rates and significant execution risks. Despite the upside, I rate DDC as 'Hold' due to risks from its Chinese domicile, possible delisting, and a lack of clear long-term business strategy. You might have been fooled by this stock—it's definitely not a food products company anymore. DDC Enterprise ( DDC ) filed for an IPO two years ago to raise capital for its ready-to-cook meal business in China—but forget about meat. Now it's all about cooking Bitcoins. Those who have been my readers for a while will know that earlier this year I covered a similar story with Top Win International, a watch reseller that took advantage of the cash it was sitting on after its IPO and transitioned to a Bitcoin treasury. Shortly afterward, it changed its ticker to AsiaStrategy ( SORA ). And besides Bitcoin, do you know what else is similar between them? Neither was working with their previous business models. A quick look at DDC Enterprise's financial statements tells us: Stagnant revenues, even after the IPO; SG&A covering all reported gross profit, resulting in negative EBIT since FY 2020; Significant net loss, reaching an EPS of -$14.95 in FY 2024; Negative OCF, increased by certain fluctuations in operating assets. Consequently, in every year since FY 2020, DDC has not reported a single positive FCF, increasing its long-term debt every year to protect its cash. So, as you can probably guess, much like the former Top Win, DDC Enterprise looks like an easy candidate to turn into a Bitcoin treasury. It raised $33 million in its IPO, but was quickly burning through it in its core business anyway. Where They Are and Where They Want to Go Right now, there are two sources tracking how much BTC DDC has on its books. The first one, from August 25 , notes they picked up another 200 BTC, pushing their total stash to 888 BTC—worth about $98.95 million as of August 28. Since their average price is $107,447, they are up +3.7%. Seeking Alpha Basically, the same press release tells us they have 1,000 shares for 0.106853 BTC. Doing some basic math, we can say that DDC has approximately 8.3 million shares. The second source puts DDC's stash even higher—at 1,008 BTC. That's 120 more than what the last press release mentioned, bringing the total value to about $112.33 million. In this case, the average price per BTC was $103,878, which tells us their position is approximately +7.4%. DDC Enterprise (BitcoinTreasuries.Net) Based on the 8.3 million shares, this second source indicates that DDC has 0.12124 BTC per 1,000 shares. And where do they want to go? According to the CEO, the goal is to reach 5,000 BTC within 36 months. Based on this statement at the end of Q1 FY 2025, DDC intends to reach this goal by mid-FY 2028. Press release (DDC Enterprise) That makes things way simpler—unlike Top Win, we actually know how much BTC they've got and where they're aiming. Right now, DDC sits as the 42nd largest Bitcoin treasury worldwide, and if they push that up to 5,000 BTC, they'd break into the Top 20. BitcoinTreasuries.Net Modeling Some Scenarios for DDC Now that we have our premises on the table: 888/1,008 BTC in treasury today; 5,000 BTC by FY 2028; 8.3 million shares. Currently, DDC has somewhere between 0.000107 and 0.000121 BTC per share today (depending on which source you're looking at). At the current BTC price, we'd be looking at somewhere between $11.95 and $13.50. Essentially, it's trading at no premium to the BTC it owns—or, in the worst-case scenario, at a very small premium. Looking ahead to FY 2028 and estimating dilution of up to 12 million shares (to finance these purchases), we could imagine something close to 0.0004167 BTC per share. If we target BTC at $150,000 three years from now, we'd be talking about $62.50 per share. Applying a 1.5x NAV, this could rise to as high as $93. But remember, we're talking about the future. We need to bring this value into the present. VCs generally use discount rates that vary between 30-50%, and that's what I'll use here: 30% : $32.50; 40% : $24.20; 50% : $18.40. Of course, there are a lot of moving parts here. Beyond the discount rate, we're talking about different BTC price scenarios for FY 2028 ($100K? $200K?), how much dilution they'll need to fund those buys, and even whether they can actually hit that 5,000 BTC mark in the first place. Applying a conservative average between the lower and middle ends of the forecasts for the discount rate, we have a price target of approximately $21.30. Look, that's an upside of 56.6% in three years. It sounds interesting, but honestly, I would prefer to buy BTC directly and self-custody it. That said, my skepticism isn’t about Bitcoin itself—it’s about the company’s long-term strategy.

Investors searching for the best crypto to buy are watching closely as capital rotation flows into MAGACOIN FINANCE , positioning it as one of the strongest opportunities before its presale allocations sell out. Bitcoin Market Update: Holding Strong After Whale-Induced Volatility Bitcoin is currently trading between $111,375 and $112,000 , staging a modest recovery after a severe whale-driven flash crash over the weekend. A massive wallet offloaded 24,000 BTC worth $2.7 billion into the market, causing Bitcoin to tumble from $114,700 to $110,700 within minutes. This liquidation erased $45 billion in crypto market value and triggered $700 million in leveraged liquidations . Despite the panic, Bitcoin bounced back from lows under $109,000 and has gained about 1.14–1.52% in the last 24 hours . Analysts note that the $110,000–$112,000 zone is acting as critical support, with resistance at $113,000 and $116,000. ETF inflows totaling $219 million on August 25 have added fresh momentum, signaling that institutional investors remain confident even in volatile conditions. With a Fear & Greed Index reading of 47 , the market sentiment has cooled from “Greed” to “Neutral”—a zone that historically sets up bullish rebounds. Traders are now eyeing whether Bitcoin can reclaim $113,000 resistance to confirm a recovery trend. BONK Nears Historic Token Burn Amid Corporate Adoption BONK, the Solana-based meme coin, is approaching a 1 million holder milestone that will trigger a 1 trillion token burn valued at $22.81 million . This deflationary event could significantly impact BONK’s tokenomics, reducing circulating supply and potentially boosting long-term value. Currently priced around $0.00002105 , BONK has been volatile—down 32% over the last month and 42% below its all-time high . Yet, corporate adoption has added legitimacy, with Safety Shot Inc. (Nasdaq: SHOT) integrating BONK into a $30 million financing deal. This marks one of the first major corporate treasury moves involving a meme coin. Ecosystem expansion remains strong, with BONK powering platforms like BONK Arena , BONKSOL liquid staking , and validator partnerships. Despite competition from Pump.fun, BONK continues to see institutional accumulation and strategic buybacks that reinforce its position as more than just a meme coin. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Emerging as the Best Crypto to Buy Now While Bitcoin and BONK dominate headlines, the real momentum in presale markets is building around MAGACOIN FINANCE . Positioned as a next-generation DeFi project, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting investors rotating out of volatile assets and into early-stage opportunities with massive upside potential. The project is nearing its last phase of presale, with allocations filling quickly as retail and whale buyers jump in. Investors who profited from Bitcoin’s rebound and BONK’s meme coin wave are now redirecting funds into MAGACOIN FINANCE, fueling presale demand. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out from other projects is its focus on being open and trustworthy. The team has made all development transparent, their smart contract has already passed Hashex.org audit , and the core members are fully KYC-verified. That’s why many investors see it as one of the best crypto to buy right now. The timing couldn’t be better for MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin dominance remains strong at 64% , but investors are diversifying into promising new tokens. BONK’s deflationary burn event highlights how community-driven catalysts can create powerful price action. Against this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a high-upside presale project that many analysts believe could be the best crypto to buy before its public launch. Final Thoughts Bitcoin is holding critical support despite whale-induced volatility, with ETF inflows hinting at resilience. BONK is preparing for a historic 1 trillion token burn while gaining corporate adoption and ecosystem growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing investor attention as presale buyers rush into final allocations, making it one of the best crypto to buy right now. For investors seeking exposure to early-stage growth and presale potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a safe opportunity at the intersection of DeFi innovation, community power, and favorable market conditions.

50896792,569558,1756530036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50896792.jpeg,"The Flippening? Ethereum ETFs Attract $4 Billion This Month, While Bitcoin Products Struggle",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etf-4-billion-month-bitcoin-products/,"Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are set to close August 2025 with total net inflows exceeding $4 billion, significantly outpacing their Bitcoin (BTC) counterparts, which recorded more than $600 million in outflows during the same period. Ethereum ETFs Outshine Bitcoin ETFs According to data from SoSoValue, spot Ethereum ETFs have attracted $4.04 billion in net inflows so far this month. In contrast, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $628 million in net outflows in August. Among Ethereum-focused funds, BlackRock’s ETHA ETF leads the market with $16.88 billion in net assets as of August 28. Grayscale’s ETHE follows with $4.80 billion, while Fidelity’s FETH holds $3.56 billion. The total net assets tied in spot ETH ETFs currently stands slightly above $29.5 billion. This figure represents almost 5.5% of Ethereum’s total market cap. On the Bitcoin side, BlackRock’s IBIT remains the leader with $83.8 billion in net assets, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at $22.45 billion and Grayscale’s GBTC at $20.01 billion. Although BTC ETFs still dominate in overall value, the latest data suggests the gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum investment products is narrowing. If the current momentum continues, August 2025 could mark the month when ETH ETFs outperformed BTC ETFs by their widest margin yet. One of the major factors driving Ethereum ETF inflows is ETH’s growing appeal as a balance sheet asset. Corporate adoption of ETH has accelerated this year, bolstering confidence in its long-term role in institutional portfolios. This year, several notable companies announced plans to add ETH to their balance sheets. For instance, SharpLink Gaming recently doubled down on its ETH bet, adding another 56,533 ETH to enhance its ETH reserves. Similarly, ETHZilla – an Ethereum treasury company – recently increased its total ETH holdings to more than 102,000 ETH. Data from CoinGecko shows that, currently, BitMine is the leading publicly-listed company with the largest ETH reserves – holding over 1.7 million ETH. Will ETH Surge Past $5,000? Institutional sentiment toward ETH continues to strengthen. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck recently described ETH as “the Wall Street token,” highlighting its growing role in enabling stablecoin transfers across financial institutions. Despite its recent rejection from close to $5,000, the overall demand for ETH remains vehemently strong. As a result, ETH reserves on exchange continue to dwindle at a rapid pace, which may lead to quick price appreciation for the digital asset in the near-term.

A single comment from Musk has often been enough to drive sharp price movements in DOGE, making him one of the most influential voices in the crypto industry. This raises an important question: what might happen if Musk were to apply the same level of attention to XRP? The Dogecoin Effect Dogecoin’s history shows the outsized role Musk has played in its valuation. His first public reference to the token came in April 2019, after which its price nearly doubled within three days. Subsequent tweets often produced immediate rallies, with several examples standing out. In December 2020, a short statement from Musk was enough to push DOGE up 20% in a matter of hours. By February 2021, when he referred to it as the “people’s crypto,” the coin gained more than 40% overnight. The peak of his influence came during the spring of 2021, when a tweet suggesting Dogecoin was “barking at the moon” coincided with the token’s surge to its record high of $0.73, representing gains of over 12,000% compared to its price at the start of that year. Musk’s influence extended beyond social media commentary. In January 2022, he announced that Tesla would accept Dogecoin for merchandise, driving another immediate price increase. A year later, in March 2023, his decision to briefly change Twitter’s logo to the Dogecoin mascot sent the coin up by 30% within hours. Even more recently, his involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative in 2024 and its launch in early 2025 gave the coin renewed attention, although the momentum did not last long. Over the same period, XRP has moved much more gradually. In April 2019, XRP was priced around $0.30. Today, it trades near $3.00, a 920% increase. Dogecoin , in comparison, has jumped from about $0.004 to nearly $0.22, a gain of over 5,700%. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What If Musk Promoted XRP? Unlike with Dogecoin, Musk has never directly commented on XRP. However, if he were to begin actively promoting it, the market response could be substantial. To explore this possibility, Google’s Gemini chatbot was asked to calculate potential outcomes. It suggested that if XRP experienced the same percentage increase as Dogecoin during its Musk-fueled rallies, the token could theoretically rise from $3.00 to approximately $175.92. However, Gemini stressed that the figure is hypothetical and should not be treated as a forecast. Cryptocurrency prices are influenced by multiple variables, including regulatory decisions, institutional adoption, and overall market sentiment. For XRP in particular, one key factor has been the resolution of Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has provided greater regulatory clarity for the asset. This clarity may encourage banks and payment providers to expand their use of XRP in cross-border settlements , strengthening its role as a utility-driven token. Combined with broader market dynamics, such as potential rallies in Bitcoin and Ethereum that typically lift other altcoins, XRP could see stronger growth regardless of Musk’s involvement. While Musk’s influence on Dogecoin is undeniable, applying the same trajectory to XRP is highly speculative. Even so, if he were to shift attention toward XRP, the token would likely benefit from increased exposure and retail participation. When combined with its established role in payment systems and improving regulatory position, such a scenario could significantly enhance its market profile.

Tether’s USDT has taken it back after a few months of being fourth, as its own market cap has grown to $167,613,338 on CoinGecko. Recall that XRP skyrocketed to a new all-time high of $3.65 in mid-July after it broke out of its consolidation phase at around $2.2. Since then, though, the asset has failed to maintain its run and has frequently dropped below the crucial $3 support line. The past 24-36 hours were not kind to the entire cryptocurrency market, and XRP was not spared. As BTC dumped to a seven-week low, Ripple’s cross-border token followed suit and slipped to $2.73 for the first time since August 3. Despite recovering some ground to trade at just over $2.8 as of press time, XRP is still 4% down on the day and 6% weekly. Ripple has also lost traction on the global assets’ scale. The company and its token, which had entered the top 100 assets by market cap after the July rally, have now dropped out of that prestigious club and are down to the 121st spot, according to 8marketcap. Although Ripple is still above the likes of Sony, Airbus, Allianz, and Accenture, it has lost positioning to Charles Schwab, BlackRock, and Xiaomi.

A recent announcement from El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) has captured global attention: a groundbreaking move to fortify its national Bitcoin reserves. This strategic shift, known as El Salvador Bitcoin distribution , aims to safeguard the nation’s holdings against potential future threats, specifically from the advancement of quantum computing. This proactive measure highlights El Salvador’s commitment to pioneering secure and resilient crypto adoption on a national scale. Understanding El Salvador’s Strategic Bitcoin Distribution El Salvador, a nation that boldly adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, continues to lead in digital asset innovation. The ONBTC revealed on X that the government is systematically moving its Bitcoin from a single large wallet into numerous smaller ones. This isn’t just a technical adjustment; it’s a critical security upgrade. Each of these new wallets will hold a maximum of 500 BTC. With El Salvador holding approximately 6,227.18 BTC as of August 23, this means their entire reserve will be spread across at least 13 separate wallets (6227.18 / 500 ≈ 12.45). This careful fragmentation is a direct response to an emerging global concern. Why is Quantum Computing a Threat to Bitcoin? You might be wondering, “What exactly is quantum computing, and why does it matter for Bitcoin?” In simple terms, quantum computers are incredibly powerful machines that can perform calculations far beyond the capabilities of today’s traditional computers. While still in early stages, a fully developed quantum computer could theoretically break the cryptographic algorithms that secure Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s security relies on complex mathematical problems that are currently impossible for even the most powerful supercomputers to solve quickly. However, a quantum computer could potentially crack these encryptions, making private keys vulnerable and potentially allowing unauthorized access to funds. This isn’t an immediate threat, but El Salvador is looking ahead. Benefits of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Distribution Strategy This forward-thinking approach by El Salvador offers several significant advantages: Enhanced Security: By distributing its Bitcoin across multiple wallets, El Salvador significantly reduces the risk of a single point of failure. If one wallet were ever compromised (hypothetically, by a quantum attack), the vast majority of their holdings would remain secure in other wallets. Mitigated Quantum Risk: This proactive measure positions El Salvador at the forefront of preparing for quantum threats. It buys time for the development of quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions. Increased Resilience: Spreading assets improves overall system resilience against various types of attacks, not just quantum ones. It makes large-scale theft much more difficult and less appealing. Setting a Precedent: El Salvador’s move could serve as a valuable blueprint for other nations or large institutional holders of Bitcoin, encouraging them to adopt similar robust security practices. This strategic move underscores the nation’s commitment to protecting its digital economy. The El Salvador Bitcoin distribution plan demonstrates a deep understanding of evolving technological landscapes and potential vulnerabilities. What are the Challenges and Considerations? While the benefits are clear, such a large-scale security upgrade isn’t without its considerations: Management Complexity: Managing multiple wallets, each with its own private key, introduces a higher level of administrative complexity. Securely storing and accessing these keys becomes paramount. Operational Overhead: There’s an increased operational overhead associated with monitoring and maintaining numerous wallets compared to a single, consolidated one. Key Management: The secure generation, storage, and backup of many private keys is a critical challenge. Any error could lead to irreversible loss of funds. However, given the stakes, these challenges are manageable with stringent protocols and advanced security practices. El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office is likely implementing sophisticated key management solutions to ensure the integrity of their distributed holdings. El Salvador’s Vision for Future-Proofing Bitcoin El Salvador’s proactive stance on El Salvador Bitcoin distribution is a testament to its long-term vision for Bitcoin adoption. They are not just holding Bitcoin; they are actively working to make it more secure and sustainable for the future. This move signals confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term viability, even in the face of advanced technological threats. This innovative approach to security demonstrates leadership in the global crypto space. It’s a powerful statement that Bitcoin, when managed strategically, can be a secure and reliable asset for national treasuries. The focus on mitigating quantum computing risks positions El Salvador as a thought leader in digital asset security. In conclusion, El Salvador’s decision to distribute its Bitcoin holdings is a groundbreaking security measure designed to protect its national assets from the theoretical future threat of quantum computing. By fragmenting its substantial Bitcoin reserves across numerous wallets, each capped at 500 BTC, the nation is proactively enhancing its digital security posture. This bold and strategic move reinforces El Salvador’s role as a pioneer in national Bitcoin adoption and sets a compelling example for responsible cryptocurrency management in an ever-evolving technological landscape. It’s a powerful demonstration of their unwavering commitment to safeguarding their digital future. Frequently Asked Questions About El Salvador’s Bitcoin Security What is El Salvador doing with its Bitcoin holdings?

Both are leading Layer 1 blockchain projects , each promising faster speeds, lower fees, and massive adoption. As investors seek the best altcoin to buy now, the competition between these two heavyweights is shaping the future of decentralized finance, gaming, and tokenization. At the same time, new players like MAGACOIN FINANCE are quietly drawing attention from whales, with growing speculation it could be a best crypto to buy now contender backed by its strong roadmap and a successful HashEx audit . Avalanche’s Institutional Bet and 2025 Price Potential When it comes to Avalanche, the project has carved out a reputation as a hub for real-world asset tokenization. In fact, industry updates highlight that AVAX is leading the Layer 1 blockchain projects category for institutional adoption. SkyBridge Capital recently tokenized $300 million in hedge funds on Avalanche using the ERC-3643 standard. Even giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are building tokenized investment products on the network. AVAX price analysis by Posty Momentum is already visible, with analyst Posty noting AVAX is “setting up nicely” with higher lows built over the summer. Meanwhile, Lennaert Snyder highlighted that AVAX transactions spiked +74% in the last 7 days , pushing the chain to the top spot in weekly transaction growth. Analysts at Blockchain.News suggest an Avalanche price prediction 2025 in the $40–$50 range if it can break past the $25.99 resistance and maintain its technical strength. For investors looking at the best altcoin to buy now , AVAX’s positioning in real-world finance gives it a strong case. Solana’s Rise and 2025 Breakout Predictions On the other side of the Solana vs Avalanche discussion, Solana is gaining attention for its speed, low fees, and strong community — the “Floki Vikings” and broader SOL supporters have kept the network in the spotlight. The chain is seeing greater developer activity, with decentralized apps, NFTs, and DeFi protocols choosing it for scalability. SOL price analysis by Quinten Market analysts are optimistic too. Quinten noted that “SOL looks very ready for a breakout” and highlighted $225 and $260 as the next key levels to watch. Sensei also pointed out that SOL shows more strength than even BTC and ETH , suggesting money could be rotating into Solana, with a potential target around $250 before considering profit-taking. According to InvestingHaven, the Solana price prediction 2025 places SOL between $255–$480, supported by a developing cup-and-handle chart structure. For many, Solana is looking like a strong candidate for the top altcoins to buy in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A New Challenger for 2025 While Avalanche and Solana dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly catching attention as an under-the-radar play. What’s making whales take notice is the project’s transparent roadmap, clear team details, and its successful HashEx smart-contract audit, which gives credibility to its long-term potential. Analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE could be a sharper bet than crowded Layer-1 plays , with whispers of it being a 40x gainer . Unlike many speculative tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing “smart money” that is diversifying into this project for 2025. For investors hunting the best altcoin to buy now , it’s being considered as a strategic hedge alongside Solana and Avalanche. Final Word: Solana vs Avalanche, or MAGACOIN’s Ascent? The Solana vs Avalanche contest is intensifying. Solana could benefit from an ETF approval wave and institutional treasuries, fueling its bullish Solana price prediction 2025 of up to $480. Avalanche is carving a niche with tokenization, backed by surging activity and an Avalanche price prediction 2025 in the $40–$50 range. Yet, while both remain strong top altcoins to buy 2025 , MAGACOIN FINANCE is building quiet momentum of its own. With whale interest, a transparent foundation, and the security of a HashEx audit, it’s shaping up as one of the best crypto to buy now for investors seeking asymmetric upside.

In 2025, more investors than ever are entering the space to capitalise on higher prices and other new projects. Traders with limited experience may be vulnerable to fraud. Investors must tread carefully; the landscape is littered with fake exchanges and Ponzi schemes that can cost them everything. Learning how to recognize red flags is essential. The cryptocurrency space does not have the same level of regulatory protection as traditional finance. It is nearly impossible to recover stolen funds after they have been taken. That’s why staying informed is your first line of defense. Common Types of Scams Crypto scams often fall into familiar categories. A rug pull is when a project’s developers abandon it while pulling the liquidity. Phishing scams use replicas of emails and websites to fool users into giving away their private key. Groups engage in pump-and-dump schemes, promoting and dumping small coins on strict buyers. People still use fake giveaways that promise free Bitcoin and Ethereum. The good news is, most of these scams have prominent warning signs. If an offer sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Do not trust unrealistic promises of guaranteed returns, teams with no established identity or track record, and projects with no clear roadmap. Why Due Diligence Matters In a market where anyone can launch a token, research is critical before investment. You can learn a great deal about the project by reviewing its whitepaper and social media channels. Scammers cheat a lot, real projects focus on transparency. The search for verifiable partnership through independent audits is another method of identifying opportunities from fraud. One of the Safest Crypto Projects Today Investors are turning to projects with built-in safeguards as scams become more sophisticated. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a prime example of the above in 2025, having garnered the attention of many through its ecosystem. MAGACOIN FINANCE is unlike projects that layer on hype; we are publicly building a sustainable ecosystem. The early estimates predict higher profits for the early supporters. However, what makes this idea different from others is that the early development comes from solid ground, not empty ground. In a market where scams can wipe out portfolios overnight, choosing projects that prioritize security and accountability is one of the smartest moves an investor can make. Conclusion Even though crypto scams take place, it doesn’t mean that crypto isn’t good for you. Thus, by learning the warning signs, performing proper due diligence, and concentrating on trustworthy projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, you can safeguard your investments while also benefiting from the incredible potential of 2025.

50899594,https://thecoinrise.com/beyond-hype-how-blockdags-386m-presale-puts-monero-and-avalanche-in-the-rearview-for-2025/,1756533603,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/50899594.jpeg,Beyond Hype: How BlockDAG’s $386M Presale Puts Monero and Avalanche in the Rearview for 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/beyond-hype-how-blockdags-386m-presale-puts-monero-and-avalanche-in-the-rearview-for-2025/,"Crypto markets thrive on momentum, and right now three names are pulling focus: Monero (XMR), Avalanche (AVAX), and BlockDAG (BDAG). Each represents a different force driving the market: Monero through its privacy-first model, Avalanche via institutional capital flows, and BlockDAG (BDAG) with one of the largest presales of 2025. Monero is pushing against major resistance levels that could spark a breakout. Avalanche has captured Wall Street’s imagination with a $300 million allocation, cementing its status as a serious Layer-1 contender. Yet it is BlockDAG’s staggering presale achievements,$386 million raised, 25.6 billion tokens sold, and a 2,900% ROI since batch one, that are defining the current presale conversation. With its mining products, live dashboard, and confirmed listings, BlockDAG has become the name traders can’t afford to overlook. Monero (XMR) Price Action: Privacy Coin in Focus Monero continues to command attention as it consolidates near the $262 level, with critical resistance zones waiting at $315 and $421. Analysts believe a push above these levels could ignite a fresh rally, cementing its reputation as the dominant privacy coin in an era of growing regulatory scrutiny. What makes Monero’s story compelling is its resilience. Despite pressure from regulators and exchanges, its decentralized model and dedicated community support have kept demand steady. Traders know that while oversight may intensify, Monero’s niche, financial privacy, remains a unique value proposition that other tokens cannot easily replicate. Technical charts suggest the $262 level is pivotal. A breakout could see momentum carry the price toward $315 quickly, adding fuel to speculative buzz. Failure to hold, however, risks pushing Monero back into consolidation, frustrating those betting on immediate action. For now, Monero remains a high-stakes watch for market participants drawn to volatility and utility in equal measure. Avalanche (AVAX) News: Wall Street Confidence Sparks Excitement Avalanche has surged into headlines after SkyBridge announced a massive $300 million allocation into its ecosystem. This bold move has been interpreted as a vote of confidence from traditional finance, a sign that Wall Street sees long-term value in Avalanche’s scalability and DeFi ecosystem. The news has fueled speculation that AVAX could push toward $50 in 2025. Analysts argue that Avalanche’s expanding developer activity and strong community of builders set the foundation for sustained growth. With its sub-second transaction speeds and interoperability, it remains one of the most credible Layer-1 competitors in the space. Still, maintaining momentum won’t be easy. Avalanche must balance its institutional endorsements with the unpredictable nature of crypto markets. For traders, however, the mix of technical strength and Wall Street backing makes AVAX one of the most exciting tokens to track heading into the new year. BlockDAG (BDAG): The Presale That Changed the Conversation While Monero and Avalanche generate steady buzz, BlockDAG has flipped the narrative around presales. With $386 million raised, batch 30 tokens priced at $0.03, and more than 25.6 billion sold, BDAG has turned heads with scale and speed unmatched by its peers. Early backers from batch one at $0.001 are sitting on 2,900% gains before launch. Unlike many presales that rely only on promises, BlockDAG has delivered tangible progress throughout its fundraising journey. Its presale dashboard offers live updates, wallet tracking, and gamified leaderboards, creating a transparent and engaging user experience that feels more like a live exchange than a typical presale page. BlockDAG has also rolled out real mining products. The X1 app miner and X10 hardware miner allow participants to generate up to 200 BDAG per day. With $7.8M in sales across 19,500 units, these tools prove the project is already building a working ecosystem. This combination of mining utility and presale transparency is rare in early-stage crypto. Looking ahead, confirmed listings on around twenty centralized exchanges ensure strong liquidity and accessibility from day one. For a project still in presale, this level of preparation puts BlockDAG in a league of its own. Community features like Buyer Battles, which reward the day’s top buyer with unsold allocations, add gamification that keeps engagement high. Combined with educational efforts through BlockDAG Academy, the project is building not just hype but infrastructure that fosters growth and loyalty. With a listing price target of $0.05, analysts speculate BlockDAG could climb toward $1 if adoption continues to accelerate. Wrap-Up Monero is holding strong as privacy demand collides with technical setups, while Avalanche has earned the attention of institutional giants. Both are important pieces of the broader market puzzle. But BlockDAG is rewriting presale expectations altogether. With $386M raised, 25.6B tokens sold, a 2,900% ROI already achieved, $7.8M in miner sales, and batch 30 priced at $0.03, it is more than a speculative token; it’s an ecosystem in motion. Where Monero thrives on niche utility and Avalanche banks on institutional adoption, BlockDAG thrives on transparency, live tools, mining products, and unmatched presale traction. For those scanning the market for the next breakout story, BlockDAG has already claimed the spotlight, and the speculation is only heating up.

According to CoinGlass, 24-hour crypto liquidations neared $540 million as selling pressure intensified on major exchanges. Related Reading: A New Vision For Money: Hoskinson Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $10 Trillion Whales And Exchange Distribution Pressure Based on reports from market watchers, heavy selling by large holders helped push the drop. Distribution on Binance was highlighted by traders as a key factor that worsened losses. Bitcoin lost nearly 5% on the day, and some large accounts were linked to the wave of sales that triggered stop orders and quick exits. Popular trader Daan Crypto Trades pointed to a “key reversal zone” around recent ranges and consolidation levels. Some experts had similar price levels on his radar, noting that Bitcoin failed to turn $112,000 into support. Other voices in the market flagged $114,000 as an important weekly close threshold for bulls. Bullish RSI Divergence Keeps A Sliver Of Hope Technical watchers found one bright spot. According to crypto commentator Javon Marks, the four-hour chart still shows a bullish RSI divergence — a pattern where the RSI makes higher lows while price makes lower lows. That setup can hint at an early reversal. $BTC Good area to keep watching. Right on top of the previous range & consolidation area. https://t.co/WEaG2IF6nV pic.twitter.com/Y7RftSqDio — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) August 29, 2025 Marks argued Bitcoin could stage a rebound. He suggested a move back toward $123,000 is possible, which would be roughly a +14% jump from current levels. That projection is optimistic, and it rests on momentum flipping quickly in favor of buyers. Macro Data, Seasonal Weakness Add Headwinds Seasonality and macroeconomic data added pressure. September has historically been one of Bitcoin’s weaker months, and investors were watching US inflation readings closely. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, matched expectations and showed signs of an inflation rebound. Still, the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool showed markets pricing in rate cuts in September, a factor that could help risk assets like crypto if it holds.

If Bitcoin can reclaim $112,000 and hold a weekly close above $114,000, bulls would gain breathing room. If those levels fail, more downside is possible and short-term traders could face further liquidations. For now, the market looks tight. Some technical signals point to a rebound, but macro data and big sellers are keeping the mood cautious. Traders and investors alike are watching both price action and economic prints closely as the US heads toward key data and the Fed decision window on Sept. 17.

Technical indicators, whale activity, and ETF-driven inflows are combining to push valuations higher as the final quarter of the year approaches. Ethereum and Solana remain central to institutional strategies, but a fast-rising presale — MAGACOIN FINANCE — is starting to dominate conversations around breakout opportunities. Alongside Aptos, Dogecoin, Hyperliquid, and Cardano, these seven tokens represent the most-watched altcoins this month. Ethereum (ETH) — Institutional Cornerstone Ethereum continues to anchor the market as the largest smart contract blockchain, with its market capitalization surpassing $380 billion. Analysts forecast ETH trading between $4,545 and $5,319 in September, with technicals tilting bullish after strong ETF inflows through Q3. The network’s expansion is being supported by Layer-2 scaling, which is lowering fees and boosting throughput. Billions remain locked in DeFi, and Ethereum’s role as the backbone for tokenized assets and stablecoin settlement has only grown. While its upside is less explosive than smaller altcoins, ETH remains the preferred long-term hold for funds seeking a combination of liquidity, adoption, and institutional credibility. Solana (SOL) — Scalability and ETF Tailwinds Solana has continued to prove itself as the fastest-growing Layer-1 ecosystem, regularly processing 100,000+ transactions per second at negligible cost. Its developer migration trend has strengthened, with major DeFi and NFT projects opting to build on Solana for speed and scale. SOL is currently consolidating around $181, with analysts pointing to a potential breakout above $186 that could drive momentum toward $200. Institutional confidence is rising as Solana ETFs attract inflows, underscoring the blockchain’s position as one of the most scalable platforms for the next cycle of growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE (Presale) — A Verified Breakout Candidate This month’s top analyst picks include the usual leaders, but attention is also shifting toward a hidden presale that is capturing outsized inflows. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being recognized as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 , with forecasts of up to 700x returns driving rapid demand from early investors. Unlike many meme-driven tokens, MAGACOIN has emphasized legitimacy from the outset. The project has undergone independent audits and built a fast-growing community that now rivals established altcoins in scale and reach. These steps have strengthened confidence that the presale is not just speculative hype but a structured effort with staying power. Backed by whale participation and retail enthusiasm, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the presale to watch this September. Analysts highlight its ability to combine meme-energy appeal with verified transparency, creating a rare mix of credibility and high-upside potential. Aptos (APT) — Layer-1 Challenger Aptos continues to attract attention as a next-generation Layer-1 blockchain with a focus on speed and DeFi applications. The token is trading near $11, with resistance forming around $12.50. Developer growth remains steady, particularly in DeFi, where Aptos is gaining traction as an alternative to Solana and Ethereum. While not expected to deliver parabolic gains in September, analysts see Aptos as a slow-burn play with strong long-term potential for adoption. Dogecoin (DOGE) — Meme Energy Revival Dogecoin has stabilized around $0.21, with bullish targets set near $0.28. Renewed meme activity across social platforms and consistent liquidity inflows have helped DOGE recapture attention heading into September. While its value remains tied to retail energy rather than fundamentals, analysts note that Dogecoin continues to prove resilient as a cultural asset. Its large user base and brand recognition keep it a recurring candidate for speculative rallies. Hyperliquid — Exchange-Focused Growth Hyperliquid has been cited by analysts as one of the boldest bets for September. Positioned as a derivatives-driven exchange ecosystem, it is attracting attention for innovative approaches to trading infrastructure. Although highly speculative, its appeal lies in the potential to disrupt a crowded exchange-token market. For investors seeking high risk and high reward, Hyperliquid offers asymmetric upside. Cardano — The Disruptive Entrant Cardano is another altcoin project appearing in analyst lists this month. Marketed as a disruptive entrant with a focus on liquidity mechanics and launch innovation, it is being positioned as a dark horse alongside MAGACOIN FINANCE. The Charles Hoskinson-led project has gained visibility among investors searching for the next major early-stage play. Like others, its risk profile is moderate, but so is the potential upside if adoption accelerates. Conclusion — Leaders and Breakouts Ethereum and Solana remain the core of September’s altcoin lineup, offering stability, scale, and institutional trust. Aptos, Dogecoin, and Hyperliquid add depth for investors seeking alternative plays across memes, DeFi, and exchanges. But the strongest attention is turning toward presales — with MAGACOIN FINANCE leading as an audited and fast-growing crypto project positioned for outsized returns. The asset represents the most speculative but potentially most rewarding category of September’s best altcoins to buy.

While the token has attracted a mass following, current market trends project that investor attention has started shifting to projects offering more practical solutions. Remittix (RTX) is one such project, a payments-focused project which is emerging as a best crypto presale 2025 winner. Pepe Coin Price Action In The Spotlight Pepe Coin’s price is $0.000059829, a decline of 2.9% in the last 24 hours. It has a market capitalization of $4.13 billion and 24-hour trading volume of $531.16 million, down by 5.14%. These figures indicate ongoing volatility and demonstrate how susceptible meme coins are to changing sentiment. As Pepe Coin news continues to dominate headlines, many traders are thinking about whether or not speculative assets can deliver long-term returns. This has spurred debate on the next 100x crypto and has brought attention to early stage crypto investment opportunities with real-world use cases. Milestone Unlocks Wider Market Access Remittix (RTX) is priced at $0.1000 per token and has already secured over $22.2 million in its ongoing presale, with over 630 million tokens sold so far. Reaching the $20 million milestone led to the announcement of its initial centralized exchange (CEX) listing on BitMart. A second listing was subsequently announced on LBank, further expanding liquidity and investor accessibility. This steady growth puts Remittix among the best crypto to invest in today for those who are keeping an eye on upcoming crypto ventures. Contrary to meme coins, RTX combines long-term tokenomics with usability, which appeals to investors looking for more than fleeting hype. Wallet Beta Launch And Real-World Utility The biggest milestone can be the beta launch of the Remittix wallet in Q3 2025. It’s a mobile-led product that supports over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies, direct crypto-to-bank transfers and instant FX conversion. With its focus on low gas fees and frictionless cross-border payments, Remittix is building infrastructure that is targeted at resolving one of the largest problems in global finance. The wallet will simplify how freelancers, remitters and businesses make transactions, making RTX a low cap crypto gem that solves real-world problems. With security strengthened by a CertiK audit, Remittix is being recognized as the best DeFi altcoin 2025 that combines innovation with trust. The Catalysts Accelerating Remittix’s Traction: Over $22.3 million raised and 630 million+ tokens sold Initial CEX listing on BitMart announced, followed by a second announced on LBank Wallet beta launch secured for Q3 2025 $250,000 Remittix Giveaway driving community growth In light of Pepe Coin headlines focusing on risk and volatility linked with meme coins, smart funds are increasingly gravitating towards projects like Remittix aimed at practical application.

In his most recent market briefing, Pal described the digital asset space as a sequence of staggered rallies, with each token moving at different points in the cycle. XRP’s Current Position in the Market According to Pal, Ethereum has already transitioned into its expansion phase, while Solana and Sui are next in line. He believes XRP has also begun shifting out of consolidation, despite showing a 3.98% decline in August 2025. The token had previously gained more than 35% in July, a performance he sees as the early stage of a larger upward movement. His assessment follows Bitcoin’s climb to a record high above $124,000 before a pullback that redirected market interest toward altcoins. Historically, this type of rotation, where profits from Bitcoin are redistributed into other tokens, has fueled altcoin rallies. Pal expects XRP to be one of the primary beneficiaries of the current phase.

The analysis highlights a recurring pattern in which long periods of sideways movement within wedge or triangle formations precede significant price advances. The first major example occurred between 2014 and early 2017, when XRP remained compressed inside a large descending triangle before breaking out and reaching $3.30 in January 2018. Following that rally, the token corrected for several years, forming a falling wedge that concluded in late 2020. The breakout from that pattern pushed XRP to nearly $2 in April 2021. From 2021 to late 2024, XRP entered another extended consolidation phase within a descending triangle. A breakout in November 2024 drove the token above key resistance levels at $1, $2, and $3. Currently, XRP is trading just under $3, forming a narrower triangular pattern. Analysts note that this structure resembles a pennant, which in technical terms often indicates the continuation of an existing trend. A confirmed breakout could validate Pal’s view of an ongoing upward move, while a breakdown might send the token back toward the $1.70–$2.00 range. Broader Market and Liquidity Conditions Beyond XRP, Pal emphasized that global liquidity trends play a critical role in shaping crypto cycles. He pointed to the strong relationship between Bitcoin and the growth of the global money supply, specifically the M2 metric. Historically , Bitcoin tends to rise about twelve weeks after liquidity expands, with capital eventually flowing into other digital assets such as XRP.

This process requires continued liquidity support from central banks, creating favorable conditions for risk assets, such as cryptocurrencies. Combined with improving regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and sovereign-level interest in digital assets, he believes the current environment is similar to the 2017 altcoin rally. Pal’s research at Global Macro Investor suggests that the present bull market may extend into the first half of 2026. He argues that slower global economic growth will likely force policymakers to maintain accommodative policies, prolonging the flow of capital into speculative markets. He maintains that the acceleration phase of this cycle began in mid-2024 and expects it to intensify in the coming quarters, with XRP well-positioned to benefit from the shift.

Data from whale trackers shows that large holders of both ADA and XRP are diversifying into a rising altcoin, Remittix (RTX) , signaling confidence in its growth potential and real-world utility. Cardano Newest Updates Signal a Big Rebound Cardano updates show ADA trading around $0.821. The community remains optimistic, expecting Cardano to pass its 2021 all-time high of $3.10. Some even expect the token to maybe even reach $4 by the end of the year. Mintern highlighted this hopeful outlook in an August 28 tweet, emphasizing ADA’s potential for new growth. Analysts point to strong technical formations, including an ascending wedge and a retest above the $1 mark, which could support a move toward $1.50–$1.60 before breaking the old ATH of $3.09. Cardano newest updates suggest that the recent price decline is temporary, and momentum is likely to return soon, but this doesn’t stop investors from looking into Remittix. source: GoneLiminal on TradingView XRP Latest News Indicates Potential Breakout Turning to XRP latest news, XRP is trading at around $2.87. Market strategist Raoul Pal described the crypto market as a “waiting room,” noting that assets are preparing for staged growth. XRP has experienced a 3.98% dip this month, following a 35% rally in July 2025. Analysts argue that XRP is now entering a “full port” phase, signaling a continuation of its breakout into higher levels. According to technical analysis, XRP is in its fifth wave, forming a weekly bull flag. If resistance holds, XRP could surge to $5.50. Conversely, a failure to maintain structure may see prices return toward the $1.7–$2 support zone.

He further posed the question of whether this could mark the beginning of other Japanese companies similarly entering XRP markets. According to the official statement attached to the tweet, the decision forms part of the company’s broader growth strategy for its blockchain business. Gumi specified that the XRP ecosystem plays a central role in remittance and liquidity network strategies that are being advanced by SBI Holdings. The company emphasized that this purchase is linked to revenue growth opportunities in the blockchain sector, which it views as a key area for business development going forward. BREAKING: JAPANESE GAMING COMPANY CONFIRMS THEY WILL PURCHASE 2.5 BILLION YEN WORTH OF $XRP ! IS THIS THE BEGINNING OF JAPANESE COMAPNIES BUYING XRP? Comment Below & Follow For More!! pic.twitter.com/R6djLeWE2p — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) August 29, 2025 Reactions from the XRP Community The post also included comments from X users who gave their perspectives on the development. One user, Eden dna, addressed the amount directly and criticized others for minimizing its relevance, stating : “I can’t believe that people in the comments saying it’s only 17m lmao this is a company in Japan that no one of y’all heard about buying 17fknm …. y’all trippin.” This response underscored the idea that while the purchase might appear modest in U.S. dollar terms, it still represents a notable move for a Japanese gaming company. Another user, Niflhel, placed the news in the context of broader trends across Asia, commenting : “We’ve seen this trend building in Asia, where efficiency trumps hype. XRP’s chart is screaming breakout potential, and moves like this from corporates signal the shift from speculation to real utility.” This interpretation suggested that the purchase could reflect a wider corporate alignment toward digital asset use cases beyond speculation, particularly in markets where remittance and liquidity efficiencies are increasingly important. Strategic Significance for Blockchain Growth The information shared by Abs indicates that Gumi’s decision is structured and deliberately framed within its blockchain strategy and connected to existing financial network developments in Japan through SBI Holdings . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The size of the purchase, set at 2.5 billion yen, represents approximately 17 million U.S. dollars, and positions the company among Japanese corporations making direct allocations into digital assets with defined business goals. Whether this development signals the beginning of further corporate adoption in Japan remains to be seen. However, the official announcement, together with the framing provided by Abs, positions Gumi’s move as both a strategic purchase and a potential indicator of how Japanese companies may begin to engage with the XRP ecosystem in line with their blockchain and financial technology ambitions.

This capital rotation has sparked speculations around where the next big opportunities could emerge from. Analysts have spotlighted crypto presales as the next goldmine for retail investors. In that conversation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the name coming up, with many calling it one of the b , based on its credibility and potential. Ethereum Traders Seek Early Opportunities Ethereum has been steady between $4,400 and $4,600, climbing 17% over the past month. Analysts forecast further upside to $5,300 by late September, driven by staking inflows and institutional accumulation. Long-term predictions stretch even higher, with calls for $7,000–$8,000 in 2026 and beyond. Despite short-term corrections, Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong. This has many ETH holders searching for early-stage projects where smaller allocations could outperform. That’s where presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE enter the conversation. Solana Investors Rotate Into Presales Meanwhile, Solana is trading close to $188–$190, recovering from support near $160. With ETF filings pending and whale accumulation increasing, analysts expect SOL could retest the $200–$220 zone soon. Futures open interest on CME has surged, signaling heightened institutional engagement. Still, retail traders are hunting diversification. Many Solana wallets are allocating into presales, aiming for higher multiples than mature assets can deliver. This has led to growing crossover interest in MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential best altcoin to buy during this cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: How to Buy Into the Presale The influx of Ethereum and Solana traders into MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught the attention of the entire crypto market. Data shows that many investors and enthusiasts are tracking projects, and newer investors are looking for a way to get in. The momentum around the project is not surprising.

Buying MAGACOIN FINANCE is straightforward: Set up a compatible crypto wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Fund the wallet with ETH or SOL through a trusted exchange. Visit the official MAGACOIN FINANCE website and connect your wallet. Swap ETH or SOL directly for MAGA tokens in the presale interface. Early investors can still take advantage of a limited-time offer of a 50% EXTRA bonus by using the code PATRIOT50X. The window of opportunity is fast closing, and only those who act early will benefit from MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum. Why Analysts Call It a Standout With ETH and SOL traders already rotating capital into the project, analysts suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could become a breakout contender in 2025—making it one of the best crypto presales to buy now for investors who prioritize both growth and legitimacy.

This isn’t just another memecoin; it’s Layer Brett (LBRETT), a bold new contender swiftly closing the gap on established giants, forcing a re-evaluation of every Cardano (ADA) price prediction out there and its crypto presale is live right now. What makes Layer Brett a standout Layer 2 crypto? The crypto world often feels like a crowded marketplace, doesn’t it? But what if something truly different emerged? Ethereum’s Layer 1, while robust, often grinds to a halt under heavy traffic, making transactions painfully slow and expensive. Layer Brett, however, bypasses these bottlenecks. Consider Pepe coin (PEPE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), or Bonk (BONK) —fun, sure, but often lacking deep utility. Even Brett (original) on Base suffered from this. Layer Brett changes the game, offering a DeFi ecosystem designed for performance. This ERC-20 token is purpose-built to escape the limitations of utility-free meme tokens, offering a next big crypto experience that merges the best of meme culture with genuine technological advancement. Why investors are looking towards LBRETT after disappointing Cardano price predictions For years, Cardano (ADA) has been a staple in many portfolios, boasting a significant market cap of $30.00 billion. Partnerships, such as the one with Serpro in Brazil, show Cardano’s commitment to real-world adoption. Yet, even with these advancements, Cardano price sits at $0.8576, a far cry from its all-time high of $3.10 back in 2021. This moderate Cardano news and incremental Cardano upgrade progress leaves some investors longing for more immediate, explosive growth. Enter Layer Brett, a genuine low cap crypto gem. While Cardano battles for incremental gains in a mature market, Layer Brett’s crypto presale price of just $0.005 per token presents a stark contrast in growth potential. Investors are seeing the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a trending cryptocurrency before it potentially explodes in the crypto bull run 2025. Unpacking Layer Brett’s killer features and staking rewards Layer Brett isn’t just talking the talk; it walks with purpose. This Ethereum Layer 2 project boasts several compelling value propositions that set it apart. Built on Layer 2 Ethereum: Enjoy blazing-fast, secure transactions with near-zero fees. This is the ultimate escape from congested chains. Presale Access: Dive into the crypto presale now at early-entry pricing, positioning yourself for potential next 100x altcoin gains. The project has already raised over $9 million. Staking Benefits: Early buyers can earn incredible rewards, with an APY of 1,490% in the initial stages. Urgency is key, as these rates decline as more participants join. This is serious staking crypto. Memecoin Energy, Real Utility: Unlike traditional meme tokens, Layer Brett is tech-backed, offering a unique blend of fun and function. The transparent tokenomics, with a fixed supply of 10 billion LBRETT tokens, are designed for community empowerment. You can easily buy and stake Layer Brett in seconds using ETH, USDT, or BNB via MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Plus, there’s even a $1 million giveaway to participate in, adding another layer of excitement. Layer Brett aims to rival established Layer 2s like Optimism and Arbitrum, but with a community-first approach and a meme-born identity. Explosive Growth starts with Utility Memecoin Energy The opportunity for explosive growth with Layer Brett, compared to the steady but perhaps slower trajectory of ADA, is undeniable. Layer Brett is still in its presale stages —but time is running out. Closer to $2 million has already been invested early doors. Don’t miss your chance to secure an early stake in this scalable meme token project designed to reshape Web3 utility. Get involved now, before the window closes! Get in now to stake, earn massive rewards , and ride what could be the most scalable meme project ever to launch on Ethereum Layer 2.

A recent landmark case highlights these dangers, sending a stark warning about crypto lender fraud and accountability. Former executives of the bankrupt crypto lending firm Cred have now faced the music, receiving significant prison sentences for their deceptive practices. What Exactly Happened at Cred, the Crypto Lender? The former CEO and CFO of Cred, a once-promising crypto lending platform, have been handed substantial prison sentences. These sentences – 52 months for the CEO and 36 months for the CFO – stem from serious fraud charges. They admitted to deliberately misleading investors, painting a rosy picture of the company’s health while concealing its true financial distress. This case serves as a critical example of crypto lender fraud and its devastating impact on trust. The executives intentionally downplayed and concealed the company’s financial situation, selectively providing only positive information to investors. This deceptive strategy ultimately led to Cred’s downfall and significant losses for its users. The Dire Consequences of Financial Deception This sentencing underscores the severe repercussions awaiting those who engage in financial deceit within the crypto space. The executives’ actions led to immense losses for countless investors who trusted Cred with their digital assets. Such cases erode confidence in the broader crypto lending ecosystem. Investors deserve transparency and honesty, especially when their hard-earned money is at stake. The justice system’s firm response in this instance sends a clear message: accountability is paramount. It highlights the importance of ethical conduct and the legal ramifications for those who exploit investor trust through crypto lender fraud . Protecting Yourself from Crypto Lender Fraud: Actionable Insights Given the risks highlighted by the Cred case, how can you safeguard your investments and avoid falling victim to crypto lender fraud ? Prudent due diligence is not just advisable; it is essential. Consider these key steps: Research Thoroughly: Always investigate the background of any crypto lending platform. Look for transparent financial reporting, regulatory compliance, and a clear track record. Understand the Risks: Crypto lending involves inherent risks, including market volatility and potential platform insolvency. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your digital assets into a single lending platform. Spreading your investments can mitigate risk. Look for Red Flags: Be wary of promises of unusually high returns, opaque business models, or executives with questionable pasts. Seek Independent Advice: Consult with financial advisors who specialize in digital assets before making significant investment decisions. A Broader Look: The Future of Crypto Lending After Fraud Cases The Cred scandal, alongside other high-profile collapses in the crypto industry, forces a critical examination of the future of crypto lending. Regulators worldwide are intensifying their scrutiny, aiming to establish clearer frameworks to protect investors. This increased oversight, while sometimes seen as a hindrance, is ultimately crucial for fostering a safer and more sustainable environment for legitimate crypto lending operations. The industry must learn from instances of crypto lender fraud and prioritize robust security and transparency. By doing so, it can rebuild trust and ensure a more secure future for digital asset lending. This evolution is vital for the long-term health and credibility of the entire cryptocurrency market. The prison sentences for Cred’s former CEO and CFO serve as a powerful reminder of the real-world consequences of financial deception in the crypto sphere. This landmark case reinforces the importance of ethical leadership and stringent investor protection. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, vigilance, transparency, and accountability will remain the cornerstones of a healthy and trustworthy ecosystem. Let this be a lesson for all involved: integrity is non-negotiable. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What was Cred?

Egrag Crypto States Two Things to Expect Next,https://timestabloid.com/is-xrp-price-crashing-so-hard-egrag-crypto-states-two-things-to-expect-next/,"XRP has faced another notable decline , with its current trading level near $2.82 raising concerns among market participants. With the asset currently falling, EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) has weighed in on its performance, suggesting the bearish pressure could continue and send XRP below lower support levels. He shared an intriguing chart that shows XRP’s potential trajectory. The chart initially appears to reinforce the community’s concerns, as the downward movement suggests persistent bearish pressure. The repeated tests of support and the proximity to lower channel boundaries would normally imply that further losses remain likely. However, a closer look at EGRAG CRYPTO’s chart challenges this straightforward interpretation, presenting a different view of the trend structure and revealing his true feelings about the asset’s future. #XRP – Is It Crashing So Hard? It looks like #XRP is experiencing a significant downturn, and the trend may continue as we head toward the green circles on the chart. What to Expect: Continued Decline: If the current momentum persists, we could see further drops … pic.twitter.com/sIjai12kWV — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 29, 2025 Interpreting the Channel Patterns The chart shows multiple parallel zones, colored in green, that at first glance resemble descending channels. Closer examination reveals that the chart is inverted, and the alignment of these channels is upward, not downward, which significantly changes the implications. Rather than a prolonged bear structure, the chart outlines a series of ascending channels that project higher future valuations for XRP. The repeated touches near the bottom levels reflect stability rather than deterioration, setting the groundwork for eventual movement toward much higher targets. XRP Projected Price Levels The highlighted green circles mark specific levels where EGRAG CRYPTO expects XRP could rise in the future. The most immediate target identified on the chart is $7. From the current price of $2.82, this represents an increase of approximately 148%. The next significant level is near $11, which would mark an advance of roughly 290% from today’s market position. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Beyond these, the highest target highlighted on the chart is $27, a target EGRAG CRYPTO has reiterated consistently . This represents a potential climb of 857% for the digital asset, showing the magnitude of the targets being considered, and positioning XRP as a candidate for substantial future growth should the structure hold. EGRAG CRYPTO’s chart delivers a counterintuitive but structured perspective on XRP’s trajectory. Although the short-term price action has been difficult, the longer-term view presented here outlines a potential for significant appreciation . With targets ranging from $7 to $27, the analysis suggests that current levels may represent a foundation for growth rather than an end to bullish momentum.

August closed with record-breaking on-chain activity as decentralized exchange (DEX) volume soared to $135B, transactions hit 48M, and active addresses climbed to 15M. Total value locked (TVL) also smashed through the $240B mark, according to Ethereum sets on-chain activity records In August, DEX volume hit $135B, while transactions reached 48M and active addresses hit 15M.

Now, the network is finally catching up to its valuation with user activity and capital pouring in. Institutional ETH Purchases Hit New Highs Big players are moving in. Corporate treasuries added a total of 247,033 ETH this past week alone, per [CoinGecko]. Institutional ETH Purchases A total of 247,033 $ETH was added to corporate treasuries over the past week. Here's the roundup: pic.twitter.com/zxz6cl7mEP — CoinGecko (@coingecko) August 29, 2025 The buying spree follows Ethereum’s rally to an all-time high of $4,946.05 on August 24. BitMine Leads with Massive ETH Buy BitMine topped the charts, scooping up 190,500 ETH as prices peaked. The purchase pushed its total holdings to 1.7M ETH, valued at roughly $7.7B. That’s more than double the second-largest corporate holder. The company’s aggressive buying signals long-term conviction even at elevated prices. SharpLink Expands Treasury with $252M Purchase Next up, SharpLink added 56,533 ETH at an average price of $4,462, spending $252.2M in a single move. The firm’s treasury now holds 797,704 ETH worth about $3.6B, cementing its position among Ethereum’s biggest institutional backers. ETHZilla Discloses $451M ETH Position ETHZilla joined the wave, revealing ownership of 102,237 ETH valued at $451.5M. Alongside the disclosure, the firm launched a $250M stock buyback program effective immediately. The plan runs through June 30, 2025, or until the full allocation is used up—whichever comes first. Ethereum Network Momentum Builds The record-breaking month signals a shift for Ethereum. For much of 2024, rising prices were driven by ETF demand rather than organic network activity. That trend seems to be reversing as August numbers show both price strength and real on-chain growth. With DEX volumes surging, addresses multiplying, and institutional wallets filling up, Ethereum appears to be entering a new phase of adoption. Data Snapshot DEX Volume (August): $135B Transactions: 48M Active Addresses: 15M TVL: $240B+ BitMine Holdings: 1.7M ETH ($7.7B) SharpLink Holdings: 797,704 ETH ($3.6B) ETHZilla Holdings: 102,237 ETH ($451.5M) If institutional inflows continue and on-chain metrics stay hot, Ethereum could maintain its momentum into Q4. The convergence of price action, user growth, and corporate adoption makes the case for sustained bullish sentiment. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

With its market capitalization slipping to $7.21 billion and 24-hour trading volume down by over 12%, the bearish trend has many Shiba Inu investors looking for alternatives. As a result, some early Shiba Inu holders are finding refuge in Remittix , which has quickly gained momentum as a leading PayFi project bridging the gap between crypto and traditional financial systems. Shiba Inu Faces Multiple Challenges: Will Price Finally Breakdown? The recent price action of Shiba Inu reflects mounting concerns within its ecosystem. SHIB’s daily burn rate collapsed by nearly 99%, leading to a loss in its deflationary appeal. Additionally, Shiba Inu’s network activity fell by 22%, with daily transactions dropping to 3.65 million. The liquidation of $111,840 worth of long positions in a single hour only added fuel to the bearish fire, triggering panic selling across the market. The Shiba Inu price technicals suggest continued weakness. The MACD histogram turned negative and the RSI at 39 shows the asset is under significant bearish pressure. Why Early Shiba Inu Holders Are Shifting Toward Remittix On a brighter side, early Shiba Inu holders are finding new hope in Remittix , which is seeing impressive growth. Priced at $0.1000, with over $22,3 million raised and 630 million tokens sold, Remittix is gaining significant traction in the crypto space. The project’s focus on PayFi, bridging crypto and fiat for seamless global transactions, makes it stand out from many other speculative assets in the market. Investors are gravitating toward Remittix not just for its tokenomics, but because it addresses a $19 trillion global payments gap. By offering fast, transparent and cost-effective cross-border payment solutions, Remittix has captured the attention of both retail and institutional investors. Why Remittix Could Be The Best Investment This Year Real-World Utility: Send crypto and have it settle as fiat directly into bank accounts across 30+ countries. Product Progress: Wallet beta launching in September, showing immediate use cases for users. Merchant & Freelancer Integration: API allowing businesses to accept crypto payments and settle in fiat. Security & Transparency: CertiK audit completed, liquidity locked for 3 years and governance shifting to the community. Exchange Listings: First CEX listing secured on BitMart, with a second listing now confirmed after crossing the $22M milestone. The Road Ahead: Why Remittix Is Gaining Momentum The challenges Shiba Inu faces have prompted some investors to reconsider their positions, especially as Remittix gains ground with a clear utility-driven model. As global financial systems continue to evolve and blockchain solutions become more widely adopted, Remittix has the potential to become a major player in the payments sector.

Meanwhile, Dogecoin is flashing bullish signals that could spark a Q4 breakout, providing traders with another reason to keep an eye on the meme coin market. With missed opportunities from past rallies fresh in investors’ minds, the scarcity narrative and FOMO are stronger than ever. Ethereum Whales Rotate Capital into New Opportunities Ethereum is experiencing a strong wave of institutional inflows. Daily flows into ETH have surged to around $900 million, matching Bitcoin’s pace, driven largely by corporate treasuries and spot ETH ETFs. BitMine has led this charge, amassing 1.7 million ETH valued at nearly $8 billion in just two months, giving it 1.4% of the total supply, while spot ETH funds pulled in $2.8 billion in August alone. This accumulation has boosted Ethereum’s momentum, with analysts forecasting a potential rally toward $6,800–$7,000 after breaking a long-term bullish pattern. Notably, Ethereum’s market dominance has risen to 14.57%, doubling since April, as Bitcoin’s share fell from 66% to 58%. But this capital rotation isn’t just staying in ETH. It’s spilling over into promising presales. Analysts note that many Ethereum whales are now accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE , drawn by its capped supply model, zero-tax trading, and strong community buzz. MAGACOIN FINANCE Builds Hype as the Top Presale of 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the most attention in the crypto market as the presale everyone is watching. The project has quickly gained momentum thanks to its whale-backed accumulation, capped supply, and zero-tax trading mechanics, which create scarcity and transparency for early investors. Verified audits and secure smart contracts further enhance confidence, making MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out in a market crowded with short-lived meme coins. Analysts are projecting returns of up to 40x, noting that the combination of strong community engagement, cultural relevance, and technical safeguards could sustain the token’s growth well beyond the presale stage. Investors are already feeling FOMO, rushing to secure allocations before the next surge , with early backers potentially reaping outsized gains. Dogecoin Flashes Signs of a Q4 Breakout Dogecoin, still trading around the $0.20 mark, has captured trader attention with a fresh TD Sequential buy signal and a bullish cup-and-handle formation. Analysts suggest these setups could point to higher targets, with some projections reaching as high as $2.18 if momentum builds. Historically, Dogecoin’s Q3 and Q4 trends have been volatile, with several years of drawdowns. However, 2025 has broken the cycle, with DOGE already up nearly 29% this quarter. As traders look for fast-moving plays to ride into the year’s final stretch, Dogecoin’s resilience and meme coin energy are fueling optimism for another leg up. Conclusion The crypto market is once again proving that timing is everything. Ethereum whales are positioning themselves early in MAGACOIN FINANCE, Dogecoin is flashing bullish patterns, and the broader meme coin space is heating up for Q4. For investors who missed past cycles, analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could have a 40X return in this bull cycle, presenting a rare second chance.

The lawsuit , filed in May 2025, had alleged that Strategy had deceived investors about its financial health and the effect of new accounting standards. Plaintiffs accused the firm of overstating the advantages of adopting a fair-value accounting standard that allowed the company to list its Bitcoin holdings on its books at its market price, which it adjusted quarterly. The case has been a focal point for critics of Strategy’s unorthodox betting style, with some investors saying publicly that the firm’s public statements falsely indicated an overly optimistic picture of profitability and downplayed the risks tied to its volatile assets. The company had been sued for unspecified damages because it failed to adequately disclose the risks of the toxic assets and properly warn shareholders about the possibility of losses . The decision to drop the suit represents a major legal victory for Strategy. The dismissal, which is filed with prejudice, prohibits those same claims from being filed again in court. For Strategy, which has staked its identity on its enormous bet on Bitcoin, the decision reflects its ability to hold to a business model that is mostly scorned but still a cause of pitched rhetorical division on Wall Street. Strategy case withdrawn with prejudice, blocking any refiling Previously, Bitcoin was valued only at its trade price. That meant Strategy would record losses when prices fell, but couldn’t recognize gains unless it sold its tokens. Supporters of the new accounting rule argued it offered a clearer snapshot of the company’s balance sheet, while critics said it painted an overly optimistic picture of profitability. By the first quarter of 2025, just six months after Bitcoin’s bull rebound, shareholders were furious as Strategy reported a staggering $4.22 billion net loss. The results bear the dark side of fair-value accounting, where unrealized gains can quickly flip into massive paper losses. The lawsuit also accused Strategy’s executives of engaging in “lucrative insider sales” of company stock while its value was “artificially inflated” before the accounting changes became public. In addition, the firm’s executives were accused of abusing their authority, gross mismanagement, and squandering corporate assets. On Thursday, however, investors abruptly dropped the lawsuit. The dismissal was with prejudice, barring any refiling of the claims. Even Strategy’s own legal team was puzzled by the move. The outcome grants the company a reprieve as it contends with intensifying investor and regulatory scrutiny. Strategy expands Bitcoin holdings to 632,457 BTC worth $70B As recently reported by Cryptopolitan Strategy, disclosed on Monday, it had purchased an additional 3,081 BTC for $356.9 million. This was acquired at an average price of $115,829 per coin, according to a Form 8-K filing with the SEC. The acquisition boosts the company’s holdings to roughly 632,457 BTC, further solidifying its position as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Strategy now sits on about $70 billion worth of BTC at current prices, purchased at an average of $$73,527 per BTC for a total cost of roughly $46.50 billion, including fees. This leaves the B itcoin treasury company with about $23.5 billion in unrealized gains. The firm’s recent purchases were funded with proceeds from its at-the-market offering programs. From Aug. 18 to Aug. 24, the firm sold 875,301 MSTR shares under its Common ATM for about $309.9 million in net proceeds. Additionally, it offloaded 210,100 shares of its 8.00% Series A Perpetual Strike preferred (STRK) for $20.4 million. It also sold 237,336 shares of its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Strife preferred (STRF) for $26.6 million net, and 944 shares of its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride preferred (STRD) for $0.1 million. Still, the Bitcoin treasury company accounting has emerged as an area of dispute. Fair-value standards enable Strategy to reflect Bitcoin’s minute-by-minute peaks and troughs in value. The firm is also exposed to wild price swings that can wreak havoc on quarterly earnings. That sharply distinguishes Strategy’s Bitcoin-backed wealth from its reported net income.

This institutional impetus follows the wider market recovery, as Bitcoin recovered over $110,000 following an abrupt decline. Traders are also hunting the best altcoins that have good applications in the real world. Emerging Defi projects that facilitate instant global transactions between crypto and fiat are gaining favor, offering practical value in a landscape dominated by speculative assets. Solana’s Billion-Dollar Momentum: Institutional Bets and Price Surge Recent Solana news shows major firms like Galaxy, Jump and Multicoin targeting $1 billion for SOL acquisitions, signaling deep faith in Solana’s ecosystem for DeFi and NFTs. This follows Solana’s robust on-chain activity, with over 10 million daily transactions reported earlier in August. As of today, Solana Price stands at approximately $214, up 5% in the past 24 hours, with support near $200 and resistance around $220 amid increased trading volume. There is a bullish potential in Solana Price predictions as analysts predict a growth to $500 by early 2026 should the rally continue. Short-term targets eye $300 by year-end , driven by ETF approvals and adoption, though dips to $180 remain possible without continued inflows.

Mutuum Finance stage 6 of presale is now ongoing at the price of $0.035. All the investors who acquire this token today have a chance of growing their investments at least 500% within a short time span. Mutuum Finance presale has already amassed over $15.15 million of capital and over 15800 token holders. The shift comes amid growing changes on SHIB’s market activity and the broader meme coin sector, as traders weigh whether this trading lull signals consolidation or fading interest. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is drawing eyes with its innovative approach to lending, hinting at a potential reshaping of investor priorities in a market often dominated by volatility and speculation. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price & Volume Update, Neutral Overview Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00001230, experiencing a 3.66% decline over the past day while its 24-hour trading volume has surged to over $359 million, a notable increase. Despite this volume spike, technical indicators suggest a cautious short-term outlook: the RSI remains below 50 and the MACD shows no bullish crossover, indicating continued selling pressure. These dynamics point to weaker momentum for SHIB, even as narratives around emerging DeFi alternatives like Mutuum Finance begin to draw investor attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stage 6 Presale Mutuum Finance is already a rapidly growing behemoth in the DeFi market and has achieved that by onboarding over 15,800 investors as well as having recorded a presale of over $15.15 million. The project is currently at Stage 6 of Presale selling tokens at $0.035 per MUTM. The stage offers early birds a huge profit window where they are presented with a chance to buy in prior to the token breaking higher in subsequent stages. $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program Consistent with an open infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is launching a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. It defines four categories of risk in relation to reward program-related risk for support of community testing and security support: critical, major, minor, and low. With security experts and white-hat hackers on the board, Mutuum places its platform at the forefront of any risk around it as being impenetrable and invincible. Massive Community Incentive, $100,000 Giveback Apart from cementing its vision to establish a healthy, growing, and sustainable community, Mutuum Finance has also introduced a $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners will get $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, and it also offers early birds and new investors a chance to be part of the project. Two-model strategy is adopted by Mutuum Finance for initiating flexibility and efficiency through Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models. Peer-to-Contract is introducing autonomous smart contracts which will lend with no sort of human intervention. These will be run on changing rates of the market but always a fixed rate of interest on prevailing demands and supplies. Middlemen have no role in the Peer-to-Peer model and lenders approach borrowers directly. Peer-to-Peer model suits well for meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to outpace expectations with over $15.15 million raised and more than 15,800 investors onboarded by Stage 6 at $0.035 per token. Backed by a robust dual lending model, a $50,000 bug bounty for security assurance, and a $100,000 community giveaway, the project is shaping up as a standout in the DeFi sector. With remaining presale stages expected to move quickly, now is the time to secure your allocation before the next price increase.

Indeed, the speculations follow a surge in ETH accumulations, with transactions running into nearly a billion dollars. Recently, nine whale addresses collectively bought about $457 million in ETH. At the same time, another large investor added $2.55 billion and staked it in one move. Overall, nearly $800 million has been added by top investors, underlining strong institutional conviction. Alongside Ethereum, an emerging altcoin—MAGACOIN FINANCE—also experienced a swell in whale accumulation, with many calling it the best altcoin to buy now in 2025 . What the Accumulation Means for 2025 Large-scale buying during corrections often signals confidence in future growth. Analysts say these Ethereum whale purchases align with forecasts that ETH could reach $5,300 by September and even $7,000–$8,000 in 2026. Long-term projections stretch as high as $15,000 by 2030, assuming steady blockchain upgrades and regulatory clarity. This level of accumulation is fueling talk that altcoin season may already be forming. With ETFs drawing billions into ETH and DeFi activity expanding, institutions appear to be signaling that Ethereum remains the best altcoin to buy now. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts See Emerging Altcoin Opportunity Alongside Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the altcoins to have seen a surge in whale interest in the ongoing market cycle. The project—tipped as one of the best altcoins to buy ahead of the next bull cycle—continues to see increased demand and investors’ attention. Notably, the bulk of the attention around MAGACOIN FINANCE comes from its full audit status and compliant ecosystem. While investors are often weary around crypto presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE has earned a reputation as the exception. At the same time, predictions are going through the roof. Analysts estimate an upside of 50x should current momentum be sustained. For investors scanning for breakout potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the project you should be looking at. Final Takeaway As cryptocurrency investors strategically position themselves, conversations around the altcoin season are gaining more prominence. The ETH whale accumulations have further fueled the speculations. While most investors focus on Ethereum, attention has turned to MAGACOIN FINANCE as a breakout altcoin. For those asking what’s the best altcoin to buy now, Ethereum remains the anchor—but emerging players like MAGACOIN FINANCE are quickly standing out for their momentum, demand frenzy, and long-term potential.

Wedson argued that compared to past cycles, the returns on investment (ROI) of leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) have been declining to lower levels each year. “With each cycle, the 1-year ROI rate for BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA, and DOGE shrinks. These major cryptocurrencies no longer provide the huge profits they used to,” Wedson said, adding that it is becoming increasingly difficult to amass large fortunes with small capital. Related News: $5 Billion Bitcoin Whale Makes New Move: But This Time, It Didn't Buy BTC According to the analyst, investors are only likely to achieve high returns by taking positions in new projects at an early stage: “The chances of getting truly rich are limited to new projects where you can get average buy-in close to the launch price. But that's a complex process in itself.” However, let us remind you that the volatility risk of small projects is very high and may result in the loss of the entire investment, including the principal. Wedson also stated that increasing leverage ratios in stock exchanges negatively impacted the market, saying, “Leveraged transactions cause losses to many investors and drain liquidity from the market.” Recalling that in the past, 2-3 cryptocurrencies could generate 10 to 100 times profit, the analyst stated that today this ratio is between 1.5 and 6 times at best: “The chances of getting rich decrease with each cycle.” Wedson also highlighted sentiment and search trends on social media, saying, “Google searches have hit their recent local peak. When everyone's excited, whales are selling.” *This is not investment advice.

According to insights from popular online cryptocurrency analyst TradingShot, Bitcoin has struggled to regain momentum, with every rally attempt being sold off, and the price slipping below the 50-day moving average ( MA ). The setup mirrors the same sequence that unfolded four years ago when BTC entered a major downturn, the analyst noted in a TradingView post on August 29. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView In both 2021 and 2025, the analysis shows lower highs followed by lower lows. The market then found support after a one-day death cross, alongside a bullish RSI divergence that marked the short-term bottom. Bitcoin rebounded, breaking above the MA50 and MA200 before forming a bull flag after a golden cross. That rally ultimately ended with a double top, marking the peak of the cycle. Today, TradingShot highlighted a similar setup, with August’s higher high mirroring the 2021 pattern. At the same time, the RSI trendlines also align, reinforcing the bearish fractal. If history repeats, Bitcoin could be on the verge of a bear cycle that erases much of this year’s gains. With the price now testing support at the MA50, losing this level may trigger a deeper correction, as it did in 2021. Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was hovering below the $110,000 mark, with concerns about potential extended losses in the coming days. The asset was trading at $108,234, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, while on the weekly chart, the leading digital currency has dropped more than 3%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

BTC is trading below its 50-day SMA of $116,462, indicating short-term bearish pressure, but remains well above the 200-day SMA of $95,666, suggesting that the broader uptrend remains intact. On the other hand, the 14-day RSI at 37.76 indicates that Bitcoin is approaching oversold conditions, suggesting that selling momentum may be easing and a potential rebound could follow if buying pressure strengthens.

However, one powerful indicator that offers a clear glimpse into trader sentiment is the BTC Long/Short Ratio . This metric provides invaluable insight into how professional traders are positioning themselves on Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts across major exchanges. Are they betting on a price surge or preparing for a dip? Let’s dive into the latest data to uncover these crucial market trends. What Does the BTC Long/Short Ratio Reveal? The BTC Long/Short Ratio essentially compares the number of traders holding long positions (betting on a price increase) against those holding short positions (betting on a price decrease) on perpetual futures contracts. When the ratio is high, it suggests a bullish sentiment, with more traders expecting prices to rise. Conversely, a low ratio indicates a bearish outlook, as more traders anticipate a fall. This ratio is particularly significant because perpetual futures are a popular instrument for both speculation and hedging in the crypto space. Monitoring these positions on top exchanges helps us gauge the collective market mood and potential future price movements. It’s a real-time snapshot of the market’s conviction. A Snapshot of Current BTC Long/Short Ratio on Top Exchanges Over the past 24 hours, the overall BTC Long/Short Ratio across the world’s top three cryptocurrency futures exchanges by open interest shows a slight bearish lean. Here’s the breakdown: Overall: Long 48.72% / Short 51.28% Let’s examine the individual contributions from the leading platforms: Binance: Long 48.53% / Short 51.47% Gate.io: Long 49.97% / Short 50.03% Bybit: Long 47.62% / Short 52.38% These figures indicate that, collectively, more traders are currently holding short positions than long positions on these prominent exchanges. This suggests a cautious, if not slightly pessimistic, sentiment prevailing in the Bitcoin futures market. Why is the BTC Long/Short Ratio Important for Traders? For savvy traders, the BTC Long/Short Ratio is more than just a number; it’s a powerful tool for strategic decision-making. Here are some key benefits: Gauging Sentiment: It offers an immediate understanding of whether the majority of leveraged traders are bullish or bearish. Identifying Potential Reversals: Extreme ratios (very high or very low) can sometimes signal an impending price reversal. If too many traders are long, a ‘long squeeze’ might occur, leading to a sharp price drop. The opposite can happen with a ‘short squeeze.’ Confirming Trends: A rising ratio during an uptrend can confirm bullish momentum, while a falling ratio during a downtrend reinforces bearish pressure. However, it is crucial to remember that this ratio is just one piece of the puzzle. It should always be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools to form a comprehensive trading strategy. Interpreting the Data: What Do These Numbers Mean for Your Strategy? Looking at the current data, where shorts slightly outweigh longs, several interpretations are possible. A majority short position, as seen in the overall BTC Long/Short Ratio , could suggest traders are bracing for further downside or are hedging existing spot positions. This might lead to increased volatility if the market moves against the majority, potentially triggering short squeezes if prices unexpectedly rise. Conversely, if the market continues to dip, these short positions could be further validated. Traders should observe how these ratios evolve. A rapid shift could indicate a change in sentiment, providing early signals for potential market movements. For instance, if Bybit’s ratio, currently the most bearish, starts to equalize or flip, it could signal a broader shift in market expectations. In conclusion, the BTC Long/Short Ratio serves as a vital barometer for understanding the collective mood of leveraged traders in the Bitcoin market. While the current data suggests a slight bearish bias across top exchanges like Binance, Gate.io, and Bybit, it’s essential to monitor these figures continuously. This powerful metric, when combined with other analytical tools, empowers traders to make more informed decisions, navigate market volatility, and potentially capitalize on shifts in sentiment. Stay informed, stay strategic! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the BTC Long/Short Ratio? The BTC Long/Short Ratio is a metric that compares the number of long positions (bets on price increase) to short positions (bets on price decrease) on Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts. 2. How is the BTC Long/Short Ratio calculated? It is calculated by dividing the total number of long positions by the total number of short positions on a given exchange or across multiple exchanges. 3. What does a high BTC Long/Short Ratio indicate? A high ratio typically indicates a bullish sentiment, meaning more traders are expecting Bitcoin’s price to rise. 4. What does a low BTC Long/Short Ratio indicate? A low ratio generally indicates a bearish sentiment, suggesting more traders are anticipating a drop in Bitcoin’s price. 5. Which exchanges are included in this analysis? This analysis specifically includes data from Binance, Gate.io, and Bybit, which are among the world’s top cryptocurrency futures exchanges by open interest. 6. Can the BTC Long/Short Ratio predict price movements? While it’s a strong indicator of market sentiment and can signal potential reversals or trend confirmations, the BTC Long/Short Ratio should be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools for more accurate predictions.

According to the country, the step was taken as part of a strategic initiative to enhance security and long-term custody of the National Strategic Bitcoin reserves. The development was revealed by the official Bitcoin Office of El Salvador on the blogging platform X. The country noted in the post that the redistribution will serve as a precaution against potential quantum computing threats. “Once funds are spent from an address, its public keys are revealed and vulnerable. By splitting funds into smaller amounts, the impact of a potential quantum attack is minimized,” the Bitcoin Office said on X. El Salvador announces plans to split its Bitcoin into new wallets According to El Salvador, quantum computers, in theory, can break public-private key cryptography using Shor’s algorithm. The cryptography serves many other systems, including banking, email, and communication. “When a Bitcoin transaction is signed and broadcast, the public key becomes visible on the blockchain, potentially exposing the address to quantum attacks that could discover private keys and redirect funds before the transaction confirms,” the Bitcoin Office added . The reserve is now being redistributed into multiple addresses, with each holding about 500 BTC. This way, El Salvador limits funds in each address that may potentially be exposed to quantum threats. The country had previously used a single address for transparency, exposing its wallet’s public keys continuously, which meant giving any quantum attacker the needed time to discover its private keys. However, the country is expected to use a public dashboard managed by The Bitcoin Office to monitor multiple addresses, allowing the reserve to maintain transparency without reusing addresses and increasing security. According to records, more than 6 million BTC, which is worth around $650 billion in today’s market, could be at risk if quantum computers become powerful enough to crack elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) keys, according to quantum research firm Project Eleven. El Salvador has always held its 6,274 BTC (presently worth around $678 million) in a single wallet, but has diversified them into 14 new addresses. Crypto experts dispel quantum computing threats While industry experts have hailed the recent moves undertaken by El Salvador, Project Eleven mentioned in its April report that quantum computing is still very far from gaining the capability to hack Bitcoin. A Bitcoin private key contains 256-bits, and as presently no quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm has gained the capability to crack a 3-bit key yet. Michael Saylor, the architect behind Strategy’s move towards Bitcoin, also dismissed the threat, noting in June that the quantum computing threat to the leading digital asset is mere hype. He added that if it ever became an issue worth devoting attention to, the protocol’s core developers and hardware creators will implement fixes for it. “The answer is: Bitcoin network hardware upgrade, Bitcoin network software upgrade, just like [how] Microsoft, Google, the US government upgrade,” he said. Meanwhile, El Salvador remains embroiled in its drama with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after the body released a report in July claiming the country has not purchased any new Bitcoin since February. The report raised eyebrows, with commentators in the crypto space questioning El Salvador’s reports of Bitcoin purchases since February. El Salvador’s Bitcoin office has yet to directly address the IMF report, only taking to X to post about the Bitcoin purchases made by the country. El Salvador secured a $1.4 billion funding deal from the IMF last December in exchange for reducing its Bitcoin initiatives. While the country agreed to the major terms proposed by the body, some other terms were reportedly disputed between the parties. One of the conditions that was gladly accepted is the use of Bitcoin as legal tender, allowing people to voluntarily accept it instead of enforcing the use of the asset through its Chivo wallet.

While Hedera continues to gain traction, Remittix has quickly become one of the hottest names in crypto, raising over $22,3 million through the sale of more than 630 million tokens at just $0.1000. With its first CEX listing on BitMart and a second listing with LBank confirmed, the project is gaining serious momentum. Hedera’s Latest Developments Source: TradingView Enterprise adoption has made Hedera one of the most discussed blockchain projects. Tech giants such as Google have supported its hashgraph technology due to its speed, security and environmental- friendly nature. More recently, SWIFT has been experimenting with blockchain solutions through Hedera and Grayscale has also launched an HBAR investment vehicle, indicating an increase in institutional trust. The Hedera token is consolidating around $0.24 after doubling from earlier lows. Analysts like Steph Is Crypto suggest that Hedera is forming a wave structure that could mirror the explosive 2021 rally. With strong liquidity and a market cap above $10 billion, Hedera price action is at a decisive point. A break above resistance could confirm a new bullish cycle for HBAR holders. Why Remittix Is The Altcoin With 50x Potential While Hedera focuses on enterprise blockchain, Remittix is breaking ground in PayFi by connecting crypto directly to banking systems. It’s already positioned as one of the top crypto altcoins to buy now, with experts suggesting it could rise over 50x before January. At $0.1000, early investors see RTX as a chance to get in before mainstream adoption accelerates. Key Growth Drivers For Remittix Real Banking Connections: Transfers crypto into 30+ countries’ bank accounts in seconds. Payment-Focused Utility: Not just speculation — solving real problems in global remittances. Strong Exchange Presence: BitMart live and LBank listing confirmed, ensuring global liquidity. Community Incentives: Staking, referral rewards and exclusive early benefits motivate adoption. Institutional-Grade Security: CertiK audit is done, increasing investor confidence. Hedera And Remittix: Two Paths, One Clear Winner The Hedera network is making strides with partnerships and institutional support, but Remittix offers a direct consumer solution with exponential upside. The Cardano and Ethereum early days showed how quickly altcoins with utility can explode and RTX is showing those same signs today. For investors asking which token could deliver 50x gains before January, the answer may not be Hedera, it is definitely Remittix.

In the tweet, he referenced a significant development involving Japan’s Gumi Inc., a company expanding its blockchain strategy through XRP. Gumi Inc. has made a major announcement that could put a large number of tokens to good use. EGRAG CRYPTO, one of the top analysts in the crypto space, is bullish due to this announcement, suggesting it could have massive implications for XRP and its ecosystem. ………… And You Wonder Why I am So #Bullish https://t.co/AkPwv1jTw1 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 29, 2025 Gumi Inc.’s Strategic Move The development in question involves Tokyo-based Gumi Inc., which confirmed that it will acquire ¥2.5 billion worth of XRP, which translates to around $17 million, and has excited the XRP army. According to Gumi, the purpose of this purchase is to accelerate blockchain growth and expand its digital business operations. The plan will be executed over several months, starting in September 2025 and continuing until February 2026. This investment represents more than a speculative buy. Earlier in 2025, Gumi added Bitcoin to its balance sheet, citing its role as a store of value . With XRP, the company’s focus is different. It seeks to use the digital asset for payments and liquidity solutions. This aligns closely with XRP’s established reputation as a token suited for international remittances and cross-border financial infrastructure. Gumi’s largest shareholder, SBI Holdings, already has strong ties to Ripple . This makes the move into XRP consistent with broader corporate strategies in Japan, where financial firms are working to implement blockchain solutions in traditional markets. Why the Development Matters The significance of Gumi’s XRP acquisition lies in its deliberate strategy. By incorporating XRP for financial utility, the company is pursuing a treasury approach, adding to the growing list of Treasury programs involving XRP, and strengthening its presence in blockchain adoption. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Gumi also plans to report quarterly on its digital asset holdings, including gains or losses, which shows the transparency of its approach. This decision also highlights institutional momentum for XRP, especially in Asia. Considering the value of this development, EGRAG CRYPTO has a good reason to be bullish. For years, Ripple and XRP have maintained a strong presence in Japan through partnerships and financial initiatives. With Gumi’s entry into the XRP ecosystem, the level of corporate support appears to be broadening further, and this growth could aid XRP’s price trajectory.

In his post, Leader Alpha emphasized the significance of Philion’s outlook for the XRP ecosystem, noting that he anticipates the possibility of up to 5 billion XRP being minted on Flare Networks by 2026. According to Leader Alpha, such a scale would require institutional-grade decentralized finance (DeFi) and is comparable to the volume of XRP Ripple currently maintains in its hot wallet. If realized, this level of integration could strengthen XRP’s standing as one of the most widely utilized digital assets in institutional DeFi. Hugo anticipates a possible 5,000,000,000 $XRP minted on @FlareNetworks in 2026 This is only possible with institutional defi and also is about the same amount of #XRP that #Ripple has in its hot wallet pic.twitter.com/X4yM8OD9M8 — Leader Alpha (@LeaderAlphaNews) August 29, 2025 The Interview with Hugo Philion During the discussion, Paul Barron asked Philion about expectations for XRP activity within DeFi for the remainder of the year. Philion responded cautiously, pointing out that market conditions remain uncertain in the short term. However, he stated, “I mean I’d like to see flair at five billion XRP by mid-2026.” While he did not provide a specific projection for the final months of 2025, his target for 2026 underlined the potential scale of Flare’s role in the XRP ecosystem . His remarks positioned Flare as a platform that could host an unprecedented amount of XRP within a decentralized environment. Flare’s Role in Expanding XRP Utility Flare Networks is designed to enhance the capabilities of XRP and other tokens by enabling them to interact with smart contracts and decentralized applications. By integrating with Flare, XRP can be used more flexibly across DeFi platforms, which historically has been a limitation due to its lack of native smart contract functionality. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This integration provides liquidity opportunities, cross-chain applications, and the ability to engage in decentralized lending and trading. The potential for billions of XRP to circulate within Flare illustrates the growing recognition of institutional DeFi. If achieved, such a milestone would reflect broader adoption beyond retail use, signaling that major players are ready to engage with XRP in decentralized markets. For XRP, this could mark a shift from being viewed primarily as a settlement asset toward being a key foundation in DeFi infrastructure. Flare’s products are designed to put billions of XRP to work . With Ripple’s ongoing push to expand use cases for XRP through partnerships and tokenization projects, Flare’s ability to attract significant amounts of XRP into its ecosystem could accelerate the asset’s adoption.

While established giants like XRP continue to prove their mettle, commanding impressive market caps near $177 billion and hitting new all-time highs of $3.67 back in July, a fresh contender is making waves, aiming for a different kind of dominance. Meet Layer Brett (LBRETT), the new Ethereum Layer 2 solution that’s combining viral meme culture with actual, tangible blockchain utility. This isn’t just another flavor of the month meme token. Analysts are whispering about potential 100x gains, and its presale is absolutely flying . Layer Brett (LBRETT): Where meme meets mechanism Brett, the character, was always stuck on Base, without much purpose. Now, he’s charting his own course, breaking those chains on Layer 2. Layer Brett isn’t just riding the coattails of meme fame; it’s leveraging Ethereum Layer 2 technology to deliver something genuinely useful. Traditional memecoins like Pepe and Shiba Inu, while fun, often struggle with slow transactions and sky-high gas fees, especially on congested Layer 1 networks. Not Layer Brett. It’s built for speed, ultra-low costs, and serious scalability. Transactions? Near-instant. Gas fees? Pennies. This is the future of meme tokens. What makes LBRETT stand out from the crowd? Built on Layer 2 Ethereum: High-speed, low-cost, and scalable. This is the most secure smart contract blockchain in crypto. Early Staking Benefits: Fancy earning an APY of 1,490%? Early buyers of LBRETT can stake right away for massive rewards. But hurry, that figure dips as more people jump in. Memecoin Energy, Real Utility: Unlike Dogecoin or the original Brett, Layer Brett isn’t just about the hype. It’s tech-backed with plans for a full ecosystem. Low Entry Price: Get in on the presale for just $0.005 per token. This is early access, folks. Close to $2 million has been invested in a matter of a few weeks. Ripple (XRP) News vs. the next big crypto Sure, Ripple (XRP) has proven its staying power, with consistent top-5 rankings and robust trading volumes topping $6 billion daily. That’s solid. But Layer Brett offers something different, a blank canvas with explosive growth potential. Ethereum Layer 2 solutions are projected to process over $10 trillion annually by 2027. Layer Brett is designed to capture a significant chunk of that growth, offering an escape from the sluggish, expensive confines of Layer 1. Imagine a world where your crypto experience isn’t bogged down by fees. That’s Layer Brett’s promise. Users can buy and stake LBRETT in seconds with ETH, USDT, or BNB using MetaMask or Trust Wallet. It’s that simple. Forget the complicated setup; this project values user experience. Layer Brett’s transparent tokenomics, with a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens and 25% allocated to staking, prioritize community rewards. This isn’t just another crypto pumping now; it’s a thoughtfully designed ecosystem ready for a bull run. Why Layer Brett is the new top gainer crypto This project isn’t just competing with established Layer 2s like Optimism, Arbitrum, or zkSync. It’s offering a fresh, community-first approach, blending the fun of a meme-born project with legitimate blockchain scaling. The old Brett couldn’t evolve; Layer Brett is here to lead. It’s a unique blend of fun and function, promising to be the next 100x altcoin in the crypto bull run of 2025. Layer Brett is still in its presale stages , but is selling out fast. Don’t miss this chance to get in early on a project combining meme power with real speed and true utility. Head over now and stake your claim for those potentially insane APYs before the opportunity fades. Get in now to stake, earn massive rewards , and ride what could be the most scalable meme project ever to launch on Ethereum Layer 2.

On Saturday, XRP traded around the low-$3 band, with intraday swings typical of late-cycle summer liquidity. Fresh catalysts—from the SEC lawsuit finally ending to possible rule changes that could fast-track crypto ETFs—have traders asking a simple question: where does the XRP price go next? Recent whale accumulation and rising payment-rail adoption add fuel to the debate, even as skeptics warn of resistance just above the round-number zone. XRP price today: snapshot and context At press time, XRP price hovered near $2.83–$2.85 , with recent prints showing repeated tests of the $3 area during August. That keeps XRP within a tight band below multi-year highs and well above its 2024 average. For reference, XRP’s all-time high sits in the mid-$3 range from the 2017–18 cycle. Why this matters: sustained closes above the $3.00–$3.10 zone would put bulls within striking distance of prior cycle peaks and reset the momentum narrative into Q4. What’s moving the XRP price right now 1) Legal clarity (finally). In early August, the SEC formally concluded its lawsuit against Ripple , cementing the split decision first outlined by Judge Torres: some institutional sales violated securities law, but programmatic exchange sales did not. Ripple will pay a civil penalty (~$125M), and the market is treating the end of appeals as a line-in-the-sand moment for regulatory overhang. 2) ETF tailwinds (rules, not rumors). U.S. exchanges have proposed generic listing standards for crypto ETPs, which—if approved—could streamline future listings beyond Bitcoin and Ether. Analysts view these rule changes (expected as soon as late September) as the practical path for products tied to assets like XRP , even if “ XRP ETF ” headlines are still speculative. Rule-level clarity often shrinks risk premiums and can boost volumes. 3) On-chain and positioning. Whale wallets holding 1M+ XRP hit all-time highs in July, a sign of persistent accumulation during summer volatility. Historically, rising large-holder concentration into resistance can either power a breakout or set up a sharp shakeout if late longs over-leverage. 4) Real-world rails. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL, now integrated within Ripple Payments) keeps expanding, offering near-instant FX settlement without pre-funded nostro accounts. This enterprise utility is a core long-term pillar for the XRP price narrative. Key technical zones to watch Immediate resistance: ~$3.00–$3.10. A decisive daily close above could open a path toward mid-$3s. Near support: ~$2.60–$2.80. Buyers defended this zone several times in August; a break risks a deeper retest of the mid-$2s. All-time high reference: ~$3.84 from the 2018 peak; reclaiming and holding above prior highs would mark a structural regime change for XRP. XRP price forecast: scenarios for 2025–26 Base case (range with higher lows). With the lawsuit closed and ETF plumbing progressing, the XRP price base case is a wider range where higher lows grind upward into year-end. Think frequent tests of $3–$3.30, punctuated by news-driven spikes. In this path, spot volumes rise as U.S. compliance comfort slowly returns. (Drivers: rule approvals, exchange relistings, continued bank/payment integrations.) Bull case (breakout on flows). If generic ETP standards are adopted promptly and one or more XRP-themed products advance, passive flows could push the XRP price through $3.50 and into prior-high territory. Pair that with sustained whale accumulation and stronger fiat-to-crypto corridors through Ripple partners, and retests of the old ATH become realistic—not guaranteed. Bear case (policy or liquidity shock). A slower-than-expected regulatory timeline, macro risk-off, or exchange-specific liquidity issues could see XRP revisit the mid-$2s. In that environment, leverage washouts often overshoot before mean-reverting—risk management matters. What about the “$5 by October” calls? A widely shared piece this week highlighted analyst calls for $5 after XRP reclaimed $3, while also promoting a new Ethereum-based token. These headlines are part of a familiar cycle near resistance: bold targets + presale marketing. Treat them as sentiment indicators, not as a base case. As always, verify source quality and note any press-release disclaimers. Fundamentals that could sustain a higher XRP price Regulatory endgame clarity: With the SEC matter closed, U.S. institutions face fewer headline risks when offering XRP exposure or payment rails—though compliance teams will still track distribution restrictions tied to institutional sales. Enterprise adoption: ODL/Ripple Payments can reduce pre-funding and settlement friction—key for corridors with expensive FX, a macro tailwind that’s independent of retail hype. Network effects: As more PSPs and fintechs join Ripple’s stack, liquidity improves, spreads tighten, and XRP price discovery becomes more efficient—vital if ETF vehicles later broaden access. Practical strategy notes (not financial advice) Respect the levels. $3.00–$3.10 has behaved like a magnet in August. Breakouts that stick typically come with rising spot + derivatives open interest and no blow-out funding. YCharts Watch flows and headlines. The next meaningful policy headline is the SEC’s decision on generic ETP listing standards . Even rule proposals can spark knee-jerk moves across large-cap alts. Separate signal from marketing. Articles that combine XRP price targets with presale promotions deserve extra skepticism; look for disclosures and weigh against neutral data (whales, volume, breadth). FAQs: fast answers for searchers Q1) What is the XRP price right now? At last update, XRP price was hovering near $2.83 with intraday volatility around the $3 mark through late August. Always check a live feed for the latest tick. Q2) What is XRP’s all-time high? XRP’s ATH is cited around $3.84 from the 2018 bull cycle. That level remains the key longer-term upside marker for technicians. Q3) Is the SEC case over—and what did the court say? Yes. The SEC vs. Ripple case concluded in August 2025 with a civil penalty and an injunction related to institutional sales; importantly, the court confirmed that programmatic exchange sales of XRP are not securities under U.S. law. Q4) Could an XRP ETF boost price? If U.S. exchanges secure generic crypto ETP listing standards , the path for new funds—including potential XRP-linked products—would be smoother. That could increase access and liquidity, which historically supports price discovery. Timing and approvals remain uncertain. Bottom line: The XRP price sits at a pivotal juncture: legal uncertainty has faded, whales accumulated on the way up, and ETF plumbing may be about to modernize. A clean break and hold above ~$3.10 would strengthen the case for a run at prior highs; failure there keeps the range intact into Q4. As always, pair narratives with data, and treat promotional forecasts with care.

With just four months left for this year, we decided to ask ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini about XRP’s future by the end of it. What’s Next in 2025? Hidden Road’s purchase for $1.25 billion stands out as the most significant acquisition made by the Brad Garlinghouse-spearheaded company this year, as some believe it will be a game-changer for both Ripple and XRP. When it comes down to positive developments, though, perhaps nothing trumps the developments on the legal case against the SEC, where the two parties have agreed to drop it entirely . The only remaining step is for the judge presiding over the case to affix their official signature. XRP felt the positive consequences of these and other developments throughout the year and peaked at $3.65 in July, thus breaking its January 2018 all-time high of $3.4. However, it has skipped a beat since then and now struggles below $3. As such, we decided to ask the most popular AI solutions what they think might happen by the end of the year. ChatGPT started with what’s most commonly anticipated – a quick rebound. It touched upon some forecasts made by established names in the financial industry, such as Standard Chartered, and outlined a $5.50 target for XRP by the end of the year. Although it admitted that Ripple’s cross-border token now has some competition in the face of rivals like Remittix (RTX), and that the overall demand for the asset has dwindled in the past several weeks, it remains bullish about its trajectory in 2025. “While the sharp retrace below $3 marks a challenging phase, XRP still holds bullish potential if it reclaims key resistance zones, maintains volume inflows, and is supported by positive macro/regulatory developments.” Its best-case reasonable target is, as mentioned above, somewhere between $5 and $6, but it also provided an “extended bullish outlook,” which sees the asset skyrocketing to $10-$12. However, it noted that this could take place only “under strong momentum and sentiment.” Grok and Gemini Say… After the mandatory “this is not financial advice” disclaimer, Gemini said several key factors can shape XRP’s future in the following four months. They include the official conclusion of the SEC lawsuit, Ripple’s role in the ever-growing Real-World Asset (RWA) space, the potential approvals of spot XRP ETFs in the US, and the broader market conditions and economic factors. Grok warned investors that they should expect XRP to “remain volatile by the end of 2025.” However, it added that the overall market structure continues to lean bullish, which should help XRP reclaim the $3 support. Its projection for the next four months includes price fluctuations between $3 and $5.50 or even higher. “XRP holds significant upside potential contingent on positive catalysts, but may also experience periods of consolidation or retracement depending on market conditions. This balanced outlook reflects XRP’s evolving role in the crypto financial ecosystem through 2025,” Grok concluded.

According to reports, the individuals involved kidnapped the businessman, based in Surat, and extorted funds in digital assets from him. Out of the 14 individuals convicted in the case, court documents show that 11 police officials were found complicit for their involvement in the case. According to court records, the 11 Indian police officials convicted in the case included former Amreli district superintendent of police Jagdish Patel, former BJP MLA from Amreli Nalin Kotadiya, and two other unnamed high-ranking officials. Meanwhile, the judge held that one of the accused, Jalin Patel, was innocent, so he was discharged and acquitted. Over 14 policemen imprisoned for life in crypto extortion case According to reports, the case was similar to a criminal thriller. The prosecution noted that the victim, Shailesh Bhatt, had gotten an unspecified amount of Bitcoin from Dhaval Mavani after making investments in a firm located in Surat worth Rs. 8,000 crore (approximately $960 million), after it closed down abruptly. When the news filtered to Kotadiya and Amreli SP, they formulated a plan to track down Bhatt and steal the digital assets from him. Court documents showed that Bhatt was illegally apprehended and arrested, with the individuals involved moving their plans a step further by arresting him. They detained him at a Keshav Farm near Gandhinagar in February 2018, with Indian police officials from the Amreli district watching over him at the location. According to the documents, Anant Patel, the local crime branch police inspector in Amreli, was one of the kidnappers. The kidnappers were able to beat and intimidate Bhatt to the point where he confessed that he had extorted 752 Bitcoin from Mavani towards his share, one which was 176 Bitcoin that he owned with his business partner Krit Paladiya, noting that he had also sold other tokens for Rs. 44 crore (approximately $5.2 million). Notably, Paladiya is also an accused in this case. Bhatt was allowed to go after he promised to transfer 176 Bitcoin and Rs. 32 crore to the gang of kidnappers. However, when he failed to hold up his end of the bargain, the accused extorted Rs. 1.32 crore from him by forcing him to sell 34 Bitcoin from Paladiya’s wallet. Bhatt took this complaint to the Union home ministry, where he was directed to the CID in Gandhinagar to register a criminal FIR in April 2018. The police started a lengthy investigations after the FIR and they were able to track several suspects involved in the case before narrowing it down to 15 individuals. Court says verdict will serve as a warning to other public officials During the trial, public prosecutor Amit Patel examined more than 173 witnesses, with 92 of them turning hostile in court. During the conviction, the court also issued perjury to about 25 hostile witnesses. During the trial, Bhatt also approached the higher courts over the outcome of the trial, making moves to delay his appearance in court . After the conclusion of the trial, the Indian court awarded life imprisonment to the convicted individuals. “Widespread corruption among public servants and private persons is required to be curbed with a strong hand by all, and certainly, the verdict of the court has greater magnitude than other means,” the Indian court said. The court also ordered that the gold jewelry seized from the Amreli SP should be confiscated and processed by the Master of Mint at Mumbai. All the Indian police officers found guilty were charged under the Prevention of Corruption Act for criminal misconduct by public servants. The convicts were also sentenced to life imprisonment under Section 364A of the IPC, and different jail terms in other IPC and PC Act sections, in addition to being fined.

Key Takeaways: Tether will no longer freeze USDT on five blockchains but has ended issuance and redemption on them. The affected networks, including Omni Layer and EOS, represent a small share of total USDT circulation. Tether is focusing on high-demand ecosystems like Ethereum and Tron, where most USDT activity now occurs. The stablecoin issuer made the announcement Friday , citing feedback from ecosystem participants. The affected chains are Omni Layer, Bitcoin Cash SLP, Kusama, EOS, and Algorand. “Tether has revised this approach and will not freeze the smart contracts on these networks,” the company stated, adding that users will still be able to move their tokens, but they will not be officially supported going forward. Tether Phase-Out Hits Omni Layer with $82.9M in Circulating USDT The change affects a relatively small portion of USDT’s total footprint. Omni Layer, once a primary vehicle for Tether, currently holds $82.9 million in circulating USDT. EOS trails at $4.2 million, while the remaining networks each hold under $1 million, according to DeFiLlama. Tether began winding down support for these chains in 2023, halting new issuance on Omni, Kusama, and Bitcoin Cash SLP last August. EOS and Algorand followed in June 2024 . The company’s revised stance keeps token transfers functional, but confirms it will not resume minting or redemptions. The decision reflects Tether’s strategy to focus on chains with high demand and strong developer ecosystems. Tether, the king of stablecoins, just dropped a crypto bomb: $USDT is disappearing from Omni Layer ( $OMNI ), $EOS , ( $ALGO ) Algorand, Bitcoin Cash ( $BCH ) $SLP , and Kusama ( $KSM )!

BNB Chain holds $6.78 billion, while newer chains like Arbitrum, Base, and Solana are gaining traction, though they are more closely tied to rival stablecoin USDC. The stablecoin sector has grown to $285.9 billion, with USDT and USDC dominating at $167.4 billion and $71.5 billion, respectively, according to CoinGecko. Trump-Backed GENIUS Act Boosts U.S. Push for Dollar-Pegged Stablecoins The shift also comes as U.S. policy support for stablecoins gains momentum. The recent passage of the GENIUS Act , signed by President Trump, aims to cement the dollar’s dominance by backing dollar-pegged stablecoins in global markets. The Treasury Department expects the stablecoin market to exceed $2 trillion by 2028, a projection that places greater emphasis on liquidity, interoperability, and regulatory alignment across the ecosystem. Tether’s latest move underscores a pragmatic shift toward that future. As reported, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has said the stablecoin sector is poised for explosive growth, projecting the market could balloon from its current $250 billion capitalization to as much as $2 trillion in the near future. “Many people think it will reach $1 to $2 trillion in a handful of years,” Garlinghouse said, adding that Ripple is positioned to benefit from that trajectory. Meanwhile, Western Union is positioning itself for a new phase of digital transformation, signaling strong interest in using stablecoins to modernize its global remittance operations. CEO Devin McGranahan has outlined how stablecoins could streamline cross-border transfers, improve currency conversion in underserved markets, and provide financial tools for populations grappling with unstable local currencies.

Legal Expert Says Yes, But…",https://timestabloid.com/can-ripple-sell-xrp-directly-to-institutions-in-the-u-s-legal-expert-says-yes-but/,"Attorney Fred Rispoli recently provided clarity on whether Ripple can sell XRP directly to institutions in the United States. This has been the subject of speculation following recent legal developments. His remarks came in response to Abs Nassif, host of the Good Morning Crypto podcast, who posed the question publicly. Rispoli affirmed that Ripple can sell XRP to U.S. institutions, although he noted that the process is still unclear. “Yes. Unclear the avenue that Ripple will use to accomplish this but the bottom line is THIS administration’s SEC won’t be a roadblock,” he stated. He emphasized the importance of legislation for ensuring market stability, adding that it is vital to secure clarity in case the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopts a stricter stance on digital assets under a future administration. Yes. Unclear the avenue that Ripple will use to accomplish this but the bottom line is THIS administration’s SEC won’t be a roadblock. So very important for market clarity legislation to pass in case next SEC goes back to anti-crypto. — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) August 29, 2025 The Context of the Lawsuit The discussion follows the recent dismissal of legal proceedings between Ripple and the SEC. While the broader case has concluded, a key restriction remains unresolved. Both Ripple and the SEC had jointly requested the removal of the permanent injunction preventing institutional sales of XRP. Judge Analisa Torres denied the motion for an indicative ruling, leaving the injunction in place. This outcome leaves Ripple without full legal clearance for institutional transactions, though the company has made strides in other areas of its operations. Analysts and observers suggest that this development will not undermine Ripple’s long-term strategy. Rispoli has previously explained that the term “institutional sales” from the ruling does not broadly apply to all future XRP sales involving institutions. In his response, he pointed out that the current SEC leadership will not obstruct Ripple’s path forward despite the outstanding injunction. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications for Ripple’s Business The issue at the heart of the injunction is whether Ripple can engage directly with institutional buyers inside the U.S. without violating securities laws. Rispoli acknowledged uncertainty about the precise mechanism Ripple might use, but stressed that the administration’s approach provides room for the company to operate. Market participants are eager for clarity, as institutional engagement is critical to XRP’s utility in cross-border settlements and liquidity solutions. Rispoli’s comments suggest that Ripple’s ability to transact with institutions is not dependent on the injunction’s removal, but rather on compliance with existing securities frameworks and the prevailing regulatory environment.

From topping open interest charts to leading in whale accumulation and network activity, ETH has consistently set the tone for broader market sentiment. Its role as the engine of capital rotation from Bitcoin to altcoins has only reinforced this dominance, making Ethereum the asset to watch as the market enters a new stage. However, the recent retrace has introduced caution. After surging to new highs, ETH has pulled back to test lower demand levels, sparking fear among traders who worry that momentum may be fading. Despite this, on-chain data suggests that the fundamentals remain firmly intact. Key insights from Lookonchain reveal that the Bitcoin OG who recently purchased 641,508 ETH, worth $2.94 billion, is back in action. After a brief pause, this whale has resumed accumulation, signaling confidence in Ethereum’s long-term trajectory . For many, such aggressive buying serves as a counterweight to the short-term volatility, highlighting how large players continue to see opportunity even as prices waver. OG Whale Buying As Ethereum Holds Key Levels According to Lookonchain, following a two-day break, the whale deposited 1,000 BTC (worth $108.27 million) to Hyperliquid, converting it into ETH spot. This latest move reinforces the trend of aggressive whale accumulation, a factor that continues to support the bullish outlook for Ethereum even as price action shows signs of weakness. The timing of this accumulation is particularly notable. Ethereum recently retraced sharply after reaching fresh highs, testing critical demand levels that have sparked concern among traders. Some analysts warn that ETH could be vulnerable if these zones fail to hold, with the broader market sentiment leaning bearish. However, the whale’s consistent purchases suggest that major players see the retrace as an opportunity rather than a reversal, adding weight to the argument that fundamentals remain strong. In this context, the coming weeks will be decisive. If Ethereum manages to consolidate above support and push higher, it would confirm the continuation of the uptrend and validate the whale’s confidence-driven buying. Conversely, failure to hold demand zones could extend the correction. For now, the return of large-scale accumulation highlights that Ethereum’s long-term trajectory remains bullish despite short-term volatility. ETH Tests Key Demand Level Ethereum is trading near $4,370 after a 3% daily decline, cooling off from its recent push to highs above $4,750. The daily chart shows ETH consolidating after a steep rally that began in mid-July, when price broke out of a long consolidation phase near $2,700 and surged more than 70% in just a few weeks. The retrace comes as ETH tests short-term demand. Price remains well above the 50-day moving average at $3,941, which is now serving as dynamic support. The 100-day ($3,244) and 200-day ($2,662) averages are trending upward, confirming that the broader market structure is still bullish. Holding above $4,200 is critical to maintain momentum, as this zone aligns with recent breakout levels and could provide a foundation for the next leg higher. Resistance remains near $4,750–$4,800, where sellers stepped in during the last rally attempt. A decisive break above this zone would likely open the door to new all-time highs, while failure to hold above $4,200 could trigger a deeper pullback toward $3,900.

Once touted as a next-gen Layer-1 with its BlockDAG speed and smart contract upgrades, Kaspa has failed to hold momentum due to volatility, lagging adoption and missed institutional interest. With the Casplex Layer-2 launch scheduled for August 31, holders remain hopeful, but smart investors are jumping ship toward projects that deliver utility now, not years down the road. Kaspa trades around $0.087, stuck under both the 50- and 200-day moving averages, with sentiment cautious and competition fierce from Ethereum and Remittix . Here’s what analysts are saying. Kaspa Faces Technical and Adoption Challenges From its $0.207 peak in August 2024, Kaspa plunged to $0.055 before recovering slightly. Current resistance around $0.12 keeps price capped, with risk of retesting $0.082 support. The August 31 smart contract upgrade is make-or-break, opening the door to DeFi apps on Kaspa’s proof-of-work base, but developer traction and enterprise partnerships remain limited. Meanwhile, competitors continue eating market share, and without clear adoption breakthroughs, Kaspa risks further sidelining. Traders seeking immediate gains are already rotating into PayFi projects with tangible, scalable adoption. Remittix: The Top Layer-2 Ethereum Alternative For Maximum Crypto Gains In 2025 This is where Remittix (RTX) is rewriting the playbook. While Kaspa builds for the future, RTX is delivering right now. The top Defi coin has already surpassed $22,3 Million in funding telling prospective investors that real adoption exists in this ecosystem. Freelancers and business owners can now conveniently forget about the 5–10% fees charged by Western Union and banks as RTX enables near-instant crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries with rock-bottom 0.1% fees. Its multi-chain backbone (Ethereum, Solana, Algorand) and institutional-ready APIs make it a direct bridge between crypto and global finance. Analysts are calling it a next 100x crypto and judging by whale accumulation and presale acceleration, they may be right. Why Investors Are Rushing Into RTX: Global transfers in 30+ countries at 0.1% fees vs banks charging 10x more Enterprise-ready APIs for seamless institutional adoption CertiK-audited for security and trust Mobile-first wallet launching Q3 2025 with FX conversion $22,3M raised and counting with BitMart listing locked What’s even more impressive is that RTX holders are up 500% from earlier this year and with the recent BitMart and LBank exchange announcements, Remittix is laser-focused on a $19 trillion opportunity: global remittances. Massive Giveaway and Exchange Expansion Fuel RTX Momentum RTX isn’t just raising funds, it’s building a movement. Its $250,000 giveaway campaign has drawn over 300,000+ entries and attracted over 25,000 holders, proving grassroots adoption is here. For investors, this is the kind of project you don’t wait on. Because once RTX launches, the cheap entry point at $0.10 will be history. Miss it now, regret it later.

Price action has shifted into a cautious phase, and ETH now faces the challenge of defending key demand zones that could determine the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Index Highlights Two Accumulations And Five Distribution Waves This Cycle – Details Despite this pullback, Ethereum remains the standout performer in the market. Fresh data from Glassnode reveals that over the past month, no altcoin sector has outperformed ETH, although DeFi and Layer 2 ecosystems came close. This resilience underscores Ethereum’s dominance even in times of broader market weakness, reinforcing its role as the backbone of decentralized finance and blockchain infrastructure. The trend also suggests that the market is entering what many analysts describe as “Ethereum season,” where ETH leads performance and capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins begins to accelerate. With institutions, whales, and retail investors watching closely, Ethereum’s ability to hold its ground while others falter highlights its strength heading into the next stage of the cycle. Ethereum Leads Market As Capital Rotation Accelerates According to Glassnode, Ethereum has established itself as the clear leader in the market over the past month. No altcoin sector has managed to outperform ETH during this period, with only DeFi and Layer 2 ecosystems coming close. Notably, most altcoin sectors ended the month in decline, reinforcing Ethereum’s relative strength in a volatile environment. This performance signals a clear shift in capital rotation, as flows begin moving away from Bitcoin and into Ethereum, marking what many analysts see as the beginning of a new stage in the cycle. Capital rotation has long been a hallmark of crypto market dynamics. Traditionally, rallies begin with Bitcoin dominance before liquidity spreads into Ethereum and then, eventually, into smaller altcoins. The latest data shows ETH taking center stage in this process, attracting both institutional interest and whale accumulation. This suggests that investors view Ethereum as the next engine of growth, supported by strong fundamentals and expanding adoption across DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise use cases. Still, sentiment remains divided. Some analysts argue that this cycle is structurally longer, stretched by institutional products like spot ETFs and increased global adoption, meaning Ethereum could continue to outperform for months. Others remain cautious, warning that the market’s current weakness could be the early signal of a broader bearish trend. Regardless of these opposing views, Ethereum’s leadership in performance and its ability to outpace nearly every altcoin sector highlight its growing importance in defining the next stage of the crypto market. For many, ETH is setting the tone for where capital flows—and opportunities—are headed next. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Reserves Decline – Strong Accumulation Signal ETH Pulls Back After Explosive Rally Ethereum is trading around $4,366 after a sharp weekly decline of nearly 9%, following its recent push to new highs near $4,800. The weekly chart highlights a powerful rally that began earlier this summer, lifting ETH from lows below $2,000 to almost double its value in just a few months. However, the latest red candle shows that sellers are stepping in as the market digests this steep run-up. Despite the correction, ETH remains firmly above its major moving averages. The 50-week ($2,863), 100-week ($2,819), and 200-week ($2,446) moving averages are all trending upward, confirming that the long-term structure is still bullish. These levels now serve as strong layers of support should deeper retracements occur.

Holding this zone would strengthen the case for consolidation before another attempt at breaking $4,800. A failure, however, could open the door for a move back toward $3,800.

JPMorgan Weighs In,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-outlook-2025-jpmorgan-undervalued/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin 2025 Outlook: Undervalued vs Gold? JPMorgan Weighs In New Delhi, Aug 30, 2025 — The bitcoin market has entered a quieter, more mature phase in 2025. Price swings have cooled, institutional demand continues through spot ETF channels, and the narrative is shifting from “speculation” to “portfolio allocation.” A recent JPMorgan note captures this shift, arguing that as bitcoin volatility sinks toward historic lows (~30% from ~60% at the start of 2025), BTC screens undervalued versus gold on a volatility-adjusted basis. Why “Undervalued vs Gold” Matters for Bitcoin For years, analysts compared bitcoin to gold as a potential store of value. JPMorgan’s latest framework suggests that with volatility compressing, the risk-adjusted case for BTC strengthens, implying upside to a fair-value band if volatility remains near current levels. Some summaries of the bank’s model suggest a scenario up to $126,000 by year-end 2025 under those assumptions. While not a guarantee, it signals how large allocators may benchmark BTC risk vs. gold. Key takeaways Volatility normalization : 60% → ~30% in 2025, a record low, supports larger institutional position sizes. Relative valuation lens : On a volatility-adjusted basis, JPMorgan argues bitcoin screens cheap vs gold. Scenario analysis : Headlines cite a $126K fair-value scenario if conditions hold. Institutional Flows: The ETF Flywheel Since the launch of U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, the structure has become a primary conduit for mainstream capital. Day-one trading activity topped $4.6 billion across funds, and 2025 has seen continued net inflows, including $1B in a single day in July and one fund racing to ~$80B in assets under management. This “ETF flywheel”—simple access, regulated wrappers, and daily liquidity—has deepened the market. Why this supports price discovery Persistent demand via retirement and wealth platforms. Tighter spreads & deeper liquidity as market-makers compete. Transparent holdings data that helps analysts track flows. Together, these factors can dampen extreme volatility and support bitcoin as a strategic allocation rather than a trade. The Post-Halving Backdrop The April 2024 halving cut the block subsidy to 3.125 BTC , mechanically slowing net supply issuance. Historically, halvings have influenced cycle dynamics, though returns vary by macro regime. In the current cycle, the combination of slower issuance and stronger institutional rails (ETFs, custody) is shaping a different—arguably more mature—market profile. Macro Currents to Watch in H2 2025 Rates & liquidity Lower global rate-volatility typically benefits risk assets. If real yields stabilize or drift lower, the opportunity cost of holding bitcoin vs cash may fall, supporting bids. Regulatory clarity Incremental clarity on market structure and token classification can unlock new allocators (pensions, insurers) who require a defined rulebook before entry. Mainstream outlets have noted how policy expectations have tracked BTC’s move into six figures in 2025. ETF flows & rebalancing Quarterly and year-end rebalances can create lumps in demand/supply through ETFs, potentially amplifying trend moves when combined with shrinking miner sell pressure post-halving. Price Context: From “Wild Ride” to “Measurable Beta” Several 2025 reports highlight that bitcoin’s realized volatility has cooled substantially , even through drawdowns—suggesting a transition from ultra-speculative swings to “measurable beta” sensitive to macro and flows. This doesn’t eliminate risk; it re-frames it. In 2025, BTC has traded near—and at times above—six figures, with mainstream coverage documenting surges past $120,000 earlier in the year on institutional adoption momentum. Bull, Base, and Bear Scenarios (Next 3–6 Months) Bull Case: $115K–$135K Volatility stays ~30% , reinforcing JPMorgan’s relative-value lens vs gold. ETF net inflows persist; wealth-platform distribution widens internationally. Macro benign (softer inflation prints, stable/lower real yields). This cluster of factors could pull bitcoin toward the upper end of JPMorgan-style fair-value scenarios. Base Case: $95K–$115K Volatility remains contained but flows are choppier. Macro is mixed; regulatory progress uneven. Mining sells modestly into strength; ETF demand offsets. Bear Case: $80K–$95K Risk-off macro (growth scare or sharp yield spike). ETF outflows and stronger USD . Volatility re-expands toward prior ranges, weakening the gold-parity argument. Even in this case, structural features (ETF access, post-halving issuance) could help stabilize drawdowns relative to past cycles. Reminder: These are scenarios, not predictions. Crypto assets remain highly volatile and can move rapidly in both directions. Risks & What Could Invalidate the Thesis Macro shock : A policy surprise or liquidity crunch can hit all risk assets at once. Regulatory setbacks : Adverse rulings or delayed approvals that restrict distribution. On-chain/security events : Major protocol or market-infrastructure incidents. Narrative shift : If realized volatility rises again, the “undervalued vs gold” framing weakens. How to Read the JPMorgan Framework (Without the Hype) It’s relative, not absolute — The claim addresses risk-adjusted valuation vs gold given volatility, not a guaranteed price path. It’s conditional — The $126K scenario assumes volatility remains subdued and flows supportive. It’s one lens — ETF flow data, macro liquidity, and halving-era supply dynamics should be tracked alongside it. FAQs: Bitcoin in 2025 Is bitcoin still volatile? Yes—but less than in prior cycles. Several analyses peg current realized volatility near 30% , a multi-year low, versus ~60% in early 2025. Do ETFs really matter? Early data says yes: ETFs created an easy on-ramp, large volumes at launch, and billions in net 2025 inflows—supporting liquidity and broader ownership. Did the 2024 halving help? Halving reduced new supply to 3.125 BTC per block. Its price impact depends on demand (including ETF flows) and macro liquidity. Conclusion The 2025 bitcoin story is about normalization : lower realized volatility, institutional rails via ETFs, and a mainstream risk framework that increasingly compares BTC with gold. JPMorgan’s lens— undervalued vs gold on a volatility-adjusted basis —doesn’t promise outcomes, but it does explain why allocators are taking BTC seriously as a portfolio sleeve. Track volatility, ETF flows, and macro cues; together, they will likely set the range for the next leg of bitcoin price discovery. This post Bitcoin 2025 Outlook: Undervalued vs Gold?

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-believes-xrp-to-close-to-next-leg-rally-heres-why/,"Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk), a well-known crypto analyst and XRP supporter, recently commented on the current sentiment surrounding XRP. In his words, “Everyone hates XRP right now.” He explained that even many holders are voicing frustration, saying the asset “doesn’t do anything” or that they have already exited their positions . Despite this, he said this kind of frustration and negativity is not a signal of a market top. Instead, he suggested that the opposite might be true, noting that “infighting and despair isn’t a mark of a top.” This perspective points to a possible turning point in XRP’s market cycle, with the implication that heavy doubt could precede a decisive move . Uncertainty Before Momentum Periods of uncertainty are not unusual for XRP, a token known for long stretches of stagnation followed by rapid price acceleration. Cryptoinsightuk’s remarks highlight that what may appear to be a weakness in community sentiment can sometimes align with the conditions before a surge. His statement that holders are showing despair, paired with his view that this is not a topping signal, suggests he believes the market is preparing for its next phase. The analyst emphasized that these conditions say “we are close to our next leg.” This reference to a potential new stage of price discovery shows his belief that bearish sentiment may be masking underlying strength. Everyone hates $XRP right now. Even the holders, I’m getting multiple comments per post about how $XRP doesn’t do anything or they can’t take it anymore or how they’ve sold. This tells me we are close to our next leg. Infighting and despair isn’t a mark of a top…. — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) August 28, 2025 XRP Community’s Reactions The post prompted a range of responses from members of the XRP community. Xoom (@Mr_Xoom), a well-respected figure in the crypto space, agreed with Cryptoinsightuk’s comments, calling his assessment spot on. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Others remarked that they had seen similar attitudes of frustration but still pointed out the significant developments ahead on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , indicating optimism about the technology despite short-term negativity. Another community member added that there is still activity happening behind the scenes that may eventually show its impact. A similar perspective came from another commenter who noted that people will realize the importance of what they hold, reinforcing the view that long-term conviction could be rewarded. Outlook for XRP XRP’s price history shows that it has often remained static for long periods before moving suddenly and at scale . This backdrop, combined with the current climate of frustration, creates a situation where market participants are uncertain, yet conditions may be aligning for stronger momentum. The analyst’s remarks suggest that negativity among holders does not necessarily reflect weakness in the asset itself. Instead, he interprets it as a sign that the market could be positioning for its next significant move. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

While the usual big names are still in the spotlight, more and more attention is shifting toward early-stage projects with fresh upside potential. Analysts are pointing to Ethereum, Binance Coin, Sui, and Pepe—with MAGACOIN FINANCE also creeping into the conversation as a new contender gaining a reputation for being one of the safest plays in the market. Here’s a closer look at why these five tokens are making waves in August 2025 and why some traders believe this presale wildcard could be one to watch closely. 1. Ethereum (ETH) – Institutional Demand Drives Record Highs Ethereum has been one of the highest-rallying cryptocurrencies this year, all thanks to the success of the ETF launches and sustained institutional demand. In August alone, ETFs have pulled in nearly $3 billion, indicating the level of institutional interest in ETH. With more than 30% of ETH staked and a DeFi TVL of $95 billion, Ethereum remains the backbone of altcoin momentum. Analysts expect ETH to reach $7,500 to $10,000 by late 2025, making it a frontrunner among the best altcoins to buy now. 2. Binance Coin (BNB) – Utility and Ecosystem Growth BNB trades near $850 with strong support around $820. Its value comes from Binance’s ecosystem — powering exchange fees, DeFi staking, and treasury programs. Analysts see potential for $940 in the near term and $1,770 by 2026. BNB’s consistent growth makes it a staple in many portfolios of the top altcoins to buy in 2025. 3. Sui (SUI) – Gaming and Real-World Assets Sui is proving itself as a scalable blockchain built for gaming and real-world assets. The network surpassed 4 billion transactions and boasts $2.72 billion in DeFi TVL. Gaming protocols like Jackson.io and tokenized gold via Matrixdock’s XAUm are expanding its ecosystem. With SUI trading near $3.5 and targets of $5, it’s one of the more innovative altcoins to buy now. 4. Pepe (PEPE) – Meme Coin With Breakout Potential PEPE is consolidating near $0.00001001, with analysts watching resistance at $0.0000125. A breakout could double its price, though risk remains high. Still, viral community energy keeps PEPE relevant, and spinoffs like Little Pepe raising $21 million prove the brand has staying power. For traders who embrace volatility, PEPE is still among the best altcoins to buy now. 5. MAGACOIN FINANCE – Secure Presale With Growing Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum has kept it in the spotlight. The token is moving faster across crypto circles than established tokens, with some now comparing it to the early stages of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. What sets the token apart is its growing community. Investors and traders alike are excited by the potential of the token as one of the standout altcoins. Alongside that, large investors are exiting their positions in other tokens to key into MAGACOIN FINANCE based on its low entry price and solid roadmap. For smart investors, that sends a signal as to where the market is going. MAGACOIN FINANCE may not have the backing of BNB or the institutional demand of Ethereum, but it surely has a momentum that positions it as one of the best altcoins to buy now, ahead of the altcoin season. Final Take Ethereum and Binance Coin continue to show strength backed by big institutions, Sui is carving out its place with real-world utility, and PEPE is proving that meme culture still has a seat at the table. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping in as a newer, more secure option that’s starting to gain traction with investors. So, for investors wondering what are the best altcoins to buy now? This mix of proven giants and up-and-coming tokens could give traders a balanced approach heading into the next altcoin season.

SPX6900 (SPX) functions primarily on the Ethereum network. The token was created as a meme to entertain wider audiences. It has no real connection with stock market, equities, or securities. The meme coin generates interest through spot trading, market speculation, or perpetual and leveraged trading on different decentralized exchanges; the latter is not recommended for non-professionals due to its high risk and highly volatile nature. SPX6900 is traded on different centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. The most popular centralized exchange for trading SPX tokens is Bybit, which has the highest trading volume for this meme coin. SPX6900 (SPX) can be stored in various wallets, including Trust Wallet, Bitget Wallet, and hardware wallets like Ledger. It can also be stored on a centralized exchange like KuCoin and another option could be Kraken, providing easy access to the coin. Early users attest to its credibility and remarkable price performance; however, the meme token still holds the interest of many investors with a daily trading volume in millions and a current circulating supply of 930.99 million SPX, which is also its total supply, although its max supply will be 1 billion tokens. Starting as a non-serious venture, the coin established itself as one of the most high-ranking coins of the year 2024. It was initiated as a useless token but ultimately ended up earning profits in the millions. For example, over a month, SPX earned up to a 9000% return following its ascent through September 2024.

SPX6900 price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has increased to $1.12 in the past 24 hours. If buyers push the price above immediate resistance channels, we might see the SPX6900 price surging toward $1.20 level. On the other hand, a drop below the $1.08 support line can strengthen sellers’ domination. In such a case, a decline toward $1 is highly likely. Is SPX6900 a good investment? Investing in SPX necessitates an evaluation of the SPX market and its emphasis on adaptability. Despite the earlier price spikes and enormous price gains, investors are advised to exercise caution on account of the market volatility of meme coins. Earnings from SPX require long-term investment decisions, whether holding or trading, but in this dynamic market, risk management is primarily achieved through diversification and keeping abreast of developments.

SPX’s nearest resistance level is at $1.35. Will SPX6900 recover? SPX token maintained an overbought status for a few days. If buyers defend the immediate support levels and push the price above the Fib channels, a recovery can be initiated. Will SPX6900 reach $2? SPX token may reach $2 in 2025. With the current price action, this seems quite possible, as the token is trending above $1 and its market cap will nearly double when it reaches this level. Will SPX reach $3? Per SPX price prediction, it has a chance of reaching $3 by 2026 if positive sentiment prevails, which makes SPX tokens a good purchase option. Will SPX reach $5? To reach $5, SPX’s value along with its market cap will have to increase fivefold. Though not impossible, there are chances of reaching this level by 2027. Does SPX6900 have a good long-term future? Long-term forecasts suggest a gradual increase in the value of SPX over the next two years. Following this period, projections anticipate sustained upward price movement with a potential resurgence in 2029. By 2031, SPX is expected to trade above $12, solidifying its position as a valuable long-term asset. SPX6900 does not only capitalize on mere entertainment but is also driven by the community surrounding it. Recent news/opinions on SPX6900 Some of the crypto influencers are bullish on SPX6900, like MustStopMurad, ApeToshi Aeon, and Maddox, a best-selling author and blogger known for “The Best Page in the Universe” and technology-related content. On May 28, Murad shared a post highlighting the community behind SPX6900’s success, and recently Maddox shared a video along the same lines. The most recent and bold claim is made by a user whose post was reshared by @MustStopMurad, speculating that SPX6900 will be the first of its kind to reach a $100 billion market capitalization. However, such content should be taken with a pinch of salt. SPX6900 will be the first meme coin to pull $100 Billion mc.

SPX6900 historic price sentiment SPX6900 price history SPX6900 was launched in August 2023 by its primary creators with an opening price of $0.003 but remained under the radar for over a year. In October 2023, SPX’s value spiked to $0.023 under bullish control, which was a considerable growth trajectory, but still, it remained far from market attention. December of 2023 saw a low price of $0.008, which was quite low as compared to the price in October as per crypto market historical data. SPX6900 saw a stagnating price movement from January to May 2024, only to rise periodically to $0.015. In September 2024, SPX6900 gained an enormous 5600% from September 12 to October 14, reaching $0.913, resulting in a massive market capitalization. The token made higher spikes till November 7, 2024, adding significantly to its market cap; however, the token’s price has deteriorated afterwards. On November 21, SPX6900 stooped to $0.450, losing 50% of its value, which made holders cautious. However, the token regained its lost value and ended the year at $0.856. The meme token entered January 2025 with a price tag of $0.866, but it soon jumped to $1.55 as its circulation and acceptance increased. It corrected strongly in search of support at the start of February, attaining an average price of $0.66, but came down to the 0.46 range in March. In April, the coin was trending near $0.386 on the lower side, while in May, it saw a fabulous recovery, peaking at $1.11 along with some other cryptocurrencies. On June 11, the meme coin attained its all time high of $1.73, and on July 28, it marked another ATH at $2.27, SPX is trending above the psychological mark of $1, trading at $1.2 under complete bullish dominance, proving itself a reliable asset.

The entire meme coin market is worth around $73 billion, which could grow further should current momentum be sustained into October. Beyond Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, meme coin investors are also spotlighting newer players such as MAGACOIN FINANCE —a secured and fully audited project—in their list of the best meme coins to buy in 2025. Dogecoin vs Shiba Inu: Who Holds the Edge? Dogecoin has been holding steady around $0.21–$0.22 after a brief rally to $0.25. Whales have scooped up more than 680 million DOGE this month, showing strong confidence. If DOGE can break above $0.23, analysts say a move toward $0.28 is possible, with ETF speculation adding fuel. Beyond price, Dogecoin’s ecosystem is expanding with upgrades like RadioDoge, designed to boost real-world use cases. Shiba Inu, on the other hand, has faced a tougher month. Shibarium’s new governance features are promising, but SHIB’s burn rate dropped nearly 99%, raising doubts about its deflationary strength. Price action has been weak, slipping around 3% to $0.0000124. Still, whales buying more than $1.6 million in SHIB suggest strategic accumulation. With DAO elections, AI partnerships, and even a SHIB-backed stablecoin planned for 2026, SHIB remains on many lists of the best meme coins to buy now despite short-term setbacks. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Investors Growing, Analysts Watchlist While older names battle for dominance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its place among the best meme coins to buy in 2025 . On-chain data shows demand for MAGACOIN FINANCE is growing fast. Analysts who track high upside projects have also noted the attention in the token, predicting it could outperform leaders such as DOGE and SHIB. With the community growing and attention spreading through the crypto market, investors now have a limited-time opportunity to get into MAGACOIN FINANCE. By using the code PATRIOT50X, early investors can gain an exclusive 50% EXTRA bonus. For smart investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the best meme coin to buy now as the market slowly recovers. Why Investors Are Watching Meme Coins Closely With capital rotating in the crypto market, meme coins remain one of the best strategic plays for investors hoping to ride the next bull cycle wave. With meme coins delivering sporadic returns in previous cycles, history is bound to repeat itself. While DOGE and SHIB continue to command high community energy and whale-driven momentum, investors say MAGACOIN FINANCE is the meme token quietly gaining traction, especially as the competition for the best meme coins to buy now is heating up.

Many altcoins continue with their sluggish performance, while CRO has resumed its recent run with another surge to well over $0.3. BTC Dipped to $107K It has been quite a painful period for the primary cryptocurrency, which intensified last Sunday. At the time, the asset had calmed at $115,000 after suring past $117,000 on Friday evening. However, the bears took complete control of the market as the weekend was coming to an end and propelled a massive decline that drove BTC to a multi-week low of under $111,000. Although bitcoin tried to recover some ground on Monday, its progress was quickly halted, and it dropped further, this time to a new low of $108,750. The bulls intervened once again and pushed BTC to just over $113,000 on Thursday. Nevertheless, that was another short-lived rally as the bears initiated another leg down that culminated earlier this morning when bitcoin nosedived to its lowest level since early July of $107,100. It has bounced off since then and currently trades above $108,500, but it’s still 1% down on the day. Its market cap has dumped to $2.160 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is fighting to remain above 56%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView CRO Back on the Gas Pedal The biggest gainer of the week was undoubtedly Cronos’ CRO, which skyrocketed following massive adoption news from companies related to the current US President. In just a few days, the asset went from roughly $0.15 to a multi-year peak of $0.38. It dipped below $0.3 yesterday during the market-wide retracement, but it has added over 11% of value daily and is back to over $0.32. OKB is another recent high-flyer that has resumed its rally, and a 10% daily pump has pushed it to almost $180. Pi Network’s native token has regained some traction, and a 6% surge has driven it to $0.37. The rest of the larger-cap alts are quite sluggish on a daily scale, with minor gains from ETH, BNB, DOGE, ADA, TRX, and SUI, while XRP, SOL, LINK, HYPE, and XLM are with insignificant losses. The total crypto market cap has recovered some ground since its low this morning and is up to $3.850 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Market analyst Matt Hughes says breaking above $3 could trigger a parabolic move. Standard Chartered predicts XRP could rise over 300% to $12.50. Even as broader crypto sentiment has softened, some market watchers remain convinced that XRP is on the verge of its long-awaited surge. Technical analysts point to a maturing chart structure that suggests the asset’s next breakout phase is closer than many expect. XRP Flips Old Cycle Tops Into New Support, Building a Strong Foundation For instance, analyst Matt Hughes has outlined how XRP’s price action continues to flip former resistance zones into solid support levels. Using a Gann Fan on the weekly chart, Hughes showed that major resistance points from 2018 and 2021 have already been broken and turned into new foundations for growth. XRP has now traded above its 2021 peak of $1.96 for weeks without slipping below. The range that once capped its movements between $0.50 and $1 has long been left behind.

From Freeze to Flexibility In July 2024, Tether said it would stop buying back and freeze USDT on these networks starting September 1, 2025. Following feedback from user communities, the company adjusted its approach: smart contracts will not be frozen. This means users will still be able to transfer USDT between wallets on these blockchains. However, new issuance and redemption of tokens will stop, effectively ending official company support for them. Strategic Refocus on High-Activity Ecosystems Tether explained the decision as part of its broader strategy to concentrate on ecosystems with strong developer activity, scalability, and user demand. The company emphasized: “Tether remains committed to a smooth transition and will continue to engage with the community to provide transparency and clarity throughout this process.” Expansion Through Bitcoin-Based Protocols Just a day earlier, Tether announced the launch of USDT on the RGB protocol , a new layer-two solution for issuing digital assets on Bitcoin. This will allow users to hold the stablecoin natively alongside BTC in compatible wallets, expanding utility and adoption.

Built to streamline cross-border payments, Remittix has already raised $22,3M, secured BitMart and LBank listings and is preparing its wallet beta launch. With strong adoption momentum, many believe RTX could become the trending altcoin that defines the next bull run. Chainlink Price Consolidates Below Critical $25 Resistance Chainlink News has been buzzing as the project partners with the U.S. Department of Commerce to bring macroeconomic data on-chain, boosting its role in financial infrastructure. The LINK Price today trades at $24.16, holding firm above key moving averages, while the Chainlink Price Prediction signals a bullish bias despite short-term consolidation between $22.36 and $23.36. Institutional inflows from SBI Group and Caliber highlight strong adoption, yet upside remains capped below $25. Analysts note that whales are accumulating, but unless the LINK Price breaks resistance, progress may stall. Pi Coin Price Prediction Notes Bullish Divergence On RSI Pi Network News has fueled optimism after the team launched Pi Node’s Linux version and confirmed smart contract functionality through Stellar’s protocol 23 upgrade. The Pi Network Price today trades near $0.3519, up 3% as bulls defend the $0.3220 support. Analysts note a falling channel breakout could target the 50-day EMA at $0.4120, signaling a possible shift in momentum. The Pi Coin Price Prediction remains cautiously bullish, with RSI divergence supporting recovery. Yet, risks remain if PI fails to hold its base, with potential retests of $0.3220 or $0.3000. While Pi Network builds towards mainnet activation, Remittix is stealing the attention of investors. Remittix Raises $22,3 Million+ And Secures Major Exchange Listings Analysts are increasingly pointing to Remittix (RTX) as the altcoin with the clearest path to mass adoption. Unlike speculative projects, Remittix is built to fix real problems in cross-border remittances, using blockchain to deliver faster, cheaper, and more transparent payments than traditional banks. With over $22,3 million raised at just $0.10 per token, investors see RTX as a rare early-stage opportunity with strong fundamentals. BitMart confirmed as the first CEX listing, ensuring global liquidity and access Upcoming LBank listing adds momentum and credibility before public trading Wallet beta launch on September 15th signals real product utility before TGE $22,3M+ milestone achieved with over 630 million tokens already sold This blend of progress and adoption separates RTX from competitors like Chainlink and Pi Network, which remain limited by consolidation phases and delayed mainnet rollouts. Add in the $250,000 Remittix Giveaway, and momentum is clearly accelerating.

A fresh project, XYZVerse (XYZ), is now catching attention for its incredible growth prospects in 2025. With excitement building and big gains suggested, all eyes are on this emerging contender. What makes XYZ stand out while others fade? The answer may surprise many. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) Source: TradingView PENGU has cooled. Price slipped 0.84% in the last 7 days and 20.60% in 30 days, yet it still shows a 245.21% gain over 6 months. It now trades near $0.033 inside the $0.0295-$0.0379 band. Short term mood is cautious, long term chart stays bright. The coin sits almost flat with its 10-day SMA at $0.0301 and 100-day SMA at $0.0308. RSI at 48.88 and stochastic at 47.55 signal balance. MACD is slightly negative. A push past $0.0379 would bring the $0.0416 ceiling into view and erase the recent monthly slide. If buyers clear $0.0416 the next target is $0.0500, roughly 50% above current trade. That swing would revive momentum. If sellers step in, watch $0.0249 support; a slip there opens $0.0165 and a possible 45% fall. Until a breakout, expect more range play. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price , far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Dogecoin (DOGE) Source: TradingView Dogecoin trades between $0.21 and $0.25. The last 7 days brought a 3.86% lift, but the 30-day chart shows a mild 0.31% dip. Even so, the coin is 8.08% higher than 6 months ago, hinting at a steady uptrend that keeps bulls interested. Buyers are poking $0.25. The first ceiling sits at $0.27, about 8% above. A break could open $0.30, a 20% jump from now. If sellers step in, price may drop 14% to $0.19 or 30% to $0.1541. These bands will guide the next move. Momentum is flat. Both 10 day and 100 day averages sit at $0.22, so DOGE hovers near fair value. The neutral RSI backs that view. Should volume rise, odds favor a push to $0.27 before month end. Failure to clear it would likely drag price back inside the $0.21-$0.25 channel. Conclusion PENGU and DOGE stay strong, yet all-sport memecoin XYZVerse unites fans, targets 20,000% growth, empowers community, lands sports media deals, crowning XYZ the memecoin GOAT of the 2025 bull run.

Decisions will weigh factors such as: TRX price movements User activity levels Ecosystem growth rate Why It Matters for TRON’s Future TRON has positioned itself as a leading blockchain for DeFi, stablecoins, and cross-border payments, often competing with Ethereum and Solana. Lowering fees is expected to enhance TRON’s competitiveness by making it more attractive for developers, dApps, and retail users who value low-cost transactions. Industry analysts note that fee reductions could encourage more stablecoin issuers and DeFi protocols to expand on TRON, which already dominates in USDT transactions. If successful, the initiative may significantly increase the network’s daily active users and strengthen its role in the global Web3 economy. Sun stressed that the move reflects TRON’s commitment to accessibility and its mission to build a blockchain ecosystem that is both scalable and affordable for everyday users.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|TRX|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-30 09:34:22

The initiative, revealed in a Fortune report citing six people familiar with the matter, would give investors stock-market exposure to the popular memecoin without directly holding it. The project is being pitched to investors as a DOGE treasury entity with backing from House of Doge, a corporate group launched earlier this year by the Dogecoin Foundation and based in Miami. While the effort is still in the early pitch stage, the plan is to establish a public company that will hold DOGE on its balance sheet, positioning it as a unique way for traditional investors to access the token. A Dogecoin Treasury Vehicle in the Making Spiro, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan, has represented high-profile names such as Elon Musk, Jay-Z, and Alec Baldwin. According to investor materials and conversations, he is expected to chair the new Dogecoin company once established. However, no launch date or final structure has been confirmed. The move comes amid a wave of firms turning themselves into crypto treasury companies. These businesses raise capital to buy and hold digital assets, mirroring strategies once reserved for Bitcoin-focused enterprises. DOGE, though less widely adopted than Bitcoin or Ethereum, has carved out a niche following thanks to its active community and Musk’s frequent endorsements. Growing Corporate Interest in DOGE Several companies have already made significant Dogecoin-related moves this year. In February, Vancouver-based Neptune Digital Assets disclosed the purchase of one million DOGE at an average of $0.37, adding to its diverse portfolio that also includes Bitcoin. More recently, Nasdaq-listed Bit Origin announced up to $500 million in financing to build a dedicated DOGE treasury, becoming the first U.S.-traded company to commit its balance sheet to DOGE. Musk himself has long influenced Dogecoin’s trajectory . Tesla, his electric car company, holds undisclosed amounts of DOGE and has accepted it as payment for select merchandise since 2022. Musk’s remarks on social media have repeatedly sent the token’s price swinging, from his 2019 tweet calling DOGE his “favorite cryptocurrency” to his infamous 2021 Saturday Night Live appearance labeling it a “hustle.” Notably, Spiro also defended Musk in a lawsuit brought by investors accusing him of manipulating DOGE price. That case was dismissed in late 2024 , strengthening the attorney’s ties to the cryptocurrency just months before his new role emerged.

Apple led the mobile revolution with the smartphone, dominating the premium market for 13 years; Google created a new standard for accessing information through its search engine, capturing 92% of the global search market; Netflix completely transformed entertainment consumption patterns with streaming services; and Amazon established absolute dominance in e-commerce and cloud computing. Now, the same historic moment is unfolding in the blockchain ecosystem. WonderChain is creating an entirely new paradigm called Web3.5, rising as the master of the next-generation blockchain era. Explosive Growth Potential of the Web3.5 Market and WonderChain’s Exclusive Position According to blockchain market research firm Grand View Research, the Web3.0 market size is expected to grow explosively from $3.2 billion in 2024 to $49.1 billion in 2034, with a CAGR of 31.8%. However, Web3.5, presented by WonderChain, aims at a completely new dimension beyond the existing Web3.0. The core of Web3.5 is to implement an integrated platform that overcomes the technical limitations of existing blockchains, satisfying practicality, scalability, and user experience all at once. This is similar to how Apple combined the internet and app ecosystem with existing phones to create a completely new category: the smartphone. WonderChain has secured exclusive first-mover advantages in this vast new market. The simultaneous coverage by 51 major media outlets worldwide is unprecedented in blockchain history, clearly proving WonderChain’s innovation and market impact. Overwhelming Community Participation – Creating a New Standard Over 80% participation in the WonderChain community sets a new benchmark in the blockchain industry. Compared to Bitcoin’s 23% and Ethereum’s 31%, this is more than double, indicating a true ecosystem of engaged participants rather than merely investors. Currently, the active community of over 80,000 members records an astonishing monthly growth rate of 300%. This surpasses the peaks of Solana (45% in 2021), Cardano (38% all-time high), and Polkadot (29% at initial launch), showing potential not only to reach 300,000 members but to grow into millions, even tens of millions, in a global community. Success Formulas of Big Tech Companies and WonderChain’s Strategic Similarities Apple – Ecosystem Monopoly Model -Apple Success Factor: Integrated closed structure of hardware, software, and services maximized user lock-in. -WonderChain Connection: WonderChain is building a blockchain lifestyle platform by integrating wallets, reward systems, commerce, and community based on Web3.5 standards. -Differentiation/Prospects: While Apple is closed, WonderChain pursues an open, standards-based ecosystem, promoting global network effects open to everyone. Google – Standard Definition Capability -Google Success Factor: Created de facto standards for internet information access through search algorithms and advertising systems, securing a monopoly. -WonderChain Connection: WonderChain defines the Web3.5 protocol, setting new standards for blockchain interactions, token usage, and linking with real-world value. -Differentiation/Prospects: Google’s standard was centralized; WonderChain aims for next-generation standards with trust and transparency based on decentralized governance. Netflix – Market Creation Power -Netflix Success Factor: Transitioned from DVD rentals to streaming, changing user habits and creating a completely new market. -WonderChain Connection: Evolving from experimental Web3.0 services, WonderChain introduces a new category: Web3.5, a real-life integrated digital economy. -Differentiation/Prospects: Just as Netflix changed content consumption, WonderChain converts digital behavior into real economic value, creating a new market. Amazon – Scalability and Diversification -Amazon Success Factor: Expanded from an online bookstore to e-commerce, cloud (AWS), logistics, and AI, dominating industries. -WonderChain Connection: Starting from blockchain-based reward models, WonderChain prepares expansion into travel, culture, commerce, and more. -Differentiation/Prospects: While Amazon grew through capital and data monopoly, WonderChain pursues sustainable growth through community participation, decentralized evaluation, and real-world integration. Apple → Ecosystem Completeness, Google → Standard Definition, Netflix → Paradigm Shift, Amazon → Scalability and Diversification. WonderChain reinterprets these four success formulas within the Web3.5 paradigm using a decentralized, real-life integrated approach, preparing for a next-generation monopolistic position in blockchain. Global VC Attention and Investment Frenzy With cryptocurrency VC investment expected to rise by 50% compared to the previous year in 2025, WonderChain has emerged as the top interest for global investors. Expectations of listings on the world’s largest exchanges – Binance, OKX, Bybit, Bitget – are actively discussed within the community, showing market recognition of WonderChain’s commercial value and technical excellence. Reports and cultural analyses by global media platforms such as Bitcoin World, Binance Square, CoinMarketCap, DailyHunt, China.com, and Phoenix News confirm WonderChain’s global impact and recognition in Asia’s largest market. Continuous global media attention demonstrates that WonderChain is not just a token but a core of industrial innovation. Next-Generation WonderChain – From First-Mover to Market Master The first-mover advantage is not merely about starting early, but defining market rules and creating entry barriers competitors cannot cross. WonderChain creates a new category called Web3.5 Technical Standard Leadership: Defining and implementing the Web3.5 protocol Ecosystem Network Effect: Over 80% participation, ultra-strong community Global Brand Awareness: Media power from simultaneous coverage by 51 outlets All these factors combine to establish an absolute advantage that latecomers cannot surpass. Expansion Roadmap Towards a 10-Million Global Community Current WonderChain community: 80,000+ members. Growth scenario Phase 1 (H2 2025): 300,000 – Official service launch Phase 2 (H1 2026): 1,000,000 – Service expansion to Singapore, Indonesia Phase 3 (H2 2026): 10,000,000 – Service expansion to Malaysia, Hong Kong & Macau This mirrors Apple’s early iPhone growth curve, a typical exponential growth pattern when innovative technology and strong community combine. Conclusion: Absolute Master of the Web3.5 Era, WonderChain In the history of technological innovation, true winners were those who created markets. Just as Apple, Google, Netflix, and Amazon did, WonderChain creates an entirely new market, establishing itself as the absolute leader of the next-generation blockchain paradigm. A super-strong community showing over 80% participation, explosive expansion with 300% monthly growth, simultaneous attention from 51 global media outlets, and coverage by top media in the Greater China region – all of this proves that WonderChain is not merely a blockchain project, but the center of innovation redefining the entire industry. Having secured first-mover advantage, WonderChain has now begun its journey as the master of the market. From 80,000 to 10 million, from a single community to a global ecosystem, from Web3.0 to Web3.5 – WonderChain is writing a new chapter in blockchain history.

Even though both projects still reside among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, many holders are already beginning to look to other alternatives in the market. In light of the need for fresh initiatives, Remittix (RTX) , a new DeFi project, stands out with its goal to address real-world payment issues. The project’s ongoing presale has garnered massive support, with over $22.2 million raised to date. Read on to find out more. ADA price weakness and ETH downtrend Cardano has taken steps to elevate its market position despite a 2.61% decline over the last seven days. Its recent Ouroborous Leis upgrade has piqued the interest of investors who believe it could lead to a rally from its current price of $0.82 to $1. Ethereum remains the leader in the smart contracts market, with a market capitalisation of $529.9 billion, although its daily trade volume has declined by more than 9%. Despite the strong positions Cardano and Ethereum hold, ADA and ETH holders are trusting RTX, a new altcoin for 20x leverage. Remittix presale momentum Unlike speculative tokens, the Remittix project aims to develop a seamless onramp between cryptocurrencies and fiat, enabling users to send currencies like BTC, ETH, and ADA directly into traditional bank accounts.

The RTX presale is ongoing, with the token price of $0.01000 per token, due to the high demand, over $22.2 million has been raised with and over 628 million tokens sold. The presale momentum was so strong that it secured listings on key centralised exchanges like BitMart and LBank, increasing access and liquidity worldwide for early buyers. Investors highlight Remittix as a cross-chain DeFi project with genuine utility. The platform integrates with over 30 countries and supports more than 40 cryptocurrencies, enabling real-life payments and remittances at a low cost. Such features as open FX conversion and low gas fees make RTX one of the next leading altcoins in 2025. Beta wallet launch & utility Going forward, Remittix will roll out its beta wallet in Q3 2025. The mobile-first offering will feature real-time FX conversion, easy cross-border payments, and multi-fiat currency support. For the typical user, this translates to cryptocurrency now being easily used for making payments, from freelancers receiving overseas payments to families sending money abroad.

That kind of growth is unheard of in traditional stock market indices. But wait until you hear what Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse thinks is next for crypto. Garlinghouse believes the crypto market could expand by another ~600% over the next five years, potentially reaching a $25T market cap by 2030 . Keep reading to discover why Ripple’s boss predicts such explosive growth for crypto, his insights on Ripple’s own token, $XRP, and how you can position yourself for this potentially outrageous rally by loading up on the best altcoins to buy now . Why Fiat Instability Fuels the Case for Crypto Garlinghouse cited the vulnerability of traditional fiat currencies as the biggest reason behind his extremely bullish crypto outlook. He explained that macroeconomic pressures on fiat are all but certain to intensify in the coming years, which could push traditional currencies toward devaluation and long-term instability. Amid such uncertainty, digital assets provide more than just hope; they’re built specifically to plug the holes in the global financial system, offering transparency, efficiency, and inflation-resistant store of value that fiat currencies simply can’t match. XRP’s Role in Crypto’s Growth As one of the biggest cryptocurrencies targeting the cross-border payments market, many believe $XRP could become one of the biggest success stories in the next few years. Lord XRP , a crypto enthusiast with 77K+ X followers, explained that since XRP was designed to handle banking transactions (even in the range of 4-5 figures), Ripple is well on its way to becoming a ‘world bank.’ All in all, with prominent industry voices bullish on crypto’s long-term growth, everyday investors will fare extremely well if they simply exercise patience during slightly deeper consolidations like the one we’re seeing now. In fact, now’s the perfect time to beef up your crypto portfolio with low-cap, high-upside tokens that are well-positioned to ride the upcoming boom. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Powering a Telegram Trading Bot for Meme Coin Sniping Snorter Token ($SNORT) is one of the best cryptos to buy now for those looking to ride the explosive growth of the meme coin market. While altcoins continue to dominate crypto discussions, the meme coin segment alone has grown by more than 70% in the past year , proving there’s so much more juice in it than many realize. $SNORT powers the Snorter Bot, a new Telegram-native trading bot designed to level the playing field between institutional players and everyday meme coin traders. How? By allowing retail investors to set buy/sell orders in advance, and then automatically executing them the moment liquidity kicks in. As a result, you’ll finally get the chance to participate in those early meme coin pumps, where life-changing gains are usually made. Security is another standout. Snorter offers protection against a wide range of on-chain threats, including front-running, rug pulls, honeypots, and even advanced sandwich attacks. By buying $SNORT , you’re positioning yourself to ride the adoption of Snorter Bot while unlocking a slew of exclusive benefits along the way: A potential 800% ROI by year-end, according to our $SNORT price prediction Reduced trading fees: just 0.85% compared to 1.50% charged to non-holders No daily sniping limits Advanced analytics Staking rewards, currently yielding 128% Currently in presale, $SNORT has already pulled in over $3.55M from early investors, with each token available at just $0.1027. Visit Snorter Token’s official website for more information. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Community-Backed Meme Coin Aiming to Overtake Dogecoin Maxi Doge ($MAXI) might not have a shiny whitepaper or game-changing technology, but its absurd mission to overthrow Dogecoin as the best meme coin on the planet has already gathered plenty of hype and community support. The project has raised over $1.66M in early investor funding, proving that degen investors are hungry for a wild, rage-fueled meme coin. What’s Maxi Doge , really? Believe it or not, Maxi is Dogecoin’s distant cousin. But the two are anything but close. Dogecoin’s popularity left Maxi in the shadows growing up, as the elder, more ‘wholesome’ Shiba Inu hogged all the limelight at family gatherings. That’s when Maxi found solace in the gym and in front of the charts, where he built big muscles and chased even bigger gains. Now, backed by a fierce community of $MAXI holders who all subscribe to his mantra of ‘never skip leg day, never skip a pump’, the dawg is ready to take the market by storm. In addition to allocating a chunky 40% of its total token supply to marketing, $MAXI will also host regular holder-only events, including weekly trading competitions and leaderboard prizes, all aimed at amplifying the noise around it. Interested? Join the tribe by buying $MAXI at just $0.0002545 apiece. Hurry up, though, because the price will increase in just a few hours. Check out Maxi Doge’s official website for more information. 3. Ethereum ($ETH) – Digital Silver Prepping for a Fresh Breakout Ethereum ($ETH) has undoubtedly been the talk of the crypto town over the past two weeks, with whales pouring big money into the ‘digital silver.’ For instance, BlackRock recently snapped up more than $314M worth of Ethereum , while Goldman Sachs and Jane Street grabbed a combined 192.5K $ETH . More notably, Thomas Lee, a significant voice in the crypto space, explained that while Wall Street once dismissed Ethereum for being slower than Solana or Sui, institutions are now betting big on it because of its ability to deliver 100% uptime – something non-negotiable for big-money players. ‘ If ETH stays above $4,800, we could see a really big cycle ,’ Lee added. That prediction looks even stronger when you consider that a massive $4.65B worth of shorts would be liquidated if Ethereum retests its all-time high. Although $ETH has been red all week, the drop isn’t as bad as it looks – because its weekly candle remains within last week’s range. According to the technical playbook, this forms a classic ‘inside candle’ pattern, and a breakout here could trigger an explosive rally. Wrapping Up With Ripple’s CEO projecting a nearly tenfold increase in crypto’s valuation by 2030, the stage is set for promising altcoins like $SNORT , $MAXI , and $ETH to shine in the upcoming bull run. That said, kindly bear in mind that crypto investments are highly risky.

In the analysis, the AI model emphasized that, whether aiming for a $10,000 portfolio value or generating a profit from XRP within twelve months, investors must decide how much to buy, at what level to sell, and whether to hold or trade around volatility. To this end, ChatGPT offered several scenarios. Scenarios for making $10,000 from XRP For smaller investors starting with $1,000 at the current XRP price of $2.80, the portfolio would grow to $10,000 only if the token surged nearly tenfold to about $28.80. Such an outcome, ChatGPT-5 noted, would require a major catalyst such as regulatory wins for Ripple, global adoption, or the approval of an XRP ETF . A medium investor with $5,000 could more realistically achieve the target if XRP climbs to around $5.76. This aligns with analyst projections that place the cryptocurrency between $4.50 and $5.50 by year-end. For larger investors committing $10,000, the path is the most straightforward. With 3,472 XRP purchased, even a doubling in price to $5.76 would deliver a $10,000 profit, without the need for extreme price appreciation. How to make $10,000 from XRP. Source: ChatGPT As for strategies, ChatGPT-5 highlighted four approaches: holding through a bull run and aiming for $5 to $10, swing trading the 15% and 30% fluctuations, using leverage for amplified gains, or applying dollar-cost averaging to build a position gradually. At the same time, according to the AI, the most realistic route for investors with $5,000 and $10,000 is to hold until XRP reaches between $5 and $10. Smaller investors would need either a dramatic rally toward $25 or more, or an active trading approach to compound profits. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.81, down 1.64% in the last 24 hours, while on the weekly timeline, the asset has plunged almost 8%. XRP seven-day price chart.

According to information provided by sources familiar with the matter, the Senate Banking Committee aims to hold a markup hearing on September 30 for the bill titled “Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025.” The bill specifically aims to clarify the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) role in crypto markets. A markup session will give committee members an opportunity to propose amendments to the bill. The committee can then decide to submit the legislation to the full Senate.

Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, Cynthia Lummis, Bill Hagerty, and Bernie Moreno released a discussion draft of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act in July. This step comes shortly after the House of Representatives passed the CLARITY Act. Senators will release an updated bill before the markup session. The two separate bills need to be combined into a single bill during the legislative process. Lummis, speaking at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium this month, stated that he aims to get the crypto market structure bill to President Donald Trump's desk by Thanksgiving. The CLARITY Act passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 294-134, with 78 Democrats supporting it.

Remittix is rapidly moving to the top of the preferred list of smart investors with all its promising updates and possible explosive growth. Solana ETF news could spark huge gains for SOL Solana (SOL) is currently trading at around $211. In August, Solana’s DeFi value locked reached an impressive $11.7 billion, but the price still struggles to break through key levels. A Solana ETF news update could change this, as ETF approvals could propel SOL to new heights. Many analysts are predicting that Solana could see a price surge following the approval of a Solana ETF, but others are calling $200 a resistance level . While approval odds for 2025 are now at 75%, the upcoming ETF launch could push Solana’s price above $455 even $500, making it one of the most optimistic price forecasts for SOL. This is based on an ascending triangle pattern signaling a bullish continuation. A breakout above the resistance zone at $213.75 could push Solana to new highs, especially if the ETF momentum continues to grow. source: melikatrader94 on TradingView Dogecoin price updates show short-term struggles, but long-term potential Dogecoin’s latest news shows DOGE trading at around $0.2178, consolidating between $0.22 and $0.23. Despite strong support at $0.20–$0.21 , the meme-coin king has faced downward pressure due to a $200 million whale transfer that triggered a selloff. However, this price dip could be a brief correction before DOGE rebounds. Some analysts suggest DOGE could see a 30% price increase if the current consolidation phase is followed by a breakout. There are also signs of whale accumulation, with major holders moving 680 million DOGE into cold storage throughout August. If the price holds support and breaks through the resistance levels, DOGE could skyrocket to $0.30 or higher, with $1 being a possible target in 2026. source: CobraVanguard on TradingView Why Remittix is the real altcoin to watch Currently priced at $0.1000, Remittix has already raised over $22.2 million through the sale of 628 million tokens, and the token is gaining attention for its utility-based PayFi infrastructure. The big news? Remittix has already announced its first CEX listing on BitMart, and with the token now surpassing $22 million in sales, the next CEX listing is set for LBANK. Also, the Remittix Beta Wallet will become available on September 15, 2025, and it will provide a smooth platform to convert crypto-to-fiat payments. It is a breakthrough for the token, since it increases its usefulness to include not only speculation, but also general usage. Here’s why Remittix could do 30x: Confirmed CEX listing on BitMart and LBANK Beta Wallet launching in September 2025 Real-world PayFi infrastructure bridging crypto-to-fiat transactions Massive growth potential with a 30x ROI predicted by analysts Rapid adoption and real utility make Remittix a serious contender Conclusion While Solana ETF news could drive SOL to new heights and Dogecoin price updates suggest potential short-term bounces, Remittix is emerging as the altcoin with the most promising future. With a strong utility-driven approach, Remittix is set to benefit from real-world adoption and growing demand, making it the ideal choice for investors looking for massive returns.

However, a new filing with the agency may have a better chance of success. NEW: @AmplifyETFs just filed for an XRP option income ETF pic.twitter.com/LbJQ6NOEeK — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 29, 2025 New XRP ETF Filing Filed by Amplify ETFs, an Illinois-based investment company with $12.6 billion in AUM as of July 31, the new XRP ETF application will work quite differently from a regular spot one. For instance, a spot ETF holds the underlying asset directly, while the Options Income variation uses options strategies (mainly covered calls) on XRP (in this case) to generate steady monthly income (yield) for its investors. In general, such ETFs gain some form of exposure to the underlying asset (which can include direct purchases), sell call options on the holdings to collect premiums, and distribute the proceeds to investors as monthly income. The options expire on a monthly basis, allowing the ETF to reset its strategy at the end of each month and pay income regularly to shareholders, which becomes a predictable but capped yield. As such, the Monthly Options Income ETF relies more on a steady monthly income rather than a massive price surge for the underlying asset. Better Chance of Success? The US SEC has seen numerous changes in its leadership and approach to crypto regulation in 2025. The departure of Gary Gensler, who had led an all-out assault against the industry, allowed the regulator to undertake a more moderate approach, resulting in countless dropped lawsuits, including a positive resolution in the SEC v. Ripple case. However, the agency is yet to greenlight a spot XRP ETF, even though many futures-based ones saw the light of day. To this day, the SEC keeps delaying making a decision on all filings. As such, many industry participants and commentators indicated that Amplify ETFs’ application could be approved sooner, as it differs from a regular spot XRP ETF. Nevertheless, prediction markets and experts still believe that the SEC will greenlight a spot XRP ETF this year. Data from Polymarket shows that the current odds for such a product to hit the US markets in 2025 are at almost 90%.

While Solana trades near $210 with targets toward $300–$400 and Cardano consolidates around $0.85 with $2 forecasts, neither offers the same explosive potential and real-world use case that RTX brings to the table. Investors are now shifting from traditional Layer 1s to utility-first projects with explosive growth potential, and Remittix is quickly becoming the next breakout altcoin of 2025. Let’s dive in. Solana price momentum faces resistance amid ETF delays Solana is holding steady around $210, with analysts pointing to possible upside toward $224 and higher. However, ETF approval delays have cooled near-term momentum, leaving price growth dependent on macro conditions and inflows. Solana’s fundamentals remain strong, fast transactions, low fees, and growing DeFi adoption, but its short-term upside appears capped until regulators move forward. Medium-term, Solana could move to eclipse its ATH at $295 and grind towards $300, but for investors seeking outsized returns this year, the biggest opportunities lie elsewhere. Cardano shows resilience amid whale accumulation Cardano sits near $0.85, buoyed by whale accumulation and a $71 million community-approved upgrade fund. Short-term targets point to $0.94–$1.04, with potential long-term expansion above $2 in 2025 if network upgrades succeed. Yet, while Cardano remains fundamentally strong, its growth curve looks slower compared to projects designed for immediate mass adoption. Enter Remittix. Remittix: The next big altcoin under $1 you can’t afford to miss If you’ve ever regretted missing out early on ETH or XRP, Remittix is definitely your second chance. At just $0.10, RTX is laser-focused on a $19 trillion remittance industry, offering instant crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries with rock-bottom fees and real-time FX conversion. This isn’t hype, it’s adoption. Over $22 million has already been raised and a Q3 wallet is set to ignite more demand. Unlike inflationary tokens, RTX deploys deflationary mechanics with token burns, ensuring scarcity as adoption grows. Why investors are piling in: Global Reach: 30+ countries, direct crypto-to-bank transfers Real Utility: Not speculation, real payments that solve a trillion-dollar pain point Deflationary Tokenomics: Built for sustainable, exponential growth Strong Momentum: $22 Million raised, community of 25,000 holders and growing fast This is where the FOMO is real, early buyers are locking in before the next milestone sends RTX soaring. RTX momentum: The clock is ticking Remittix’s $250,000 giveaway has already pulled in over 300,000 participants, amplifying community hype. Every presale phase is bringing higher entry costs, meaning those who hesitate now will likely pay more later, or worse, miss the run entirely. In 2025, Remittix is where the life-changing upside is with Solana and Cardano having decent returns. RTX is one of the most promising moonshots in 2025 due to its formation of a clear roadmap, real-world demand, and aggressive exchange rollout. The present cycle may have gains of 4,500% and more to investors who make this move now. Don’t be left on the other side when RTX breaks out.

The report uncovers how platform tokens, with Mantle (MNT) at the forefront, are emerging as essential pillars of liquidity, governance, and ecosystem growth. August 2025 has marked a historic month for digital assets, with both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) reaching new all-time highs. This market surge has created powerful momentum for platform tokens, which are increasingly recognized not only as trading incentives but also as critical components of exchange-driven ecosystem strategies. Key Highlights Mantle (MNT): Strengthened by Bybit’s Mantle 2.0 launch and integrated across loan, staking, and structured products. On-chain insights: Santiment data highlights whale redistribution patterns and elevated MVRV ratios for MNT. Ecosystem impact: Bybit’s MiCAR-compliant staking framework in Europe reinforces regulatory alignment and long-term value creation. Mantle (MNT): Exchange-Driven Momentum Launched in July 2023 following its rebrand from BitDAO, Mantle has quickly risen as a high-performance Layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution designed to reduce costs and improve throughput for decentralized applications. Bybit has strategically embedded MNT within its platform, including loan offerings, staking programs, and structured investment products. Santiment data shows sharp increases in $100K+ and $1M+ whale transactions during MNT rallies, often signaling both accumulation and redistribution phases. Bybit’s MiCAR-compliant staking program in Europe further underscores Mantle’s regulatory-ready integration. Combined with creator-focused initiatives and structured product innovations, Mantle is evolving into a cornerstone asset, demonstrating how a platform token can anchor vibrant and engaged ecosystems. Platform Tokens: An Industry-Wide Trend Beyond Mantle, the Bybit × Santiment report highlights that platform tokens are gaining prominence across the industry. Once limited to fee discounts and basic incentives, these tokens are now deeply embedded in exchange ecosystems, powering governance, liquidity, and user engagement. Their structural role demonstrates how platform tokens have become essential to the long-term growth of the digital asset economy. The Era of Platform Tokens The Bybit × Santiment report concludes that platform tokens like Mantle are no longer secondary incentives but structural pillars of the modern crypto economy. Their integration across liquidity, governance, and product ecosystems creates strong network effects and a self-reinforcing flywheel of adoption. As user engagement and developer activity expand, Mantle’s demand is set to grow in tandem, positioning it as a key driver of Bybit’s ecosystem and a cornerstone of global crypto infrastructure. #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk / #BybitResearch / #IMakeIt About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 60 million users.

The company, which was until recently a Tokyo-listed operator of nail salons, now wants to become one of the corporations owning a large stash of the asset. Over the last few months, there have been plenty of corporations reinventing their financial landscape, with most of them pushing into the crypto industry. While the crypto market is seeing a boom, the Japanese firm has unveiled its ambitious plans. It intends to raise 434 billion yen (approximately $3 billion) to acquire 21,000 Bitcoin, which is equivalent to 0.1% of the total supply. Japanese firm wants to become a Bitcoin holder At the time of the announcement , Convano boasted a market value that was a fraction of that sum. However, since the announcement, its shares have more than doubled. In addition, its report on August 25 showed that the Japanese company has raised 2% of the needed funds and now holds about 365 Bitcoin . To make sure it actualizes its dreams, Convano is looking to adopt the same model popularized by Michael Saylor. This means that the firm will generate retail and institutional interest, lift the share price, and then convert it into capital to further its resolve concerning the purchase of Bitcoin. “We will enhance corporate value with the new plan, which will increase our stock price 10 times,” said Motokiyo Azuma, a director at Convano. Azuma is also in charge of the firm’s finance and crypto strategies. In the world of crypto, highlighting big ambitions is part of the model that has helped big companies thrive. Huge targets, even those far beyond the immediate reach of companies, have also served the function. They set expectations high, attract the needed attention, and in turn, move the market long enough to make that plan work. The Japanese company also said it is presenting the pivot as a rational response to macroeconomic pressures. The yen has been in a prolonged slide, with the currency weakening 21% against the dollar in the past decade, pushing up the costs of wages and raw materials for its consumer services and business. “We started to think about Bitcoin because of the persistent yen depreciation and geopolitical risks,” Azuma said. “Bitcoin is a long-term store of value.” Japan emerges as a center for Bitcoin accumulation The funds raised by the Japanese firm so far have seen 4.5 billion yen come from corporate bonds. The firm wants to acquire Bitcoin in three phases, pegging the average price of each coin at 19.9 million yen. Nomura Securities and SMBC Nikko Securities are expected to act as brokers, with the company remaining tight-lipped on an anchor investor or timeline for completing the fundraising. Japan has emerged as a surprising center for the business of Bitcoin accumulation via listed vehicles. Metaplanet, a firm that formerly operated in the hotel and hospitality scene, has accumulated about 19,000 Bitcoin, placing it among the top 10 holders globally. The risk in that space remains the momentum behind crypto treasuries. So many PIPE and SPAC deals have been used to turn several low-growth companies into crypto proxies, with the results being mixed. Ethzilla, a firm backed by Peter Thiel, lost more than half of its value days after becoming an Ethereum accumulator. “You can’t limp in,” said Michael Bucella, co-founder of Neoclassic Capital, a crypto investment manager. “You need to come in with size and be quick.” Even several big companies are undergoing pains or increasing the pace of their Bitcoin purchases. For Convano, its plan depends not only on Bitcoin’s appeal but also on the company’s ability to sustain investor confidence. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

BTC and ETH Stay Strong, but an Altcoin Is Moving to Hit $5",https://timestabloid.com/which-crypto-to-buy-today-for-long-term-roi-btc-and-eth-stay-strong/,"For years, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have remained the foundation of every serious crypto investment portfolio. Both assets provide stability, steady appreciation, and serve as the blue-chip benchmarks of the industry. Yet, long-term investors know that allocating only to the top two cryptocurrencies limits the upside available in the market. As new projects are launched with stronger structural mechanics, tactical exposure to early-stage tokens can radically improve portfolio performance. For investors evaluating what is going on with crypto today, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the standout DeFi project positioned to deliver outsized long-term ROI. Why MUTM’s Fundamentals Support A $5 Target Unlike tokens that rely solely on speculation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has embedded utility at its core. The project’s design will route protocol-generated fee revenue into continuous buybacks of MUTM, which will then be distributed to mtToken stakers. This will create permanent, automated demand for the token. At the same time, the planned Layer-2 integration will lower transaction costs and accelerate throughput, making the protocol more competitive. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also plans to introduce a $1 stablecoin that will deepen lending demand and ensure persistent borrowing activity, further reinforcing the buyback engine. The financial implications for investors are significant. Consider a patient buyer who commits $2,000 at the current Phase 6 presale price of $0.035. This allocation secures 57,100 MUTM tokens. With the long-term target price set at $5, this position will be valued at $285,700. That means a net profit of $283,700. These returns are anchored in utility, not hype. Repeated revenue-driven buybacks, a live beta at listing, and the natural discovery process of expected exchange listings will work in tandem to make this $5 thesis realistic for long-term users following crypto predictions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining strong traction during presale. The token has a total supply of 4 billion, with Phase 6 having already generated around $15.14 million. The current presale price is $0.035 and the project already has over 15,850 holders. Out of the 170 million tokens allocated for this phase, 30% have already been sold. Importantly, the project has been through a CertiK audit, using manual review and static analysis, and achieved a Token Scan Score of 95.00 alongside a Skynet Score of 78.00. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also attracted over 12,000 Twitter followers, while its audit timeline was first requested on February 25, 2025, and revised on May 20, 2025. These details strengthen transparency and reinforce long-term credibility for anyone analyzing crypto charts. Alongside its P2C lending system, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will integrate a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace that will appeal to a different segment of capital. In this model, lenders and borrowers will negotiate directly on APYs, loan durations, and terms. The protocol will allow partial fills to give greater flexibility and ensure a wider match of counterparties. All settlements will be enforced through smart contracts, removing counterparty risk and maintaining security. Roadmap and The Longer-Term Mechanics That Sustain ROI The roadmap for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is structured to deliver visibility, adoption, and long-term price support. Phase 6 of the presale is already in motion, and the move to Phase 7 will trigger a 15% increase in token price. Once the presale closes, the project will debut with a beta release at token listing, giving users the ability to test and interact with core features from the start. Layer-2 integration will follow, boosting efficiency and accelerating the pace of lending and borrowing activity. Each cycle of lending will feed protocol revenue back into MUTM buybacks, which will be redistributed to mtToken stakers, building sustained demand that will compound over time. As expected exchange listings on platforms like Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, MEXC, and Kraken expand liquidity and bring in more retail participation, the demand mechanics will begin to exert even greater pressure. Each redistribution round will reduce the amount of MUTM available on the open market, aligning directly with the $5 price target that long-term investors are analyzing in their crypto predictions. Final Verdict For traders watching what is going on with crypto today, this pathway is clear: secure discounted exposure while Phase 6 remains open. With 30% already sold and the next phase set to raise the price by 15%, the opportunity to position before broader market discovery is rapidly closing. For those balancing BTC and ETH with targeted exposure to high-conviction DeFi, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers the kind of asymmetric upside that can elevate overall returns. The mechanics are transparent, the audits are complete, and the roadmap is clear. Long-term ROI will not come from speculation but from utility, adoption, and constant buyback-driven demand — and that is precisely the advantage that positions MUTM to outperform.

The SUI Price today shows steady strength, driven by record network activity and growing institutional backing. Meanwhile, Remittix is stealing headlines with $22,3M+ raised, confirmed BitMart and LBank listings and its upcoming wallet beta. Analysts say RTX could be the altcoin delivering 7x gains next week. SUI Price Prediction Strengthens With Institutional Adoption Rising SUI News continues to heat up as whale activity drives inflows into the token. The SUI Price today sits at $3.48, up 1.5% on the day, backed by record network activity with 4.4 million daily transactions and over 605,000 active addresses. Analysts highlight that the fundamentals are catching up to the hype, setting the stage for a major breakout. The biggest spark came from Mill City Ventures’ rebrand to SUI Group Holdings, with 98% of a $450 million private placement directed into SUI’s treasury. Institutional confidence also surged after Swiss-regulated Sygnum Bank announced new custody and trading services for SUI, further validating its long-term adoption. On-chain data confirms strength, with DeepBook DEX hitting $100M in daily spot volume and weekly totals exceeding $457M. Technically, the SUI Price Prediction shows $3.45 as strong support , with the 50-day MA at $3.71 acting as immediate resistance. Analysts describe SUI as “coiled energy” ready to break higher, with symmetrical triangle patterns pointing to $6–$8 targets if momentum builds. The Sui Price Prediction highlights short-term upside of nearly 2x, with whales betting on even larger moves. While SUI dominates short-term chatter, Remittix is drawing attention with its $22M+ milestone, BitMart listing and upcoming LBank debut. Some traders believe SUI could break resistance next week, while RTX positions itself as the altcoin with 7x potential. Remittix $250K Giveaway Draws Thousands Ahead Of CEX Debut Whale investors are not just circling SUI News, they are also pouring into Remittix (RTX) , a PayFi token that is quickly shaping up to be one of the year’s biggest surprises. At $0.10 per token, with more than $22,2 million raised and over 630 million tokens sold, RTX is already attracting families, freelancers and businesses fed up with the cost and delays of international transfers. Remittix keeps it simple by solving an everyday problem: making money transfers seamless. $22.3M raised milestone with rapid community adoption underway BitMart confirmed listing, bringing global exposure and liquidity for RTX Upcoming LBank listing, adding momentum before public trading begins Wallet beta launches September 15th, first real product release for the ecosystem This real-world focus is why analysts believe RTX could deliver the kind of gains that whale traders are chasing. The $250,000 Remittix Giveaway has only amplified attention, and with major listings confirmed, RTX has the infrastructure to scale quickly. As whales drive inflows into both SUI and Remittix, market chatter suggests RTX could be the one delivering 7x gains in the near term.

Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a popular analyst on X, linked this upcoming event to XRP by referencing XRP’s parabolic move in late 2024 following similar rate cuts. Comparing the Charts He paired his comment with comparative charts illustrating how XRP reacted in 2024 and what could potentially happen in 2025. The 2024 chart shows that after the Fed completed a 25 basis point cut, XRP moved from below $0.50 to over $3 in early 2025, showing a sharp upward trajectory. The magnitude of the move exceeded 480% on the four-day chart, suggesting that monetary policy shifts had a significant influence on speculative flows into the cryptocurrency market at that time. Last September, when the Fed cut rates, #XRP went parabolic. Next decision: Sept 17 pic.twitter.com/Sv25N1EVEf — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 28, 2025 The 2025 chart projects a similar setup. XRP has been consolidating in a range between $2.90 and $3.30 following its all-time high of $3.65 in July . The visual comparison implies that another rate cut could bring conditions similar to last year, potentially igniting a new phase of upward momentum. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has held off on cutting rates throughout the year , and the market has been anticipating this move for an extended period. While no two market conditions are identical, the chart signals that XRP traders may be anticipating a repeat of the 2024 scenario if the Fed follows through with its expected cut. Influence of Monetary Policy Rate cuts by the Fed generally have wide-ranging effects on asset markets. They tend to weaken the U.S. dollar, reduce borrowing costs, and increase the appeal of riskier assets. Cryptocurrencies, including XRP, often respond positively to such changes because they benefit from the influx of liquidity and investor appetite for higher returns. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Donald Trump has consistently called for the Fed to cut rates . If another 25 basis point reduction is announced on September 17, traders may take it as a green light for another strong rally, particularly if broader risk assets join. Current Market Outlook At present, XRP remains subdued compared to its previous highs. Despite periods of accumulation , it has yet to break out decisively above resistance levels. The September meeting may provide the catalyst needed to establish a new direction. If history repeats, XRP could see a multi-dollar rally within a short time. However, this will also depend on external factors such as overall market sentiment, liquidity conditions, and investor risk tolerance.

It redefined the meaning of value and helped thousands of early adopters rake in tremendous gains. But LayerBrett, a new meme priced below 1 cent, looks like the better alternative for those in search of life-changing profits this year. Dogecoin marches towards $1 Dogecoin’s journey to the top is quite legendary. From its humble beginnings as a joke, it soared on the wings of viral enthusiasm, rallying strongly to be an online sensation that everyone wants to be a part of. DOGE experienced multiple surges, including its famous 2021 rally, which saw prices approach new heights and turned several people into crypto millionaires. Unfortunately, Dogecoin has never hit the $1 mark in spite of these numerous rallies. But that might be a thing of the past soon. That is because Dogecoin has spent the last couple of months consolidating, and the time is nigh for a bullish move. In terms of timeframe, Dogecoin price predictions anticipate this break above $1 in early 2026. Dogecoin price is expected to break through $0.50 from its current levels around $0.25 in late November, and hit the much coveted landmark in January or February of the next year. This would usher in decent profits for holders. However, experts believe that LayerBrett, a new meme sensation, would get to this price level first. 3 reasons LayerBrett could hit $1 before Dogecoin Reason #1. Utility and FUD immunity LayerBrett is expected to outperform Dogecoin because of its robust technological foundation. This is not like Dogecoin, which relies on hype and is vulnerable to FUD and speculation. LBRETT doubles as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, delivering fast, scalable and cost-efficient transactions. When the crypto market enters bullish mode at the end of the year, LBRETT would skyrocket to new highs, and being a utility token would make it appreciate higher than other meme coins. Reason #2. Passive staking income In addition to a much better boom potential, LBRETT also offers astonishing staking rewards— with APYs well above 1,400% in the presale phase. This feature enables holders to earn significant passive income simply by staking their tokens. It’s a benefit rarely found among meme coins. Such lucrative returns drive early adoption and support long-term holder commitment, building price stability and upward pressure. Reason #3. A massive boom potential While Dogecoin is already near market saturation and widely held, LayerBrett is just beginning its ascent. Still in presale, LBRETT has raised more than $1.9 million in record time, with the price still sitting at a minuscule $0.005 per token. This means there’s ample room for parabolic growth. Analysts forecast the possibility of 100x returns on exchange listing, far exceeding what late-stage DOGE can offer. Don’t miss out on LayerBrett Much too often, people complain about missing out on blue chip crypto assets when they were still unknown. LayerBrett is presenting that kind of opportunity now. It offers real explosive potential and looks set to hit $1 before Dogecoin does. Investors in search of the next 100x meme coin should take a close look at LayerBrett before the opportunity passes. Layer Brett is in presale now, but it’s moving fast. Get in early, stake while rewards are high, and don’t miss your shot at the next 100x crypto!

The project hinted at the possibility in a post on X. According to the post from the WLFI official account, USD1 is meeting the internet capital markets. The post also included an image showing the golden eagle icon of WLFI coated in the purple hues of Solana. It read: “USD1 meets internet capital markets. Announcement coming soon 🦅☝️.” While the project itself has yet to announce the deployment, a Twitter user known as CharlesWLFI and self-identified as Head of Solana Ecosystem for World Liberty Financial has confirmed it. Charles posted that USD1 will arrive on Solana sooner than anyone expected. He added that the project is just getting started. He posted: “USD1 is coming to Solana — sooner than you think. Thrilled to help bring @worldlibertyfi into the Solana ecosystem. We’re just getting started.” The user only joined X in August 2025, and the USD1 to Solana is their first post, enough to raise suspicions about their authenticity. However, WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff confirmed that Charles is part of the team, adding that the project is coming to Solana. Meanwhile, other reports further confirm that the speculation is likely true. DeFi protocol Raydium has also hinted at it, posting that “Solana is about to get a lot more stable” while BONK.fun stated that the story of the dog and eagle is set to start. Onchain data also supports the speculation, with one user sharing a SolScan screenshot showing that 100 million USD1 tokens have been minted on the network in preparation for the launch. USD1 continues expansion to boost adoption The potential deployment of USD1 on Solana continues WLFI’s efforts to increase adoption of the stablecoin. Since launching in April 2025, USD1 has seen sizable growth with its supply increasing by $2 billion in the first few days. However, its growth had plateaued since then and remained at $2.402 billion, enough to rank it sixth among top altcoins. Solana will be the fourth blockchain network to power the stablecoin, which is already live on BNB Smart Chain, Ethereum, and Tron Network. Interestingly, WLFI had already minted USD1 on Solana some days ago. The DeFi project at the time minted $30 million USD1 on Solana, with Witkoff stating that it is now available on the network. With its deployment on Solana, USD1 will be hoping to see broader and more diverse use across multiple chains. Currently, 88.52% of its $2.40 billion supply is on BSC, while Ethereum has over 10% and TRON has only 1%. However, the project has been pushing to increase usage through partnerships. Several exchanges already support it, including Coinbase , Binance, Bullish, Gate.io, and HTX. DeFi protocols, including JustLend on TRON, Moonpay, and PancakeSwap on BSC, also support the stablecoin. The stablecoin points program launched in early August also appears to be part of the efforts to boost adoption. Several exchanges, including Kucoin, MEXC, Bitget, Gate.io, and others, are all involved in the loyalty program. Stablecoins add $7 billion in one week Meanwhile, the USD1 effort to boost adoption comes amidst broader growth in the stablecoin market. According to DeFiLlama , the stablecoin market cap increased by $7.24 billion in the past seven days to hit a new high of $283.46 billion. This continues the trend of stablecoin expansion fueled by Ethena USDe and MakerDAO DAI. In the past month, the two stablecoins increased by 49.79% and 20.25% respectively, while Circle USDC rose by 12% to cross over $71 billion. USD1 only increased by 10% within that time. The growth of these stablecoins supplies, including smaller-cap ones such as PayPal PYUSD and Ripple RLUSD, which are up more than 20% in the past month, has impacted Tether USDT’s dominance. The leading stablecoin has a 59% dominance with a market cap of $167 billion. Interestingly, experts at CryptoQuant believe that stablecoin growth is already cooling, noting that recent weekly expansions peaked at $1.1 billion, far below the $4 billion to $8 billion in late 2024.

The crypto company announced the initial plan to disable its stablecoin support on these legacy chains in July, citing a shift in its business strategy. Tether justified this earlier decision with the claim of aligning its operations with the current shift in user behavior and increased focus on more scalable, actively developed blockchain networks. Also, the dwindling activity on some of these ecosystems was highlighted as one of the reasons behind freezing USDT operations. At the time, Tether advised customers with their USDT holdings on Omni Layer, Algorand, and the other affected blockchains to redeem their stablecoins before the September 1, 2025, deadline. However, it appears that these users won’t need to do this anymore following the issuer’s latest decision. What Did Tether Change In Its Plan? In a media release on its website, Tether disclosed that investors with USDT holdings on the five legacy blockchains will no longer have to redeem their coins before the September 1 deadline. While these ecosystems will stop supporting the USDT issuance and redemption, the revised plan will now allow users to transfer their USDT stablecoins across other blockchains. The media release read: Following the feedback from the communities of these discontinued blockchains, Tether has revised this approach and will not freeze the smart contracts on these networks. While users will still be able to transfer the tokens between wallets, Tether will discontinue direct issuance and redemption on these blockchains. This means the tokens will no longer be officially supported as other Tether tokens. According to the crypto company, this revised plan correlates with the broader strategy to expand support for crypto ecosystems with strong developer activity, scalability, and user demand. “Tether remains committed to a smooth transition and will continue to engage with the community to ensure transparency and clarity throughout this process,” the stablecoin issuer added. Tron and Ethereum lead the blockchain pack in terms of USDT adoption, with $80.9 billion and $72.4 billion of the Tether stablecoins circulating in their ecosystems. Meanwhile, the BNB Chain boasts the third-largest USDT supply worth around $6.78 billion. USDT Market Cap As of this writing, the total market capitalization of Tether’s USDT stands at roughly $167.4 billion, according to data from CoinGecko.",Tether (USDT)|Algorand|Ethereum|OmniChain|Tether|tron|USDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|USDT|ALGO|BCH|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-30 11:00:29

Interest in Hyperliquid is surging as traders chase momentum. Amid that tidal wave, Remittix stands quietly strong with its $250,000 giveaway and Q3 wallet beta launch, gaining attention in pockets looking beyond hype. Let us unpack the Hyperliquid rise and why Remittix is getting tagged as the altcoin set for real growth amid the noise. Hyperliquid outpaces Robinhood and fuels excitement Hyperliquid recorded $330.8 billion in trading volume for July, alone surpassing Robinhood’s $237.8 billion across all assets, marking its third straight month in the lead. Early August data shows volume already exceeding $349 billion, reinforcing Hyperliquid’s dominance in decentralized trading. Its native token, HYPE, hit a new all-time high near $51, gaining 8% in 24 hours after this trading boom. Traders are hyped, but technical charts show resistance forming, suggesting momentum may wane if not supported by fundamentals. Remittix Readies for Breakout Beyond Analysts’ Target of $1 Remittix appeals to those who prefer substance over hype. Its trajectory may be less flashy than Hyperliquid’s volume figures, but its foundation in fintech use case growth could translate into lasting value, not just hype-based spikes. The token is priced at $0.10, has sold over 630 million tokens and raised over $22,3 million. It secured a BitMart listing once it passed $20 million and followed with a second CEX listing on LBANK confirmed surpassing $22 million. A Q3 2025 wallet beta launch is coming and a $250,000 community giveaway is live to drive awareness. Here is what puts Remittix in a different class than hype-fuelled volume: Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Direct crypto-to-bank transfers in more than 30 countries Utility-first token powering actual transaction volume Built for adoption, not for speculation Time-sensitive entry point before listings and parabolic growth Where Hype Ends and Utility Begins Hyperliquid’s August dominance over Robinhood is a stark reminder that DeFi innovation can outpace traditional players when speed and design align. That campaign drives excitement around HYPE token speculation. Remittix , by contrast, quietly advances toward user-first global finance. Its suite of listings, wallet beta, giveaways and real-world payments infrastructure may yield steadier upside. For savvy watchers, the substance behind Remittix could be the real story under this Hyperliquid hype.

The post outlined a near-term outlook for both assets, noting potential upside ranges in the coming 1 to 3 weeks. Both charts show strong advances earlier in the year, followed by consolidation patterns highlighted within a shaded area. The accompanying annotations display key resistance lines and target ranges. For XRP, the projection extends to a zone between $4 and $5, while HBAR is indicated within $0.40 to $0.50. $XRP & $HBAR target range for the next 1-3 weeks! pic.twitter.com/P966CjtP36 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 29, 2025 XRP Price Structure and Momentum Both charts show comparable performance with a strong upward rally in late 2024 leading into early 2025, an extended consolidation phase , and another notable rally in July. One of the major differences is that XRP hit a new all-time high in July. However, HBAR failed to reclaim its peak. Both assets have also slowed down due to resistance. The highlighted circles on the charts mark another consolidation period, suggesting a balance of buying and selling pressure before the next move. Heikin Ashi candles are used to smooth volatility, emphasizing trend strength more clearly than standard candlesticks. The Relative Strength Indexes (RSIs) for both assets also sit around the same range. XRP is shown at 63.80, and HBAR is at 64.45. Both remain below the overbought threshold of 70, indicating firm bullish momentum. The chart also marks a downward-sloping line across recent RSI peaks, signaling a bearish divergence . While price action has continued, momentum has trended lower, raising caution about the sustainability of a breakout attempt. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Near-Term Targets Despite this divergence, the charts show a clear short-term roadmap. The lower target for XRP is $4, with the upper boundary of the projected channel at $5. This prediction suggests that the asset could hit a new all-time high in 1 to 3 weeks. The analyst has bullish expectations for HBAR, setting a target range of $0.40 to $0.50. However, this would place the asset just below its peak of $0.5701, which it reached in 2021. Achieving these levels would likely require both assets to post consistent closes above their identified resistance lines while maintaining momentum strength. Despite the market downturn over the past 24 hours , Steph is confident that both assets can reach these targets, suggesting this bearish phase will be short-lived.

In August alone, inflows have jumped 44%, now totaling $13.7B . On August 11th, in particular, $ETH recorded its highest-ever single-day inflow: over $1B. Most of this demand is coming from companies and institutions hoarding $ETH as bullish pressure continues to build. Currently, about 3.7% of the total $ETH supply is held by corporations in the form of treasuries. Of this, Bitmine Immersion Tech leads the pack with $7.81B worth of $ETH, followed by SharpLink Gaming with $3.48B. Considering $ETH has already surged more than 80% in the past two months, now trading around $4,378, the real question is: are big-money players simply chasing price, or do they know something we don’t? Is $ETH becoming the next $BTC? Read on as we break down why Ethereum’s growth is accelerating. Plus, we’ll reveal the 3 best cryptos to buy now to ride the upcoming ‘digital silver’ bull run. What Is Driving Ethereum’s Growth? Several key factors are fueling ETH’s growth, one of the most important being the GENIUS Act . It seeks to regulate the issuance and governance of dollar-pegged stablecoins, bringing much-needed clarity and legal context to the broader cryptocurrency markets. Another major driver is the 401(k) amendment , which now allows cryptocurrencies to be included as an investment option in retirement funds. This is a huge positive for $ETH, as it opens the doors for both institutional and retail investors to adopt it as a diversification tool. On the technical side, Ethereum’s upgrade roadmap continues to make the network more accessible and utility-driven. The recent Pectra upgrade bundled 11 EIPs to improve speed and usability. It also raised the validator staking limit from 32 $ETH to 2,048 $ETH, enabling smoother management along with faster rewards and exits. Even better? $ETH has more upgrades on the horizon. Fusaka (expected in November 2025) will focus on faster block times and infrastructure refinements. Glamsterdam (2026) aims at broader performance enhancements. These continuous updates will ensure Ethereum maintains its position at the forefront of DeFi and Web3. If you’re building a crypto portfolio, there couldn’t be a better time. With $ETH looking strong on both fundamental and technical fronts, a sharp rise could trigger a wider crypto bull run. Here are 3 top altcoins you can buy now to make the most of this opportunity. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – The First Layer 2 Solution for Bitcoin With Better Speed and Scalability Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is transforming the Bitcoin blockchain by adding Layer 2 features and compatibility to an otherwise ‘old school’ network. While Bitcoin is often referred to as the ‘digital gold’ of the modern era, it still lags behind the likes of Solana and Ethereum in the Web3 and DeFi space. That’s exactly what $HYPER aims to change. Through its Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, $HYPER brings Solana-like speed and scalability to Bitcoin. Currently, the Bitcoin blockchain can process only 7 transactions per second, since it executes them one by one. With SVM, however, multiple transactions can be processed simultaneously through parallel execution (as long as they aren’t inter-related). This drastically boosts throughput and ensures faster speeds. On top of that, the SVM integration allows developers to run smart contracts and build dApps directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. $HYPER also employs a decentralized canonical bridge, enabling users to swap their Layer 1 Bitcoin tokens for utility-driven Layer 2 Bitcoins on a 1:1 basis. These L2 tokens can then be used to participate in DeFi, from staking and lending to DAOs, NFTs, gaming, and more. This added utility is likely why the $HYPER presale has pulled in over $12.8M from early investors. Currently priced at $0.012825, $HYPER is predicted to surge to $0.32 by the end of 2025 – a potential 2,400% gain. If you want to hop on the $HYPER train, here’s a step-by-step guide on how to buy $HYPER . Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website for more information. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Powering the Best Non-Custodial, Multi-Chain Wallet Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the in-house cryptocurrency of Best Wallet , a non-custodial, multi-chain crypto wallet built with a security-first approach. For starters, the wallet leverages Fireblocks’ MPC security tech for enhanced protection. Plus, since it’s non-custodial, only you control the private keys, eliminating the risk of third-party interference. On top of that, you can further strengthen security by enabling multi-factor authentication, including biometric login. One standout feature of Best Wallet is its Presale Aggregator section, which lets you discover and buy the best crypto presales before they hit mainstream hype. Convenience is another big plus. You don’t even need to leave the app to buy presale tokens. Everything can be done directly within the wallet, ensuring a seamless and secure experience. Better yet, every token listed is pre-vetted by Best Wallet’s internal team to ensure you don’t fall victim to scams. Looking ahead, Best Wallet aims to capture 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market share by 2027, and you can be part of this by buying $BEST . Holding $BEST also unlocks early-bird access to presale cryptos, staking rewards (currently 87%), reduced trading and gas fees, and platform voting rights. Currently, 1 $BEST token is priced at just $0.025555, and the presale has already surpassed $15.2M in funding. Check out $BEST’s official website for more information. 3. Solana ($SOL) – Sixth-Largest Crypto With Rising Institutional Inflows Alongside Ethereum, Solana ($SOL) has become one of the hottest cryptos attracting heavy institutional investment. This month alone, firms like Bit Mining and DeFi Development Corp have scooped up 27K and 110K $SOL, respectively. Meanwhile, Pantera Capital has announced plans to raise $1.25B to launch Solana Co. , a $SOL-focused treasury company modeled after MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy. $SOL has surged more than 114% since early April and is now trading above the $200 mark. Plus, sentiment is equally bullish on the ETF front. Polymarket currently shows a staggering >99% chance of Solana ETF approval , while Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart puts the odds of seeing a live SOL ETF before the end of the year at 95% . From a technical perspective, $SOL appears to be consolidating around $200. A short-term dip toward $180 could act as a springboard, potentially sending the token above $250 in the coming weeks. If you’re looking to add a trusted large-cap crypto with high upside potential to your portfolio, now may be the perfect time to buy $SOL. Wrapping Up With institutional buying and ETF inflows into $ETH on the rise, the token is inching closer to the $5K mark. So if you’re looking to build a crypto portfolio, now could be the perfect time. You can start by picking up some Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , which adds a new layer of scalability, speed, and Web3 compatibility to the Bitcoin blockchain. Then, consider stacking Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , the driving force behind Best Wallet , which is a non-custodial wallet you can use to securely store, swap, buy, and sell cryptos. Last but not least, adding some Solana ($SOL) could help diversify your portfolio and keep it relatively ‘safe,’ thanks to $SOL’s mainstream adoption, strong institutional inflows, and upcoming ETF momentum. That said, crypto investments remain risky and are influenced by both micro- and macroeconomic factors. This article is not financial advice.

50910698,https://invezz.com/?p=2856169,1756552370,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,DOGE news: why holders are backing latest trending altcoins like Remittix in Aug,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/30/doge-news-why-holders-are-backing-latest-trending-altcoins-like-remittix-in-aug/,"Dogecoin may be stabilizing near $0.22, but DOGE News shows many holders are searching for fresh opportunities. With rallies capped and momentum slowing, attention is shifting toward trending altcoins offering real utility. Remittix (RTX) , which has raised $22M, secured BitMart and LBank listings, and is set to launch its wallet beta, is quickly becoming the top choice for investors seeking growth beyond Dogecoin in August. Dogecoin news confirms $5 million inflows as accumulation resumes Dogecoin News shows the meme coin holding steady near $0.223 after weeks of swings inside a descending parallel channel. The DOGE Price today continues to test the balance between bulls and bears, with $0.20 acting as firm support and $0.24 capping rallies. Technical charts highlight consolidation, as moving averages tighten around the $0.22 zone, leaving traders waiting for a decisive move. Momentum is cautiously improving. The RSI has rebounded to 54, suggesting room for more upside without hitting overbought levels. Liquidity flows add weight to the case for accumulation, with net inflows of $5.10 million breaking the streak of persistent outflows that dominated much of the summer. The Dogecoin Price Prediction now hinges on whether buyers can force a breakout above $0.24 to open the door toward $0.26–$0.28. On the downside, a failure to defend $0.20 risks a deeper correction toward $0.18–$0.19, levels that would reset bullish momentum. While DOGE Price Prediction models point to stability, holders are diversifying into trending tokens like Remittix (RTX). With recent developments, RTX is quickly becoming the alternative that many Dogecoin investors are backing for the next leg of the bull run. Remittix momentum grows as Dogecoin holders join in Dogecoin may still grab headlines, but many long-term holders are exploring new opportunities in trending projects like Remittix (RTX) . While DOGE News highlights stabilization around $0.22, investors are realizing the value of tokens that solve real problems. Remittix stands out by offering instant crypto-to-fiat conversions across 40+ cryptos, making it simple to send funds directly to bank accounts worldwide. This is a utility that meme coins simply can’t match. $22M milestone achieved with over 628 million tokens sold at $0.10 each BitMart confirmed as the first CEX listing, providing instant liquidity for RTX Upcoming LBank listing further expands access for global investors Wallet beta launches September 15th, showcasing real-world use before public trading Unlike Dogecoin, which relies heavily on speculation, Remittix is building a PayFi platform designed for real adoption in the $19 trillion payments market. Analysts now predict an 800% surge in value before listings begin, pointing to RTX as one of the few altcoins that blends hype with real impact. With the $250,000 Remittix Giveaway fueling further attention, Dogecoin holders see RTX as the logical next step. For many, it represents not just the latest trend but the smarter long-term play.

Key Takeaways: Elon Musk’s lawyer Alex Spiro will chair a new $200M public company aimed at building a Dogecoin treasury. The venture, backed by the Dogecoin Foundation’s House of Doge, offers DOGE exposure without direct token ownership. It joins a growing list of firms adding Dogecoin to corporate balance sheets amid rising institutional interest. The venture is being pitched to investors as a dedicated Dogecoin holding vehicle backed by the House of Doge , the corporate entity created by the Dogecoin Foundation in early 2025. Headquartered in Miami, House of Doge has emerged as the central force in institutionalizing the memecoin. New Public Vehicle to Offer Dogecoin Exposure Without Direct Ownership The company plans to offer stock-market exposure to Dogecoin without requiring direct token ownership from investors. While still in the pitch phase, investor materials name Spiro, partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Musk’s legal representative in multiple high-profile cases, as the incoming chairman. This development comes amid a wave of firms rebranding as crypto treasury companies, raising capital to acquire digital assets. Dogecoin, originally launched in 2013 as a joke, has gradually found a foothold among a small but growing group of corporate backers. In February, Vancouver-based Neptune Digital Assets disclosed a 1 million DOGE purchase at an average price of $0.37. $200 MILLION DOGECOIN TREASURY TO BE CHAIRED BY ELON MUSK'S PERSONAL LAWYER ALEX SPIRO 6 investors were confirmed by Fortune to have received pitches for an up to $200 million Dogecoin treasury with plans for it to be chaired by Alex Spiro, Elon Musk's lawyer of choice at… pic.twitter.com/DvRhPTwhPq — REDWRITER (@The_REDWRITER) August 29, 2025 The firm also holds Bitcoin and has expanded its treasury through derivatives. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-listed Bit Origin revealed plans in July to raise $500 million in financing to build its DOGE-focused balance sheet, becoming the first US-listed company to do so. Tesla, the electric vehicle company chaired by Musk, has also acknowledged Dogecoin holdings and accepts the token for select merchandise purchases. While Tesla hasn’t disclosed the size of its DOGE reserves, its public endorsement has long been considered a key catalyst for the token’s popularity. Musk’s relationship with Dogecoin has been both promotional and controversial. A 2019 tweet calling Dogecoin his “fav cryptocurrency” helped propel the coin into mainstream visibility. In 2021, his Saturday Night Live appearance, where he called Dogecoin a “hustle,” triggered a steep price drop after a hype-fueled rally. Spiro defended Musk in a 2022 lawsuit alleging Dogecoin market manipulation. That lawsuit was dismissed in 2024. Eliza Labs Sues Elon Musk’s X Corp, Alleging Monopoly Abuse As reported, Eliza Labs has filed a lawsuit against X Corp , accusing the Elon Musk-owned company of abusing its dominant position to suppress competition and replicate its technology. The complaint claims that X used its platform power to extract sensitive technical data from Eliza Labs before suspending the firm’s account without warning. Last week, Ex Populus, the company behind the Ethereum-based gaming platform XAI, also filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI. The legal dispute centers on alleged marketplace confusion between Ex Populus’s federally registered “XAI” trademark and Musk’s similarly named venture, launched shortly after. Ex Populus claims Musk’s xAI crossed into its territory when he announced plans to launch an AI game studio in late 2024, amplifying confusion among consumers.

According to reports, the company has held talks with Google and OpenAI to integrate their AI models into Meta’s growing suite of AI products. Executives inside Meta Superintelligence Labs, the company’s new AI division, have discussed incorporating Google’s Gemini model. The aim would be to improve what are already highly accurate and natural text-based responses in Meta AI, the company’s leading chatbot, when users ask questions. The discussions also included the potential use of OpenAI’s models, the technology that could enhance AI features across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Any partnership would not mean a permanent shift away from Meta’s work. According to people knowledgeable about discussions, these deals are expected to be a stopgap for Meta’s in-house technology to develop. The company’s priority is developing Llama 5’s new large language model . Meta intends for this model to challenge OpenAI’s GPT series and Google’s Gemini head-on. This pragmatic stance conveys the sense of emergency in the AI arms race. Rivals have already introduced sophisticated products, and Meta does not want to lag as it develops its systems. In the short term, borrowing strength from Google or OpenAI makes its AI systems competitive and engaging for users. Meta couples external AI with in-house work As it aims to push toward self-reliance, Meta is already experimenting with AI outside the company. A coding assistant using Anthropic’s models is available to employees who can quickly compose and test software. That shows that Meta is willing to blend outside technology with its in-house tools when doing so, offering a differentiated benefit. A Meta spokesperson emphasized this adaptable strategy, saying the company was taking an “all-of-the-above approach.” That involves creating best-in-class models itself, working with other leading players, and open-sourcing technology. Meta has been among the more aggressive companies in outsourcing its models, releasing earlier versions of Llama to researchers and developers. The push is being fueled by massive investment. Earlier this year, Meta pledged billions of dollars to grow Meta Superintelligence Labs. Mark Zuckerberg enlisted Alexandr Wang, once the chief executive of Scale AI, and Nat Friedman, a former chief executive at GitHub, to co-lead the project. The lab has also recruited a dozen researchers, many of whom were offered very high salaries, keeping with Zuckerberg’s ambition to turn Meta into a leader in AI. The desired angle is clear. Meta wants to be out in front of the AI revolution, not a fast follower. A temporary alliance with OpenAI or Google could bridge some of these holes in the near term, but the company is betting its homegrown technology will eventually rival the competition. Competition shapes Meta’s choices Meta’s approach is similar to, but also different from, how other tech giants deal with the AI arms race. Microsoft was an early bettor on OpenAI, pouring billions into the company and integrating GPT models deeply into its products. Apple has chosen a more balanced route, collaborating this year with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT with the iPhone and develop its own Apple Intelligence system. Meta’s approach falls somewhere in between. Like Apple, it wants flexibility and will mix partnerships with its models if it gets that. Like Microsoft, it is willing to spend big to attract talent and speed up research. What makes Meta different is that it’s willing to let the world borrow parts of what it built, a strategy that wins friends and influences developers, and applies pressure on closed rivals. For users, that could mean more powerful AI characteristics for its social-media apps, which serve billions. For the industry, Meta’s negotiations with Google and OpenAI shows the fact that even bitter rivals may have to work together sometimes. Cooperation, however fleeting, could be crucial for staying competitive in the AI race. But in the long term, Meta’s fate lies with Llama 5 and beyond. If its models can rival or exceed Gemini and GPT, Meta may not need outside help anymore. Until then, deals with rivals could be the bridge that keeps it in the fight.

Ethereum holders, however, are beginning to shift some capital into Remittix , a utility-first altcoin promising up to 50x upside rooted in cross-border PayFi innovation. While BNB may continue delivering steady, infrastructure-led gains, Remittix offers the chance for breakthrough growth, earning attention from ETH investors seeking bold performance. BNB Price Prediction Points Toward Strength Around $900–$1,000 BNB outlooks lean upbeat. Several recent calls see price pushing into the $920 to $1,000 zone by September, helped by a steady footing above the $750 to $800 support band. Charts also point to a near-term break toward $850. For the rest of 2025, many models cluster between $900 and $1,000, reflecting faith in Binance’s ecosystem and ongoing crypto demand. Ethereum Investors Are Scouting Remittix for Next 50× Movement While BNB remains a solid option for steady capital stays, Ethereum investors are exploring alternatives with exponential potential, with Remittix rising to the top. That mirrors Ethereum’s own past breakout, yet Remittix brings infrastructure into the mix. As ETH price targets push toward $6,500, aided by ETF flows and momentum, Remittix attracts capital from holders chasing asymmetric returns. Remittix Stakes Its Case as the PayFi Upgrade Ethereum Investors Seek Remittix has the utility alternative Ethereum investors want when BNB’s consistent growth doesn’t scratch the high-return itch. Analysts estimate Remittix could offer up to 50× growth, positioning it as a standout among ETH ecosystem extensions. The low-cap gem is supported by an Ethereum-backed ecosystem that appeals to ETH holders looking to deploy capital into scalable payment systems, not just smart contract tokens. Ethereum investors recognize that Remittix’s growth path resembles a leveraged version of Ethereum’s, but with immediate utility baked in. It has sold over 630 million tokens, trades at $0.10, and has raised over $22.1 million. Its BitMart listing was unlocked after $20 million+ raised and its second CEX partner LBANK is confirmed following the $22 million+ milestone, key goals strengthening investor confidence. Remittix stands out through: Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Direct crypto-to-bank transfers in more than 30 countries Utility-first token powering actual transaction volume Built for adoption, not for speculation Time-sensitive entry point before listings and parabolic growth When BNB delivers predictability and ETH rides up slowly, Remittix presents a course toward tangible reward backed by functionality. It offers a Dutch book opportunity: utility today, upside tomorrow. BNB’s Steady Cup vs. Remittix’s Rocket BNB price prediction keeps it in bullish territory, targeting $900–$1,000 into 2025 with infrastructure security. Ethereum investors are drawn to Remittix, however, believing it may outperform via product delivery and explosive growth. For those looking to pair value with velocity, Remittix is analysts’ most compelling crypto to buy now, outpacing even BNB’s chart support.

While Stellar (XLM) and Algorand (ALGO) have their place in the market, Remittix offers something they lack: real-world utility. Specifically, Remittix is making waves with its cross-border payment solutions, providing crypto-to-fiat conversion and direct bank deposits in over 30 countries. HBAR price: Struggling with pressure and slow growth HBAR, known for its enterprise blockchain applications, is currently struggling with a falling price and technical resistance. While its focus is on long-term use cases in enterprise blockchain and decentralized apps, HBAR is currently in a bearish trend, with its price hovering around $0.236. Source: TradingView Unlike Remittix , which continues to experience growth and adoption, HBAR’s market performance has been subdued, making it less attractive for short-term traders seeking quicker returns. Stellar (XLM) and Algorand: A solid but slower solution Although Stellar has established a solid reputation as an affordable option for international transactions, its applications are still more constrained than those of Remittix. Although cross-border payments are still Stellar’s primary emphasis, merchants looking for practical solutions may find it less enticing without Remittix’s instant accessibility. Source: TradingView For individuals participating in the DeFi ecosystem, Algorand is a desirable investment due to its scalability and emphasis on decentralized finance. However, Remittix’s capacity to instantly convert cryptocurrency to fiat and address the $19 trillion payments problem surpasses its usefulness in the real-world payments market. Remittix: The clear winner in real-world utility Unlike Stellar and Algorand, Remittix brings tangible value to the table, solving real-world problems. It is putting itself in a position to transform the $19 trillion remittance sector with a distinct emphasis on cross-border payments. As the platform grows, Remittix continues to attract significant interest from investors and market players, raising over $22.2 million and witnessing noteworthy token sales. Its status as a strong contender in the crypto market is backed strongly by significant developments like the upcoming wallet beta release and exchange listings on BitMart and confirmed listing LBank. Remittix features pulling in massive liquidity Cross-border payment solution that offers instant crypto-to-fiat conversion and direct bank deposits worldwide. Raised over $22.2 million with solid reinforcement from retail and institutional investors. CertiK-audited smart contracts ensuring transparency and security for investors. The goal of deflationary tokenomics is to promote sustained growth. Community rewards that increase user loyalty and involvement include freebies and staking chances With these developments, Remittix has established a reputation as a useful, workable solution that appeals to both individual and corporate customers, including NGOs, freelancers, and remitters. Compared to speculative currencies like Stellar and Algorand, which are still developing their usefulness, this makes it far more alluring. Remittix leads the pack for experienced traders Experienced traders are progressively selecting Remittix (RTX) over Stellar (XLM), Algorand (ALGO), and HBAR due to its obvious adoption path and useful cross-border payment solution. Remittix has already shown noticeable results and is continually gaining traction with its growing user base and upcoming milestones.

The majority of investors are comparing meme-tied coins like the Shiba Inu Coin to upcoming projects like Remittix (RTX) , already generating attention via its presale program and adoption plan. Shiba Inu price prediction trends Shiba Inu Price has fallen to $0.00001228 in recent times, falling 2.63% in the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization stands at $7.23 billion, with trading volume down 11.62% to $183.65 million. The drop has added fresh controversy to Shiba Inu News, with most asking whether SHIB Price momentum can be sustained in the long term. Similar to other meme coins, Shiba Inu Coin greatly depends on speculation and hype from its user base. Although it has delivered incredible returns in the past, it is still extremely volatile compared to crypto with real-world utility. For this reason, experts traditionally compare the latest Shiba Inu Price Prediction to adoption-based projects. Why investors are watching Remittix In contrast to speculative tokens, Remittix is being promoted as a cross-chain DeFi project focused on global payments. The Remittix token is priced at $0.1000 and more than 628 million tokens have been sold and well over $22.2 million raised in its presale. It has already secured listings in BitMart and LBANK, providing early liquidity and availability to global investors. What differentiates Remittix as one of the best crypto presale 2025 offers is its roadmap. The project has recently revealed its upcoming beta wallet, which will launch in Q3 2025. The wallet will support over 40 cryptos, allow direct transfers to 30+ nations, and have real-time FX conversion at low gas fees. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction: Allows for crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ nations Beta wallet launch date fixed for Q3 2025 Over $22.2Million collected in presale First CEX listings secured on BitMart & LBANK (reveled) The larger picture for crypto adoption Although recent Shiba Inu Price Prediction news requires, many traders are diversifying into up-and-coming altcoins to track like Remittix. Its utility-focused framework positions it as more than just a speculative bet — instead, it’s being built as a crypto addressing actual world problems in payments. RTX has also launched a $250,000 Remittix Giveaway as an additional incentive for community engagement and early interest. With interest heating up, RTX is emerging as a strong contender for the next big altcoin of 2025 that combines DeFi technology with practical applications. The crypto universe will always have meme coins such as Shiba Inu Coin, but real innovation comes from potential future crypto ventures with a possibility of adoption. Whether SHIB recovers is up to market sentiment, but Remittix has a different narrative to share — bridging crypto and mainstream finance via a low gas fee crypto business with mass-market application. For investors interested in pre-emptive crypto investment, keeping an eye on both Shiba Inu Price Prediction and adoption-based coins like Remittix could be the way to stay above water in 2025’s shifting market.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with recent news that could signal a significant shift in market dynamics. Reports indicate a monumental Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition , with new wallets scooping up a staggering 1,506 BTC, valued at $163.5 million, from Galaxy Digital. This substantial move suggests a growing confidence among major players in the digital asset space. What Does This Massive Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition Signify? In a recent report by Lookonchain, four new wallets, widely presumed to belong to institutions, have made a considerable splash. They acquired 1,506 BTC, worth approximately $163.5 million, directly from Galaxy Digital within a short two-hour window. This is not merely a transfer; it represents fresh capital entering the market. The term ‘new wallets’ is crucial here. It implies that these are not existing institutional holders rebalancing their portfolios, but rather new entities or expanded positions taking a significant stake in Bitcoin. Such an Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition often reflects a strategic long-term view. Why Are Major Players Embracing Bitcoin Now? The drivers behind such large-scale institutional investments are multifaceted. Bitcoin has increasingly been recognized as a legitimate asset class, offering unique advantages in today’s economic climate. Institutions are looking for hedges against inflation and diversification for their portfolios. Key Drivers for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: Inflation Hedge: Many institutions view Bitcoin as a potential safeguard against the erosion of purchasing power in traditional fiat currencies. Digital Gold Narrative: Its finite supply and decentralized nature align with the ‘digital gold’ thesis, making it an attractive store of value. Portfolio Diversification: Bitcoin often exhibits a low correlation with traditional assets, providing diversification benefits. Long-Term Growth Potential: Belief in Bitcoin’s continued appreciation as global adoption grows. Furthermore, the maturing infrastructure around cryptocurrencies, including robust custody solutions and regulatory clarity in some regions, makes it easier for institutions to participate. This latest Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition underscores a broader trend. The Ripple Effect: Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition and Market Dynamics When institutions make such substantial moves, it often sends a powerful signal to the broader market. A significant Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition can boost investor confidence, potentially leading to increased demand and price stability. It suggests that sophisticated investors are increasingly comfortable with Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. However, it is also important to consider the potential for increased volatility. While institutional involvement can bring stability, large buys and sells can also create price swings. The market will be watching closely to see how these newly acquired assets are managed. This event could be a precursor to more widespread institutional adoption, further integrating digital assets into traditional financial systems. It highlights Bitcoin’s growing role as a credible investment. How Can You Track Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition? For individual investors and market enthusiasts, tracking institutional movements can provide valuable insights. On-chain analytics platforms, like Lookonchain, are essential tools for monitoring large transactions and identifying potential institutional activity. These platforms offer transparency into the blockchain, allowing for informed decision-time decisions. Actionable Insights for Tracking: Monitor Whale Alerts: Keep an eye on services that track large cryptocurrency transactions, often referred to as ‘whale’ movements. Follow Reputable Crypto News: Stay informed through trusted news sources that report on institutional investment trends and market analysis. Understand Market Indicators: Learn to interpret volume, open interest, and funding rates, which can sometimes signal institutional interest. Understanding these trends can help you make more informed decisions about your own crypto portfolio. This latest Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition is a prime example of the kind of data that can move markets. Conclusion: A New Era of Confidence? The recent $163.5 million Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition by suspected institutional wallets from Galaxy Digital is a compelling development. It underscores a growing conviction among major financial entities regarding Bitcoin’s value proposition and future potential. This influx of capital from new players could indeed be a glimmer of hope, signaling a more mature and robust market ahead. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, institutional participation will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping its trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition? An Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition refers to large-scale purchases of Bitcoin by financial institutions, corporations, or investment funds, as opposed to individual retail investors. These acquisitions typically involve significant capital and are often part of a broader investment strategy. Who is Galaxy Digital? Galaxy Digital is a diversified financial services and investment management company specializing in the digital asset, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology sectors. They provide services such as asset management, trading, and investment banking to institutional clients. How do we know these are ‘institutional’ wallets? While direct attribution can be challenging, analysts like Lookonchain often infer institutional involvement based on the size of the transactions, the nature of the wallets (e.g., newly created, high-volume activity), and the entities involved in the transfers (like Galaxy Digital, which caters to institutional clients). What impact does this have on Bitcoin’s price? Large institutional acquisitions can have a positive impact on Bitcoin’s price by increasing demand and reducing the available supply on exchanges. This can lead to upward price pressure and foster greater market confidence, although short-term volatility can still occur. Is Bitcoin a good investment for institutions? Many institutions are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a viable investment due to its potential as an inflation hedge, its role as ‘digital gold,’ and its diversification benefits. However, investment decisions depend on an institution’s specific risk tolerance, investment horizon, and regulatory environment. Did you find this analysis insightful?

The coin has lost up to 2.56 percent of its value. Technical indicators give neutral signals, but the price charts project a bearish market scenario for the day. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as selling momentum took hold, bringing the price down to $2.81 during the day. The RSI decreased to 41.75 at the same time and is in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $4.76 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to increase significantly. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the end of this year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching $20 by 2030. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $24.74 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported on Teucrium’s XXRP, the leveraged XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) launched in April, which has reached $300 million in net flow. With the ETF reaching $323.6 million in inflows, it becomes the first XRP ETF in the US to reach the milestone. The Teucrium Trading CEO says the leveraged ETF product is its most successful ETF ever.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP is trending above $3, as the market sentiment still tilts toward the positive side.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-30 11:30:00

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now standing at $0.035 in presale stage 6. Investors in the project are estimated to earn a minimum return on investment of 400% once MUTM goes live. Mutuum Finance has already passed over $15.15 million and more than 15800 token buyers. Recent market activity suggests a noticeable uptick in institutional and retail interest around Mutuum Finance, placing it alongside established coins such as XRP. XRP Price Analysis & 2025 Outlook XRP is currently trading at approximately $2.98, holding steady with slight movement around the $3.00 mark. Analysts note that if XRP breaks above the key resistance zone near $3.40, combined with favorable regulatory developments and growing institutional interest, a rise toward $4.50–$5.50 by year-end remains plausible. However, maintaining this momentum will depend on market sentiment and capital flows, particularly as investors also explore emerging DeFi narratives like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Stage 6 Success Mutuum Finance (MUTM) 2025 presale has been a record-breaking success. The token is now at Stage 6 at a price of $0.035 and reflects higher investor anticipation as well as stronger market anticipation.

The giveaway is evidence that the project is serious about a long-term and a dedicated community. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched an Official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. The project team invites the participants with a promise of providing up to $50,000 USDT as a bounty for finding bugs in the project. The objective of the bounty program is to identify the probable weaknesses of the project. Four types of weaknesses are analyzed in the program to rank them on the basis of their severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. Dual Lending Model Mutuum Finance is based on a two-lending model whereby customers are given unprecedented convenience by Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model, lending pools have access to smart contracts, which can be programmed to determine whether or not they will dynamically shift interest rates as a function of how the market conditions trend. Fixed incomes are provided by lenders while borrowers are insured upon accessing loans. P2P model does not involve middlemen to create a direct relationship between lending and borrowing parties. Any asset with price-risky demands such purely decentralized model under full control of users. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $15.15 million with 15,800 investors on board at Stage 6 priced at $0.035. Its dual lending model, CertiK-audited security, and $100,000 giveaway highlight strong growth momentum as it heads toward launch.

If that happens, it will mark the first time DOGE reaches this level since a multi-year high of around $0.48 in 2024. It will also mark a 2025 high for the meme coin, with its current high at around $0.28. Unichartz revealed that a descending resistance line and a key horizontal supply zone at around $0.28 are acting as a strong barrier for the meme coin. He remarked that DOGE will need to flip this confluence zone cleanly for it to see a breakout and push higher. In the meantime, the meme coin continues to decline alongside the broader crypto market. Dogecoin has dropped from a recent high of around $0.24 and is down over 8% in the last seven days. This has occurred thanks to the massive drop in the Bitcoin price, with the flagship crypto on a downtrend since it reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $124,000 two weeks ago. The Goal Is For DOGE’s Stoch RSI To Cross The 20 Level In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital said that the goal is for Dogecoin’s Stochastic Relative Strength Index (Stoch RSI) to cross the 20 level and show a follow-through. He explained that anything below that level is a sign of weak momentum. This technical indicator is currently crossing to the upside and is at the 13 level. Related Reading: Alphractal Says Resilient Dogecoin Metrics Could Lead To Price Breakout This is significant, as Kevin noted that monthly Stoch RSI crosses on Dogecoin, outside of the bear market, and, along with an uptrending monthly RSI, ultimately lead to massive rallies. He further remarked that DOGE’s biggest move of the cycle is likely if Bitcoin can move higher and Ethereum ultimately enters into price discovery with a dropping BTC dominance. The analyst added that DOGE just needs a little more time for BTC and the macro to support this move. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.21, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The executives, Daniel Schatt (former CEO) and Joseph Podulka (former CFO), are being punished for their roles in a wire fraud conspiracy that led to about $1 billion customer losses according to current coin valuations. How long will Cred’s CEO and CFO be gone for? According to the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Northern District of California, Daniel Schatt, the company’s co-founder and CEO, got off with the heavier sentence of 52 months while Joseph Podulka, the company’s CFO, received a 36-month sentence. Along with the prison time, Schatt and Podulka also received three years of supervised release and a fine of $25,000. The 55-year-old Schatt and Podulka, 53, both pleaded guilty in May to wire fraud conspiracy and were indicted along with former chief capital officer James Alexander last year. U.S. Attorney Craig Missakian in a statement from Friday said the criminal conspiracy dealt significant damage to Cred’s customers. Cred’s business offered loans to customers primarily by using crypto as collateral and accepting deposits of cryptocurrency in exchange for interest. That was the part the customers knew. The part many of them did not know was that the business also depended on a relationship with a Chinese firm founded by one of Cred’s co-founders to generate the interest yield. “Under this arrangement, Cred would loan the Chinese company a percentage of Cred’s customers’ funds, and the Chinese company would make short-term, high-interest microloans to Chinese gamers to generate interest to pay back to Cred,” the U.S. Attorney’s office said. The business was also dependent on a hedging strategy and used a third-party company to protect Cred from overexposure to fluctuations in the crypto market. The plea agreement traces the conspiracy back to March 2020, just as the COVID-19 pandemic began, and the price of Bitcoin subsequently tanked. Cred heard from its hedging partner that it was underwater and would need to liquidate all of its trading positions, prosecutors said. The Chinese company also informed Cred that it would be unable to pay back tens of millions of dollars, which the executives hid from customers and investors. According to prosecutors, Schatt reassured everyone during a public “Ask Management Anything” session on March 18, 2020 that Cred was “operating normally.” “Daniel Schatt and Joseph Podulka orchestrated a scheme in which they deceived both investors and customers out of their hard-earned funds in an attempt to extend a failing business,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Matt Cobo. Following the company’s bankruptcy filing, customers and investors filed over 6,000 claims totaling more than $140 million, now worth more than $1 billion, based on August 2025 valuations. A restitution hearing has been scheduled for October 7, and the pair is expected to start serving their sentences on October 28. Regulators will still go after fraud and mismanagement Schatt and Podulka are not the only crypto founders who have faced legal consequences this year. The SEC is no longer on the offensive and has even dismissed several high-profile cases involving some giants in the industry. But the U.S. Attorney Craig Missakian has promised that “fraud targeting cryptocurrency investors and customers will not be tolerated and wrongdoers will be held accountable for their actions.” Aside from Schatt and Podulka, other notable crypto executives facing legal prosecution include Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius , who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for fraud on May 8. There is also Wolf Capital’s co-founder and head trader Travis Ford, who pleaded guilty on January 10 to wire fraud conspiracy charges. Do Kwon of Terraform Labs has also pleaded guilty to fraud charges, and the embattled Sam Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence.

With more activity on-chain and a likely market bottom forming, the Shiba Inu coin is exhibiting new signs of strength. Layer Brett , a new competitor, is also shaking things up in the crypto space with real utility and a lot of presale momentum. Is this the beginning of another meme coin rally? Let’s look at what the analysts are saying. Shiba Inu coin shows signs of a market bottom There is a lot more activity on the Shiba Inu coin blockchain, with the amount of transfers going up by 300% in just one day. On August 25, volume climbed from 1.13T to 4.25T tokens, based on a recent report. This shows that big holders are still moving coins even when retail transactions are slowing down. This shows that people are buying, not selling in a panic. Price action is still caught in a downward channel, but the Shiba Inu coin is still near $0.0000120, which is a major support level. If bulls can break out from the $0.0000126 resistance, Shiba Inu coin might move toward the $0.0000140–$0.0000145 range. Even if the technical signals are bearish, the Shiba Inu coin might be making a base for a reversal. Analysts claim that the market turned down an earlier triangular breakout, but it has subsequently settled down in the descending channel. The SHIB Army, increased burn rates, and the acceptance of Shibarium all point to long-term strength. CoinCodex says that the price of the Shiba Inu coin could go up to $0.00001325 by September. Shiba Inu coin is holding up well while holders wait for the next breakout, with 14 of the previous 30 days ending in green and only 3.72% volatility. Layer Brett: Fast, low-cost, and built for growth Layer Brett is transforming meme coins by bringing practical use to Ethereum Layer 2. It has very instant transactions, gas prices that are only a few cents, and full decentralization that Ethereum protects. Users may easily acquire $LBRETT with ETH, USDT, or BNB and then stake it right away through the dApp to get high-yield incentives. The ecosystem stays active and rewarding via gamified staking, NFT integrations, and community rewards. Layer Brett is one of the best cryptos to invest in because it combines meme culture with genuine blockchain scalability. The $LBRETT presale is going on now, and it’s only $0.005 per token. Over $1.9 million has already been raised. Early holders get better staking rates, clear tokenomics, and the strength of a community-first approach. Layer Brett is designed for performance, scaling, and rewards, unlike Base’s Brett, which doesn’t really do anything. With intentions to match large Layer 2s like Arbitrum and Optimism, Layer Brett is geared for long-term supremacy. $LBRETT is a good choice for investors who want to buy crypto right now because it has a low entry price and a lot of room to develop before launch. Don’t miss the next big meme coin wave Layer Brett is the true disruptor, yet Shiba Inu coin is showing strength. Layer Brett combines the power of memes with genuine Ethereum Layer 2 utility to give users fast transactions, minimal fees, and high staking rewards. The presale is still active, and more than $1.9 million has already been raised. This is the kind of early entry that may turn tiny wagers into huge wins. Don’t wait for the rally to start; sign up for the presale today to lock in your spot before prices go up.

The move has reignited debate around the long-discussed “Flippening,” where Ethereum’s market value could one day overtake Bitcoin’s. Whale Activity Shakes the Market Blockchain analytics firms, including Arkham Intelligence, flagged several transfers last week showing the whale moving over $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin into Ethereum. Just days earlier, the same entity had acquired $2.5 billion in ETH, bringing its total conversion to more than $4.5 billion within weeks. HUGE: A $5B #Bitcoin whale is rotating into Ethereum. Just shifted $1.1B $BTC to a new wallet Already bought $2.5B $ETH last week Now stacking even more $ETH through Hyperunit/HL pic.twitter.com/0i5T3LR6Ia — The Crypto Times (@CryptoTimes_io) August 29, 2025 These were no small bets. The whale traded through Hyperliquid, adding spot and futures and locking in $33 million profit from an earlier long on Ethereum. With over 220,000 ETH in the treasury, this whale is now one of the top 5 ETH holders globally – possibly even bigger than the Ethereum Foundation. Bitcoin dropped $4,000 last week under selling pressure. Ethereum up 14% in the last month, 2x Bitcoin’s performance. The whale is showing more confidence in Ethereum in the 2025 cycle. Staking Dynamics and Institutional Flows This whale rotation coincides with the Ethereum validator exit queue hitting an all time high. Roughly $5 billion worth of ETH is awaiting withdrawal, creating concerns about potential sell pressure. The wait time for unstaking has now exceeded 19 days. Yet analysts argue that institutional demand offsets much of this risk. In August alone, U.S. Ether ETFs drew $4 billion in inflows, underscoring the appetite for ETH exposure. Bitmine, one of the largest corporate treasuries, also added 190,500 ETH, lifting its holdings to 1.7 million ETH worth nearly $7.7 billion. On-chain data shows institutions are buying more than 35 ETH for every 1 ETH issued, making Ethereum increasingly scarce, even with validator exits. Ethereum Technical Outlook Ethereum price prediction appears bullish, with a target of over $4,265, as it currently trades at $4,391, consolidating after testing highs near $4,865. Price action is holding above a rising trendline from early August, signaling the broader uptrend remains intact. The 50-SMA at $4,567 is the immediate resistance. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview On the technical front , a daily close above it could trigger a retest of $4,665, with a breakout opening the path toward $4,865 and the $5,100 psychological level. Momentum indicators support this setup. RSI 43, ETH has room to bounce. MACD is bearish, with momentum fading below $4,265, risking $4,070 and $3,865. ETH holds trendline at $4,265 as whales & ETFs pour billions into the network. Eyes on $4,567 SMA—a breakout opens path to $5,100+, reviving the Flippening debate. pic.twitter.com/LUrWrc803g — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) August 30, 2025 For traders, the levels are clear: a bullish engulfing candle above $4,567 presents a long opportunity to $5,100, while a candle below $4,265 indicates a sell. Will the Flippening Return? Ethereum is still behind Bitcoin in overall market cap, but institutional flows and whale accumulation is changing the dynamics. Bitcoin is digital gold, but Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi, tokenization and stablecoins is growing. The whale’s $5B shift doesn’t guarantee the Flippening, but it reflects rising belief—even among Bitcoin loyalists—that Ethereum may deliver stronger returns in the years ahead. With network upgrades, growing ETF demand, and institutional adoption, Ethereum’s path toward challenging Bitcoin’s crown looks more credible than ever. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines Bitcoin Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation.

A recent and truly shocking development from India highlights this stark reality: a major Bitcoin kidnapping case that has sent ripples through the nation’s legal and crypto communities. This isn’t just a tale of crime; it’s a cautionary saga involving high-ranking officials and an astonishing sum of digital currency. The Audacious Bitcoin Kidnapping Unveiled In a landmark judgment, an Indian court has handed down life sentences to 14 individuals. Among those convicted are a former ruling party lawmaker and a senior police official. Their crime? Involvement in a sophisticated Bitcoin kidnapping scheme that targeted a businessman in 2018. This case underscores the evolving nature of crime in the digital age. The victim, businessman Shailesh Bhatt, was abducted in Surat, a prominent city in the Indian state of Gujarat. The perpetrators, a well-organized group, didn’t demand traditional ransom. Instead, they extorted a staggering 750 Bitcoins from him. At the time of the incident, this amount represented a significant fortune, highlighting the high stakes involved in this audacious plot. Unraveling the Conspiracy: How the Bitcoin Kidnapping Plot Unfolded The investigation into this complex crime revealed a shocking level of involvement from powerful figures. The defendants included the police chief of the Amreli district, a position of significant authority, and a former Member of Parliament from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), India’s ruling political party. Their participation added a layer of scandal and disbelief to the already sensational Bitcoin kidnapping . This wasn’t a simple snatch-and-grab. The court’s proceedings meticulously detailed how the group conspired to kidnap Bhatt and then leverage their positions to force the transfer of his digital assets. The use of Bitcoin as the ransom currency made the case particularly challenging for law enforcement, given the nascent understanding of cryptocurrencies at the time. Justice Served: Life Sentences for Bitcoin Kidnapping Masterminds The recent sentencing to life imprisonment for all 14 convicted individuals marks a significant victory for justice. This verdict sends a strong message that those who exploit emerging technologies for criminal purposes, regardless of their societal standing, will be held accountable. The judgment in this Bitcoin kidnapping case serves as a precedent for future crypto-related crimes in India. Moreover, the conviction of high-profile individuals like a former lawmaker and a police chief reinforces the principle of equality before the law. It demonstrates the judiciary’s commitment to tackling corruption and organized crime, even when it involves complex digital assets like Bitcoin. This outcome is crucial for maintaining public trust in both the legal system and the integrity of public service. Implications for India’s Crypto Landscape After the Bitcoin Kidnapping This landmark case undoubtedly has broader implications for India’s rapidly growing cryptocurrency ecosystem. Firstly, it highlights the urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks and enhanced cybersecurity measures to protect individuals and businesses involved in crypto. Secondly, it serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with holding large amounts of digital assets without adequate security protocols. For law enforcement agencies, the Bitcoin kidnapping case provides invaluable lessons in investigating and prosecuting cybercrimes involving cryptocurrencies. It necessitates specialized training and inter-agency cooperation to effectively trace digital transactions and bring perpetrators to justice. As India continues to navigate its stance on crypto, this case will likely influence future policy decisions aimed at preventing similar incidents and ensuring investor safety. What Does This Mean for Crypto Users? Enhanced Security: Always prioritize strong, unique passwords and two-factor authentication for all crypto accounts. Hardware Wallets: Consider using hardware wallets for storing significant amounts of cryptocurrency to reduce online exposure. Due Diligence: Be wary of unsolicited communications or schemes that promise unrealistic returns. Report Suspicious Activity: If you suspect any criminal activity involving crypto, report it to the authorities immediately. The resolution of this sensational Bitcoin kidnapping case is a testament to the persistent efforts of law enforcement and the judiciary. It serves as a powerful reminder that while the digital frontier offers immense potential, it also presents new challenges that demand vigilance and robust legal responses. As the crypto world evolves, so too must our methods of ensuring safety and justice for all.

The Federal Reserve’s preferred measure, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, showed that price pressures are climbing higher, raising concerns among investors navigating the effects of President Donald Trump’s trade policies. According to data from SoSoValue, Ether ETFs experienced a sharp net outflow of $164.64 million, breaking a five-day streak of inflows that had brought in over $1.5 billion. Bitcoin ETFs also turned negative, recording $126.64 million in withdrawals — their first daily loss since August 22. Following the selloff, total assets under management stood at $28.58 billion for Ethereum and $139.95 billion for Bitcoin. Outflows Reverse Momentum The redemptions were led by major players. Fidelity’s FBTC posted the steepest single-day outflow among Bitcoin ETFs with $66.2 million withdrawn. ARK Invest and 21Shares’ ARKB followed with $72.07 million in net exits, while Grayscale’s GBTC shed $15.3 million. Only a handful of funds managed modest gains, including BlackRock’s IBIT, which attracted $24.63 million, and WisdomTree’s BTCW, which saw $2.3 million in inflows. The moves came as the July PCE index showed a 2.9% annualized rise, the fastest pace since February. While the reading matched forecasts, it underscored the impact of Trump’s tariff strategy , which includes a 10% baseline tax on all imports alongside targeted reciprocal duties. Analysts noted that while lower energy prices helped contain headline inflation, service costs rose 3.6% year-over-year, fueling worries about stickier underlying price growth. Ether ETFs Maintain Longer-Term Momentum Despite Friday’s setback, Ether ETFs remain in strong demand . Since their debut in July 2024, they have attracted steady inflows, with August alone seeing a 44% increase, lifting assets from $9.5 billion to $13.7 billion. Analysts attribute the growth to renewed institutional appetite for Ethereum after a period of underperformance relative to Bitcoin. Corporate treasuries are also emerging as a significant source of demand. StrategicETHReserve reported that businesses now collectively hold 4.4 million ETH, valued at more than $19 billion — around 3.7% of the total supply. This trend reflects Ethereum’s growing role as a strategic asset for companies looking to diversify beyond Bitcoin. Even with the latest market turbulence, expectations of a potential Fed rate cut at the next meeting remain, particularly if labor market data shows further signs of weakness. For now, ETF flows suggest that investors are taking a cautious stance amid heightened inflation concerns.

They are quick to deliver returns when they rocket and are equally quick to drop once they run out of hype. Recently, the Pepe coin was in the crypto news for its short-term gains. However, it lacked true substance to maintain its value, hence the emergence of Layer Brett. Still in its ground phase of its presale , analysts are backing Layer Brett to achieve more gains than Bonk and Dogwifhat. Layer Brett (LBRETT) is set to be the next 100x crypto This is where Layer Brett (Layer Brett) is delivering huge potential as its performance continues to outperform all the currently trending cryptocurrencies. The high-potential crypto project is already drawing huge attention, thanks to its strong staking rewards as well as potential to deliver high gains. In its presale , stakers earn over 1,000% APY, creating an enviable and steady stream of passive income for them. Smart money investors are taking advantage of this opportunity. The project has already raised more than $1.9 million within a few weeks, which shows that there is a lot of investor interest. At launch, these investors will be able to claim tokens through the official site. Beyond the frenzy, Layer Brett is offering something different. The project is made to turn meme culture into genuine blockchain power. It is made for speed, scale, and incentives, unlike the first Brett, which had no use. With this rare utility, analysts see Layer Brett filling a necessary gap in the meme market, which could potentially catapult its price above 100x in 2026. What is happening with the Pepe coin: Can it recover in 2026? The Pepe coin price has been consolidating at a major high-time frame support zone. This consolidation has been happening for the past three months after the Pepe coin erased all its 2024 gains. Amid this lagging performance, some signs of hope are appearing on the charts. A rare Gartley harmonic setup is forming, and its confluence with the 0.618 Fibonacci suggests strong potential for a bullish recovery in 2026. Additional confirmation comes from derivatives data. Open interest rates, which had been trending negative, are now surging upward. This signals increased participation with some insider whales entering the Pepe markets. Despite these good signs, investors are still in a cautious mode because speculative assets like Pepe can often give in to their volatile nature. This is why analysts believe Layer Brett, with its strong market fundamentals, can flip Pepe’s gains in 2026. BONK shows promising signs but still falls short BONK has quickly become a sensation as Solana’s first community-driven meme coin. By leveraging Solana’s 65,000+ transactions per second capacity and ultra-low fees, BONK managed to spread virally, even surpassing its brother, Dogwifhat. In 2024, Bonk posted a 127.5% annual gain, including a 29.6% rally in Q4, making it one of the strongest performers among meme tokens. Recent news highlights a potential further 150% bull run rally per chart, yet competition from emerging meme coins like Layer Brett outpaces it in 2026. Bonk’s integration across Solana-based wallets and NFT platforms has helped it stand out from other meme projects. But, like Pepe and Dogwifhat, BONK primarily thrives on speculation rather than structured economic utility. Conclusion Beyond its rare utility, Layer Brett’s smaller market cap compared to Pepe, Bonk, and Dogwifhat gives it far greater room for exponential growth. Do not wait—the presale is limited, and those who act now position themselves for maximum rewards as Layer Brett flips these vintage meme giants. LBRETT is available now at $0.005. Don’t miss out on the next 100x—join the Layer Brett presale today.

The cryptocurrency’s recent performance has caught the recognition of both technical analysts amid the heavy selling action from the smart money. Analysts believe this sell-off is a mere profit-taking action at the institutional level. Still, smart investors are following the money to Layer Brett, the new Ethereum layer 2 token with 100x predictions. Market traders pivot to Layer Brett: Is a 100x jump possible? Layer Brett has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk has proven that viral marketing and community engagement can drive massive gains. But Layer extends beyond the regular meme hype to deliver true utility. The new crypto is built on a cutting-edge Ethereum Layer 2 infrastructure. This system enables near-instant transactions and gas fees that cost just pennies, making it both accessible and efficient for everyday users. Add gamified staking, NFT tie-ins, and a DAO on the roadmap, and you see that Layer Brett is designed to actually keep people involved after the hype wave. Layer Brett’s staking program takes things to a notch. Staking rewards reportedly reach up to 20,000% APY, encouraging committed ecosystem participation. Throw in governance rights, exclusive airdrops, and early-access benefits, and you have a reward-rich ecosystem designed to keep capital locked in for the long term. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in Layer Brett’s 100x potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that Layer Brett is still in presale , it could benefit from this wave if it maintains its market appeal. XRP price prediction: Fundamental metrics raise questions XRP is in a critical phase after facing intense selling pressure from its largest holders. Since July 9, whales have offloaded 640 million tokens, totaling $1.91 billion. Its price has fallen below the $2.9 threshold. And its trading volume is down 12% for the month, but still exceeds $4.8 billion in daily activity. This sell-off occurred due to signs of a potential market top. DefiLama data shows that over 95% of XRP’s circulating supply is currently in profit, a setup that historically precedes sharp price corrections. XRP’s recent price dip likely triggered fear of missing out among these institutional holders. Meanwhile, the XRP price prediction is looking bleak as the growth of the XRP Ledger lags behind other major layer-1 blockchains. The network’s $190 billion market cap is roughly 2,200 times larger than its $85 million total-value-locked. This ratio contrasts sharply with Ethereum’s ratio of about 5.6, despite XRP’s valuation being nearly 40% of Ethereum’s market cap. Such disparity has led to concerns over extreme overvaluation relative to on-chain activity. If whale sell-off continues, XRP could clear its early gain of 2025 and drop towards $2.2. Breaking its current support level could open the path toward a massive price fall. Still, it’s worth considering that XRP has shown resilience during previous market tops, maintaining a choppy momentum without experiencing major declines. This characteristic suggests XRP may defy typical market behavior patterns when a sell-off happens. Conclusion The XRP price prediction portrays a negative outlook after last month’s win. The real explosive deal now lies with LBRETT . With meme-driven virality, blazing-fast Layer 2 infrastructure, and jaw-dropping staking rewards, LBRETT isn’t just riding the alt season wave; it’s positioned to lead it. Grab your share to ride what could be one of the biggest breakouts of the year!

This marks the blockchain’s highest level since May 2021 and the third-largest monthly volume in its history. What’s Driving Ethereum’s Activity? The report highlighted several key factors behind the surge: Unique transactions over 30 days hit an all-time high. Active addresses reached the second-highest level in history. Total Value Locked (TVL) in the Ethereum ecosystem stayed near peak levels. Analysts noted a strong uptick in institutional involvement. Corporate treasuries are actively accumulating Ethereum, while spot ETF trading volumes have grown significantly. Interestingly, despite the surge in activity, average transaction fees dropped to multi-year lows, making Ethereum more attractive for both retail and institutional players. Analysts See Ethereum as Undervalued Experts at Standard Chartered described Ethereum as an undervalued asset, noting that the market is not fully pricing in its long-term growth potential. Analysts argue that Ethereum’s role in decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenization, and institutional-grade applications gives it a structural edge. “Ethereum is positioned as the backbone of Web3 infrastructure, yet it still trades at a discount relative to its utility,” said one Standard Chartered strategist. They pointed to corporate adoption, rising ETF inflows, and Ethereum’s growing dominance over Bitcoin as key reasons the asset could outperform in the next market cycle.

Pepeto (PEPETO) , an Ethereum memecoin on mainnet, is quickly gaining attention because it blends meme culture with real working tools, a zero fee DEX, a built-in bridge, and rewarding staking. This is not just another meme coin. It is an early entry that could turn small bets into huge wins, and many are already calling it the next Shiba Inu of 2025. Pepeto’s Presale Growth and Utility Pepeto’s presale is running at $0.000000150 and has raised more than $6.5M so far. Each stage increases the price, so early buyers secure a stronger position before launch. The token itself fuels PepetoSwap, a zero fee exchange, in the same way BNB powers Binance, which means every trade and listing creates direct demand for Pepeto. Alongside that, a native cross chain bridge allows smoother movement between ecosystems, solving problems that other meme coins have ignored. Staking rewards up to 236% APY give holders strong incentives, building steady demand and long-term holding. Why Pepeto Stands Out From Other Memecoins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu showed that memes can create wealth, but their tools stayed limited. Many newer projects went to Layer 2 for cheaper costs, yet that decision limits reach. Pepeto stayed on Ethereum mainnet, where the real users, deep liquidity, and advanced tooling are already active. That choice is key for growth. The Pepeto token is built as the engine of PepetoSwap. Two full audits by SolidProof and Coinsult add trust to its system. Its 420 trillion supply is split clearly, with 30% Presale, 30% Staking, 20% Marketing, 12.5% Liquidity, and 7.5% Development, keeping the structure simple and credible. Market Timing and Why It Matters Each bull cycle plays out the same way. Bitcoin rises first, then profits move into large altcoins, and finally into Ethereum memecoins where growth can multiply faster. Pepeto is set up to ride this cycle. Analysts expect a 40× move at launch as presale buyers unlock value. As PepetoSwap adoption increases and its brand spreads, targets stretch to 70×. By late 2025, with the bull run peaking, higher usage, and big listings, a 100× gain is seen as realistic. That is why Pepeto is being described as one of the best cryptos to buy today, a presale designed with real tools and timing that fits the market perfectly. Final Takeaway In every bull run, profits rotate from Bitcoin into altcoins, and then into memes that climb the fastest. But the ones that last are always backed by real products. Pepeto delivers on that need. At $0.000000150 with $6.5M+ raised and staking set at 236% APY, it offers both reward and upside. Unlike Shiba Inu or Dogecoin, which leaned only on community, Pepeto runs on Ethereum mainnet and powers a zero fee exchange, making the token itself the fuel of real trading activity. Each presale stage pushes the entry price higher, which means those who join early capture the best level. Analysts see the potential for 40× soon after launch, 70× with usage, and 100× by 2025 as listings expand. That is why many investors now call Pepeto the best memecoin to buy. It is designed to capture demand, reward early believers, and become one of the next big names in crypto. The presale window is open, but it will not stay this way for long.

However, as the most skilled investors call them the so-called smart money, they understand that the actual profits may be when the capital is taken out of Bitcoin and into other assets. Historically, wealth has been created at lightning speed in this altcoin season . Institutions and experienced traders are already indicating their subsequent actions. But curiously, the flow of smart money is not restricted to well-known names such as Ethereum or Solana only, but it is moving toward well-chosen emerging projects that demonstrate a promise of explosion. Among them, one of the most-discussed is MAGACOIN FINANCE , an emerging star in this cycle. Why Smart Money Rotates Out of Bitcoin When Bitcoin grows rapidly, it reaches a stage where gains become slow. At that point, the investors that rode on the wave make profits and seek other opportunities that have higher returns. This new money is then pumped into altcoins, causing enormous surges in the coins, which had been earlier ignored. It is a trend that has recurred in each significant cycle. In 2017, it was Ethereum and Ripple. Solana and meme tokens made their appearance in 2021. Analysts predict that in 2025, a new influx of altcoins will be at the frontline. The Insider Pick MAGACOIN FINANCE is a hot topic of smart money this year. It has been able to gain momentum with its disciplined approach to development and expanding ecosystem unlike speculative meme coins. Instead of being based on hype only, MAGACOIN FINance is developing actual utility as well as increasing its number of users. In order to reward early supporters, the project has introduced a limited 50% EXTRA reward on investors who use the code PATRIOT50X . This incentive arrives when its community is growing fast, and it has momentum when investors are selling out of Bitcoin. To most, MAGACOIN FINANCE holds a balance of safety and explosive potential. Other Places Smart Money Is Heading There is a doubling of ETF inflows into institutions on Ethereum, and new liquidity into gaming tokens and DeFi projects. Meanwhile, hedge funds pay attention to the niche segments like real-world asset tokenization, and privacy coins. Together, these indicators indicate that altcoin season 2025 could be one of the most profitable. Conclusion Bitcoin will forever provide an anchor in the crypto market, but the smart money knows when to get out. This season will yield the prospective profits to define a generation of investors by investing in altcoins and promising projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE.

Ethereum is Already On A “Full Port” While XRP Is In The Process In an X post , Raoul Pal stated that Ethereum is already on a “full port,” indicating that the altcoin is poised for a parabolic rally. He also shared an ETH chart , which showed that it had already broken out of a long-term consolidation. The market expert also highlighted XRP as one of the altcoins set to witness a massive breakout, similar to ETH, stating it is in the process of “full porting.” Pal shared an XRP chart, in which he pointed out the altcoin’s long-term consolidation at different periods before it recorded a massive rally to the upside. The latest of them was the move at the beginning of the year, when the altcoin reached its previous all-time high (ATH) at the time. Meanwhile, the market expert also identified other altcoins besides XRP that he expects to witness a significant rally, just like Ethereum. He noted that these coins are in the waiting room and are getting ready to launch. Pal declared that Solana will be the next to leave the waiting room after ETH. Once that happens, he predicts that SUI, which is also currently in the waiting room, will follow Solana next with a parabolic rally of its own. Meanwhile, the market expert said that Dogecoin will full port when the others outside the top 10 are full porting. Pal claimed that the coins outside the top 10 (OTHERS) are still in the waiting room but will take longer to launch. He described their projected rally as the “purest form of altcoin season .” A “Bullish Backdrop” For Crypto Raoul Pal expects a rise in total global liquidity as the U.S., E.U., China, and Japan all need to roll over their debts. He described this as an “absurdly bullish backdrop” for Ethereum, XRP, and these other altcoins. He also highlighted crypto treasury companies and sovereign accumulation, along with Wall Street, as bullish catalysts for the imminent rally among altcoins. However, the market expert remarked that market participants need to learn patience as even though the path is clear, they can never expect “tick for tick perfection.” He added that it is the pattern that counts.",Ethereum|Altcoin Season|altcoins|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|OTHERS|Raoul Pal|Real Vision|SOL|solana|XRP,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|ALTCOIN|XRP|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-30 12:00:00

GRYP shareholders recently approved a reverse takeover by American Bitcoin Corp. Its stake will now be around 2% post-close, with a ticker change to “ABTC” pending. American Bitcoin is majority owned by Hut 8 Corp. There’s a disclosed market stand-off period that applies per the merger’s S-4 filing. Still, GRYP’s Q2 2025 showed tight liquidity and declining revenue. The combined entity also appears to be somewhat constrained. Ultimately, I think the implied valuation for the combined entity seems expensive. So I lean towards a neutral “Hold” rating at these levels. Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc. ( GRYP ) is a pure-play cryptocurrency mining company focused on Bitcoin (BTC-USD). GRYP generates revenue by directing the hashrate of its ASIC mining machines to pools such as Foundry USA under the Full Pay Per Share (FPPS) model. This gives GRYP relatively stable payouts and includes transaction fees. Their recent webcast confirmed that GRYP’s shareholders approved the reverse takeover by American Bitcoin Corp. (ABTC), which adds mining infrastructure and gives it extra financial stability as a combined entity. Yet, at this point, it seems there's a substantial premium embedded for the combined entity. Thus, I feel it’s prudent to rate GRYP a “Hold” for now. Bitcoin Hashrate Play Gryphon Digital Mining is a cryptocurrency mining company that mostly focuses on Bitcoin using its ASIC machines. Basically, GRYP contributes computing power (i.e., hashrate) to mining pools in exchange for Bitcoin rewards. GRYP went public back in February 2024 following a reverse merger with Akerna Corp. , which, interestingly, was specialized in SaaS cannabis compliance. Today, GRYP is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. Source: Foundry Digital Website. Retrieved August 24, 2025. With that in mind, the bottom line is that GRYP’s revenues come from providing hashrate to mining pools. Mining pools are essentially miner cooperatives. Each miner points their machines’ computational power to the pool’s server, and whenever the pool collectively wins a block, its rewards are split among participants. Each miner receives its rewards proportionally based on the amount of hashrate it contributed to win that particular block. Moreover, GRYP’s main pool partner is Foundry USA, which is a large Bitcoin mining pool where GRYP earns part of the rewards under a Full Pay Per Share (FPPS) model. To give you an idea, FPPS means miners receive a fixed payout for each valid share of work they submit, regardless of whether the pool actually wins a Bitcoin block. Also, FPPS includes transaction fees from blocks, which makes it more profitable than regular PPS models. After all, this means miners also share in both Bitcoin revenue sources. Bitcoin Mining Reverse Takeover Currently, GRYP is finalizing a merger with American Bitcoin Corp. (ABTC) to expand its mining capacity. A special shareholder meeting took place on August 27, 2025, and the reverse takeover was approved (the votes were counted at 12:35 in the recording). As such, it’s expected that the new entity will be called American Bitcoin Corp. and trade under the new ticker “ABTC.” Effectively, current GRYP shareholders will be heavily diluted, but will get a little equity in a much larger mining operation. GRYP’s shares remain for now until the Nasdaq approves the branding and ticker update. Source: CryptoSlate. Moreover, it’s worth mentioning that ABTC was actually co-founded and backed by Eric Trump. He holds a minority stake, with the majority held by Hut 8, an energy and infrastructure firm. Technically, Hut 8 Corp. wholly owns American Bitcoin Holdings (ABH) LLC., which itself owns 80% of American Bitcoin today. Eric Trump is listed as owning 9.3% of American Bitcoin in the merger's S-4 filing . Donald Trump Jr. has also been reported as owning a portion of American Bitcoin, but if he owns less than 5% he wouldn't show up in this disclosure, so I can't confirm his stake. Source: Reverse Takeover S-4 Filing. March 2025. Fortunately, we do know there’s a lock-up period for their shares (see the S-4’s Market Stand-off Agreement ). Basically, this will be the earlier of a) 1 year after the closing date of the deal, or b) 18 months after March 31, 2025. Nonetheless, the publicly traded GRYP shares today will correspond to just 2% of the combined entity. In my view, that is a relatively thin float if Hut 8 or Eric Trump decides to sell a portion of their stakes. So, it’s worth monitoring this as a potential risk post-merger. In any event, ABTC today generates its revenues by mining Bitcoin through its fleet of ASIC miners, similar to GRYP. In fact, ABTC is also technically a pure-play Bitcoin miner with a comparable model to GRYP that focuses on hashrate to mining pools in exchange for Bitcoin. So, the strategic rationale here is simple. ABTC will bring larger operational resources , additional miners, hosting infrastructure, plus get a publicly traded ticker in the process. Source: Hut8 American Bitcoin Launch Presentation. Retrieved August 24, 2025. But at a deeper level, this combined entity could be much better capitalized, which could pave the way for building a more competitive mining platform. This merger with ABTC was proposed back in May 2025 , and upon completion, GRYP shareholders will hold 2% and ABTC shareholders will own 98% of the combined company. The merged company will have a new structure that will include Class A, B, and C common stock. Class B shares will have 10,000 votes per share, so it’s possible the voting power may be concentrated in that share class as well. Regardless, ABTC shareholders will effectively control the resulting company. Valuation And Risk Analysis As for GRYP’s perspective, this reverse takeover is largely due to its rapidly dwindling resources to fund its operations. Their Q2 2025 balance sheet showed only $678.0 thousand in cash, $72.0 thousand in marketable securities, and a stockholders’ deficit of $11.0 million. Also, its revenues declined YoY to $1.4 million from $5.5 million in Q2 2024. So clearly, GRYP needed a partner to shore up its balance sheet with a much-needed capital infusion. American Bitcoin also brings a larger mining operation, more equipment, and hosting capacity. And the added benefit of the transaction is that it leverages GRYP’s Nasdaq listing, so an outright IPO isn’t necessary for American Bitcoin. Source: Seeking Alpha Charts. Nevertheless, the market so far seems optimistic about this merger with ABTC. GRYP’s shares have bounced to $1.28 from their 52-week low of just $0.13 per share. Despite the heavy dilution for GRYP’s current shareholders, investors are seemingly pricing in ABTC’s operational scale and robust balance sheet. Indeed, this could be a catalyst for a financially stronger entity with better competitive prospects through additional CAPEX down the road. Plus, the combined entity will still retain its access to capital markets, which is a nice added bonus to this transaction. Now, from a valuation perspective, GRYP currently trades at a $102.7 million market cap. However, in reality, we should now think of GRYP as 2% of the merged entity post-transaction. So, a back-of-the-envelope approximation implies a $5.1 billion market cap for the post-merger company. The pro-forma consolidated statements (March 2025) show the combined entity will have $318.0 thousand in cash, $49.0 thousand in marketable securities, and $787.0 thousand in digital assets. Therefore, that amounts to approximately $1.2 million in liquid resources, against no financial debt (total liabilities of $11.2 million). Source: Reverse Takeover S-4 Filing. March 2025. Additionally, the combined book value would have been $230.0 million ( S-4 filing , page 150), indicating a P/B of 22.2 (assuming the implied market cap of $5.1 billion I previously mentioned). Note that per the merger's S-4 filing, GRYP had a stockholders' deficit of $7.7 million by Q1 2025 (by Q2, its book value declined further to $11.0 million ). So, ABTC's book value of $115.8 million partly offsets GRYP's negative book value. The remaining portion of the reported combined Q1 book value of $230.0 million comes from pro-forma adjustments. Primarily from adding $114.3 million in goodwill and $121.1 million in net PPE from ABTC's books. Similarly, the combined entity would have had Q1 2025 revenues of only $13.9 million and a net loss of $32.6 million. If we annualize its topline, it amounts to just $55.6 million, which implies an expensive P/S of 91.7. For context, GRYP’s sector’s median P/B and P/S are around 3.6 and 3.4, respectively. Source: Reverse Takeover S-4 Filing. March 2025. Lastly, if we use the combined EBIT as a proxy for cash flow, it also shows a somewhat concerning picture. The combined entity would have had a Q1 2025 EBIT loss of $46.5 million, or around $186.0 million if we annualize it. And remember, the combined liquid resources are only $1.2 million (including digital assets like Bitcoin). So, I imagine they’re probably going to do a capital raise post-transaction or issue some debt to increase their operating liquidity. But at the end of the day, I believe the GRYP stock appears too expensive to warrant a bullish rating at this point. Conclusion: Neutral For Now Overall, I think GRYP’s shareholders have clearly benefited from this transaction, as the shares have rapidly appreciated since the reverse merger was announced. However, the combined entity still has many uncertainties, and it does seem to trade at a substantial premium at this point. Naturally, consolidation is critical in Bitcoin mining, as economies of scale lower per-bitcoin production costs. It’s possible there will be considerable synergies post-transaction that justify such a premium. But for now, I feel it’s prudent to remain neutral on the stock until we have more details post-transaction.",GRYP,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MINING|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-30 12:00:00

The investigation discovered that most of the bots were built by users through Meta’s AI chatbot platform. However, there were a few that were created internally by a Meta employee. Some of the Taylor Swift parody chatbot accounts insisted that they were the real singer, and oftentimes made flirtatious advances and encouraged meet-ups. Reports implicate Meta in flirty avatars scandal Reuters reported that several weeks of testing found that the celebrity chatbots, available across Meta’s Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp platforms, sometimes went far beyond playful conversation. Users prompted them to produce photorealistic images of stars in lingerie, posing in bathtubs, and even suggesting intimate encounters. One troubling discovery was the creation of a chatbot of Walker Scobell, a 16-year-old actor. When asked for a beach photo, the bot generated a lifelike image of the teenager shirtless with the caption, “Pretty cute, huh?” Meta is not alone in facing scrutiny. Elon Musk’s xAI has also come under criticism for enabling users to generate deepfake images of celebrities in underwear. Meta spokesman Andy Stone acknowledged the failures, saying the company’s tools should not have generated either intimate depictions of adult celebrities or any sexualized material involving minors. “Like others, we permit the generation of images containing public figures, but our policies are intended to prohibit nude, intimate or sexually suggestive imagery,” he told Reuters. He added that the lingerie depictions reflected failures in enforcing company policy. Meta’s rules prohibit “direct impersonation,” but the company argued that parody bots were permissible if labeled clearly. However, Reuters found that some avatars carried no disclaimer. Meta deleted about a dozen of the bots, both parody and unlabeled, shortly before the Reuters report was published. The company declined to comment on the removals. AI safety concerns could lead to regulatory pressure Following the report , Meta said it would roll out new safeguards aimed at protecting teenagers, including restricting youth access to certain AI characters and retraining its models to reduce inappropriate themes. California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued a warning to the sector, saying, “Exposing children to sexualized content is indefensible.” In one tragic case earlier this month, a cognitively impaired 76-year-old man in New Jersey died after attempting to meet a Meta chatbot he believed to be a real woman. Critics say such cases highlight the dangers of deploying large-scale AI tools without adequate guardrails. Legal experts warn that Meta could face significant challenges under existing intellectual property and publicity laws. Mark Lemley, a Stanford University law professor, said that California’s “right of publicity” statute prohibits the use of an individual’s name or likeness for commercial purposes without consent. “That doesn’t seem to be true here,” he said, noting the bots simply replicated celebrities’ images rather than creating transformative works.

The XRP Ledger was originally designed with 100 billion XRP . No new issuance is possible. Unlike inflationary models, XRP is slightly deflationary, as a fraction of each transaction is destroyed through fees. SMQKE shared official documentation showing that “at the current rate of destruction, it would take at least 70,000 years to destroy all XRP.” This design means that the asset is structured with longevity in mind, balancing availability with controlled scarcity.

She shared a study which says “Ripple could survive as it is a better version of SWIFT and Bitcoin network, and it could be used by traditional financial organisations for advanced experience of the current service industry.” This places Ripple and XRP in a unique position, bridging the functions of established financial messaging systems and first-generation blockchain networks. The reference to both SWIFT and Bitcoin is significant. SWIFT remains the dominant global payments messaging system, but is slow and outdated , and operates without a native settlement asset. Bitcoin introduced the model of decentralized, borderless transactions, but it is constrained by slower settlement and higher energy costs. XRP is presented here as a solution that combines the messaging efficiency of SWIFT with the blockchain-backed asset functionality pioneered by Bitcoin, and could power a fast, cheap, and efficient global payment system. Implications for XRP as an Asset XRP can operate for thousands of years without exhaustion, providing a predictable supply environment. Transaction fees are low and help prevent spam without placing a significant burden on users. Because XRP is necessary for operating on the ledger, any broader adoption of Ripple’s technology by traditional financial institutions strengthens the underlying demand for the asset as a bridge currency .

This makes the XRP’s role not speculative alone, but functional within real-world payment infrastructure. An Exciting Future The combination of long-term supply sustainability and a position as an alternative to both SWIFT and Bitcoin highlights why XRP continues to be viewed as strategically important. Ripple’s framework suggests that the asset is not only designed to endure but also structured to integrate with existing financial practices. With documentation showing a 70,000-year horizon for supply depletion and academic references placing Ripple as a viable successor to legacy systems, XRP is viewed by many as the future of global finance .

The token has slipped 2.35% in the past day, ranking #4 by market cap at $166.89 billion. With 59.48 billion XRP in circulation out of a 100 billion max supply, the asset is approaching key support levels that could determine whether it sparks the next altcoin rally. Market Pressure Weighs on XRP Ripple’s XRP has been struggling to reclaim ground above $3.00. A broader crypto selloff, triggered by Bitcoin’s slide to a seven-week low and Ethereum’s pullback after billions in expiring options, has amplified weakness across altcoins. Tokens like Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Sui (SUI) also recorded steep losses. Macro headwinds are adding to the pressure. Fed says rate cuts may come slower than expected, inflation and a strong US economy mean no demand for risk, Wall Street tech giants drag down equities after NVIDIA’s AI outlook softens, risk sentiment suffers. Crypto market cap down 3.3% in a day to $3.76 trillion. On-Chain Data Shows Weakening XRP’s fundamentals have also softened. Active addresses on the XRP Ledger fell from roughly 50,000 in mid-July to just 24,000 today, according to CryptoQuant, highlighting weaker network activity. Derivatives markets echo the caution. Futures open interest dropped from $10.94 billion to $7.97 billion, signaling reduced trader confidence. Long liquidations totaled over $15 million in the past 24 hours, compared with only $1 million in shorts, showing that bullish bets are being flushed out at a faster pace. Even XRP’s market standing has shifted. The token recently slipped behind Tether (USDT) in total valuation and fell out of the world’s top 100 assets by market capitalization. XRP Price Forecast: $2.58 Support in Focus The XRP price prediction appears bearish, as XRP is consolidating within a descending channel. The rejection near $3.25 in mid-August has left bears in control, with the token now hovering around the $2.79 Fibonacci retracement (0.5 level). Immediate support : $2.79, followed by $2.58 and $2.43 Resistance levels : $2.99, $3.09 (50-day SMA), and $3.25 Indicators : RSI at 41 signals continued pressure but not yet oversold; MACD remains negative with widening histograms On the technical front , XRP’s immediate support stays near $2.79 and $2.58, $2.28. Above $2.99 and $3.25, $3.43. As long as above $2.06, the trend is not broken. XRP slips to $2.81, testing critical $2.79 support. A rebound above $2.99 could spark a wider altcoin rally—while a drop below $2.58 risks deeper losses. pic.twitter.com/EQyBIJeUGT — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) August 30, 2025 If buyers defend these support levels, XRP could re-emerge as the token that reignites momentum across the altcoin sector. Historically, XRP rallies have boosted liquidity and confidence across the market—a trend that traders are closely watching as institutional flows and ETF speculation intensify.

While Solana certainly commands an impressive market cap, a disruptive new contender, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) , is shaking up the scene, promising to deliver genuine utility and explosive gains that even the most established altcoins might struggle to match. Check out its fresh take! The Layer 2 That Memes Deserve Layer Brett is an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain, specifically engineered for speed and ultra-low gas fees, a far cry from the often congested and costly Layer 1 experience. While SOL offers its own robust ecosystem, Layer Brett is tackling a different beast: bridging meme culture with serious blockchain scalability. During peak times, Ethereum gas fees can easily hit $10 or $20. Layer Brett slashes that to mere pennies. This radically improves accessibility for everyday users. Its off-chain processing capability means transactions are near-instantaneous, a significant advantage over many traditional memecoins like Pepe or Shiba Inu, which often suffer from slow network performance. Solana’s Glacial Plays Vs. Layer Brett’s Agility Solana has demonstrated incredible resilience and growth, recently participating in a broader altcoin rally with crypto inflows nearing $2 billion. With SOL trading around $193.16 and boasting a $103.94 billion market cap, it’s a titan. But the co-founder’s recent critique of meme coins as “digital slop” is telling, especially with many such tokens thriving on the Solana network itself. Layer Brett, on the other hand, embraces its meme heritage while injecting it with genuine utility. $LBRETT is compelling as low cap crypto gem for a number of reasons, especially when stacked against a behemoth like SOL: Built on Layer 2 Ethereum: Lightning-fast transactions, near-zero gas fees, and the gold-standard security of Ethereum. Staking Rewards: Early buyers can snag an APY of 1,490%, a figure that dwarfs most staking crypto opportunities. Presale Access: Get in now at the ground floor, with $LBRETT priced at just $0.005 per token. Community First: It’s a meme-born, utility-built project focusing on user rewards and engagement, unlike the utility-free origins of Brett itself or other top meme coin contenders. Why Investors are Eyeing LBRETT Despite a Bullish Solana Price Surge While Solana’s price continues its upward trajectory, and its all-time high of $294.85 remains a testament to its power, smart money is always looking for the next big crypto. Layer Brett offers a unique blend of fun and function, breaking away from the one-dimensional model of tokens like Bonk or the original Brett. It’s a next 100x altcoin contender in the making, fusing viral culture with legitimate blockchain scaling solutions. This isn’t just hype. Layer Brett is purpose-built for performance and user rewards. Users can connect their MetaMask or Trust Wallet, buy $LBRETT with ETH, USDT, or BNB, and start staking instantly through the dApp. No KYC, full control. Plus, there’s a $1 million giveaway to take part in, sweetening the deal for early adopters. Jump in early to Secure the Biggest Gains Layer Brett is pushing ahead as a community-driven blockchain designed for experimentation and interaction. It’s perfectly positioned to capture significant attention during the upcoming crypto bull run 2025, offering a much smaller market cap than SOL and therefore greater potential for explosive growth. Don’t miss this opportunity. Visit the Layer Brett presale and stake your tokens for truly massive, Layer 2-powered rewards. The future of memes, powered by utility, is here. Get in now to stake, earn massive rewards , and ride what could be the most scalable meme project ever to launch on Ethereum Layer 2.

A prominent figure, often referred to as a Bitcoin OG, recently executed a massive Bitcoin OG ETH swap , converting a substantial amount of BTC into Ethereum. This strategic move, valued at $109 million, has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike, signaling potential shifts in long-term holding strategies. What’s Behind This Significant Bitcoin OG ETH Swap? Just recently, a well-known Bitcoin OG made headlines by depositing 2,120 BTC, valued at approximately $230 million, onto the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid. Within a short period, a remarkable 1,000 BTC, equating to $109 million, was strategically swapped for Ethereum (ETH). This particular Bitcoin OG ETH swap was reported by Lookonchain, a prominent blockchain analytics firm, highlighting the transparency and traceability of such on-chain activities. Hyperliquid, a rising decentralized platform, facilitated this substantial transaction, allowing for direct peer-to-peer asset conversion without traditional intermediaries. Why Are Bitcoin OGs Diversifying with ETH? The decision by a long-term Bitcoin holder to perform such a large Bitcoin OG ETH swap isn’t merely a speculative play; it often reflects a deeper understanding of market trends and technological advancements. Several compelling factors might influence such a strategic pivot: Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum boasts a vibrant and expansive ecosystem, encompassing decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and numerous decentralized applications (dApps). Staking Rewards: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), holders can earn passive income through staking, offering a yield that Bitcoin currently does not provide natively. Technological Innovation: Ethereum continues to innovate with scalability solutions like sharding and layer-2 networks, promising enhanced transaction speeds and lower costs. Diversification Strategy: Even the most ardent Bitcoin maximalists often recognize the benefits of portfolio diversification, especially with another leading asset like Ethereum. This move suggests a belief in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition and its role as a foundational layer for the future of the decentralized internet. What Does This Bitcoin OG ETH Swap Mean for the Market? A transaction of this magnitude, particularly one involving a seasoned investor, can send ripples through the crypto market. While it’s one individual’s decision, it could be seen as a bellwether for broader trends. Moreover, it sparks important conversations among investors. Shifting Investor Sentiment: It might signal growing confidence in Ethereum’s potential to outperform Bitcoin in certain market cycles, or at least to offer a complementary growth vector. Increased ETH Demand: A large-scale Bitcoin OG ETH swap directly contributes to increased demand for Ethereum, potentially influencing its price dynamics. Validation for DeFi: The use of a decentralized exchange like Hyperliquid for such a large trade further validates the robustness and efficiency of DeFi platforms. This kind of move encourages market participants to re-evaluate their own holdings and consider the strategic advantages of diversification within the top-tier cryptocurrencies. Navigating Your Own Bitcoin OG ETH Swap Decisions For everyday investors, observing a significant Bitcoin OG ETH swap can be a valuable learning experience. However, it’s crucial to remember that individual strategies vary greatly based on risk tolerance, financial goals, and market outlook. Therefore, always conduct your own research. Key Considerations: Research Thoroughly: Understand the fundamentals of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, their respective ecosystems, and future roadmaps. Assess Your Portfolio: Determine if diversifying into ETH aligns with your personal investment strategy and risk profile. Consider Market Conditions: Crypto markets are volatile. Timing entries and exits requires careful analysis. Use Reputable Platforms: Whether centralized or decentralized, ensure the exchange you use is secure and reliable. This event serves as a powerful reminder that even long-term holders continuously adapt their strategies to maximize returns and manage risk in the dynamic crypto landscape. The recent Bitcoin OG ETH swap represents more than just a large transaction; it symbolizes an evolving perspective among early adopters regarding the future of digital assets. This strategic move highlights Ethereum’s growing appeal as a foundational asset and a powerful diversifier within a crypto portfolio. As the market matures, we can expect to see more such sophisticated strategies unfold, shaping the next era of cryptocurrency investment. It’s a testament to the continuous innovation and the ever-changing landscape of this exciting financial frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Bitcoin OG?

The price has slipped below key supports, raising doubts about short-term momentum. The coming sessions are likely to determine whether ETH maintains its broader bullish trajectory or enters a deeper correction. ETH Price: Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily chart, ETH continues to trade within its ascending channel, though momentum has clearly weakened following the rejection at the channel’s upper boundary. The asset has now pulled back toward the midline support around $4.2K, which has repeatedly acted as a key demand zone. The RSI has declined to around 52, reflecting cooling bullish strength and growing equilibrium between buyers and sellers. A decisive break below $4.2K would likely expose the $3.8K region, which overlaps with the sell-side liquidity pocket and prior consolidation levels. Conversely, if buyers hold this level, ETH could consolidate before mounting another attempt toward the $4.8K resistance zone, keeping the broader bullish structure intact. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, ETH has broken below its steeper ascending trendline, though the broader channel midline near $4.2K continues to provide crucial support. This has placed the market in a consolidation range bounded by $4.2K support and $4.8K resistance. The $4.2K demand zone is the key battleground. A breakdown here would confirm a shift in market structure, likely accelerating a move toward the $3.8K area. However, if buyers defend this support and reclaim the $4.6K swing high, momentum could quickly reverse, with liquidity targets at $4.8K and potentially beyond. Onchain Analysis By Shayan Over the past week, Ethereum’s sharp rejection from $4.9K triggered a cascade of long liquidations, sending the price lower toward the $4.2K range. The liquidation heatmap highlights where leveraged positions are clustered, offering insight into which levels are most likely to attract price in the short term. The heatmap currently shows a dense liquidity cluster between $4.8K and $5K, where aggressive short positions were previously trapped. This remains a significant upside target, suggesting that any bullish push could aim to sweep remaining short liquidations in this zone. On the downside, large concentrations of long liquidations have accumulated within the $3.8K–$4.2K range, aligning with key technical support areas. If sellers regain control, these levels could serve as downside magnets, accelerating further corrections. Until one side is decisively cleared, Ethereum is likely to remain in a range-bound, liquidity-driven environment. A breakout above $4.6K would likely trigger a run into the $4.8K liquidity pool, while a breakdown below $4.2K could open the path toward the $3.8K zone.

According to people familiar with the matter, the firm plans to raise $200 million. So far, investors have cast the enterprise as a Dogecoin treasury platform and an endorsement of House of Doge, the Miami entity formed in early 2025 by the Dogecoin Foundation. Musk has influenced Dogecoin’s popularity and price in the past The company aims to raise at least $200 million to be listed as a publicly traded company that holds Dogecoin or its relevant derivatives on its balance sheet. The idea is to offer investors a way of entering the stock market to gain exposure to Dogecoin without needing to hold it directly. For now, though, the plan is still at the pitch stage, with no specific details yet on structure or timing. Investor materials and conversations indicate the group intends to name Alex Spiro, a Quinn Emanuel partner known for representing high-profile clients like Elon Musk, Jay-Z, and Alec Baldwin, as chairman. Musk himself has had long-standing connections with Dogecoin. In 2019, he called it his favorite cryptocurrency in a post that helped catapult the token into the spotlight. Then again, during his May 2021 Saturday Night Live appearance, Musk described Dogecoin as a “hustle,” a comment that quickly erased weeks of gains and dragged the token down from record levels. The price seemed to shift each time the billionaire posted about Dogecoin, sparking worries from regulators and investors about his outsized impact. He even faced a market-manipulation lawsuit in 2022, but in 2024, the case was dismissed, thanks in part to Spiro’s defense . For now, it is still unclear whether Musk will be involved with the new company. Representatives for X have not replied to inquiries, and House of Doge declined to comment. Dogecoin is widely regarded as the first meme coin, has no underlying utility, and draws its worth primarily from online culture and popularity. It is named after the Doge meme — a Shiba Inu accompanied by Comic Sans catchphrases such as “so amaze.” Michael Saylor popularized the corporate crypto holdings Several publicly traded companies have restructured to fit the bill of crypto treasury companies, securing funds to acquire and keep digital assets on their balance sheets. For instance, Neptune Digital Assets, headquartered in Vancouver, revealed in February 2025 that it had obtained 1 million Dogecoin via a derivative purchase at an average cost of $0.37 per token. The company also added 20 Bitcoin to diversify its portfolio. In July, Nasdaq-listed Bit Origin said it had lined up as much as $500 million in debt and equity funding to build a Dogecoin treasury. As reported by Cryptopolitan , this was the first time a US-based company has made the token a key part of its holdings. Chardan was the exclusive placement agent, and Atw Partners was the backer. Bit Origin disclosed the transaction in a regulatory filing on July 17 (Form 6-K). Tesla has also confirmed it owns some Dogecoin, though it has never shared how much. The automaker started accepting cryptocurrency for select merchandise in early 2022. Meanwhile, Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, was key in popularizing digital asset treasuries when it started holding Bitcoin way back in 2020. The BTC holdings lifted Strategy’s market value to around $96 billion, fueling efforts by other companies to mimic Saylor’s financial experiment. Since the start of the year, 184 public firms have unveiled crypto purchases amounting to nearly $132 billion, according to Architect Partners data—assets acquired range from Bitcoin to Ethereum, Solana, and WLFI, the Trump family’s cryptocurrency.

With Bitcoin’s recent pullback, concerns are growing among investors that the broader bull market could be fading, which in turn raises the risk of XRP also heading lower. Technical Analysis By Shayan The USDT Pair On the daily timeframe of the USDT pair, the market has been consolidating in a relatively tight range, forming a symmetrical triangle pattern. This type of structure usually signals that a decisive move is on the horizon, as price coils up before expanding again. Currently, the bias leans slightly to the downside, as the triangle appears weaker with each retest of support. If sellers gain momentum, the next major level to watch will be the $2.70 support zone. This level has already acted as an important pivot in the past, so another breakdown could set the stage for a sharper selloff. Adding to the bearish case, the RSI is currently holding below the 50 midpoint, which is a clear indication that momentum is favouring the sellers. As long as the RSI remains subdued, the probability of a breakdown below $2.70 is higher than a bullish rebound. If that breakdown occurs, the market could continue to slide until it reaches the lower boundary of the broader ascending channel. Of course, this outlook would only shift if market dynamics change suddenly in favor of the bulls, with stronger buying activity stepping in to push the price out of the triangle to the upside. The BTC Pair On the XRP/BTC chart, the price has also been consolidating, holding above a major support area. July’s surge, however, managed to push the market out of a long-term descending channel, which has tilted the broader structure to the bullish side. The RSI sitting near the neutral 50 level reflects uncertainty, as traders appear to be waiting for a decisive move. If the 2,500 SAT support holds, the market could attempt another rally targeting the 3,000 SAT zone. But if 2,500 SAT fails, the price would likely fall back inside the old channel, opening the door for a drop toward 2,000 SAT. Such a move would confirm a bearish reversal and add further pressure on XRP holders.

Analyst Rings Alarm as Whales Flee,https://cryptopotato.com/90k-bitcoin-meltdown-looming-analyst-rings-alarm-as-whales-flee/,"Bitcoin’s recent rally has seemingly slammed into a wall, with the asset dropping over 6% this week to hover near $108,500. The slide has the market asking one question: Is the bull run finally over? And one prominent analyst is sounding the alarm with a grim forecast. Bearish Breakdown On August 29, crypto commentator Klarck made a dire assessment of BTC’s state of health, predicting the OG cryptocurrency is headed for $90,000, a move that would also obliterate altcoins. “Market has FINALLY reached its PEAK. $BTC is heading to $90k – ALTs will lose ~90%. Disagree? Be ready to lose everything,” the analyst warned. He pointed to a massive $2.7 billion whale sell-off that sparked a cascading liquidation bloodbath exceeding $900 million, predominantly from leveraged positions, as the initial trigger. Additionally, he claimed that institutional players like BlackRock are leading the charge to exit, leaving optimistic retail investors as “exit liquidity.” His thesis is rooted in what he calls a “textbook cycle top scenario.” Key indicators are flashing red: trading volume is drying up, funding rates remain excessively high, and BTC is being dumped on exchanges at an accelerating rate. However, the market watcher’s most chilling claim is that the timeline is set. Based on historical halving cycles stretching back eight years, he gives the market approximately 30 days before a final, devastating “bull trap” and subsequent collapse. Klarck isn’t alone in his caution. Fellow analyst Doctor Profit echoed his sentiment in part, highlighting a critical red flag: “Today, the charts scream the same warning again! Bearish divergences on the weekly chart!” And with BTC slipping more than 12% off its all-time high above $124,000 set just 16 days ago, the fear may feel justified to some. Further firing up the debate is a recent suggestion by another analyst, Cryptobirb, that the cycle is already 93% complete, with a “grand finale” window between late October and mid-November 2025. That lines up eerily with Klarck’s own 30-day warning. Conflicting Signals But not everyone’s buying the apocalypse narrative. Crypto trader Mr. Wall Street insists that bears are celebrating too soon. “Bulls are still in control… shorts being triggered way too early,” he argued, projecting BTC to run toward $145,000 before any real bloodbath. Meanwhile, influencer Kyle Chassé is hyping up research suggesting BTC could skyrocket to $190,000 by Q3, citing ETF demand and institutional inflows. The post $90K Bitcoin Meltdown Looming?

The world’s largest coin is already trading above six figures, and major analysts are projecting 2025 targets between 180K and 250K, with some stretching calls to 500K or even one million. Spot ETFs, retirement access, corporate treasury buys, and the supply shock from halving all keep demand strong. Yet history shows that when Bitcoin climbs this high, investors rotate profits into new memecoins that can multiply faster. Right now, one project has caught the eye of whales, and this article explains why Pepeto(PEPETO) is viewed as one of the best crypto investments to buy today. Bitcoin 2025: Can It Reach $145K, $250K, or Even $1M? The case for Bitcoin hitting between $145,000 and $1,000,000 in 2025 is not built on hope, but on real data. Spot ETFs and retirement accounts are already pulling in billions, while corporations continue to lock up coins in their reserves. Supply is lower after the halving, so every dollar invested lifts the price higher. Regulators are easing their stance with stablecoin frameworks and SEC programs that reduce fear for larger institutions. The macro backdrop of falling rates and stronger liquidity adds fuel. At the same time, BTCFi products are turning Bitcoin into a usable system beyond store of value. Previous cycles also confirm that late 2025 could host the peak. This is why estimated ranges sit at $180,000 to $250,000, while more optimistic cases project $500,000 or even one million. What happens after that? Money starts looking for new places to grow. Why Profits Move From Bitcoin Into Altcoins Once Bitcoin moves higher, profits are unlocked and traders start to chase larger percentage gains. The first capital shift is usually into large altcoins, and then into plays where price action can multiply in days. That is where memecoins stand out. Still, not every meme project survives. Only those with both culture and infrastructure make sense for investors seeking more than luck. This is exactly the lane Pepeto was built to own, and it is why it is already becoming the favorite of this upcoming cycle. Pepeto: The Ethereum Memecoin Ready for Takeoff Pepeto(PEPETO) is positioned as the star of the next meme coin wave. It is built on Ethereum mainnet, joining viral community culture with real working products. Its name stands for Power, Energy, Precision, Efficiency, Technology, and Optimization. That vision is live in its tools. PepetoSwap delivers a zero-fee exchange. A built-in bridge allows smooth movement across chains. Staking rewards sit near 236% APY. Audits by SolidProof and Coinsult are complete. 420 trillion tokens, the same supply as Pepe, Pepeto keeps familiarity but adds a sharper system, making it ready to deliver big upside against other memecoins in 2025. By running directly on Ethereum mainnet, Pepeto is setting up as a true hub for meme trading. Its presale is active at $0.000000150, with more than $6.5M raised already, proof that early investors see trust and potential. Culture drives attention, but the deeper foundation is infrastructure. Key Reasons Pepeto Is the Best Crypto to Buy Now • Ethereum mainnet launch, not Layer 2, with instant access to liquidity, tools, and millions of wallets. • PepetoSwap charges zero fees, boosting trader returns and driving higher volumes. • The Pepeto token itself powers PepetoSwap, giving it continuous utility and growth potential. • A native cross-chain bridge that connects ecosystems with faster and cheaper transfers. • Audited twice, by SolidProof and Coinsult, clearing the path for larger investors. • Tokenomics designed for clarity: 420T supply, 30% presale, 30% staking, 20% marketing, 12.5% liquidity, and 7.5% development, all without trading tax. • Presale success with $6.5M+ raised at $0.000000150, showing strong demand before TGE. • Growth drivers ahead include TGE, possible exchange listings, and adoption of PepetoSwap. Final Takeaway The picture is clear. If Bitcoin reaches $180K to $250K, new profits will flow into coins that offer higher upside. Pepeto delivers that lane, with its tiny presale entry, working tools, and roadmap that sparks adoption. This is how a meme coin can climb far beyond the headlines of Bitcoin itself. Smart investors keep their Bitcoin, but they also build early positions in Pepeto before it reaches the market spotlight. Those who buy now get the lowest price and can earn high staking rewards while waiting. That is why whales are already joining the presale.

Leading the charge in this space is Austin Federa, former Head of Strategy at the Solana Foundation, who is gearing up to launch DoubleZero , a protocol designed to redefine how blockchains communicate and scale. In a wide-ranging conversation with CoinDesk, Federa delved into the motivations behind DoubleZero, the challenges it addresses and that may come out of it, and why its vision for a high-performance networking layer could be the foundation for the next generation of decentralized systems. DoubleZero was first announced in December 2024 as a blockchain layer aimed to be faster than the internet and therefore crucial for crypto trades. Since then nearly 12.57% of SOL staked is operating on the DoubleZero testnet. The mainnet launch is expected to happen sometime in September. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. CoinDesk: Explain how DoubleZero works to someone who is new to crypto. Austin Federa: I think one of the easiest ways to explain what we're building is we're building crypto’s version of Flash Boys . That really was this transformational moment where people kind of realized that your edge in execution on a centralized trading venue, was no longer your actual trade logic or the speed of the computer that you have hooked up to the market, it is how quickly you can get data between different points where market events occur. That was kind of a really big change in the industry, because transit time was not [previously] considered to be terribly important. You can go back and watch Formula 1 races from the 80s, they're just taking a cigarette break during a pit stop, and then someone realized “oh man, we're actually leaving a lot of time on the track by these pit stops not being optimized.” And it really is something quite similar in the trading space. So for crypto, the idea of using something that's faster than the public internet (that you can use a network that you can use technologies on that are not available on the public internet), it's not necessarily a new idea. The problem was, until DoubleZero came along, it would have to have been run by one centralized company and not allow for multiple independent contributors. The main technology, philosophy and economic unlock of the DoubleZero protocol is that it allows multiple contributors that have their own fiber networks to contribute portions or all of that fiber network to the DoubleZero network. It builds a giant, extremely high performance fiber mesh network that connects people all around the world. CoinDesk: Why build for Solana? Federa: We're not actually built on Solana. We do have a separate ledger system, but it's not a network that anyone ever deploys a smart contract to, it really is just an accounting database. The reason that we're supporting Solana first…is because Solana is pretty unique. If you look at fast blockchains, and then you look at node count, there's a ratio of transactions per second to number of nodes, no one comes even close to Solana. Any network that is anywhere near the performance of Solana has a 1/5th to a 1/10th of the number of actual nodes. And so the communications problem is an exponential problem. The more nodes you have in the system, and the more places you need to get data to go, the more bandwidth you need, the more the communication becomes a bottleneck. So the bigger and the faster you get a blockchain network, the more communication becomes a bottleneck for that network moving quickly. And so the real goal behind what we're doing is to allow blockchains to go faster than the public internet, without having to drop node count or add centralization. We think DoubleZero has a lot more applications than just Solana, and a lot more applications than just blockchain. But it is the place where there's the biggest need at the moment. You look at the other blockchains out there, and they just don't have these problems yet. CoinDesk: How does staking on Solana tie to DoubleZero? Federa: We have a stake pool that is staking to nodes on DoubleZero. As a percentage of stake, it's quite small, it's about 3 million SOL, (there's 500 million SOL), so it's not a huge amount of SOL. That was originally conceived of as a way to help subsidize the cost of validators running on our testnet, but turned out people were just very interested in running on testnet, and so that's been a really nice tool for getting more people on board with the network. When we launch mainnet data in September, that's going to be over 50 different fiber links right now. Currently its at eight. Many of the links will be 10 times faster than the connections that we have today in terms of their capacity. So going from 10 gigabit to 200 gigabit connections. We see a future where, when you get enough stake operating on the DoubleZero network, protocol designers at Solana are now able to jack up limits way higher than they can on the public internet, because there's more capacity offered on DoubleZero than is available to validators operating on the public internet today, and it's a lower latency connection. So the data transmission actually, not only can you send more data, but that data arrives more quickly than it would otherwise. CoinDesk: So in your world there are two scenarios here: you have the public internet, or you have something like a DoubleZero. If you want to get something done faster, quicker, or other benefits for your trade, you go the DoubleZero route. Does that then create a performance inequality between validators on Solana? Federa: We get a version of this [question] a lot. And the question to ask yourself is, is the internet a centralizing force? The internet is basically just 20 companies that have most of the connectivity. And today if all of the OECD countries suddenly said, “no more crypto,” basically everything but bitcoin is hosed. So when we're honest about what we're feeling about here, the importance is not to get rid of the internet entirely. It is to make sure the internet is there as a fallback, as a censorship resistance path. And so if DoubleZero is offline, or if there is a bad actor in the DoubleZero network that decides to try and censor blocks or something along with censored data moving through it, two things will happen: One, this is why we have nine independent contributors on the network, so data will just route around them, and we can basically kick a contributor off the network. And the second thing is, we always have the public internet to fall back on. Now that may require Solana dropping from 500,000 transactions per second to 10,000 transactions per second. But that's not a bad failback state. That's kind of your classic, “there's a traffic jam on the highway, I'll take the county road at the moment.” CoinDesk: So mainnet is coming very soon. What's happening between now and then? Federa: It's a lot of testing, it's a lot of making sure that we're fully ready to go. And then it's obviously a token-based project. So there is a token launch that will go along with that as well, also in the month of September.

The Case Against Strategy Bitcoinist has reported that plaintiffs led by Anas Hamza filed a class action suit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, against Strategy Inc., co-founder Michael J. Saylor, Chief Executive Officer Phong Le, and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang as defendants.The case filed by Pomerantz LLP claimed violations of federal securities laws, specifically Section 10(b) with Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In particular, the complaint claimed that Strategy downplayed the financial risks of its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy while also failing to share proper information on the expected profitability of this crypto investment. The lawsuit also argued that executives failed to adequately disclose the potential impact of adopting Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-08, which requires companies to mark crypto assets at fair market value and report fluctuations directly in earnings. Plaintiffs Voluntarily Dismiss Claims Interestingly, in a Bloomberg Law report on Friday, the lead plaintiffs and a shareholder have now voluntarily dismissed their claims against Strategy Inc. and its executives in a joint agreement. Notably, the dismissal applies with prejudice to the named plaintiffs, i.e., meaning they cannot refile the same claims, though this law does not extend to potential absent class members. The lawsuit, covering a class period from April 30, 2024, to April 4, 2025, had sought unspecified damages, legal fees, and other relief. However, the plaintiffs’ decision to step back brings the case to a close without a trial or settlement. In earlier filings, Strategy stated it intended to “vigorously defend” itself against the allegations and maintained that its disclosures about Bitcoin-related risks and accounting practices were accurate and complete. With the voluntary dismissal, the company avoids what could have been a prolonged legal battle for the leading Bitcoin treasury holder. Strategy had recently made another Bitcoin bulk financing through another stock sale. The Saylor-led company reportedly issued shares worth $359 million in new shares, using the proceeds from which to buy 3,081. At the time of writing, Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings stand at 632,457 and are valued at around $68.5 billion. Meanwhile, MSTR trades at $334.41, a price loss of 4.43% and 10.23%, in the last one and five days, respectively.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Treasury Company|Bloomberg|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Strategy,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-30 13:00:09

XRP has once again attracted focus, with analysts watching for a potential breakout cycle. Historical surges suggest the possibility of another rally if patterns hold. OKB is also in the spotlight, holding near $120 support. While this level shows resilience, it also carries the risk of breakdown if momentum fades. Traders remain divided, weighing short term signals against longer term strength. BlockDAG stands apart by emphasizing fundamentals that extend beyond speculation. The project has already raised $387 million in presale at a Batch 30 price of $0.03 with a $0.05 launch target confirmed. With millions using its X Series miners and 20 exchanges already secured, BlockDAG (BDAG) is positioning itself as the best crypto platform to watch in 2025. XRP Eyes Breakout Potential but Awaits Confirmation XRP has captured market attention once again as traders watch for signs of a larger rally. The price is hovering near $3 after a January move to $3.40, with analysts pointing to the long-term ascending channel that has guided past bull runs. Historical surges, such as the move from $0.39 to $3.30 in 2017 and from $0.79 to $1.96 in 2020, are fueling speculation of another repeat. Some analysts suggest XRP could climb as high as $28 if the pattern holds, though the market is waiting for clear technical confirmation. This leaves XRP in a phase of anticipation where optimism remains strong, but conviction depends on whether momentum can shift decisively in the weeks ahead. OKB Tests Crucial Support With Mixed Signals OKB is trading near $120, making this level the center of bullish and bearish speculation. Technical signals place the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement at $120.06 and the EMA-50 at $119.96 as critical markers. A push above the EMA-20 at $122.54 could reignite momentum toward $126 and $130, while a breakdown risks corrections toward $113 or even $105. Market sentiment leans cautiously positive, but the fading impulse shows traders are hesitant. Speculators remain alert, knowing a sudden move could drive volatility quickly in either direction. For now, OKB’s price action highlights the excitement and uncertainty that make it a token to watch closely. BlockDAG’s $387M Presale Backed by Miners, Sports, and Exchange Power BlockDAG has surged ahead in 2025, raising $387 million in its presale at a Batch 30 price of $0.03, with a confirmed listing target of $0.05. This success is anchored by three pillars that highlight real delivery, measurable adoption, and long-term scalability. Unlike speculative projects still searching for traction, BlockDAG has already built a framework that is functioning ahead of launch. The first pillar is its X Series miners, which appeal to both mobile and hardware users. The X1 app miner has already attracted more than 3 million participants mining BDAG coins daily through Proof of Engagement. Alongside it, the X10, X30, and X100 miners offer scalable solutions with earning potential that grows in line with user goals, providing a system that blends retail accessibility with industrial scale performance. The second pillar is BlockDAG’s visibility through sports. Strategic partnerships with the Seattle Orcas cricket team and Seattle Seawolves rugby club have extended the project’s reach to global fanbases. These collaborations bring co-branded content, NFTs, and interactive fan engagement, connecting blockchain technology with mainstream audiences and reinforcing BlockDAG’s brand beyond crypto. The third pillar is the confirmation of 20 exchange listings, including major names such as MEXC, BitMart, LBank, Coinstore, and XT.com. With liquidity and accessibility already secured, BlockDAG removes the uncertainty that often plagues new projects. Together, the X Series miners, sports partnerships, and guaranteed exchange listings solidify its reputation as the best crypto platform to watch in 2025. Quick Rundown XRP and OKB remain closely watched, but both are still bound to shifting sentiment. XRP’s chart suggests potential gains if past patterns repeat, though confirmation is lacking, while OKB’s stability at $120 shows strength but also carries risk if support fails. These factors highlight the uncertainty of relying only on technicals and market mood. BlockDAG sets itself apart with fundamentals already in motion. With $387 million raised in presale at a Batch 30 price of $0.03, 3 million X Series miners, sports partnerships with the Orcas and Seawolves, and 20 confirmed exchange listings, it demonstrates delivery before launch. This foundation makes BlockDAG the best crypto platform to watch in 2025.

An analyst has warned that the coin shows strong bearish signs after being rejected at a resistance level. The price has now fallen to a critical support area, where buyers are trying to hold the line. According to the analyst, if the level fails, the price could drop even lower, raising doubts about whether the key levels will remain safe. Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Turned Bearish After $121,000 Rejection The analyst explained that the bearish trend began when Bitcoin strongly rejected the $121,000 resistance level. According to the analyst, that rejection forced the coin to break down from its earlier upward channel, which had guided the price during its last rally. Once this breakdown happened, the mood in the market shifted, and a new bearish phase took hold. Related Reading: VanEck CEO Reveals Which Altcoin Is “The Wall Street Token”, It’s Not XRP The analyst added that Bitcoin first moved within a downward channel, but even that structure could not hold. As selling pressure increased, the coin also broke below the support level of this channel. The downward move marked a shift in sentiment, as buyers could not keep the price stable. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s fall may now follow a steep local trend line, which could cause the coin to decline faster. This kind of move shows that sellers are firmly in control for now. The analyst’s view is that the rejection at $121,000 was a turning point, and the coin has been unable to regain strength since then. For many traders, this level has become a clear resistance that won’t break again without strong demand. $109,700 Support Under Pressure, Analyst Targets $104,000 Next The analyst also pointed out that Bitcoin is now directly testing the key buyer zone at $109,700. The level acts as a horizontal support, and the analyst says that if it fails, the bearish case could only grow stronger. While there may be a short period of sideways movement or a minor retest of the nearby trend line, the analyst believes the dominant force in the market remains downward pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin OG Who Told People To Buy BTC At $1 Reveals How High XRP Price Will Go In simple terms, the analyst expects the weight of selling to break the $109,700 level. If that happens, the path to $104,000 becomes the next logical target. The analyst explained that this lower zone could be the next support area where buyers might try to fight back. However, if $109,700 does not hold, the move to $104,000 could come quickly. Beyond that, the market will begin to ask a bigger question — can Bitcoin hold the critical $100,000 level? Traders are watching closely, because a break below that level would mark a significant shift in the broader trend.

ISO 20022 is designed to create a universal language for transactions, allowing institutions to interact more efficiently by reducing complexity and enhancing interoperability. According to the Bank for International Settlements, the adoption of ISO 20022 is accelerating because it enables a shared communication framework across both traditional financial systems and blockchain-based platforms. This standardization is critical as it ensures banks, fintechs, and distributed ledger technology networks can communicate on the same foundation. Financial institutions are already in the process of migrating to ISO 20022 , and the framework is now being positioned as the backbone of global financial messaging. ISO 20022 OPENS DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN RIPPLENET + XRP AND SWIFT Once ISO 20022 is fully established, RippleNet will connect directly with SWIFT, creating a unified pathway for international payments. This alignment places Ripple at the center of the global transition… pic.twitter.com/96E3BJKe9k — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 29, 2025 Ripple’s Strategic Positioning with ISO 20022 Ripple anticipated the industry’s shift toward ISO 20022 and integrated compatibility into its network to align with the requirements of financial institutions. Ripple’s focus has been on banking and institutional transactions, making ISO 20022 a natural fit for its operations. As explained in industry reports, Ripple specifically adapted its systems to ensure it could interact with banks that were transitioning to the new standard. RippleNet’s compatibility means its messaging system is already aligned with the standards used by global institutions. This ensures that transactions executed on RippleNet can seamlessly integrate into the broader financial ecosystem, making it easier for banks and payment providers to adopt digital asset solutions. XRP, as the bridge asset on RippleNet, is positioned to provide liquidity across currencies once connected through the ISO 20022 framework. SWIFT and the Integration Pathway The documents attached by SMQKE underscore how ISO 20022 will impact SWIFT, the world’s leading financial messaging network. SWIFT has confirmed that once ISO 20022 is fully established, its system will allow banks and fintech companies to connect directly via application programming interfaces. This transition opens the door for interoperability between SWIFT’s international payments network and blockchain-based solutions, such as RippleNet. RippleNet’s alignment with ISO 20022 means it can integrate with SWIFT’s infrastructure, creating a direct pathway for cross-border payments. With XRP functioning as a liquidity solution, banks using RippleNet can access instant settlement across multiple currencies while still operating within SWIFT’s established framework. The Global Transition to Modernized Infrastructure The move toward ISO 20022 represents a wider shift in the modernization of financial infrastructure. Institutions worldwide are upgrading their systems to comply with the standard, ensuring that cross-border transactions become faster, more efficient, and less reliant on fragmented systems. By ensuring early compatibility, RippleNet has placed itself at the center of this transformation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The shared framework not only reduces redundancy in transaction messaging but also enables scalable interaction between digital networks and traditional financial institutions. With SWIFT confirming its integration strategy and RippleNet already positioned for compatibility, the two systems are on course to function within a unified payment environment. SMQKE’s post emphasizes that ISO 20022 establishes a direct connection between RippleNet, XRP, and SWIFT, creating a foundation for greater interoperability in global payments. Ripple’s strategic preparation for this transition places its network at the core of the financial industry’s modernization process. With banks adopting ISO 20022 and SWIFT enabling connections through APIs, RippleNet and XRP provide the liquidity and messaging compatibility needed to support the next phase of international financial infrastructure.

Key Takeaways: Gryphon shareholders approved a merger with Trump-linked American Bitcoin, including a 5-to-1 reverse stock split. The combined company will rebrand as American Bitcoin and begin trading under the ticker “ABTC” on Sept. 2. The move gives American Bitcoin fast-track public market access. The Las Vegas-based Bitcoin miner announced Friday that its shareholders voted in favor of the merger earlier in the week. A reverse five-to-one stock split will be completed by 5:00 pm ET on Sept. 2, after which the combined company will trade under the name American Bitcoin with the ticker symbol “ABTC.” Gryphon Shareholders Approve 5-to-1 Reverse Split Ahead of Merger The split will reduce Gryphon’s outstanding shares from 82.8 million to approximately 16.6 million. Originally revealed in May, the deal allows American Bitcoin, launched by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump earlier this year , to enter public markets without a separate IPO, using Gryphon’s Nasdaq listing as a vehicle. The Trump-backed company emerged from a rebrand of American Data Center and is affiliated with mining infrastructure provider Hut 8. American Bitcoin has positioned itself as a pure-play mining venture focused on Bitcoin accumulation. It has disclosed 215 BTC in holdings, though third-party data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET suggests its reserves could approach 1,941 BTC. Gryphon Digital Mining $GRYP will merge with American Bitcoin $ABTC , co-founded by Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and @Hut8Corp . With Gryphon’s stock up over 200% since the merger announcement, investors are asking: is this a golden opportunity? 00:00 Intro to Gryphon-American… pic.twitter.com/Y8M1ryvGMe — Hayden Otto (@Hayden_Otto) August 29, 2025 Shares of Gryphon fell more than 10% on Friday, giving back part of Thursday’s 41% rally that followed initial reports of the merger. The deal is seen as combining Gryphon’s low-cost mining operations with American Bitcoin’s aggressive treasury strategy to create a more competitive presence in the public mining space. The merger reflects a broader trend of public firms ramping up their Bitcoin exposure. Collectively, listed companies now hold nearly 990,000 BTC, led by Strategy’s dominant 631,000 BTC position. American Bitcoin has been exploring acquisitions in Hong Kong and Japan to expand its footprint, the Financial Times reported earlier this month. American Bitcoin’s interest in Asia taps into markets with deep retail trading culture and growing regulatory openness toward crypto. Hong Kong has positioned itself as a digital asset hub, and Japanese-listed vehicles could provide a regulated path for institutional and retail investors to participate. Trump Family Expands Crypto Ties The venture is one of several crypto-linked businesses tied to the Trump family. In June, Donald Trump disclosed $57 million in income from World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform that recently announced a $1.5 billion token buyback in partnership with Las Vegas-based blockchain firm ALT5 Sigma. Separately, Trump Media & Technology Group, which operates Truth Social, plans to raise $2.5 billion to establish its own Bitcoin treasury. Meanwhile, the Trump administration advanced its pro-crypto agenda with a series of policy and regulatory moves. President Trump signed an executive order urging regulators to remove barriers that prevent 401(k) plans from including alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies. If implemented, the reforms could allow millions of Americans to allocate retirement funds to Bitcoin and other digital assets through regulated channels. Trump also nominated economist Stephen Miran , a digital asset advocate, to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, signaling continuity in his administration’s pro-crypto stance.

Not Exactly …,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/08/30/has-el-salvador-made-its-bitcoin-holdings-quantum-proof-not-exactly,"El Salvador has overhauled how it stores the nation’s bitcoin, saying the change both strengthens security today and prepares for technological risks that could emerge in the future. In an announcement on Friday, the Bitcoin Office said the country’s entire reserve has been moved out of a single wallet and spread across many new ones. Each wallet will hold no more than 500 BTC, a limit meant to reduce the potential damage if any one of them were ever compromised. Officials described the new setup as following established industry practices while also anticipating advances in quantum computing. Quantum machines, they noted, could one day break the cryptographic math that secures bitcoin, as well as everyday systems like banking, email and online communications. The concern arises when coins are spent. To move bitcoin, the digital signature protecting those funds must be revealed on the blockchain. Today, that’s safe, but in theory a future quantum computer could exploit the exposed information to calculate the private key and steal the coins before the transaction is confirmed. By shifting coins into many unused wallets, El Salvador reduces the chance that its reserve is left with too many exposed keys at once. Most of its holdings remain locked behind information that cannot currently be attacked, and capping the size of each wallet means even a breach would not put the entire reserve at risk. The government also admitted that its earlier setup — keeping everything in a single address for the sake of transparency — created unnecessary exposure. That address was used repeatedly, which meant its keys were visible on the blockchain almost continuously. In the new model, a public dashboard allows anyone to track the reserve across multiple wallets, preserving accountability without repeatedly reusing the same address. In plain terms, the shift is like moving money out of one giant vault and into a series of smaller safes. The locks on those safes stay hidden until they are opened, and no single safe holds too much cash. Beyond the quantum angle, this also lines up with basic bitcoin housekeeping. Experienced users often warn against reusing the same wallet over and over, since it weakens privacy and security. They also recommend breaking large balances into smaller chunks, which limits the fallout if something goes wrong. That’s why Adam Back, one of bitcoin’s earliest pioneers and the CEO of Blockstream, praised the change. Writing on X, he said it’s “generally a good practice” to split funds into many pieces — called UTXOs in bitcoin jargon — rather than piling them into one place and reusing the same address. Back, who invented the proof-of-work system Hashcash that inspired bitcoin and was cited by Satoshi Nakamoto, didn’t weigh in on the quantum argument directly. Instead, his comment underscored that El Salvador’s new approach reflects principles long recognized as best practice in the bitcoin world. Most researchers believe quantum computers powerful enough to threaten bitcoin are still a decade or more away, and the network could eventually adopt new protections if needed. But El Salvador is not waiting. By combining transparency with a more resilient storage model, the country has positioned itself as a test case for how sovereign bitcoin reserves might be managed in the future — setting out a potential blueprint that others could follow.",Tech|El Salvador|btc|Crypto Custody|News,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-30 13:17:27

The market cap stands at $172.11 billion and the daily volume at $6.06 billion, as sentiment is mixed with investors weighing stress in the short-term and potential in the long term. Curiously, the reversal has sparked comparisons with early-stage potential, with some pointing towards Remittix (RTX) as a prospect that compares with the XRP days when the coin traded at a mere $0.02. From XRP Price Uncertainty to Fresh DeFi Expansion The decline of XRP Price proves that even established tokens are no exception to volatility. However, at the same time, it proves why so many investors are opting for young cryptocurrencies. It is here that Remittix, with a value of just $0.1000 per token, enters the conversation. Remittix has already presaled for $22.2 million, selling more than 630 million RTX tokens. The project is different from the majority of low cap crypto gems because it’s created with real-world adoption in mind. Unlike being yet another speculative token, it attempts to provide a bridge between crypto and traditional banking. Why Remittix Differentiates In 2025 As one of the leading crypto presales 2025, Remittix is building what it calls a cross-chain DeFi project. Basically, it allows users to remit cryptocurrencies directly into bank accounts in over 30 countries with over 40 cryptocurrencies supported. This makes RTX a prime investment bet for investors seeking crypto that addresses actual problems. And what enhances the project’s allure is the Q3 2025 reported beta wallet release. The wallet will have real-time FX conversion, low gas fee crypto transfer, and cross-border remittances, making payments seamless for freelancers, businesses, and worldwide earners. Already having its listings on BitMart and LBANK in the books, RTX is building momentum at a level above most other new crypto projects on the horizon. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction Over $22.2Million in presale with 630Million+ tokens sold CEX listings on BitMart and LBANK secured first Beta wallet launch Q3 2025 with real utility feature $250,000 giveaway generating presale buzz The Bigger Picture For Investors The fall in XRP Price serves as a reminder that markets can change overnight. Those investors who missed out on XRP’s first rise may find Remittix to be another altcoin to keep an eye on in 2025. Its combination of low entry point, compliant exchange listings, and real-world adoption approach makes it one of the quickest growing crypto 2025 contenders. While speculative tokens are dominating the headlines, projects like Remittix highlight the reason why crypto with actual utility is dominating. Whether or not it is the next trending altcoin 2025, though, with good presale momentum and a forthcoming wallet launch, RTX is already one of the leading DeFi projects 2025.

Interest is growing as investors watch these well-known tokens face a fresh challenger. Strong whispers suggest that this newcomer could outshine top names and set a new trend for 2025. What makes this new coin stand out? Dogecoin (DOGE) Source: TradingView Dogecoin trades between $0.21 and $0.25. The last 7 days brought a 3.86% lift, but the 30-day chart shows a mild 0.31% dip. Even so, the coin is 8.08% higher than 6 months ago, hinting at a steady uptrend that keeps bulls interested. Buyers are poking $0.25. The first ceiling sits at $0.27, about 8% above. A break could open $0.30, a 20% jump from now. If sellers step in, price may drop 14% to $0.19 or 30% to $0.1541. These bands will guide the next move. Momentum is flat. Both 10 day and 100 day averages sit at $0.22, so DOGE hovers near fair value. The neutral RSI backs that view. Should volume rise, odds favor a push to $0.27 before month end. Failure to clear it would likely drag price back inside the $0.21-$0.25 channel. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price , far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Shiba Inu (SHIB) Source: TradingView The coin trades between $0.00001214 and $0.00001364, adding 1.78% over the past week after slipping 3.97% in a month and 7.70% in six months. Buyers are trying to build on the small uptick, but the range remains tight. Price now sits just above the 10-day and 100-day averages at $0.00001258 and $0.00001245. That crossover hints at a steady trend. RSI at 51.18 is neutral, while stochastic at 63.44 leans mild buy. If bulls clear $0.00001433, the next barrier at $0.00001583 could lift SHIB about 20% from today. A drop under $0.00001133 could drag it toward $0.000009833, a similar 20% slide. Short-term bias tilts up because recent green candles outnumber red and the MACD edges higher. Still, the weak monthly chart warns of lingering sellers. A close above $0.00001364 could flip the monthly change from –3.97% to roughly +10%. Failure keeps price boxed in the narrow band and may pull it 8% toward support. Current data favors patience with a slight bullish lean. Conclusion DOGE and SHIB remain popular, yet XYZVerse (XYZ) fuses sports fervor with meme appeal, targeting 20,000% gains and community-driven GameFi growth in the current 2025 bull run.

Cardano ETF approval odds surge to 87%, per Polymarket data. ADA price holds support, needs $0.88 breakout for next rally. Grayscale Investments has filed fresh S-1 registration statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for Polkadot (DOT) and Cardano (ADA) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The filings follow up on previously submitted 19b-4 forms, meaning that Grayscale is formalizing spot product structures for both tokens, similar to the final steps taken before Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs won approval. Cardano ETF Odds Improve According to Polymarket data, the probability of SEC approval for a Cardano ETF has jumped to 87% following Grayscale’s updated filing. As for ADA price, the recent pullback below $0.88 is not surprising and ADA is still holding important support levels that keep the bullish case intact. ADA Price Needs to Break $0.88 to Trigger the Next Rally The main support area sits between $0.789 and $0.852.

Bitcoin is well-positioned to outperform in the next round of monetary policy easing, especially after a period of cooled sentiment. Historical comparisons show that traditional assets like stocks and gold mostly mirror money printing, with stocks not significantly outperforming gold over decades. While I see strong upside for Bitcoin, I recommend diversification and caution against leverage due to Bitcoin's history of sharp drawdowns. In my previous article on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in January 2025, I argued that there were indications that sentiment for BTC was at a peak, and this was probably not the best time to buy BTC. Indeed, BTC was relatively flat for most of 2025 compared to the large run-up seen in 2024. BTC 2024-25 price (stockcharts) However, I believe BTC is still on a long-term upward trajectory, and recent events provide a good catalyst for another move upwards. In particular, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave a speech on August 22, 2025, with tantalizing hints, which many in the financial media interpret as opening the door to easing monetary policy. In this article, I will discuss why I believe Bitcoin (BTC) may be the best-performing asset in this round of monetary policy easing. #1 Liquidity (i.e., money printing) is the key driver of asset prices We are living in a liquidity-driven era, especially post-2008 financial crisis, when governments around the world embarked on quantitative easing (QE) and other monetary experiments, which basically meant printing more and more money to fund higher and higher deficits as % of GDP. US deficit as % of GDP (FRED) A simple comparison shows this to be the case. Let's look at the S&P (first chart below) and gold (second chart below). Let’s not consider extreme cases where an investor buys and sells at bottoms and peaks, but instead let’s take a look at some realistic examples: S&P 500 since 2000 (Macrotrends.net) Gold since 2000 (Macrotrends.net) Summary of S&P 500 index vs. gold performance Starting Year S&P 500 index S&P total returns*: starting year to 2025 Gold ($/oz) Gold total returns*: starting year to 2025 2004 ~1100 734% $400 762% 2006 ~1400 614% $600 475% 2012 ~1400 519% $1700 103% 2016 ~2000 287% $1200 188% 2025 ~6500 n/a $3450 n/a *Note that S&P total returns are calculated assuming dividends are reinvested based on this source (using 2004 as an example). Gold total returns are calculated based on the gold price in 2025 compared with the gold price in the years listed above. Source: Various online sources Let’s say an investor sees an improving economy post-the 9/11 scare and the dotcom bubble and buys S&P or gold in 2004. 20 years later, gold has returned slightly more at 762% versus S&P 734%. (However, had the same investors bought S&P and gold in 2012 and 2016, S&P's total returns would have exceeded gold, as gold prices had increased a lot in those years versus 2004, while S&P had appreciated a lot less). What’s the point of the comparison, you ask? The point is that assuming gold prices in the long run (i.e., over the span of decades) are a good reflection of long-term currency debasement through money printing, and I believe this assumption to be valid, then much of the vaunted massive gains in stocks are nothing more than just the result of mirroring money printing. All of those magnificent tech giants and AI and globalization and everything have resulted in an S&P 500 that has probably only produced not much more returns than owning a bunch of boring gold bars. What’s even more sombering is that the S&P 500’s price-to-earnings ratio based on average inflation-adjusted earnings from the previous 10 years, known as the cyclically adjusted PE Ratio (CAPE Ratio), is near a record high of 39, significantly above the 20-30 range it has traded in most of the past two decades, and even at such valuations, S&P has underperformed gold from 2004 to 2025. S&P 500 CAPE (multpl.com) To me, this long-winded detour means that the current market is liquidity-driven more than fundamentals-driven. Yes, there are some tech giants doing some cool stuff, and we have a lot more gadgets to play with than two decades ago, but stocks are mostly going up because governments are printing money rather than the economy becoming more productive. #2 Bitcoin has more room to go when compared with other assets When compared with other assets, Bitcoin still has more room to go. Asset Benchmark compared US stocks 1. S&P 500 CAPE of 39, almost the highest on record 2. Market cap of other countries (e.g., Europe) Gold Cost of production: Gold is currently trading at double or more the AISC (all-in sustaining costs) of many producers; see details below BTC Market cap: BTC market cap of $2.3 trillion vs. gold’s market cap of $23 trillion Source: from various sources online US stocks have a market cap of $66 trillion, whereas if you add the main Western European countries together, you get about $10+ trillion (UK $4 trillion, France $3 trillion, Germany $3 trillion, Spain $1 trillion, Italy $1 trillion). While US stocks have done well and can continue to do well for the foreseeable future, for those of us who have been around long enough, there’s always the downside risk to consider. When the 10-year CAPE is at nearly 40, it suggests to me that investors should be cautious rather than make new bets that the train won’t stop. Put this together, and it starts to remind one of the anecdotes of the Japanese imperial palace being worth more than all the land in California during the late 1980s bubble. Gold: Gold may be the best asset for the super long run in terms of durability. But it’s trading at relatively elevated levels compared to, say, its cost of production as per the source below, and is not cheap compared to several years ago, when it was trading slightly above its AISC. gold cost of production (miningvisuals.com) Bitcoin is arguably today’s gold, at least for many amongst the new generation of investors, who view it as digital gold. Bitcoin has two factors in its favor: Momentum: While the long-term prospects for Bitcoin are less certain (will people still treat Bitcoin as a store of value 50 or 100 years later?). Maybe or maybe not, even though gold will probably still be a steady store of value 50 or 100 years later, it is performing as an alternative store of value right now and can probably continue to do so for the next few years until something dramatically negatively changes how market participants view Bitcoin (for example, another crypto asset becomes more popular than Bitcoin, or market participants revert to more traditional stores of value such as gold). But as of this moment and for the foreseeable future, Bitcoin still has momentum; witness how even Gucci recently declared it would accept payments in crypto in some stores. Limited supply: Bitcoin's theoretical upper limit is 21 million coins, but it's already relatively close at 20 million coins mined as of the most recent date. The next "" halving "" is expected to occur 4 years later, but even without considering halving, 95% of all potential Bitcoin has already been mined, and essentially, Bitcoin has very limited new supply. A higher ceiling: Bitcoin's market cap is still relatively small ($2.3 trillion) compared to other stores of value, say gold ($23 trillion). As long as Bitcoin’s acceptance amongst the investment community (and even as a payment method) grows and the market continues to be liquidity/money-printing driven, I could very well see Bitcoin become more ""gold-like"" - even if Bitcoin eventually becomes half as valuable as gold (i.e., a market cap of $11 trillion), that would still be a 400% increase versus the current $2.3 trillion market cap. Update to my “hold” rating in early 2025: In my previous article on BTC in January 2025, I suggested measuring sentiment for BTC using the Google search interest index : In the past 5 years, a Google search interest index of around 70-100 would suggest investors are overly bullish (most prominently seen in the circle in red below on the left in 2021, where the high search interest index was before the massive decline in BTC prices from $66k/coin in 2021 to $15k/coin in 2022). Whereas index readings of 25-30 indicated cool sentiment and extended periods of at least several months coincided with BTC bottoming in late 2022 and moving upwards throughout 2023 and 2024. Q4-2025 index readings (circled in red below on the right) were at a peak, the highest since mid-2022. Since hitting around 65 in November 2024, the index has fallen to 20-30 for much of 2025. As was the case in recent upward movements by BTC, a period of consolidation typically followed large gains, as shown below. Note that these correlations are not perfect on a day-to-day basis, but for major peaks and bottoms, these are a good reference point: when investors show a high interest in Googling for Bitcoin, it's probably time to be cautious, and when investors have been less interested in Bitcoin for some time, then it may be time to consider buying. Google search index Bitcoin (Google) BTC 5 year chart (stockcharts) Now that what I believe to be overly bullish sentiment in early 2025 has been given some time to cool down, it may pave the way for further upside. I would also prefer to invest in BTC compared to “alternative” methods such as investing in Coinbase ( COIN ) stock, as I discussed in a recent article. Risks to bullish thesis I think there are a few risks for BTC ： One is that investors may lose interest and chase other shiny new instruments. I remember how gold was epitomized by many investors as the only safe store of value in the early 2000s. A new generation of investors has grown up in an environment of crypto and memes rather than gold. However, this interest could shift if something else shiny and alluring comes along. That said, right now I don't see anything similar in the works, especially in the crypto field. Since the 2022 bear market, there has been a flight to quality, reflected in Bitcoin's dominance (i.e., Bitcoin as % of total crypto market cap), increasing from a low of 37% in 2022/2023 to 57-58% currently. BTC dominance (coingecko.com) The other is that a severe monetary tightening and economic recession, both of which do not seem to be imminent, will cause holders of Bitcoin to liquidate their holdings for cash and restrict new money from flowing into Bitcoin. Indeed, this sounds far-fetched in the short run when policymakers seem intent on keeping the economy running hot, as American leaders are pushing the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates , but in the long run, it’s not as implausible as it sounds. Major developed economies are all running massive deficits as a % of GDP, which means these economies are consuming way in excess of production. At some point, say when bondholders are no longer willing to fund such extravagance, consumption will revert to equal production. Individuals find they need money to pay bills, and there’s no investable cash to throw at shiny memes and coins, and if this persists over a prolonged period, the public could lose interest in Bitcoin. However, as policymakers are currently tilted towards lowering interest rates, the near-term risk from such monetary tightening in the next few months is remote. Conclusion As usual, I would suggest diversifying (i.e., not putting all the eggs in one basket) across crypto and non-crypto assets, and by no means am I suggesting betting the farm on one asset; however, I do believe BTC has a good chance to be a market-beating investment in the next upward move. That said, I would caution against any leveraged move given that BTC has suffered immense drawdowns in the past few years during bear markets, and it’s always possible that the next bear move is around the corner. Either buying ETFs (such as IBIT ) or buying plain BTC through any reputable platform or broker should suffice for the typical retail investor wishing to gain exposure.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-30 13:58:08

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/arrington-xrp-capitals-recent-acquisition-stuns-xrp-army-heres-why/,"XRP community figure WrathofKahneman highlighted a notable development involving Arrington XRP Capital, a digital asset management firm founded by Michael Arrington. According to the information shared, the firm has acquired a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Armada Acquisition Corp. II, for $6.6 million. The deal places Arrington XRP Capital directly within traditional financial markets through sponsorship of a Nasdaq-listed vehicle. The acquisition is significant in part due to the branding attached to Arrington XRP Capital. As WrathofKahneman emphasized, the move means that the XRP name is now directly tied to a regulated Wall Street entity. This crossover between digital assets and traditional markets underscores a formal entry of an XRP-branded fund into a space often reserved for institutional players and legacy financial structures. Arrington #XRP Capital acquired a publicly traded SPAC, Armada Acquisition Corp. II, for $6.6 million. Why this matters: 1.

A SPAC's purpose… pic.twitter.com/kKVmz8HTFF — WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) August 29, 2025 Function of the SPAC and Potential Outcomes SPACs are structured to raise capital through public markets with the intention of identifying private companies suitable for merger and public listing. By acquiring Armada Acquisition Corp. II, Arrington XRP Capital now holds the capability to identify and bring a private company into public markets under its sponsorship. WrathofKahneman noted the potential significance of this position. With a fund explicitly named after XRP in control of a Nasdaq-listed SPAC, there is now a direct channel through which blockchain or cryptocurrency-related firms could be taken public. This not only elevates the visibility of Arrington XRP Capital but also strengthens the presence of XRP-associated branding in the broader financial ecosystem. Industry Context Arrington XRP Capital has maintained its focus on blockchain and digital asset investments, and its founder, Michael Arrington, has been an advocate for the sector. The decision to acquire a SPAC aligns with a wider trend of digital asset-focused entities looking for new ways to integrate into traditional markets and broaden their scope of influence. WrathofKahneman’s observation points to an important development in how cryptocurrency-focused funds can position themselves as key participants in bridging digital finance with public market structures. The move places Arrington XRP Capital in a position to shape which blockchain or crypto-related firms may find their way to Nasdaq through a merger. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Strategic Significance The acquisition of Armada Acquisition Corp. II represents more than a capital transaction; it demonstrates a strategic step for Arrington XRP Capital in entering traditional market frameworks while carrying the XRP name into a highly regulated space. This advancement is not merely symbolic but establishes the fund as an active participant in the mechanics of public listings, potentially influencing which companies gain access to broader investment opportunities. As WrathofKahneman explained, the implications extend beyond Arrington XRP Capital itself. The XRP community now sees the brand in a Wall Street-regulated entity, offering a new level of visibility and association for digital assets in mainstream financial markets.

The Grayscale Cardano Trust ETF (GADA) and Grayscale Polkadot Trust ETF join a crowded field of 92 pending crypto ETF applications currently awaiting regulatory review. Both trusts were incorporated as Delaware Statutory Trusts on August 12, 2025, following Grayscale’s established pattern of Delaware registrations preceding SEC submissions. Altcoin ETF Race Heats Up as Approval Odds Surge The Cardano ETF would trade on NYSE Arca under ticker GADA, while specific exchange details for the Polkadot fund remain pending final approval. The filings arrive as prediction markets surge with optimism for the approval of altcoin ETFs. Solana maintains a 99% approval odds on Polymarket for 2025, up from 72% in May, while XRP holds an 87% probability, up from 64% in August. Source: Polymarket Even speculative memecoin Dogecoin commands 82% approval odds, nearly doubling from 44% in June. Grayscale’s aggressive expansion strategy includes converting five existing trusts into ETF structures, covering Litecoin, Solana, Dogecoin, XRP, and Avalanche. The firm simultaneously filed for Dogecoin ETF approval with ticker GDOG, entering competition with Rex-Osprey and Bitwise for similar products. Current crypto ETF applications encompass eight Solana proposals and seven XRP submissions, driven by renewed filing activity following the SEC’s feedback. Grayscale Fund Structured to Anticipate Regulatory Uncertainties Both Grayscale ETF proposals acknowledge significant regulatory risks, particularly the SEC’s previous determination that ADA constitutes a security. The Cardano filing warns that a final SEC security classification could trigger material adverse impacts on token value and potentially force the termination of the trust. The trusts operate through cash-only creation and redemption mechanisms, processing shares in 10,000-unit baskets through authorized participants and liquidity providers. In-kind transactions involving direct token deposits remain unavailable pending “In-Kind Regulatory Approval” that may never materialize. Notably, valuation relies on CoinDesk price indices, which are calculated daily at 4:00 PM New York time. Both funds maintain staking capabilities contingent on undefined “Staking Conditions” that currently remain unmet. The Polkadot trust anticipates staking up to 85% of holdings through provider-facilitated arrangements, while maintaining 28-day unbonding periods that introduce liquidity constraints. Additionally, Coinbase Custody Trust Company serves as custodian for both trusts. The Bank of New York Mellon also handles transfer agent and administration duties, while Coinbase Inc. provides prime brokerage services. Fee structures center on daily accruing sponsor fees paid in underlying tokens rather than cash. Institutional Demand Drives Altcoin ETF Pipeline Expansion The 92 pending crypto ETF applications represent a 28% increase from 72 submissions recorded in April. October deadlines loom for the majority of applications, particularly those for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin proposals, which could trigger significant market activity. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts project continued growth in filings, with Eric Balchunas suggesting that “ pretty soon there will be more crypto ETF filings than stocks .” Pretty soon there will be more crypto ETF filings than stocks https://t.co/txPR7S7iFu — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 28, 2025 Recent regulatory developments have favored broader approvals for crypto ETFs. The SEC’s approval of in-kind redemption mechanisms for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has widened compliance pathways. At the same time, the Project Crypto collaboration between the SEC and CFTC aims to clarify digital asset classifications under U.S. law. Twenty-one Shares and Grayscale lead Ethereum staking ETF applications following regulatory clarity on liquid staking operations. Notably, VanEck’s JitoSOL proposal also represents the first entirely liquid staking token-backed fund, tracking tokens representing staked SOL on the Solana network. A wave of XRP ETF amendments filed last week likely responded to SEC feedback, adjusting fund structures to accommodate both token and cash creations, as well as cash and in-kind redemptions. A wave of asset managers filed updated paperwork for spot XRP ETFs on Friday, signaling a renewed push to secure approval from the SEC. #ETFs #Crypto https://t.co/W0VqCgXjGp — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 23, 2025 Nate Geraci of The ETF Store called the synchronized filings “highly notable” and “a very good sign” for approval prospects. BlackRock, despite launching pioneering Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, confirmed no current plans for XRP products. Looking forward, as Alts continue their bullish trajectory, NoOne’s CEO, Ray Youssef, predicts that major cryptocurrencies, including SOL, XRP, and BNB, will attract huge capital investments. For SOL specifically, Youssef, speaking with Cryptonews, noted that Solana treasury companies are lining up funds running into tens of billions to accumulate SOL.

August saw an incredible surge in investment, particularly within the realm of Spot ETH ETFs . These funds, which allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price without directly holding the asset, experienced a phenomenal net inflow of $3.8 billion. This significant event marks the second-largest monthly inflow since their inception, signaling a growing appetite among investors for Ethereum-backed products. What’s Driving the Phenomenal Spot ETH ETFs Inflows? The impressive $3.8 billion (approximately 5.2884 trillion Korean Won) net inflow into U.S. Spot ETH ETFs in August, as reported by TraderT, truly captured the market’s attention. This surge highlights a crucial shift: institutional and retail investors are increasingly comfortable and eager to allocate capital to digital assets through regulated financial products. Such substantial inflows indicate strong market confidence and a bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum’s long-term potential. Significant Growth: $3.8 billion net inflow in August. Historical Context: Second-largest monthly inflow since launch. Investor Confidence: Reflects growing trust in regulated crypto investment vehicles. Moreover, the ease of access provided by ETFs compared to direct crypto purchases makes them an attractive option for a broader range of investors, further fueling these impressive numbers. This accessibility helps bridge the gap between traditional finance and the evolving digital asset economy. BlackRock’s Dominance: A Game Changer for Spot ETH ETFs? A major player in this August surge was none other than BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers. Their specific Ethereum ETF, ETHA, alone attracted a staggering $3.4 billion. This amount accounts for approximately 87% of the total monthly inflows into Spot ETH ETFs . BlackRock’s substantial involvement is often seen as a powerful validator in the financial world, lending significant credibility to the asset class. When an institution of BlackRock’s caliber commits such vast capital, it sends a strong signal to other institutional investors. This often encourages more conservative players to explore similar investment opportunities. Consequently, BlackRock’s dominant contribution could be a pivotal moment, potentially paving the way for even greater institutional adoption of Ethereum and other digital assets. Ethereum’s Price Action: Riding the Wave of Spot ETH ETFs? The impact of these massive inflows into Spot ETH ETFs wasn’t just confined to the investment products themselves; it also had a direct and positive effect on Ethereum’s underlying asset price. During the same period in August, the price of ETH experienced a remarkable rally, climbing by approximately 48%. It soared from an initial price of $3,353 to reach an impressive $4,957. This strong correlation suggests that the increased demand generated by ETF purchases significantly contributed to Ethereum’s price appreciation. As more capital flows into these funds, fund managers must acquire more ETH to back their shares, thereby increasing demand in the spot market. Therefore, the performance of Spot ETH ETFs can often serve as a leading indicator for Ethereum’s market dynamics, reflecting heightened investor interest and positive market sentiment. The Broader Impact: What’s Next for Spot ETH ETFs? The August performance of Spot ETH ETFs offers a compelling glimpse into the future of institutional crypto investment. This strong showing indicates that the market for regulated crypto products is maturing rapidly. As more asset managers launch their own Ethereum ETFs and as regulatory clarity improves globally, we could see these inflow trends continue, or even accelerate. However, it’s also crucial to consider the broader economic landscape and regulatory developments that might influence future performance. While the benefits of diversification and regulated access are clear, investors should remain informed about market volatility and evolving regulations. Nevertheless, the sustained interest, particularly from major financial players like BlackRock, underscores a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views and engages with digital assets. In summary, August was a landmark month for Spot ETH ETFs , characterized by colossal inflows, primarily driven by BlackRock’s significant contributions. This surge not only propelled Ethereum’s price to new highs but also solidified the position of these regulated investment vehicles as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto market. As institutional interest continues to grow, the future looks incredibly promising for Ethereum and the broader digital asset ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly are Spot ETH ETFs? Spot ETH ETFs, or Exchange-Traded Funds, are investment vehicles that hold actual Ethereum (ETH) as their underlying asset. They allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without directly buying, storing, or managing the cryptocurrency themselves, offering a more familiar and regulated way to invest. How significant were the August inflows for these funds? The $3.8 billion net inflow in August was highly significant, marking the second-largest monthly inflow since the launch of Spot ETH ETFs. This indicates a strong and growing interest from both institutional and retail investors in regulated Ethereum investment products. What role did BlackRock play in this surge? BlackRock played a dominant role, with its ETHA fund attracting $3.4 billion, accounting for approximately 87% of the total August inflows. BlackRock’s participation is crucial as it signals strong institutional confidence and often encourages other major financial players to enter the market. Did the inflows affect Ethereum’s price? Yes, there was a clear correlation. During the same period in August, the price of Ethereum (ETH) rose by about 48%, climbing from $3,353 to $4,957. The increased demand from ETFs, which need to purchase ETH to back their shares, contributed significantly to this price appreciation. What does this mean for the future of institutional crypto investment? These substantial inflows suggest a maturing market for institutional crypto investment. They indicate that major financial players are increasingly comfortable and active in the digital asset space, potentially leading to further adoption, more regulated products, and a stronger integration of crypto into traditional finance.
