The lawsuit came just as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) unveiled a global system designed to help companies better manage and protect their intellectual property. Musk’s xAI in legal battle with ex-engineer Musk’s xAI filed its complain t on Thursday, August 28, in a California federal court, alleging that former employee Xuechen Li stole confidential material tied to Grok, the company’s conversational AI chatbot, and carried it to his new role at OpenAI earlier this month. According to the filing, Li helped train and develop Grok during his tenure at xAI, which began last year. The company alleges he downloaded and concealed files shortly after accepting a job offer from OpenAI and selling $7 million of his xAI stock in July. The lawsuit claims Li admitted to theft during a meeting on August 14, but investigators later discovered additional sensitive material on his devices. xAI is seeking monetary damages and a restraining order preventing Li from working for OpenAI. It’s important to note that OpenAI itself is not a defendant in the case. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 before leaving its board three years later, has become one of the company’s fiercest critics. He is currently pursuing separate lawsuits against OpenAI and chief executive Sam Altman for allegedly abandoning its initial non-profit mission, and earlier this week filed an antitrust case against OpenAI and Apple in Texas over alleged monopolization of AI chatbots on Apple devices. TSMC promotes trade secrets registry While Musk’s startup opted for litigation, TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, took a more systematic approach to trade secret protection. The Taiwanese company said it would begin marketing its proprietary registry system to partners in Europe and the US. The system, in development since 2013, functions as a secure database of confidential information, ranging from chip designs to manufacturing processes. To date, 20 local firms including ASE Technology Holding have adopted the platform. TSMC associate general counsel Fortune Shieh said that the registry integrates with HR and IT systems and uses artificial intelligence to track projects, joint ventures and standout talent. The database now contains more than 610,000 entries. “If our suppliers also adopt this trade secret registration and management system… it can help them build a stronger innovation culture and more systematic management… and in turn, we benefit from that as well,” Shieh said. The company mentioned that cybersecurity had been “a fundamental and necessary consideration” from the outset, with automatic encryption designed to render files unreadable even if hacked. Rising risks for global innovators Despite such precautions and systems in place, TSMC has itself faced theft incidents . Earlier this week, Taiwanese prosecutors indicted three individuals accused of stealing its trade secrets to benefit Japan’s Tokyo Electron. The company has vowed a “zero-tolerance” policy and increased internal monitoring following recent breaches. While xAI seeks legal redress for alleged misconduct by an individual employee, TSMC is institutionalizing and about to commercialize a framework aimed at preventing such disputes. The potential for leaks or divulging of intellectual property has long been a major headache for businesses, and in recent times, that risk has been elevated in the AI and semiconductor space as firms compete for scarce experts and breakthroughs. This gives insiders access to commercially critical data which can be difficult to manage. Litigation may be necessary to punish violations, but systems that catalogue and protect intellectual assets could prove more effective in deterring breaches and making sure of lasting innovation.

Disappointing U.S. inflation data is the key factor behind today’s fall, with Bitcoin dropping by 4% in the past 24 hours, and Ethereum by 6%. However, this article will look at three of the most promising up-and-coming altcoins, all of which could soon bring big returns when they list for the first time. Each of them combine strong fundamentals with growing online communities, giving them the potential to rank among the best meme coins in the market. Next 100x Crypto to Buy Now – 29 August Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) With over $12.7 million raised, layer-two project Bitcoin Hyper lays claim to one of the biggest presales of 2025, and it could have one of the biggest launches of the year as well. Bitcoin Hyper’s sale is performing so well because of its enviable fundamentals, with the project about to launch a layer-two network for Bitcoin. Unlike the preexisting Lightning Network, which is focused mostly on payments, Bitcoin Hyper will provide a DeFi and smart contract layer for Bitcoin. In other words, it will enable BTC holders to tap into the coin’s enormous value, hopefully unlocking further gains in the process. They can deposit Bitcoin with the L2’s smart contract, which will then provide them with a commensurate quantity of HYPER in return. They will then be able to use HYPER within the network’s growing ecosystem of DeFi apps and protocols. HYPER will also be necessary to pay for Bitcoin Hyper’s transaction fees, giving the coin lots of utility. With $HYPER you're always securing the bag. From Payments to dApps. Hyper does it all. https://t.co/VNG0P4FWNQ pic.twitter.com/yAPbP2G73a — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) August 27, 2025 Investors can buy it now by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website , where it’s currently selling at $0.012825. Visit the Official Website Here Maxi Doge (MAXI) Another potential 100x crypto, Maxi Doge is an ERC-20 meme token with a community- and trading-focused twist. It opened its own presale a few weeks ago and has now attracted $1.6 million in funding so far, with this figure increasing fast. While Maxi Doge is obviously Dogecoin themed, it’s aiming to be more than a simple meme token, with the coin working on building an online community of likeminded traders. It will operate Telegram and Discord channels, where it will organise regular trading competitions, which will serve to reward the best-performing traders and generate more engagement. These channels will also serve as forums where community members can share trading tips and strategies, while even coordinating collective action. On top of this, Maxi Doge will maintain a Maxi Fund that it will use to support new partnerships and ad campaigns. This fund will equal 25% of MAXI’s overall supply (of 150.24 billion), giving it plenty of ammunition. Given the enduring popularity of Dogecoin-themed coins, Maxi Doge has every chance of performing well once it lists, and traders can join its sale by going to its official website . Visit the Official Website Here Snorter Token (SNORT) Another coin with a strong chance of becoming the next 100x crypto to watch, Snorter (SNORT) is a Solana- and Ethereum-based trading bot . More specifically, it’s an automated sniping bot, which investors can use to spot tokens before they rally, making trades ahead of the market. It has already raised $3.5 million in its presale, while its official X account already has over 14,000 followers. This is a very encouraging sign of its future growth, and of all the new coins currently holding presales right now, Snorter has some of the strongest fundamentals. Not only will its bot snipe on behalf of users, but it will offer a wide range of other features, including copy trading, atomic swaps, limit orders, and protection against dumps. This makes it a hugely comprehensive bot, with the native token SNORT necessary to gain access to its features. This means that SNORT could attract plenty of demand in the event of Snort becoming popular. It will have a max supply of 500 million SNORT, with holders able to stake the token for a passive income. How to trade like a pro with Snorter: Step 1: Paste a token address. Step 2: Sit back. Snorter watches liquidity like a hawk on caffeine. Step 3: The instant funds drop in, I pounce. Buy executed.

This single transaction, valued at approximately $249 million, immediately sparked widespread discussion and speculation across the crypto market. Such large movements often signal important underlying shifts, making it crucial to understand what this particular event might signify for investors and the broader ecosystem. What Exactly Happened with This Bitcoin Transfer? On a recent day, Whale Alert, a popular blockchain transaction tracker, reported a substantial Bitcoin transfer . Specifically, 2,300 BTC departed from a wallet associated with Coinbase Institutional. The destination was an unidentified wallet address, making the precise intent behind the move unclear. Coinbase Institutional serves as a prime brokerage platform for institutional investors, offering advanced trading, custody, and financing services for digital assets. Source: Coinbase Institutional Amount: 2,300 BTC Value: Approximately $249 million at the time of transfer Destination: An unknown, unlabelled wallet address This specific Bitcoin transfer , due to its size and the institutional origin, naturally draws considerable attention. It highlights the ongoing activity within the institutional crypto space, which often operates with greater discretion than retail markets. Why Do Large Bitcoin Transfers Matter? Every major Bitcoin transfer involving ‘whale’ wallets—those holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency—can have a ripple effect. These movements are often interpreted as potential indicators of market sentiment or strategic plays by large holders. When institutions are involved, the stakes can feel even higher. Investors closely monitor such transactions because they could precede significant market events, like large-scale buying or selling, or simply represent internal operational adjustments. Understanding these transfers helps in gauging the overall health and direction of the market. While not every large transfer leads to immediate price action, consistent patterns of institutional movements can provide valuable insights into evolving market dynamics and adoption trends. Unpacking the Reasons Behind This Bitcoin Transfer When a substantial Bitcoin transfer occurs from an institutional platform to an unknown wallet, several possibilities emerge regarding the motivation. It is important to remember that without direct confirmation, these remain speculative: Internal Rebalancing: Institutions frequently move funds between hot and cold storage wallets for security or operational efficiency. This could be a shift to more secure, offline cold storage. Over-The-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large blocks of Bitcoin are often traded directly between parties via OTC desks to avoid impacting exchange order books. The unknown wallet could belong to the buyer in such a deal. Custody Changes: An institution might be moving assets to a different custodian or setting up a new custody solution. Strategic Positioning: The transfer could be preparation for a future strategic move, though its exact nature would be unknown. Therefore, while the destination is ‘unknown’ to the public, it is almost certainly known to the transferring entity, serving a specific purpose within their operational framework. What Are the Market Implications of Such a Bitcoin Transfer? The immediate market reaction to a large Bitcoin transfer is often one of speculation and heightened observation. While a single transfer rarely dictates market direction, it contributes to the overall narrative. Here’s what we often see: Increased Scrutiny: Analysts and traders intensify their monitoring of on-chain data for follow-up transactions. Sentiment Shifts: Depending on prevailing market conditions, such a move can fuel either bullish anticipation (e.g., if seen as accumulation for an OTC deal) or bearish concerns (e.g., if perceived as preparation for a large sell-off). Liquidity Considerations: Moving a significant amount of BTC off an exchange can sometimes be interpreted as reducing available supply on exchanges, which could, in theory, impact liquidity. However, it is crucial for investors to avoid knee-jerk reactions. The true impact of this transfer will only become clear with subsequent events or further transparency from the involved parties. Concluding Thoughts on This Monumental Move This recent Bitcoin transfer of 2,300 BTC from Coinbase Institutional to an unknown wallet serves as a potent reminder of the dynamic and often opaque nature of institutional cryptocurrency movements. While the exact reasons remain undisclosed, such events underscore the growing involvement of major players in the crypto space. It reinforces the importance of monitoring on-chain data as a key tool for market analysis, even as we acknowledge its limitations in revealing true intent. As the crypto market matures, these institutional flows will continue to be a focal point for understanding market trends and potential future directions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘Coinbase Institutional’ mean? A: Coinbase Institutional is Coinbase’s platform tailored for institutional investors, offering services like advanced trading, secure custody, and financing for large-scale digital asset operations. It caters to hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. Q2: Why is a Bitcoin transfer to an ‘unknown wallet’ significant? A: An ‘unknown wallet’ simply means the address is not publicly linked to a known entity (like an exchange or major fund). Its significance lies in the mystery it creates, leading to speculation about the owner’s identity and the purpose of the large transaction. Q3: Do these large transfers always affect Bitcoin’s price? A: Not always directly or immediately. While large transfers can spark speculation and influence sentiment, they don’t automatically cause price swings. The actual impact depends on whether the transferred Bitcoin is then sold, bought, or simply held, and how the broader market interprets the move. Q4: How can I track similar Bitcoin transfers? A: Services like Whale Alert provide real-time updates on significant blockchain transactions. On-chain analytics platforms also offer tools to track large movements and analyze wallet activities, helping users stay informed about market flows. Q5: Is this a sign of institutional selling or buying? A: It’s difficult to say definitively. A transfer from an institutional platform could precede either. It might be a move to an OTC desk for a sale, or it could be a consolidation of assets into cold storage after a large purchase. Without more information, it’s pure speculation.

The transaction is the Bank’s first use of a collateralized loan obligation, a structure common on Wall Street but until now, unused by the development lender. The deal targets institutional investors hungry for yield and pushes private capital into markets where businesses typically face serious financing hurdles. The bonds are backed by debt issued to 57 different companies across Asia, South America, and Eastern Europe. That’s according to Yinni Li, a credit analyst at Moody’s Ratings, who reviewed the deal. Companies involved span sectors like telecommunications, food, and beverage production. The idea is to take loan exposures from the World Bank’s book, package them into securities, and sell them off. This would supposedly free up space on the Bank’s balance sheet to issue new loans while passing credit risk to investors. Moody’s rates $320 million piece Aaa, Goldman structures the deal The largest slice of the bonds, $320 million, was rated Aaa by Moody’s, the agency’s highest rating. This portion pays an interest rate of 1.3 percentage points over a benchmark tied to market rates. Moody’s did not assess the creditworthiness of the underlying loans themselves, only the senior tranche. The Bank kept the structure standard: risk is carved into tranches, the safest at the top, and more volatile risk below. This lets cautious investors grab high-rated debt while others take bigger bets on the lower-rated layers. Goldman Sachs worked with the World Bank on the design and execution of the transaction. The World Bank hasn’t done this before, but Wall Street has. These types of deals were heavily used before the 2008 financial crisis. Back then, toxic mortgages were bundled into seemingly safe securities, many with top ratings, until the entire structure collapsed. Since that blow-up, securitization became a dirty word for a while. But in the last few years, it has come roaring back. There is now over $1.3 trillion in global CLO issuance. A growing slice of that belongs to private credit CLOs, which are gaining traction fast. Retail investors are also jumping in, with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that buy U.S. CLOs pulling in serious inflows. As of earlier this month, ETFs linked to these types of loans managed over $34 billion in assets. World Bank plans more deals to push risk into private hands This deal isn’t just a one-off trial. The World Bank is actively building out an entire emerging-market securitization platform. That was outlined in a November presentation, where it said more transactions were coming. The Bank wants to expand its lending by taking some of its old loans off its books and handing the exposure to private institutions. That’s a key step in helping it lend more without ballooning its own balance sheet. Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank, told Bloomberg last month, “It’s the first time the World Bank has done this.” He confirmed that Goldman Sachs helped structure the product. Ajay said it was just one part of a broader strategy. Other pieces include debt-for-development swaps, which are also in play as tools to scale up investment into poorer nations. It’s not like no one has done this before. Other issuers have securitized emerging-market loans, though deals remain rare. In 2023, Bayfront Infrastructure Capital, based in Singapore, issued a $410 million CLO backed by revenues from project loans and bonds. That deal covered regions including the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, the Americas, and Africa. Like the World Bank’s deal, it relied on turning illiquid debt tied to infrastructure and development into investable products for global markets.

The panel left the levies in place until October 14 so the administration can seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Soon after the decision, Trump said in a Truthsocial post that the tariffs remain in place and vowed to keep them despite the ruling. He argued the appeals court was wrong and predicted the Supreme Court would ultimately side with his administration. He warned that ending the tariffs would hurt the U.S. economy, saying they are needed to counter large trade deficits and what he calls unfair foreign tariffs and non-tariff barriers. He said the measures protect American manufacturers, farmers, and other workers. Tariffs have been central to Trump’s foreign policy in his second term. He has used them to press trading partners and to seek new terms on goods sold into the United States. The steps have given Washington leverage for economic concessions, while also adding to market swings. Court says emergency law does not include tariff powers In its opinion, the court said the emergency statute the administration relied on does not grant taxing power . “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,” the court wrote as per Reuters . The case was decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. The panel reviewed the legality of what Trump has called “reciprocal” tariffs announced in April as part of his trade fight, as well as a separate round from February aimed at China, Canada and Mexico. The ruling does not touch measures issued under other laws, including the administration’s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Trump defended both rounds, and newer ones, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows a president to address “unusual and extraordinary” threats during national emergencies. The judges concluded that Congress did not grant tariff authority when it passed that law. “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,” the opinion said. “The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President’s power to impose tariffs.” Passed in 1977, the law has been used to impose sanctions or freeze assets, not to set border taxes. Trump is the first president to invoke IEEPA for tariffs, saying the steps were needed because of trade imbalances, reduced U.S. industrial strength and the flow of drugs across borders. Justice Department argued emergency powers allow trade restrictions The Justice Department argued in court that IEEPA’s emergency powers include the ability to “regulate” imports or stop them entirely, which in its view permits the use of duties. Trump declared a national emergency in April, citing decades of trade deficits and arguing that continued shortfalls weaken U.S. manufacturing and military readiness. He said the February tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico were justified because those governments were not doing enough to curb illegal fentanyl reaching the United States, a claim the three countries have rejected. The appeals court ruled on two cases at once. One filed by five small U.S. firms and another from 12 Democratic-led states. Both challenged the use of IEEPA for tariffs. They said the Constitution assigns Congress, not the president, the power to levy taxes and tariffs, and that any handoff of that power must be clear and limited. Another federal court in Washington has also concluded that IEEPA does not authorize Trump’s tariffs, and the government has appealed that decision. In all, at least eight lawsuits have been filed against the administration’s tariff program, including one brought by the state of California. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Such large-scale movements often signal potential shifts in market dynamics, making this particular Bitcoin transfer a focal point for anyone watching the crypto space. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Transfer Signify? The core of this news revolves around the impressive volume: 2,300 BTC. To put this into perspective, this is a considerable amount of Bitcoin, representing a significant portion of the total circulating supply. The fact that it originated from Coinbase Institutional, a platform designed for large-scale institutional investors, adds another layer of intrigue. Institutional players typically manage vast sums, and their actions can have ripple effects across the market. Therefore, any major Bitcoin transfer from such an entity is closely scrutinized. This particular transaction involves: Origin: Coinbase Institutional, a trusted custodian for major investors. Destination: An unknown wallet, meaning the recipient’s identity is not publicly linked to an exchange or known entity. Value: Approximately $249 million at the time of the transfer, highlighting its financial weight. Why Are Institutional BTC Transfers So Closely Watched? When institutional entities engage in a large Bitcoin transfer , it often provides insights into their strategies and market sentiment. These aren’t small retail trades; they are carefully calculated moves. Here’s why such transfers matter: Market Sentiment Indicator: A move from an institutional custodian could indicate a potential sale (if moving to an exchange) or long-term holding (if moving to a private, cold storage wallet). Liquidity Impact: A sudden influx or outflow of such a large amount can temporarily affect market liquidity and price. Security Considerations: Institutions prioritize security. Moving funds to an unknown wallet could mean enhanced self-custody or preparation for an over-the-counter (OTC) trade, which bypasses public exchanges. Regulatory Compliance: Institutional actions are often bound by stricter regulatory frameworks, making their moves more deliberate and impactful. Understanding these motivations helps us interpret the broader implications of a significant Bitcoin transfer . Who Could Be Behind This Significant BTC Transfer? The mystery of the “unknown wallet” is perhaps the most captivating aspect of this Bitcoin transfer . While we cannot pinpoint the exact identity, several possibilities exist: Institutional Rebalancing: The institution might be rebalancing its portfolio, moving funds to a different custody solution, or preparing for a new investment strategy. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: Large transactions often occur via OTC desks to avoid market disruption. The BTC might be moving to a buyer’s wallet directly after an OTC sale. Large Individual Investor (Whale): While from Coinbase Institutional, the ultimate beneficiary could be a high-net-worth individual who uses institutional services for their large holdings. Exchange Internal Movement: Less likely given “unknown wallet” but sometimes exchanges move funds between their own cold storage addresses for operational reasons. The anonymity of blockchain transactions, while a core feature, also fuels speculation in cases like this. What are the Potential Market Impacts of Such a Bitcoin Transfer? A Bitcoin transfer of this magnitude inevitably leads to market speculation. While it’s crucial not to jump to conclusions, here are some potential impacts: Short-term Volatility: The news itself can create uncertainty, leading to minor price fluctuations as traders react. Long-term Holding Signal: If the funds are moving to a cold storage address, it could signal a bullish long-term outlook from the institution, indicating they intend to hold rather relevant keyword e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.}} {{insert future oriented activity e.g. price action, institutional adoption, etc.}}.than sell. Selling Pressure Concern: Conversely, if the funds are eventually moved to an exchange, it could suggest an impending sale, potentially creating selling pressure. However, this particular transfer is to an unknown wallet, not directly to an exchange. Increased Scrutiny: Such events draw more attention to Bitcoin’s institutional adoption and the movements of major players. For investors, the key takeaway is to monitor follow-up movements and broader market trends rather than reacting impulsively to a single large transaction. This recent Bitcoin transfer from Coinbase Institutional highlights the dynamic and often mysterious nature of large-scale cryptocurrency movements. While the immediate implications remain speculative, it underscores the growing influence of institutional players in the crypto market. Keeping an eye on these “whale” movements offers a glimpse into potential future trends and investor sentiment, reminding us that every major transaction tells a part of the evolving crypto story. Frequently Asked Questions About BTC Transfers What is Coinbase Institutional? Coinbase Institutional is a suite of services offered by Coinbase designed for large institutional clients, including asset managers, hedge funds, and corporations, providing advanced trading tools, custody solutions, and prime brokerage services for cryptocurrencies. What does “unknown wallet” mean in a crypto transaction? “Unknown wallet” typically refers to a cryptocurrency address that is not publicly associated with a known entity like an exchange, a specific company, or a prominent individual. It could be a private cold storage wallet, an address for an OTC trade, or simply an unlabelled address. Why do large Bitcoin transfers generate so much interest? Large Bitcoin transfers , often called “whale movements,” are closely watched because they can signal significant market events. These could include institutional buying or selling, rebalancing of large portfolios, or preparations for major over-the-counter trades, all of which can influence market sentiment and price action. Does this Bitcoin transfer necessarily mean a sale is imminent? Not necessarily. While moving funds to an exchange often precedes a sale, moving them to an unknown wallet could mean various things: enhanced self-custody, preparation for an OTC deal, or simply an internal transfer for strategic reasons. Without further information, it’s speculative to assume an immediate sale. Did you find this analysis of the recent massive Bitcoin transfer insightful?

The figure, while slightly down 5.3% from the prior quarter, represents a 1.9% increase year-over-year, supported by growing management fees, improved treasury performance, and strong momentum in physically backed products. The company attributed the results to a surge in digital asset prices and rising institutional inflows. Bitcoin and Ethereum advanced by 29% and 37% during the quarter, pushing CoinShares’ assets under management (AUM) to $3.5 billion, a 26% increase from the previous quarter. This growth came despite continued outflows from its legacy derivatives-based products, highlighting shifting investor preference toward physically backed exchange-traded products (ETPs). Financial Performance and Market Drivers According to the company’s Q2 earnings report , asset management fees generated $30 million, compared with $28.3 million in the same period last year. Capital markets income came in at $11.3 million, slightly below the $14.6 million posted in Q2 2024, while adjusted EBITDA reached $26.3 million. Basic earnings per share stood at $0.49, marginally above the $0.47 a year earlier. CoinShares’ spot crypto ETPs attracted $170 million in net inflows, the second-highest on record, driving much of the growth in AUM. These inflows were boosted by the integration of Valkyrie ETFs into the CoinShares brand after last year’s acquisition. In addition, the firm’s proprietary BLOCK Index rose 53.7%, outperforming leading equity benchmarks , reflecting broader strength across digital asset markets. Within its capital markets division, Ethereum staking contributed $4.3 million, while delta-neutral trading strategies and lending added $2.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Liquidity provisioning generated $1.5 million, a slight dip compared with earlier quarters. The company’s treasury also swung back into positive territory, with $7.8 million in unrealized gains, compared with a $3 million loss in Q1 and a $0.4 million loss in the same period last year. Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marie Mognetti noted that the quarter demonstrated resilience across all business units: “We saw a significant recovery in digital asset pricing . While average prices across Q1 and Q2 were relatively similar, we closed H1 2025 with strong AUM and a favorable outlook.” Strategic Expansion and US Listing Plans Looking ahead, CoinShares is positioning itself for further growth , with plans to pursue a US stock exchange listing. The company is currently listed on Nasdaq Stockholm but sees the US as a market offering greater liquidity, higher valuations, and stronger investor appetite for digital asset firms. “The move from Sweden to the US will unlock substantial value for shareholders by entering a market with significant breadth and depth,” Mognetti said, pointing to recent listings by Circle and Bullish, which experienced strong demand and immediate share price gains. The company also highlighted a supportive policy environment in the US, citing recent legislative progress and an administration signaling openness to crypto innovation . Mognetti said clarity on the timing of the listing should be available within this quarter, with the firm aiming to capitalize on current momentum in both digital asset markets and regulatory developments.

50884583,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=812577,1756508411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50884583.jpeg,TRON Faces Key Resistance With Potential Breakout Target at $0.50,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/tron-trx/tron-faces-key-resistance-with-potential-breakout-target-at-0-50/,"TRON (TRX) has been experiencing muted performance in recent weeks, trading at $0.3389 at the time of writing. This represents a 21.4% decline from its all-time high of $0.4313, recorded late last year. Despite relatively stable price levels in recent days, the lack of upward momentum suggests investors might be carefully watching for a catalyst that could determine the token’s next major move. Amid this market setting, analysts are closely tracking TRON’s on-chain data. One key observation comes from CryptoQuant contributor CryptoOnchain, who examined network activity and resistance levels. According to the analyst, TRX is currently testing its historical resistance zone, a level that could prove decisive in whether the asset pushes toward higher targets or risks another setback. Related Reading: Extreme Greed Grips TRON: Could a Market Pullback Be Next? TRON Network Activity and Potential Breakout CryptoOnchain noted that TRON’s network activity is at record levels, with daily active addresses (DAA) surpassing 2.6 million, the highest figure in its history. This surge in user activity reflects strong underlying demand for the network, even while TRX’s price has struggled to break higher. Historically, such growth in addresses has acted as a fundamental driver for price strength, signaling that demand for TRON’s blockchain services remains resilient. The analyst highlighted that TRX sits just below its historical resistance. If the token were to close above its all-time high and sustain that level, the breakout target could range between $0.48 and $0.52, aligning with TRON’s On-Chain Value Bands metric. However, CryptoOnchain cautioned that this scenario depends heavily on TRON maintaining its active address momentum. A decline in DAA could undermine the bullish setup, exposing TRX to downside risk. The outlook also ties into broader market conditions. The CryptoQuant analyst believes that a potential altseason, a period of significant gains across altcoins, could provide the momentum needed for TRX to achieve a breakout. In this context, continued high network demand and user activity would support further price appreciation. Whale Activity and Stablecoin Dynamics In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha examined stablecoin flows on the TRON network, particularly the activity of large wallets. Data showed that in the past 24 hours, wallets holding over $100 million in USDT dominated TRON’s transaction volume, coinciding with Bitcoin regaining momentum above the $110,000 level. This concentration of large transfers is significant because it often precedes shifts in broader crypto market sentiment. A notable example occurred on August 12, when $100M+ wallets moved approximately $3.9 billion in USDT across the TRON network. That wave of transfers directly coincided with a 5% rally in Bitcoin, highlighting the role of stablecoin liquidity in driving market cycles. Related Reading: TRON Spot Market Signals Relief – Seller Dominance Weakens After Cycle High Taha added that the distribution of daily USDT wallet changes reinforces this trend. Wallets with balances above $100M accounted for nearly 35–36% of total daily activity, a level nearly identical to August’s inflows. Such concentrated whale activity suggests that stablecoin flows on TRON remain a leading indicator for market positioning and potential capital rotations into risk assets like TRX and Bitcoin.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) price drop has raised doubts about its long-term sustainability, as a 95% plunge in burn rate undermines one of its strongest supply-side arguments. In contrast, Pi Network (PI) technical analysis shows a token at a crossroads: a triple-bottom near $0.33 hints at potential reversal, yet broader adoption and liquidity remain limited until exchange access expands. Then comes a project rewriting presale history, BlockDAG . With $386M raised, 25.8 billion coins sold at $0.03 in Batch 30, and over 200,000 holders already onboard, BlockDAG represents not just speculative momentum but structural strength. Weighing the best crypto to buy, the divergence is clear: one project falters, one hesitates, and one accelerates toward dominance. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Collapses as Price Faces Pressure Shiba Inu’s burn mechanism has taken a sharp downturn, sparking concern among traders. Data shows that only 9.43 million SHIB tokens were burned this past week, a steep 95% decline from previous levels. Daily burns also plunged by 95%, with fewer than 170,000 SHIB removed in 24 hours. This slowdown is troubling because token burns are central to Shiba Inu’s supply control strategy. A weaker burn rate means fewer tokens leave circulation, potentially limiting long-term value growth. Despite the setback, SHIB managed a modest 3.25% recovery in price, bouncing after a weekend drop of over 12%. The coin now trades near $0.00001210, but slipped slightly after the rebound. Pi Network at a Crossroads: $0.33 Support Could Decide Its Fate? Pi Network is testing a crucial $0.33 support level, with a triple-bottom pattern hinting at a possible reversal. Holding this floor could spark a move toward $0.50-$0.85, but losing it risks a fall below $0.30. The token remains in consolidation, yet activity within its ecosystem shows resilience. A recent hackathon attracted 2,100 developers, and institutional confidence has grown with Ulu Ventures backing the project. Attention now turns to September’s Stellar Protocol 23 upgrade, expected to deliver faster transactions and smart contract support. While this improves fundamentals, analysts note real price momentum will require stronger demand and broader listings. BlockDAG’s 200,000 Holder Milestone Sparks FOMO Ahead of Launch BlockDAG has crossed a major milestone with over 200,000 holders secured even before launch, setting a new benchmark in community-driven presales. This early density of participation is more than numbers; it’s evidence of strong conviction. With Batch 30 priced at $0.03, the presale has already raised more than $386 million and sold 25.8 billion coins, making it one of the largest pre-mainnet fundraises in years. The strength of this community isn’t just in holding tokens. Adoption is reinforced by over 19,000 miners sold and more than 3 million users on the X1 mining app, creating a blend of retail activity and infrastructure support that most projects struggle to achieve post-launch. This means BlockDAG will enter public markets with built-in liquidity, governance readiness, and user activity already in place. The implication is clear: this scale of commitment positions BlockDAG among the most prepared projects in the sector, combining deep funding, active adoption, and broad retail participation. Analysts speculate that if momentum continues, the $1 price target could be a realistic post-launch scenario, underpinned by one of the strongest pre-launch ecosystems in recent years. Why BlockDAG, Not SHIB or Pi, Holds the Real 2025 Advantage Markets reward scale, participation, and resilience. Shiba Inu may remain a community favorite, but the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price drop exposes weaknesses in its burn-driven model. Pi Network, despite its technical analysis at $0.33, carries promise yet lacks the market depth to guarantee sustained upward movement. However, BlockDAG, with 3M+ X1 app users, 19,000 miners sold, and over 200,000 holders, has achieved before launch what many Layer-1s struggle to secure years later. Analysts suggest a realistic path to $1 post-listing, translating into over 30x ROI for Batch 30 buyers. BlockDAG embodies the infrastructure, liquidity, and confidence needed to enter the top crypto tier of 2025.

In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $48 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $8.52 Market cap $179.09M 24-hour trading volume $63.48M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2023 24-hour high $9.13 24-hour low $8.34 ORDI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 5.97% 50-day SMA $9.84 200-day SMA $16.13 Sentiment Bearish Green days 14/30 (47%) ORDI price analysis: ORDI drops below $10 On the day of writing (August 29), ORDI’s price dropped by 4.54% in 24 hours and 10.44% in the last thirty days. Its trading volume, however, rose by 24.35% showing more trader conviction in the price trend. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades below the Williams alligator trendlines, signaling a bearish market. The coin has registered negative momentum over the last five days. The MACD and signal lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, signaling a bearish market. At the same time, the relative strength index is in neutral territory at 44.10. It is oversold when the RSI drops below 30. ORDI’s 24-hour drop is likely driven by Bitcoin’s correction. BTC’s ability to hold $105k support – a break below could trigger cascading liquidations in high-beta alts like ORDI. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI is moving downwards at the $9 mark, with neutral RSI (38.79) and MACD confirmation. ORDI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 7.98 BUY SMA 5 8.55 SELL SMA 10 9.16 SELL SMA 21 9.54 SELL SMA 50 9.84 SELL SMA 100 9.40 SELL SMA 200 16.13 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 9.28 SELL EMA 5 9.26 SELL EMA 10 9.00 SELL EMA 21 8.74 SEL EMA 50 9.69 SELL EMA 100 13.47 SELL EMA 200 20.18 SELL What to expect from ORDI price analysis next? ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. Over the short term, ORDI remains correlated with Bitcoin, which is just below $110,000. The charts show it will continue downwards. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Why is ORDI up? ORDI is in a bull run this month. The rise in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market’s sentiment. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10.",Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|ORDI|ZRX|BTC|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-29 23:05:00

Are you watching the cryptocurrency markets for the next big move? Many eyes are on Solana (SOL), with a prominent analyst predicting a substantial Solana (SOL) rally . This forecast is sparking excitement across the crypto community, suggesting SOL could be on the brink of a major upward trend. What’s Fueling the Anticipated Solana (SOL) Rally? An influential, anonymous analyst known as Bluntz, boasting over 327,000 followers on X, has shared a compelling prediction for Solana. As reported by The Daily Hodl, Bluntz anticipates a significant Solana (SOL) rally once its current consolidation phase concludes. This isn’t just a hopeful guess; it’s based on technical chart analysis that often provides valuable insights into market movements. Bluntz points to Solana’s price action over the past 36 days, noting it has been trading within a defined range. During this period, a specific chart pattern has emerged: the ascending triangle. This pattern is widely recognized in technical analysis as a bullish indicator, often preceding an upward price breakout. It suggests that buyers are steadily pushing the price higher, despite temporary resistance levels. Understanding the Bullish Ascending Triangle for SOL For those new to technical analysis, an ascending triangle forms when there’s a flat upper resistance line and a rising lower trendline connecting higher lows. This pattern indicates that while the asset faces resistance at a certain price point, buying pressure is consistently increasing, preventing the price from dropping to previous lows. Eventually, this mounting pressure often leads to a decisive break above the resistance, triggering a significant upward move — precisely what’s expected for a potential Solana (SOL) rally . Bluntz’s analysis isn’t without historical context. The analyst drew a fascinating parallel to a previous period where Solana traded in a range for an extended 166 days. Following that prolonged consolidation, SOL experienced a remarkable surge, significantly outperforming Bitcoin. This historical precedent adds weight to the current prediction, suggesting that history might be poised to repeat itself for Solana. Historical Precedent: A Glimpse into Solana’s Potential The comparison to Solana’s past performance is crucial. When an asset consolidates for an extended period, it often builds up energy for a powerful move. The longer the consolidation, the more significant the eventual breakout can be. Bluntz’s observation highlights this, implying that the current 36-day consolidation, while shorter than the previous 166-day stretch, could still be setting the stage for a substantial Solana (SOL) rally . Investors often look for such patterns to time their entries and exits, aiming to capitalize on anticipated price swings. What does this mean for the average investor or enthusiast? It suggests a period of potential volatility but also significant opportunity. Monitoring the breakout point of this ascending triangle will be key. A confirmed breakout, typically accompanied by increased trading volume, would be a strong signal that the predicted Solana (SOL) rally is underway. However, it’s always important to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results, and market conditions can change rapidly. Key Takeaways for Solana Investors Eyeing a Rally If you’re considering Solana, here are some points to keep in mind: Bullish Pattern: The ascending triangle is a strong technical indicator for a potential upward move. Analyst Insight: Bluntz’s prediction, backed by a significant following and historical context, adds credibility. Historical Parallel: Solana has previously seen massive gains after extended consolidation periods. Monitoring is Key: Watch for a confirmed breakout above the triangle’s resistance line, ideally with high volume, to signal the start of the Solana (SOL) rally . While the prospect of a major Solana (SOL) rally is exciting, remember to conduct your own research and consider market risks. Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and predictions are not guarantees. However, for those tracking SOL, this technical setup offers a compelling narrative for potential growth. Summary: The crypto community is buzzing about a potential Solana (SOL) rally , driven by an analyst’s observation of a bullish ascending triangle pattern. Drawing parallels to past performance where SOL significantly outperformed Bitcoin after a consolidation phase, the current setup suggests a strong upward breakout could be imminent. While technical analysis provides valuable clues, vigilance and personal research remain paramount in navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency investments. Frequently Asked Questions About the Solana (SOL) Rally Q1: What is an ascending triangle pattern in crypto? An ascending triangle is a bullish chart pattern characterized by a flat resistance line and a rising support line, indicating increasing buying pressure and often preceding an upward price breakout. Q2: Who is Bluntz, the analyst mentioned? Bluntz is an anonymous but highly followed crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) with over 327,000 followers, known for technical analysis predictions based on chart patterns. Q3: What makes Solana (SOL) attractive for a rally? Solana’s current formation of a bullish ascending triangle pattern, combined with historical precedents of significant rallies after consolidation phases, makes it attractive for a potential upward move. Q4: How reliable are technical analysis predictions like this? Technical analysis provides valuable insights and probabilities based on historical price action. While not guarantees, patterns like the ascending triangle are widely respected, but market conditions can always shift rapidly. Q5: What should investors do if a Solana (SOL) rally occurs?

Ethereum is now above $4,600, after a recent dip. Analysts are saying the recent surge of inflows into ETFs may be hinting at future altcoin and presale rallies. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the presale that benefits the most from Ethereum’s momentum. Ethereum: ETF Inflows Signal Strong Institutional Confidence Ethereum is currently priced around $4,602, representing a 5% increase in the last 24 hours and a 71% increase in 1-year. The price of ETH had fallen to the low of $4,413 before it bounced back. The main engine behind the demand appears to be institutional, as U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs witnessed net inflows of almost $444 million during the previous trading session—almost twice as much the inflows into Bitcoin ETFs over that time. Fidelity’s (FETH) offering added $129 million, demonstrating strong competitive spirit from issuers. In fact, Strong inflows were noted to BlackRock’s ETHA, which topped the pecking order with over $314 million in inflows. The total assets under management for Ethereum ETFs have increased to almost $13 billion since launch. This shows that institutions are not just sitting on their hands but rather buying the dip. This difference between money flowing into the ETF and the spot prices becoming volatile shows a long-term faith in Ethereum’s fundamentals, say analysts. Why Presales Are Attracting Smart Money Since Ethereum and Bitcoin are now firmly upper class, attention has broadly shifted to lower cap altcoins and pre-sales as investors seek the exponential returns that are no longer possible from either of the two majors. The 14,000% return on investment in Ethereum is what presales can achieve. This cycle, analysts believe, new projects that combine transparency, audits, and scarcity could again take many projects to similar heights. Most presales below $0.01 are particularly fascinating as you have two-thirds of the market. Whales and retail traders can position themselves early on before the valuation increases on exchanges. August’s rise in Bankman-Fried’s token search and whale-backed inflows indicates that smart money is already seeking out the most credible opportunities in this category. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The “Next Big Thing” Under $0.01 Analysts are saying that MAGACOIN FINANCE is the ‘Next Big Thing,’ as Ethereum-ETF hype is generating new excitement over presale trading under $0.01. Security and transparency are driving investor interest in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With a completed audit by Hashex and strong team disclosures, it’s positioned to be one of the top crypto presales of the year — not just in hype, but in real fundamentals. Experts believe whales have begun to accumulate their positions, while the rapid increase in Google search interest suggests growing awareness in the broader market. Investors are buying in now ahead of presale allocations as demand prompts prices to rally higher. With a potential ROI of up to 65x, people are reaping significant benefits, with thousands of KYC-verified investors on board. Due to its limited supply, time is running out quickly to buy one of the best cryptos for 2025. Conclusion Ethereum’s price boom following the ETF approval shows that institutional money is here to stay, say analysts, but they expect the next chapter to be a presale bonanza. With its double audits, transparent team, whale demand, and sub-$0.01 entry point, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being branded as the ‘next big thing’ under $0.01. Analysts warn that early allocations may not last long.

The move comes as the court weighs whether Trump had the constitutional authority to dismiss her earlier this week. The case is unprecedented. No U.S. president has ever attempted to remove a sitting member of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. Its outcome could reshape the balance of power between the presidency and the central bank, which was designed to operate independently of political influence. Arguments were heard on Friday by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington. She heard from lawyers for Trump and for Cook during a hearing that stretched to nearly two hours. Cobb requested further filings from both sides by Tuesday. The judge did not immediately rule. Instead, she said she would make up her mind before the Fed’s next policy meeting, on Sept. 17. The meeting is key partly because if she were to be reinstated, Cook would vote on interest rates as one of 12 Federal Open Market Committee members. Trump’s legal team described Cook’s claim as “meritless” and unlikely to succeed, arguing that the president had the authority to fire her “for cause” and that the evidence supporting his action was strong. Cook’s attorneys argued that her due process rights had been violated. They noted that she never had an opportunity to defend herself against the charges and warned that upholding Trump’s action would undermine the Fed’s independence. Trump uses mortgage allegations to justify firing The firing came after accusations from Bill Pulte , a Trump supporter and head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that Cook lied on mortgage applications. He accused her of describing two properties as her “principal residence” in 2021, which entitles someone to better terms on a loan. This week, Pulte added a new allegation, claiming Cook had also labeled a third property as her second home. He referred all three claims to the Justice Department, though Cook has not been charged with any crime. Trump pounced on Pulte’s claims in a letter he posted to Truth Social, stating that Cook had been fired “for cause.” In practice, the term is reserved for the most serious cases of malfeasance and has never before been adjudicated by a court as it applies to a Fed governor. Cook has rejected the allegations. She said she has “no wish to be bullied” out of her job, and in the week since the complaints were reported, she has sought to deliver correct details about her financial history. Trump tests central bank independence Now the case is shining a light on the independence of the Federal Reserve. For more than 100 years, presidents have refrained from direct intervention in the makeup of the Fed’s board. Trump’s decision to fire Cook violates that tradition. Judge Cobb also expressed skepticism at elements of both sides’ arguments. She pressed Trump’s lawyers about what the president — and the president alone — can determine as “cause.” She also raised concerns about whether Cook had been adequately notified before her dismissal. If Cobb ruled against Trump, Cook would surely get her seat back, at least for now. If she favors the president, Cook would remain removed, and the case could move toward a full trial or possibly the Supreme Court. The ruling is of enormous significance for financial markets. The Fed has held interest rates steady at 4.25–4.5 percent this year despite pressure from Trump to reduce them. The president has also repeatedly lashed out at Jerome Powell, who chairs the Fed, calling him a “numbskull” for not cutting the cost of borrowing. As the legal fight continues, Cook is kept out of her office. Her future, and the power balance between the White House and the Federal Reserve, will rest on Judge Cobb’s ruling, expected in the next few days. Get seen where it counts.

Recent movements show ETH has dipped below a critical support trendline, a development closely watched by analysts and investors alike. This break suggests a potentially challenging period ahead for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. What Does the Trendline Break Mean for Ethereum Price? Ethereum (ETH) recently fell below the $4,300 mark, breaching a key support trendline that Fundstrat founder Tom Lee had previously identified. This specific trendline acted as a crucial psychological and technical barrier. Its failure indicates a shift in market sentiment, moving from bullish to a more cautious or even bearish outlook. According to Cointelegraph’s analysis, the immediate next significant support level for the Ethereum price is now seen at $4,180. Traders and investors are closely monitoring this point, as its ability to hold will be vital in determining ETH’s short-term direction. Understanding the Bearish Signals for ETH Several factors contribute to this current bearish outlook for the Ethereum price . Cointelegraph’s report highlights a confluence of signals: Historical Weakness: Ethereum has a history of showing price weakness during the month of September. While past performance does not guarantee future results, this pattern often influences market psychology. Declining Open Interest: There has been a continuous decline in open interest, which represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts (like futures or options) that have not been settled. A decrease often signals that money is flowing out of the market, reducing liquidity and speculative activity. Negative Funding Rates: Funding rates in the perpetual futures market have turned negative. This suggests that traders holding short positions (betting on a price drop) are paying those holding long positions (betting on a price rise). It indicates a dominance of bearish sentiment and a willingness to pay to maintain short positions. These combined indicators paint a picture of increased selling pressure and reduced confidence among derivatives traders. Where Could Ethereum Price Go Next? Navigating Key Support Levels While $4,180 is the immediate support level, the broader context suggests that a decisive rebound might not be straightforward. The current decline follows a prolonged bull market, making a quick recovery less likely. Market corrections after extended upward trends can often be deep and take time to resolve. Cointelegraph warns that if the $4,180 support level fails to hold, traders should prepare for a potential drop to $3,100. This level would represent a more significant retracement and could test the conviction of many investors. Monitoring these key levels is essential for anyone involved in the Ethereum market. Actionable Insights for Navigating Volatility Given the current market dynamics, what steps can investors and traders take? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Key Levels: Keep a close eye on $4,180 and $3,100. These are critical junctures that could dictate future price action. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies. This includes setting stop-losses for trades and only investing capital you can afford to lose. Dollar-Cost Averaging: For long-term investors, consider dollar-cost averaging. This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the Ethereum price , which can help mitigate risk during volatile periods. Stay Informed: Continue to follow reputable news sources and expert analyses to understand market sentiment and potential catalysts for change. Understanding these market signals allows you to make more informed decisions rather than reacting purely on emotion. Summary: A Critical Juncture for Ethereum The recent break below Tom Lee’s trendline marks a significant moment for the Ethereum price . With key support levels at $4,180 and potentially $3,100 in focus, the market is signaling a period of caution. The combination of historical patterns, declining open interest, and negative funding rates suggests that bears currently hold the upper hand. While volatility is a constant in the crypto world, staying informed and adopting a strategic approach will be paramount for navigating these challenging waters. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Tom Lee trendline for Ethereum? The Tom Lee trendline refers to a significant support level identified by Fundstrat’s Tom Lee. Breaking below this line typically signals a bearish shift in market sentiment and potential further price declines for Ethereum. Why is the Ethereum price currently falling? The current decline in Ethereum’s price is attributed to several factors, including historical September weakness, a continuous drop in open interest, and negative funding rates in the perpetual futures market, all indicating a bearish sentiment. What are the key support levels to watch for ETH? The immediate key support level to watch for ETH is $4,180. If this level does not hold, the next significant support is anticipated around $3,100. What do negative funding rates mean for Ethereum? Negative funding rates in the perpetual futures market mean that traders holding short positions (betting on a price decrease) are paying traders holding long positions. This indicates a dominant bearish sentiment in the market. Should I sell my ETH now that the price is falling? Investment decisions depend on individual financial goals and risk tolerance. It’s crucial to conduct your own research, consider professional financial advice, and implement risk management strategies rather than making impulsive decisions based on short-term price movements. Is a quick rebound for Ethereum likely after this drop? Analysts suggest that a decisive rebound is unlikely in the short term, especially since the current decline follows a prolonged bull market. Corrections after extended upward trends can often be deeper and require more time to recover. Did you find this analysis helpful?

A significant development recently emerged from a U.S. appeals court regarding the legality of Trump administration tariffs . This ruling, while not directly about digital assets, highlights the interconnectedness of global economics and policy, which often influences investor sentiment and, by extension, the crypto market. What’s the Verdict? A Crucial Decision on Trump Administration Tariffs A U.S. appeals court has delivered a pivotal decision, ruling that most of the Trump administration tariffs imposed during the previous presidential term are, in fact, illegal. This news, initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, marks a substantial legal challenge to the trade policies of that era. However, it is important to note a key detail: the court also stated that these tariffs may remain in place for the time being. This allows for further litigation to proceed, meaning the immediate impact on goods and prices is not an abrupt change, but rather a prolonged process. Understanding the Legal Battle: Why Were These Tariffs Challenged? The tariffs in question were primarily imposed on goods from various countries, most notably China, under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The Trump administration argued these tariffs were necessary to address unfair trade practices. The legal challenge centered on whether the administration exceeded its authority in imposing these tariffs, particularly regarding the scope and justification for their continuation and expansion. The appeals court’s ruling suggests a finding that the executive branch overstepped its statutory powers in the implementation of a significant portion of these Trump administration tariffs . What Does This Mean for Businesses and the Economy? This ruling introduces a layer of uncertainty and potential change for businesses that have been operating under the weight of these tariffs for years. Here are some key implications: Potential Relief for Importers: If the ruling stands and tariffs are eventually removed, importers could see reduced costs for affected goods. Consumer Impact: Lower import costs could, in theory, translate to lower prices for consumers, boosting purchasing power. Trade Policy Scrutiny: The decision puts future presidential administrations on notice regarding the limits of their authority in imposing trade barriers. Market Reaction: While not immediate, the long-term prospect of tariff adjustments can influence investor confidence and supply chain strategies. This legal challenge to the Trump administration tariffs underscores the intricate balance between executive power and legislative oversight in trade matters. The Road Ahead: Will Trump Administration Tariffs Be Lifted? The court’s decision that the tariffs may remain in place while litigation proceeds means the saga is far from over. This ongoing legal battle could involve: Appeals: The government could appeal this decision to a higher court, potentially even the Supreme Court. Remand to Lower Courts: The case might be sent back to a lower court for further proceedings consistent with the appeals court’s findings. Negotiations: The current administration might also use this ruling as leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. Therefore, while the ruling is a significant legal blow, the actual removal or modification of these Trump administration tariffs is not guaranteed to happen quickly and will depend on the subsequent legal and political developments. The Broader Impact on Global Markets and Crypto Major economic news, such as this ruling on Trump administration tariffs , often affects investor sentiment across all asset classes. Here’s how it connects to the crypto world: Macroeconomic Sensitivity: The crypto market, particularly Bitcoin, is increasingly sensitive to macroeconomic indicators and global trade relations. Positive or negative shifts in the global economic outlook can influence investor risk appetite. Inflation and Supply Chains: Tariffs can contribute to inflation by increasing import costs. A potential reduction or removal of these tariffs could ease inflationary pressures, which might be seen as a positive for assets like Bitcoin, often viewed as a hedge against traditional economic instability. Investor Confidence: A clearer, more predictable global trade environment can foster greater investor confidence, potentially encouraging broader investment across various markets, including digital assets. While the link is indirect, a healthier global economy and stable trade relations generally create a more favorable environment for all investments, including cryptocurrencies. This crucial appeals court ruling on Trump administration tariffs highlights the ongoing complexities of international trade policy. While the tariffs remain in place for now, the legal precedent set could have far-reaching implications for future trade strategies and the broader economic landscape. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, understanding these macro-level shifts is vital, as they often shape the underlying currents of market sentiment and investment flows. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly did the appeals court rule regarding Trump administration tariffs? The U.S. appeals court ruled that most of the Trump administration tariffs were illegal, finding that the administration exceeded its legal authority in their implementation. Why were these tariffs considered illegal? The ruling suggests that the legal basis for imposing and continuing these specific tariffs under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 was not sufficiently met or that the executive branch overstepped its statutory powers. Will the tariffs be removed immediately? No, the court stated that the tariffs may remain in place for the time being while further litigation proceeds. This means the process for their potential removal or modification will likely be lengthy. How might this ruling impact the US economy? If the ruling ultimately leads to the removal of these tariffs, it could potentially lower import costs for businesses, ease inflationary pressures, and result in lower prices for consumers, influencing overall economic activity. Could this ruling affect future trade policy? Absolutely. This decision sets a precedent that could limit the scope of executive power in imposing tariffs under Section 301, influencing how future administrations approach trade disputes and implement trade policies. Is there any direct impact on the cryptocurrency market? While there’s no direct impact, macroeconomic shifts resulting from trade policy changes, such as reduced inflation or increased global economic stability, can indirectly influence investor sentiment and risk appetite, which in turn can affect the cryptocurrency market.

Ethereum is now above $4,600, after a recent dip. Analysts are saying the recent surge of inflows into ETFs may be hinting at future altcoin and presale rallies. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the presale that benefits the most from Ethereum’s momentum. Ethereum: ETF Inflows Signal Strong Institutional Confidence Ethereum is currently priced around $4,602, representing a 5% increase in the last 24 hours and a 71% increase in 1-year. The price of ETH had fallen to the low of $4,413 before it bounced back. The main engine behind the demand appears to be institutional, as U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs witnessed net inflows of almost $444 million during the previous trading session—almost twice as much the inflows into Bitcoin ETFs over that time. Fidelity’s (FETH) offering added $129 million, demonstrating strong competitive spirit from issuers. In fact, Strong inflows were noted to BlackRock’s ETHA, which topped the pecking order with over $314 million in inflows. The total assets under management for Ethereum ETFs have increased to almost $13 billion since launch. This shows that institutions are not just sitting on their hands but rather buying the dip. This difference between money flowing into the ETF and the spot prices becoming volatile shows a long-term faith in Ethereum’s fundamentals, say analysts. Why Presales Are Attracting Smart Money Since Ethereum and Bitcoin are now firmly upper class, attention has broadly shifted to lower cap altcoins and pre-sales as investors seek the exponential returns that are no longer possible from either of the two majors. The 14,000% return on investment in Ethereum is what presales can achieve. This cycle, analysts believe, new projects that combine transparency, audits, and scarcity could again take many projects to similar heights. Most presales below $0.01 are particularly fascinating as you have two-thirds of the market. Whales and retail traders can position themselves early on before the valuation increases on exchanges. August’s rise in Bankman-Fried’s token search and whale-backed inflows indicates that smart money is already seeking out the most credible opportunities in this category. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The “Next Big Thing” Under $0.01 Analysts are saying that MAGACOIN FINANCE is the ‘Next Big Thing,’ as Ethereum-ETF hype is generating new excitement over presale trading under $0.01. Security and transparency are driving investor interest in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With a completed audit by Hashex and strong team disclosures, it’s positioned to be one of the top crypto presales of the year — not just in hype, but in real fundamentals. Experts believe whales have begun to accumulate their positions, while the rapid increase in Google search interest suggests growing awareness in the broader market. Investors are buying in now ahead of presale allocations as demand prompts prices to rally higher. With a potential ROI of up to 65x, people are reaping significant benefits, with thousands of KYC-verified investors on board. Due to its limited supply, time is running out quickly to buy one of the best cryptos for 2025. Conclusion Ethereum’s price boom following the ETF approval shows that institutional money is here to stay, say analysts, but they expect the next chapter to be a presale bonanza. With its double audits, transparent team, whale demand, and sub-$0.01 entry point, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being branded as the ‘next big thing’ under $0.01. Analysts warn that early allocations may not last long.

Investors in 2025 are no longer satisfied with meme coins or speculative tokens that do not have practical use. Instead, a long-term growth needs cryptocurrencies more than ever before to solve real-world issues, drive to use the power, and build strong communities. Altcoins with utility have also been resistant to being sensitive to market cycles. Not only do they provide short term profits to the investors, but they can also give profits in the long-term. With real use cases, tokens stand a much better chance of surviving and flourishing as adoption increases. Why Utility Matters in 2025 Short-term prices might be pushed higher by speculation, but the projects with practical implications will hold out. For example, Ethereum has emerged as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), and XRP has remained the leader in cross-border payments. With the rising adoption in the world, sustainability becomes the critical measure of utility. The Altcoins to Watch Ethereum (ETH): The smart contract leader. Cardano (ADA): Energy-efficient and research-driven. Solana (SOL): High-speed transactions for DeFi and NFTs. XRP (XRP): Cross-border settlement. Avalanche (AVAX): DeFi-focused scalability. Polkadot (DOT): Blockchain interoperability. Chainlink (LINK): Secure oracle solutions. Polygon (MATIC): Ethereum layer-2 scaling. Immutable X (IMX): Gaming and NFT infrastructure. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA): A scarcity-driven, high-growth contender. Integrating High ROI and Utility Among these established players, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one of the newest and most exciting opportunities. Contrary to other small-cap tokens that exist purely as speculation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a community ecosystem that can reward holders by its scarcity and security . According to analysts, early investors would have the opportunity to make 50x gains , which puts it on par with early-stage successes like DOGE and SHIBA. Its dedication to providing development and practical use makes it one of the rare new altcoins with both short-term gains and long-term utility. Conclusion The smartest investments today lie in high above and beyond hype projects in 2025. Altcoins , however, that have strong real-world use, such as Ethereum and Solana, and upcoming contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE , are the most probable to promise sustainable growth. The utility based long term portfolios will be in a good position to perform better with more adoptions.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-will-pump-to-10-soon-heres-why/,"Host of Crypto Crusaders Levihas once made a bullish call for XRP. He predicted that the digital asset would soon rise to $10, the closest 2-digit price. In a new tweet, where a viral video is captioned, Levi wrote, “$10 PER XRP INCOMING SOON!” In the video, a woman openly admitted she did not know much about investing and asked for help in understanding what to do. In response, Brazilian-American influencer Camilla Araujo shared her investment decision, saying she holds approximately 1.3 million XRP. She went further to note that the current price was around “$2 and something cents,” adding that the community widely expected a move to $10. According to her, such a price would secure her financial future and effectively set her up for life. $10 PER #XRP INCOMING SOON! pic.twitter.com/gnMwnBIWFI — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 28, 2025 Broader Market Context and Expert Views Levi’s tweet aligns with growing sentiment in the digital asset market that XRP could soon reach higher price levels. A recent report from Times Tabloid referenced Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL), a prominent voice in the cryptocurrency space, who has been vocal about XRP’s potential to climb to $10. Cobb suggested that the market is entering altseason, a period where altcoins outperform, and predicted that a $10 valuation for XRP will be considered normal during this phase. Supporting this view, veteran trader Peter Brandt has also confirmed that altseason for 2025 is already underway. Brandt’s recognition of the market shift has added weight to bullish forecasts surrounding XRP. With the asset currently trading well above its levels from the same period last year, the trajectory points to continued strength if market conditions remain favorable. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Fundamental Position Beyond market speculation, XRP’s established position as a payments-focused digital asset contributes to confidence in its long-term outlook. The token has consistently maintained relevance in the broader financial ecosystem due to its efficiency and role in cross-border transactions . Advocates highlight factors such as Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions , the expansion of adoption, and progress in regulatory clarity as supportive elements for XRP’s growth. Additionally, the token’s utility in payment systems provides a foundation that many argue will help sustain momentum even in volatile conditions. XRP’s Move Toward $10 The projection of $10 per XRP continues to gain traction among analysts and investors, and Levi’s tweet amplified that sentiment with a clear, confident statement. The viral video he shared also underscored how strongly the XRP community views this target, with holders openly expressing expectations of significant financial change if the price level is reached. While the exact timing remains uncertain, the combination of technical market cycles, expert forecasts, and growing adoption reinforces the belief that XRP could realistically achieve this milestone.

The question is whether LINK can push past this barrier and ignite a bigger rally, or if a pullback comes first. Parabolic Surge Stalls Below $76.60 Resistance According to Alpha Crypto Signal, in a recent update shared on X, Chainlink has shown remarkable strength with a parabolic move before entering a consolidation phase just below the $26.60 horizontal resistance zone. This level has now become the focal point, as traders watch closely to see if momentum will carry LINK beyond it. Related Reading: LINK Price Climbs Following Chainlink’s Deal With US Commerce Department, Eyes $30 Alpha Crypto Signal noted that the momentum behind LINK’s move was powerful, and a breakout above $26.60 should not come as a surprise in the coming sessions. Such a development could potentially trigger another leg higher. Still, the analyst cautioned that broader market conditions point to the possibility of a correction. If LINK fails to sustain current levels, the altcoin is likely to dump below the marked boxed zone. However, Alpha Crypto Signal described it as a must-buy opportunity, presenting traders with an ideal entry point at discounted levels. To prepare for such a scenario, Alpha Crypto Signal plans to place spot limit buy orders below the boxed zone, with the intention of patiently waiting for price action to align with the setup. This strategy reflects a balanced approach—ready to capitalize on both potential downside dips and upside breakouts. On the flip side, if Chainlink manages to break out of the $26.60 resistance with significant trading volume, Alpha Crypto Signal emphasized that the plan would need to be adjusted accordingly. For now, the analyst recommends keeping LINK on the radar, as it sits at a pivotal point where the next big move could soon unfold. Market Confidence Returns With Chainlink Buyers Stepping In Trader Rai, in his latest analysis on the 15-minute timeframe, highlighted that Chainlink has shown strong resilience after bouncing from its support zone. This rebound signals renewed strength in the market, with buyers beginning to take control of short-term price action. Related Reading: Chainlink Whales Scoop Up $150 Million LINK In Two Weeks – More Gains Ahead? The chart further suggests that buyers are targeting a retest of the $24.30 resistance level. This zone stands out as a critical barrier, and a successful test could determine whether LINK is ready to extend its upward trajectory. If the breakout above $24.30 holds with sufficient volume, LINK may confirm a continuation pattern toward higher levels. Such a move would mark a key shift in sentiment, giving bulls the upper hand and potentially paving the way for a stronger rally in the near term.

50886545,569544,1756512013,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50886545.jpeg,Tron Cuts Network Fees By 60% To Strengthen Position In Stablecoin Market,https://bitcoinist.com/tron-cuts-network-fees-by-60/,"The Tron (TRX) network has made headlines by approving a significant reduction in transaction fees, cutting them by up to 60% following a majority vote within the community, as rising fees have been seen as a barrier to user participation and ecosystem development. Fee Adjustments On Tron The proposal to lower fees was driven by rising transaction costs that have accompanied an increase in TRX’s value, the network’s native token, which has doubled since 2024. The proposal alleged that while higher fees are essential for the Tron network’s overall security and stability, they have also eroded Tron’s competitive edge, making it imperative to adjust them. The increase in TRX prices has led to a corresponding rise in fees for transactions, particularly affecting Tether’s USDT stablecoin and other contracts on the platform. As a result, the earlier 50% reduction in energy unit prices, established by a previous proposal, has been negated, prompting this latest response from the Tron Super Representative community. As of this writing, TRX trades at $0.33, up by 107% year-to-date, being in the top performers in the cryptocurrency market during the same period, outpacing tokens like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins such as Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). Short-Term Profit Impact Expected Justin Sun, the founder of Tron and a prominent figure in the crypto space, announced this decision on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). He highlighted that the upcoming fee reduction will be the largest fee cut since the network’s inception back in 2017 along with the TRON Foundation. Sun alleged that in the short term, this reduction is expected to impact the networ’s profitability, given that the network relies on transaction fees as a primary revenue source. However, Sun expressed confidence that the long-term benefits would outweigh these initial drawbacks. By encouraging increased user engagement and higher transaction volumes , Tron aims to foster a more vibrant ecosystem that ultimately enhances profitability. To ensure that the fee structure remains competitive and sustainable, the network’s Super Representative community plans to conduct quarterly reviews of network fees. These assessments will take into account various factors, including fluctuations in TRX prices, levels of network activity , and overall growth rates. In his social media post, Sun further stated: On August 26, 2025, the Tron Super Representative community proposed to reduce Tron network fees by 60%. This is the largest fee reduction since the founding of the Tron network. The proposal has already passed and will take effect at 20:00 (GMT+8) this Friday Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Crypto News|crypto|crypto news|Cryptocurrency|Justin Sun|Tron Network|Tron news|Tron transaction fees|TRX price|TRXUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRX|ADA|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-30 00:00:13
50886642,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=176798,1756512030,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/50886642.jpeg,"MAGACOIN FINANCE Shows in Whale Wallets Next to AVAX, DOGE, and LINK",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/magacoin-finance-shows-in-whale-wallets-next-to-avax-doge-and-link/,"Whales are on the move again and their wallets say it all. Big investors are stacking Avalanche (AVAX), Dogecoin (DOGE), Chainlink (LINK), and MAGACOIN FINANCE — a mix of established tokens and one altcoin that’s quickly building hype. To those paying attention to market trends, such movement indicates what the smart money is up to. And right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE showing up next to these names is catching plenty of attention. Avalanche (AVAX) Price Builds Confidence Avalanche is in the green today, trading at $24.47 and is up 5.23% in the last 24 hours. What’s catching attention though isn’t just the price pump. The level of trading volumes has declined steeply, and this is an indicator that holders are not keen on selling. It is the level of quiet confidence that is typically observed before stronger price action. In May-August, the number of transactions increased more than twice, reaching $30 million throughput. That is a massive boost to AVAX since a larger network usage results in increased tokens being burned. Add the hype around Grayscale Avalanche ETF submission, and it is understandable why investors would expect AVAX to rally up to $53.98 in the short term. The crucial level to consider in case of a bullish failure is $16.05, although the market remains on the upward trajectory. Dogecoin (DOGE) Bulls Target $0.30 Dogecoin price has been trading sideways for weeks, but now it’s knocking on a critical resistance level. Traders are closely monitoring price activity around $0.23. A clean breakout above it could send DOGE running toward $0.26, $0.28, and even $0.30. Analysts cite a symmetrical triangle pattern which seems to be close to completion. If this plays out, Dogecoin could have an impulsive breakout, the kind that usually comes after a long period of consolidation. Support levels are intact of $0.21 and $0.19, providing a strong foundation to the bulls. Currently, traders are waiting to see daily close above the $0.23 mark as the signal to go ahead. Source :X Chainlink (LINK) ETF Filing Sparks Buzz Chainlink just received a stretch by Bitwise submitting the first U.S. Chainlink ETF to SEC. The filing refers to Coinbase Custody for storage and the product is intended to permit in-kind redemptions and creation, which would be the ability to trade using the LINK directly, rather than by converting it to cash. Following the announcement, LINK surged 4.2% in one day to reach $24.33. In the past month, LINK has gained in excess of 26%. Such a move has attracted the interest of both retail and institutional traders that see a regulated entry into altcoins. Although this ETF is way off its all-time high of $53, there is a growing hope that a steady climb in LINK price could be on the way once this ETF materializes. Source: CoinMarketCap MAGACOIN FINANCE Draws Whales With Strong ROI Hopes Whales are streaming to MAGACOIN FINANCE, signaling growing confidence in what analysts call one of 2025’s breakout altcoins. With forecasts of up to 1200% ROI , the project is drawing heavy attention as investor demand accelerates. Confidence is further reinforced by a smart contract audit passed by leading blockchain firms, confirming MAGA’s transparency and security. Together with whale accumulation and an increased FOMO, MAGA is solidifying as one of the altcoins to monitor prior to the next bull cycle. Final Take AVAX is gaining strength from rising adoption, DOGE looks ready for a breakout, and LINK is getting ETF-fueled attention. But the interesting part is that MAGACOIN FINANCE now shows up in the same whale wallets. For a new altcoin, that’s a strong sign. As Bullish whales continue to accumulate , MAGACOIN FINANCE may be in it to win it in the new bout of post-merger euphoria.

Tron has stepped into the spotlight as rising network fees push its leadership to reevaluate the protocol’s transaction model. Toncoin, meanwhile, is showing signs of weakness, slipping in momentum as trading volume declines and investors hesitate. Both projects underscore how blockchain ecosystems must constantly adapt to technical and economic pressures to remain competitive. Yet while TRX and TON wrestle with immediate challenges, BlockDAG is building on firm foundations. With $386 million raised in its presale at a current batch 30 price of $0.03, BlockDAG is showcasing growth through strategic initiatives. Its referral program rewards early adoption, Dashboard V4 transforms presale transparency, and its headline appearance at Token2049 Singapore this October sets the stage for global visibility. In a market where many projects are reacting, BlockDAG is proactively positioning itself as a front-runner. Tron: Fee Models Under Fire as TRX Gains Momentum Tron (TRX) is facing scrutiny as its bull market surge drives up transaction fees, highlighting the tension between token appreciation and user accessibility. Founder Justin Sun acknowledged the issue, confirming that rising TRX value has increased costs for developers and users, a trend that risks eroding Tron’s reputation as a low-cost, fast blockchain. The network’s Super Representatives are leading a review of the fee structure, exploring ways to keep costs aligned with Tron’s affordability goals. Their ability to make real-time protocol adjustments is a strength, ensuring the network remains responsive in the face of shifting market conditions. Still, the challenge is clear: without proper balance, users may look toward alternatives like Solana or Avalanche, both of which offer speed with lower fees. Tron’s proactive approach reflects its commitment to user experience over short-term gains. If the Super Representatives succeed in refining fees while maintaining growth, Tron could preserve its competitive edge during this bull market. Toncoin: Mixed Signals and Cautious Market Sentiment Toncoin (TON) currently trades at $3.24, up just over 1% in 24 hours, but its broader picture is less encouraging. Trading volume has declined 15% to $207 million, and open interest has slipped, showing reduced investor participation. Over the past week, TON has fallen more than 5%, diverging from broader market gains and leaving traders wary of its near-term direction. Critical levels remain in focus. If TON can hold its current support, analysts see recovery potential toward $3.89, with $4.43 as a longer-term upside target. However, failure to maintain support risks a slide toward $2.80, which would mark a sharp reversal in sentiment. Technical indicators echo the uncertainty: RSI sits at a neutral 45, while the MACD shows faint bullish momentum but with slowing histogram signals. Caution defines market behavior around TON. Until volume strengthens and resistance at $3.89 is reclaimed, Toncoin risks drifting in consolidation or facing deeper corrections if sentiment weakens further. $386M Raised and Counting: BlockDAG Storms Token2049 Stage With Confidence While Tron and Toncoin explore immediate market pressures, BlockDAG continues to build a story of scale, engagement, and global visibility. Its presale has raised $386 million to date, advancing to batch 30 with tokens priced at $0.03 and a launch price set at $0.05. Early participants who joined at $0.001 in batch 1 have already seen ROI in the thousands of percent, while current buyers still hold over 1,500% upside potential. BlockDAG’s strategy is not confined to fundraising. The referral program incentivizes growth by rewarding users with a 25% commission in BDAG for each new buyer referred, while the referred party also secures a 5% bonus. This structure encourages organic expansion and community-driven momentum. At the same time, Dashboard V4 has set a new benchmark in presale transparency. It acts as a live exchange simulator with wallet tracking, real-time order books, leaderboard rankings, and gamified referral metrics. This feature instills confidence among buyers by mirroring a post-launch trading environment and ensuring visibility of activity before BDAG lists on exchanges. Perhaps the most impactful near-term milestone is BlockDAG’s confirmed presence at Token2049 Singapore in October. With over 25,000 attendees and 7,000 companies expected, it is Asia’s most prominent Web3 event. BlockDAG is not just attending—it is marking the occasion with a 2049% presale bonus valid until October 1, amplifying investor enthusiasm and spotlighting the project on a global stage. By combining strong capital backing, real adoption through referrals, presale transparency, and international visibility, BlockDAG is proving itself more than just another presale, it is growing as a contender for long-term leadership. Summing Up! Tron’s fee model review highlights the growing pains of a network balancing token appreciation with user affordability. Toncoin’s slipping volume and cautious sentiment show how fragile market confidence can be without technical breakouts. Both projects reflect the challenges of maintaining competitiveness in a crowded field. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is demonstrating how preparation and execution can create stability amid volatility. With $386 million raised, a $0.03 batch price, a powerful referral program, and Dashboard V4 transparency, it has already laid down critical infrastructure. Its upcoming Token2049 Singapore appearance, enhanced by a 2049% presale bonus, signals ambition not just to participate in the global conversation, but to lead it. For investors scanning the market, the contrast is sharp. Tron and Toncoin may offer short-term plays, but BlockDAG represents structured growth with long-term upside, a rare combination in today’s crypto market.

A Reuters report citing three sources familiar with the matter indicates that Google will face a “modest” fine subsequently marking a shift in EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera’s stance on Big Tech violations from predecessor Margrethe Vestager’s heavy-handedness, focusing on harsh penalties. The EU wants Google and peers to comply with regulations This comes after a four-year long investigation which was a result of a complaint from the European Publishers Council, which led to charges against the search engine giant in 2023. The allegations levelled against Google were that it favoured its own advertising services ahead of its competitors. According to the sources , Ribera’s focus is on getting tech firms to end anti-competitive practices as opposed to punishing them with hefty fines. As a result, the fine is expected not to be in the scale of a record 4.3 billion euro that was imposed on Google by the bloc’s competition enforcer in 2018 over using its Android mobile operating system to suppress competitors. Earlier in 2017, Google was also hit with a 2.42-billion-euro penalty for using its own price comparison shopping service to gain an unfair advantage over smaller European competitors. In 2019, the search engine giant was slapped with a 1.49 billion euro fine for abusing its dominance to stop websites using brokers other than its AdSense platform. The EU competition enforcer did not comment on the matter. Google referred to a 2023 blog post in which it criticized the Commission for what it termed a flawed understanding of the adtech sector, adding that publishers and advertisers have vast options. Last year, Google’s advertising revenue, including from search services, Google Play, Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Ad Manager, AdMob and AdSense reached $264 billion or 75.6% of total revenue. It is the world’s most dominant digital advertising platform. Google won’t be forced to divest part of its adtech business However, Reuters indicates that the company does not give out revenue figures for its adtech business which relates to advertising and not search. With the latest information coming out, Ribera is not expected to ask Google to dispose part of its adtech business although her predecessor had made such suggestions that the tech giant could divest its DoubleClick for Publishers tool and AdX ad exchange, according to what the sources revealed. This is not the first instance in which Google is having a clash with EU over unfair practices. In July this year, a coalition of independent publishers lodged an antitrust complaint with the EU accusing the company of its dominant search position by using their material to power its AI Overviews without offering an opt‑out. The publishers also sought an interim injunction, warning that continued use would inflict irreversible damage to their readership and revenues. Apart from this case, also earlier this year, a UK’s competition watchdog launched an investigation into the search engine giant’s dominance in search and search advertising. With these and many other cases, Google has accused the EU of hampering innovation and tech firms from flourishing in the region because of tough rules, subsequently short-changing consumers. Google’s sentiments are also echoed by others in the tech sector with a survey by European tech founders revealing widespread concerns over the bloc’s regulatory environment.

This notable drop signals a decisive move into ‘fear territory,’ causing many investors to pause and carefully assess the current landscape. Understanding this pivotal index is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool developed by Alternative.me to gauge overall market sentiment. It operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed.’ Essentially, it provides a quick snapshot of how emotionally charged the crypto market is at any given moment. But how exactly is this sentiment measured? The index considers several key factors, each contributing to the overall score: Volatility (25%): Measures how much the market moves, often indicating uncertainty. Trading Volume (25%): Reflects the level of buying and selling activity across the market. Social Media Mentions (15%): Analyzes the frequency and sentiment of crypto-related discussions online. Surveys (15%): Gathers direct polls of investor sentiment (though currently paused). Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks how often crypto-related terms are searched, indicating public interest. These diverse factors combine to give a comprehensive view, helping investors understand if the market is driven by rational decisions or emotional impulses. What Does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index of 39 Mean for Investors? Recently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index saw an 11-point decline from its previous day’s reading, settling at 39. This significant dip pushes market sentiment firmly into the ‘fear’ category. What does this actually mean for you as an investor? When the index enters fear territory, it suggests that investors are becoming increasingly cautious, worried, and perhaps even engaging in panic-selling. This sentiment can be triggered by various factors, such as negative news, significant price drops, regulatory concerns, or broader economic uncertainties. It often reflects a lack of confidence in the short-term outlook for cryptocurrencies. Historically, periods of extreme fear have sometimes presented unique opportunities for long-term investors. However, they also come with heightened risks, as market downturns can intensify rapidly. It is a time for careful consideration, not impulsive reactions. How Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Impact Your Strategy? For many, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index acts as a contrarian indicator. The old adage, ‘Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,’ perfectly encapsulates this approach. When the index shows extreme fear, it might suggest that the market is oversold and could be due for a rebound, potentially offering attractive entry points for those with a higher risk tolerance. Conversely, when the index hits ‘Extreme Greed,’ it could signal an overheated market ripe for a correction. This is often when asset prices are at their peak, driven by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), and a pullback might be imminent. Recognizing these patterns can help inform your decisions. It is important to remember, however, that the index is just one tool among many. It should complement, not replace, your own thorough research and robust risk management strategies. Relying solely on a single indicator can be misleading and lead to poor outcomes. Navigating Market Apprehension: Actionable Tips for Crypto Investors With the Crypto Fear & Greed Index now showing fear, how can you navigate these uncertain times effectively? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Keep up with reliable news sources and market analysis. Understand the underlying reasons for market shifts, rather than reacting solely to price movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: Spreading your investments across different assets can help mitigate risk during volatile periods. Practice Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set clear stop-loss orders and stick to your predefined investment plan. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Regularly investing a fixed amount, regardless of price, can help smooth out volatility over time and reduce the impact of short-term dips. Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Short-term fluctuations are common in crypto. Focusing on the long-term potential of projects can help you weather temporary downturns. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Fear can lead to impulsive selling, while greed can lead to reckless buying. Always stick to a well-thought-out strategy rather than succumbing to market emotions. The recent drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 39 serves as a crucial reminder of the inherent volatility and emotional swings within the cryptocurrency market. While fear can be unsettling, it also presents an opportunity for informed investors to re-evaluate their positions and potentially identify strategic entry or exit points. By understanding the index and combining it with sound investment principles, you can make more rational decisions, even when market sentiment turns apprehensive. Stay calm, stay informed, and always prioritize your long-term financial goals. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from ‘Extreme Fear’ (0) to ‘Extreme Greed’ (100). Q2: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? A: It is calculated based on factors like volatility, trading volume, social media mentions, surveys, Bitcoin’s market cap dominance, and Google search volume.

A: While some view extreme fear as a potential buying opportunity (contrarian investing), it’s not a standalone signal. Always combine it with your own research and risk management strategy.

The U.S. Justice Department has announced a pivotal US tariff appeal , challenging a court decision that declared many of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies illegal. This move signals a determined effort to defend past trade strategies and has substantial implications for businesses and consumers worldwide. What Sparked the US Tariff Appeal? The core of this dispute lies in a prior court ruling. This decision found that the Trump administration had overstepped its authority by imposing tariffs on billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese goods. The court specifically cited the use of Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 as exceeding the legal framework. President Trump’s administration initiated these tariffs as a measure to address perceived unfair trade practices by China. These policies aimed to protect American industries and jobs, but they also led to increased costs for many imported goods. The Justice Department’s Stance: Why Pursue this US Tariff Appeal? The U.S. Attorney General has clearly stated the intention to appeal. The Justice Department believes the initial court ruling was incorrect in its interpretation of executive authority regarding trade. They argue that the President possesses broad powers to implement tariffs under specific trade laws. Key arguments for the US tariff appeal include: Executive Authority: The department asserts that the President’s actions fell within the scope of powers granted by Congress for trade enforcement. National Security: Some tariffs were justified on national security grounds, a claim often used in trade disputes. Precedent: Allowing the ruling to stand could set a precedent that limits future administrations’ ability to respond swiftly to trade challenges. This appeal is not merely about past policies; it’s about defining the boundaries of presidential power in trade matters for the future. Potential Impact of the US Tariff Appeal on Global Trade The outcome of this US tariff appeal will have far-reaching consequences. For businesses, it could mean continued uncertainty regarding import costs and supply chains. Industries that rely heavily on imported components or materials from China are particularly vulnerable. Consider these potential impacts: Economic Stability: A reversal could re-introduce or validate tariffs, potentially leading to higher consumer prices and inflation. Trade Relations: It will undoubtedly influence the U.S.’s trade relationships, especially with China, and potentially affect ongoing negotiations. Legal Precedent: The final decision will clarify the extent of presidential power in trade policy, shaping how future administrations approach trade disputes. The global economy is interconnected, and shifts in one major player’s trade policy ripple across markets. What Comes Next in the US Tariff Appeal Process? The legal process for this US tariff appeal will involve several stages. The case will likely move through higher courts, potentially reaching the Supreme Court. This journey can be lengthy, often spanning months or even years. During this period, businesses and policymakers will closely monitor developments. The legal arguments will focus on statutory interpretation and constitutional law, specifically concerning the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches in trade matters. Stakeholders must stay informed to adapt to potential policy changes. The U.S. Justice Department’s decision to appeal the tariff ruling marks a critical juncture in American trade policy. This ongoing legal battle will not only determine the legality of past actions but also set a precedent for future executive authority in trade. Its resolution will undoubtedly shape the economic landscape for years to come, influencing everything from consumer prices to international diplomatic relations. Staying abreast of these developments is essential for anyone involved in global commerce. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the main reason for the US tariff appeal? The U.S. Justice Department is appealing a court ruling that found many of President Trump’s tariff policies on Chinese goods to be illegal. They aim to defend the executive branch’s authority in trade matters. Which specific trade policies are being challenged in the appeal? The appeal specifically targets the tariffs imposed under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 on various Chinese imports during the Trump administration. How could this US tariff appeal affect American businesses? If the appeal is successful, it could validate the imposition of tariffs, potentially leading to increased costs for businesses that import goods from China and creating uncertainty in supply chains. What does the term ‘executive authority’ mean in this context? ‘Executive authority’ refers to the powers granted to the President to act on behalf of the government, including the ability to implement trade policies and tariffs, which is at the heart of this legal dispute. How long is the US tariff appeal process expected to take? The appeal process can be lengthy, potentially taking months or even years as the case moves through higher courts, possibly up to the Supreme Court. Will this appeal impact current U.S. trade relations with China? Yes, the outcome of this appeal will significantly influence ongoing and future trade relations between the U.S. and China, potentially altering negotiation strategies and trade agreements.

Backed by a completed Hashex audit and a fully KYC-verified team, the project is drawing serious investor attention for combining early-stage upside with real protections. Today’s update covers fresh listing progress, funding milestones, and what the next weeks could mean for pricing, liquidity, and community growth at scale. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Exchange Listings, Liquidity Plans Take Shape The team reports steady progress on listings, with an initial DEX launch planned to establish on-chain liquidity, followed by staged CEX listings to broaden reach. This two-step approach is designed to reduce slippage at launch, support healthier price discovery, and make MAGACOIN FINANCE accessible to both DeFi natives and centralized exchange users. Listing windows have been aligned with final presale tranches so that newly unlocked demand meets prepared liquidity from day one. Presale Milestones: Nearing Sellout at Sub-$0.005 Investor demand has exceeded the presale beyond significant levels, with over $13 million raised from more than 12,000 unique contributors and community headcount exceeding 25,000 people via official channels. Pricing remains below $0.005 in the current tranche, but the allocation is reported to be over 90% sold. That combination—low entry with shrinking supply—has accelerated FOMO while keeping distribution broad enough to avoid unhealthy whale concentration at launch. Security and Compliance: Built to Withstand Due Diligence MAGACOIN FINANCE emphasizes verifiable trust signals rather than hype. The smart contract has passed a full Hashex audit , adding a layer of assurance. The core team is fully KYC-verified, and wallet transparency, liquidity locks, and clear vesting schedules are all documented. Tokenomics for Multi-Cycle Growth The token model is structured to scale across multiple bull cycles, with emissions and unlocks mapped to roadmap delivery instead of arbitrary dates. Utility features slated for rollout after listing aim to deepen on-chain activity and create natural demand sinks, supporting sustainable volume rather than one-off spikes. By aligning incentives for holders, contributors, and market-makers, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning for steady liquidity and reduced volatility as the ecosystem expands. What to Watch Next When the presale allocation is coming to an end, you should still monitor the final tranche availability, any additional audit artifacts being published, and the precise order of DEX and CEX listings. Events that could move the market in the near future are the trading pairs coming through, the initial liquidity depth at the actual launch, and the first utility releases’ timing. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s first quarters on public markets will be influenced by these steps being taken, which will also provide early price discovery and set the mood. Bottom line With exchange listings approaching, a near-sold-out presale under $0.005, audited code, a KYC-verified team, and protective tokenomics, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to look like one of 2025’s most credible—and most closely watched—presale stories.

At first glance, the chart presents a bearish setup, reinforced by the prominent red arrow pointing downward. However, a closer examination reveals that the chart is inverted. What may initially seem like a bearish call is, in fact, a bullish projection. The chart depicts a symmetrical triangle , and the analyst anticipates that XRP is nearing a breakout from this formation. I guess that's it for XRP. pic.twitter.com/RB2RjsoVxE — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) August 28, 2025 XRP’s Performance Within the Triangle XRP entered July with a powerful rally, reaching an all-time high of $3.65 . However, the asset’s momentum stalled toward the end of the month, and the converging trendlines show that it had traded within a tightening range. The price has oscillated between support and resistance, dipping below $3 multiple times and attempting multiple failed breakouts. This consistent pattern of repeated rejections at the upper boundary while maintaining higher lows along the bottom trendline has defined the symmetrical triangle that now dominates the short-term outlook. At the time of Xoom’s analysis, the digital asset traded around $2.96, close to the upper boundary of the triangle. The structure shows that the token has found a firm base above $2.9. This consolidation reflects both the caution and strength in the market as traders position for the next decisive move. Why the Breakout Matters The symmetrical triangle is typically a continuation pattern, but it can also signal reversals depending on market conditions. In this case, the analyst interprets the setup as bullish. Despite the visual prediction of a bearish breakdown, the chart’s inversion shows the expectation of an upward move once XRP breaks through the upper resistance trendline. Such a breakout would represent more than a short-term rally. It would confirm that XRP has absorbed the recent selling pressure within the triangle and is now ready to extend higher. The multiple tests of the upper boundary strengthen this outlook, suggesting that resistance may soon give way. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Targets After Confirmation If XRP manages to break convincingly above the triangle, price targets could extend significantly higher than current levels. A measured move from the triangle suggests a rise toward $3.9, which would mark a new all-time high for the digital asset. For now, XRP remains confined within the symmetrical triangle. Still, its consistent performance inside the pattern indicates that a breakout decision point is approaching, with a high chance of a price rally once the breakout is confirmed.

Grayscale, a leading digital asset manager, has officially updated its S-1 filings for spot Cardano (ADA) and Polygon (POL) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This move is a significant step forward for the broader adoption of Grayscale Crypto ETFs , potentially opening new avenues for mainstream investment in these prominent cryptocurrencies. What Do Grayscale Crypto ETFs Mean for Investors? When we talk about Grayscale Crypto ETFs , we’re discussing a financial product that allows investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies like ADA and POL without directly owning the underlying assets. These ETFs track the price of the cryptocurrencies, offering a regulated and potentially more accessible way to participate in the digital asset market. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart highlighted these updated S-1 filings, underscoring the ongoing efforts by asset managers to bring diverse crypto products to market. The updated S-1 filings are essentially registration statements required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for new securities. For spot crypto ETFs, these filings are crucial. They provide detailed information about the fund’s structure, risks, and operations, aiming to ensure transparency for potential investors. Why Are Spot ADA and POL ETFs Gaining Traction? Cardano (ADA) and Polygon (POL) are not just any cryptocurrencies; they represent significant innovation within the blockchain space. Cardano is known for its research-driven approach to development and peer-reviewed academic studies, aiming for a highly secure and sustainable platform. Polygon, on the other hand, is a scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to improve transaction speeds and reduce costs, making decentralized applications more practical. The potential introduction of spot ETFs for these assets reflects a growing institutional interest beyond just Bitcoin and and Ethereum. It signifies a maturation of the crypto market, where more diverse, high-potential assets are being considered for regulated investment vehicles. This expansion could offer investors: Diversification: A broader range of crypto assets within a regulated framework. Accessibility: Easier access through traditional brokerage accounts. Professional Management: Funds managed by experienced asset managers like Grayscale. What Are the Next Steps for Grayscale Crypto ETFs? While updated S-1 filings are a positive sign, they are just one step in a multi-stage approval process. The SEC still needs to review and approve these filings, which can be a lengthy and unpredictable journey. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, particularly spot ETFs, remains complex in the United States. However, the consistent efforts by firms like Grayscale demonstrate a strong commitment to navigating these challenges. Historically, the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs paved the way for broader acceptance. Many market observers believe that if more spot Grayscale Crypto ETFs are approved, it could lead to increased institutional adoption and liquidity for the underlying assets. This would be a tremendous boost for the entire crypto ecosystem, providing greater legitimacy and stability. Navigating the Future: Benefits and Potential Roadblocks The introduction of Grayscale Crypto ETFs for ADA and POL offers compelling benefits, but it also comes with potential hurdles: Benefits: Reduced Custody Risk: Investors don’t directly handle crypto storage. Market Efficiency: Potential for better price discovery and arbitrage opportunities. Broader Investor Base: Attracts traditional investors who prefer regulated products. Potential Roadblocks: Regulatory Uncertainty: The SEC’s stance on non-Bitcoin/Ethereum spot ETFs is still evolving. Market Volatility: Crypto markets are inherently volatile, which can impact ETF performance. Fees: ETFs typically come with management fees, which can eat into returns. Despite these challenges, the continuous updates from Grayscale underscore the industry’s determination to integrate digital assets into traditional finance. This commitment could unlock significant value for investors seeking exposure to the innovative potential of Cardano and Polygon. In conclusion, Grayscale’s updated S-1 filings for spot ADA and POL ETFs are a significant development, signaling growing momentum for diversified Grayscale Crypto ETFs . While regulatory hurdles remain, these efforts reflect a maturing market and increasing institutional interest in a wider array of digital assets. Keep an eye on these developments; they could redefine how we invest in the future of finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are spot crypto ETFs?

The crypto world is buzzing with news as the Altcoin Season Index , provided by CoinMarketCap, has recently climbed to a significant 58. This one-point increase from the previous day signals a notable shift, suggesting that altcoins are gaining momentum against Bitcoin. But what exactly does this number mean for you and your digital assets? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: What Does 58 Mean? The Altcoin Season Index is a crucial metric for investors. It measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. A reading closer to 100 indicates a stronger trend where altcoins are broadly outperforming Bitcoin. Specifically, an ""altcoin season"" is declared when 75% of these top coins surpass Bitcoin’s performance during that 90-day period. Reaching 58 on this index tells us that a substantial number of altcoins are currently showing stronger price action compared to Bitcoin. While not yet at the ""official"" 75% threshold for a full altcoin season, this upward movement is a clear indicator of growing investor interest and capital flow into the broader altcoin market. Therefore, many traders and investors closely monitor this index for potential opportunities. Why the Altcoin Season Index Matters for Your Portfolio The rising Altcoin Season Index has several implications for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Firstly, it often suggests a period where diversified portfolios, including a mix of promising altcoins, might see better returns than those solely focused on Bitcoin. Secondly, it highlights specific sectors or narratives within the altcoin space that are attracting significant attention. Key benefits of a rising index include: Diversification potential: Exploring altcoins can spread risk and enhance returns. Higher growth potential: Many altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps, can experience rapid price appreciation. Innovation spotlight: A rising index often shines a light on innovative projects and emerging technologies. However, it is essential to remember that higher potential returns often come with increased risk. Therefore, always conduct thorough research before investing. Navigating the Altcoin Landscape: Tips for Investors With the Altcoin Season Index showing strength, how can you effectively navigate this dynamic market? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Research (DYOR): Understand the fundamentals of any altcoin before investing. Look at its use case, team, technology, and community. Risk Management: Allocate only what you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Diversify Wisely: Instead of putting all your funds into one altcoin, spread your investments across several promising projects. Stay Informed: Keep up with market news, project updates, and broader economic trends that can influence altcoin performance. The crypto market moves quickly, so staying vigilant and adaptable is key to success during periods of heightened altcoin activity. Challenges and Considerations in an Altcoin-Favorable Market While the rising Altcoin Season Index brings exciting prospects, it also presents certain challenges. Volatility is a primary concern, as altcoins can experience more drastic price swings than Bitcoin. Additionally, the sheer number of altcoins makes it challenging to identify truly valuable projects from those with less long-term potential. Potential challenges include: Increased Volatility: Altcoin prices can be highly unpredictable. Scam Projects: The market can attract projects lacking genuine utility or with malicious intent. Liquidity Issues: Some smaller altcoins may have low trading volumes, making it difficult to buy or sell large positions without impacting the price. Therefore, a cautious and informed approach is always recommended, even when the market sentiment appears bullish for altcoins. Conclusion: The Future of Altcoins Looks Promising The climb of the Altcoin Season Index to 58 is a compelling signal for the cryptocurrency market. It underscores a growing confidence in altcoins and their potential to outperform Bitcoin in the short to medium term. While this doesn’t guarantee a full-blown altcoin season, it certainly creates an environment ripe with opportunities for those who are prepared to research and manage their risks effectively. This period encourages a closer look at the innovative projects shaping the future of decentralized finance and beyond. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index?

It helps indicate whether altcoins are generally outperforming Bitcoin. Q2: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 58 signify? A reading of 58 means that a significant number of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. While not yet the 75% threshold for a declared ""altcoin season,"" it shows strong positive momentum for the altcoin market. Q3: How is an ""Altcoin Season"" officially declared? An Altcoin Season is officially declared when 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin in price performance over the preceding 90 days. Q4: Is now a good time to invest in altcoins? The rising Altcoin Season Index suggests a favorable environment for altcoins. However, all investments carry risk. It’s crucial to conduct your own research (DYOR), understand individual project fundamentals, and manage your risk exposure carefully before investing. Q5: What are the risks associated with investing during an altcoin-favorable period? Key risks include high volatility, the presence of scam projects, and potential liquidity issues for smaller altcoins. Always approach with caution and a well-defined investment strategy.

Bitcoin Illiquid Supply On Binance Hit Record Highs According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, Bitcoin’s illiquid supply recently touched new highs on the Binance exchange. In contrast, BTC’s liquid supply has seen a significant decline. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment On Binance Turns Bullish – But Is The Market Setting A Trap? The CryptoQuant contributor shared the following chart which shows the difference between BTC’s liquid vs illiquid supply on Binance. Bitcoin recently hit a fresh all-time high (ATH) above $120,000 before a price correction, showing that the market is currently in a state of “liquidity scarcity” supporting an upward trend. A high level of illiquid supply essentially means that more BTC is locked away in wallets with minimal movement, effectively removing it from circulation on exchanges. This reduces the amount of Bitcoin available for trading. A lack of BTC readily available on exchanges increases buying pressure on the limited supply that remains. This dynamic helps explain how BTC has continued to reach new highs even without massive inflows of external liquidity. That said, there remain some risks. BTC’s low liquid supply means that whales or large holders can exert significant pressure on the cryptocurrency through any sudden sell-off. Such pressure could result in sharp price correction for the digital asset due to the lack of liquidity to absorb the new supply. At the same time, current on-chain data indicates that whales and institutions appear to be adopting a “hold for the long haul” strategy, underscoring their confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term strategic asset. However, analysts caution that any sudden shift in this behavior would be felt almost immediately across the market. BTC In A “Fragile Bull Run” Arab Chain described the present market situation as a contradictory one. On one hand, rising illiquid supply provides a foundation for further price appreciation. On the other, the lack of liquid supply creates a fragile market structure where even moderate selling could cause significant volatility. Related Reading: More Pain For Bitcoin? Open Interest Surpasses $40 Billion As Longs Crowd In As a result, Bitcoin is currently in a “fragile bull run” in that it is supported by long-term holders but susceptible to sudden selling from whales. However, if BTC illiquid supply continues to rise, then it could move toward levels exceeding $150,000 by the end of 2025. On the flipside, if the liquid supply increases due to persistent sell-offs, then the market could face challenges, leading to a price decline to as low as the $90,000 to $100,000 range. Despite BTC’s fragile price momentum, some experts continue to remain optimistic. Crypto analyst Timothy Peterson recently predicted that BTC can surge as high as $160,000 by Christmas. At press time, BTC trades at $109,286, down 3% in the past 24 hours.

Hedera, on the other hand, stands at a technical crossroads, with its ability to defend critical support likely dictating whether it can graduate from promise to performance. Yet it is BlockDAG that is drawing the sharpest spotlight. With over $386 million raised and a bold $600 million presale target, BlockDAG isn’t just participating in the altcoin race, it is redrawing the track. Its design prioritizes scalability, liquidity, and developer incentives at a magnitude few competitors can match. If Dogecoin shows cultural stickiness and Hedera reflects institutional curiosity, BlockDAG represents a decisive economic moat. It isn’t hype, it’s an infrastructure play with grassroots momentum, setting itself apart as the most ambitious Layer 1 bet this year. BlockDAG’s $600M Presale Sets Stage for Explosive Breakout BlockDAG is quickly emerging as the most watched Layer 1 project of 2025, and its bold $600M presale target signals confidence few rivals can match. With $386M already raised, the project is more than halfway there, positioning itself among the most ambitious fundraising efforts in crypto history. Unlike smaller-scale raises that often burn out, BlockDAG’s strategy is designed to fuel global liquidity, infrastructure scaling, and developer incentives, giving it a runway that could rival Avalanche or Aptos, but with stronger grassroots momentum. The technical backdrop adds to the buzz. Just as Dogecoin and Hedera (HBAR) are testing critical support zones before potential breakouts, BlockDAG is consolidating ahead of its own inflection point. Analysts suggest that once its presale crosses key thresholds, momentum could snowball into one of the sharpest rallies the market has seen. The sheer scale of its raise becomes a moat, an economic shield that sets it apart from hype-driven projects. For investors, this is more than a presale, it’s a chance to enter early into a project built for scale, liquidity, and sustainability. With upside potential amplified by strong demand and defined growth plans, BlockDAG is shaping up as the FOMO play of the year. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Poised for a Breakout Toward New Highs Dogecoin (DOGE) has been holding firm above the $0.21 mark, and this stability is drawing attention. Unlike past rallies that were driven almost entirely by hype, the current move shows signs of stronger market structure. Analysts suggest that if DOGE can maintain this base, the next logical milestone is $0.30, a level that could ignite broader momentum. Pushing further, the key resistance lies at $0.48, its previous high. A successful break above that zone could set the stage for a new all-time high. The $0.16–$0.17 range has repeatedly acted as a springboard, with buyers stepping in to defend dips. This recurring demand hints that the market isn’t just speculative, it’s finding sustainable interest. Of course, risks remain. A drop below $0.21 could invite a correction, but for now, the bias leans upward. For investors, this presents a balanced risk-reward scenario: steady support below and significant upside potential ahead. HBAR Holding Critical Support Signals Big Move Ahead Hedera (HBAR) is perched at a pivotal technical level, trading around $0.234 as it shapes a descending triangle, a chart pattern that often precedes either a sharp breakout or a steep correction. Despite ongoing pressure, HBAR has repeatedly defended its crucial $0.226 support, suggesting strong buying interest and accumulation from long-term investors. A decisive push above the 50-day moving average, now hovering near $0.245, could trigger a rally toward $0.305, delivering more than 30% upside in the short term. Conversely, failure to maintain the $0.226 zone would expose HBAR to a pullback in the $0.16–$0.20 range, erasing recent gains and dampening momentum. For investors, this creates a defined risk-reward scenario: clear downside protection with significant upside potential if bullish momentum returns. With volatility high across altcoins, HBAR’s technical setup stands out as one of the more watchable plays for traders seeking timely entry points. Final Word: BlockDAG Emerges as the Defining Altcoin of 2025 If Dogecoin is the nostalgia play and Hedera is the cautious bet, BlockDAG is the strategic entry point for investors seeking asymmetric upside backed by robust fundamentals. Unlike its rivals, BlockDAG is not merely riding speculative waves; its $386M presale already demonstrates deep conviction from investors. The massive capital inflow translates into liquidity, developer incentives, and infrastructure scaling, factors that elevate it beyond hype. In the fast-paced crypto market of 2025, where Dogecoin thrives on sentiment and Hedera wrestles with adoption hurdles, BlockDAG’s $600M presale stands as the strongest economic moat. It is not just competing; it is rewriting the competitive landscape and positioning itself as the defining altcoin of 2025. With its presale momentum accelerating and investor confidence surging, BlockDAG is laying the groundwork for sustainable dominance, turning early participation into a generational opportunity that could outpace both legacy tokens and new entrants.

Both sit at the center of the ETF conversation, and both have fuel from institutions and community traction. Cardano’s ETF decision has a new timeline, while Avalanche has filings, custodians, and tokenization moves lining up. Near the end of this piece, you’ll also meet MAGACOIN FINANCE —fresh, fast-growing, HashEx-audited, and pitched by many as a candidate for best crypto presale 2025 in a cycle where early entries matter. Cardano: ETF Clock Ticks, Institutions Circle The SEC pushed the Cardano ETF decision to October 26, 2025 , giving the market a clear date to watch. Traders track approval odds that sit near the top of the range—Polymarket around 79% and well-known ETF watchers calling it near 90%. That sets the tone for Cardano price prediction 2025, where the path often hinges on the approval window and liquidity that may follow. Institutional signals keep building. Franklin Templeton runs Cardano nodes and has been in direct talks with leadership about blockchain adoption. On-chain data shows large holders snapping up ~200 million ADA (about $157 million) in a short 48-hour window in Q3. Governance is active too: the community approved a development fund of about $71 million (96 million ADA) with strong support. ADA joined the Nasdaq Crypto Index in mid-Q3 2025, it returned to major U.S. platforms like Bitstamp and Binance US, and a joint SEC-CFTC effort dubbed “Project Crypto” aims to clarify token categories—an umbrella step many view as tailwind for altcoin ETFs. For investors building a list of sltcoins to watch 2025 , ADA belongs in the conversation. Avalanche: Filings, Custody, and Tokenization Heat Grayscale filed to convert its Avalanche Trust into a spot ETF (late Q3 2025), with listing plans on Nasdaq. There’s competition in motion—VanEck submitted an AVAX ETF application in March 2025, and Nasdaq filed 19b-4 docs that same month. The proposed Grayscale fund taps Coinbase Custody, while BNY Mellon handles admin and transfer agent duties. Creations and redemptions would be cash-based, and as much as 85% of holdings may be staked to capture rewards. Institutions are testing the rails. SkyBridge plans to tokenize $300 million (about 10% of AUM) on Avalanche. Wyoming launched the FRNT stablecoin on Avalanche alongside six other chains. In Europe, Crypto Finance (a Deutsche Börse Group unit) integrated AVAX for institutional access in Q3 2025. All of that informs Avalanche crypto price prediction chatter. Analysts flag a short-run band around $28–$33, while more speculative takes stretch toward $500 if institutional use grows. With AVAX trading in the low-to-mid $20s range at times this year, many list it among best crypto to buy now . MAGACOIN FINANCE: Retail Floodgates and a Fresh Narrative As ETF hype builds, traders are eyeing ADA and AVAX—yet the real heat, some say, sits with MAGACOIN FINANCE, a sale gaining speed as retail flows pick up. The project has passed an independent smart-contract audit by HashEx , one of the top names in blockchain security. That box ticked, the narrative shifts to access and timing—exactly why many tag MAGACOIN FINANCE as a fit for best crypto presale 2025 lists . With a crowd projecting up to 11000% upside, buyers argue that missing early allocations could sting if ETF tailwinds lift the whole market. Final Take: Three Paths Before the Peak ETF headlines give traders three angles. Cardano has a hard date and strong odds.. Avalanche stacks filings, custodians, and real-world tokenization. And MAGACOIN FINANCE slots in as the rising new play—HashEx-audited, gaining speed with retail, and pitched for best crypto presale 2025 lists. If you’re building a shortlist of the best altcoins to buy now or the best crypto to buy now, ADA and AVAX give the ETF-focused route, while MAGACOIN FINANCE adds the high-beta wildcard.

In a series of direct posts, he stated that he does not support Ripple holders and even joked that he would mock anyone who sent him a private message. ZachXBT Calls XRP Holders “Exit Liquidity” For Insiders In his posts, ZachXBT explained why he keeps his distance from the XRP community. “I do not currently assist the XRP community and will make fun of anyone who sends me a DM,” he wrote. He went further to say that Ripple holders are not worth supporting because they provide “nothing of value to the industry except exit liquidity for insiders .” The on-chain detective also noted that the supply of XRP remains heavily controlled by insiders. In his view, this makes the token less attractive and prevents fair growth. He added that the community around XRP behaves more like a cult than a group trying to build real technology. According to him, Ripple holders focus too much on hype, price promotion, and defending their token, rather than driving innovation. ZachXBT grouped XRP holders with other communities he sees as structurally weak. He says that they share the same problems: strong promotion, defensive attitudes, and little to no useful progress. Due to his reputation as a respected blockchain investigator, his comments drew attention, despite being divisive. Because he has exposed crypto scams and shady financial transactions , ZachXBT has gained influence over time, and his words now carry more weight. On-Chain Detective Rejects MLM Chains And Community Shilling ZachXBT also explained that his criticism goes beyond XRP alone. He said, “I discriminate against MLM chains,” comparing many projects in the market to pyramid schemes. In his view, these chains operate with little real utility but rely on hype, recruiting new buyers, and constant shilling by communities to keep the system alive. He described a pattern of insider enrichment, where early insiders and influencers cash out with profits while late retail buyers are left holding losses. This setup, he argued, also suits the XRP community, as it is more about aggressive promotion than genuine innovation. ZachXBT also discussed the behavior of these communities. He described their behavior as cult-like, with members becoming very defensive and spending more energy on pushing “numbers go up” rather than creating long-term value. In his opinion, this is one of the reasons why these projects do not advance the crypto industry. ZachXBT’s comments may prompt the crypto space to reassess XRP, its community support, and whether the token’s future lies in real utility or is simply an asset used by insiders for profit. A fresh wave of verbal shrapnel could happen within the XRP community, as some agree with him while others defend Ripple’s token.",XRP|ripple|Ripple investors|ripple news|Ripple price|XPRUSD|XRP community|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-30 01:00:35

This decline has sparked significant criticism on social media, particularly against the crypto exchange Binance, which some investors accuse of contributing to the current market slump. Binance Behind The Bitcoin Price Slump? Market analyst DeFitracer shared insights on social media site X (formerly Twitter), questioning why the market is experiencing a sell-off despite what he describes as an oversaturation of positive catalysts. These include record inflows into crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) anticipated for next month. Yet, he points out, “we’re still dumping—why?” Related Reading: LINK Price Climbs Following Chainlink’s Deal With US Commerce Department, Eyes $30 According to DeFitracer, the ongoing sell-offs appear to be orchestrated by Binance, which he claims is using a third party, market maker Wintermute, to execute its trades. This strategy, he argues, is designed to set a bearish trend that retail investors follow, ultimately benefiting Binance through profits from futures liquidations. In fact, 2024 saw $344 million liquidated in a single day on the exchange, and current market manipulations may yield similar results, he asserts. As of press time, the market’s leading cryptocurrency trades at $108,295, meaning a 12% retrace from all-time high (ATH) levels of $124,000 reached earlier in the month. Three-Phase Reaction To Crypto Sell-Off DeFitracer also highlighted significant activity surrounding Solana (SOL). The analyst indicates that beyond Bitcoin, Binance has also been offloading SOL, potentially driven by an alleged desire to curb competition with its own token, Binance Coin (BNB), which currently has a market cap of $117 billion compared to SOL’s $102 billion. The analyst also said in his analysis that this activity raises questions about where Binance is sourcing its Solana, as their proof-of-reserves only shows client funds, suggesting that customer assets might be at risk in these trading maneuvers. DeFitracer added that these movements echo the practices of collapsed exchanges like FTX, which similarly utilized client funds through its trading arm Alameda Research: This is a terrible look for the exchange. User funds should stay safe – not be used for market games. FTX pulled the same move with client funds through Alameda Research.

The chart shared by Brandt shows XRP against USDT on Binance , plotted with daily bars. The technical structure displayed highlights a descending formation with a support level marked at approximately $2.78. His analysis suggests that this level is crucial to monitor, as its loss could signal further downside pressure. I post what I see. I assume strong opinions — always weakly held. I am wrong as often as I am right. If you are offended by my charts, then that is your problem The chart of XRP is potentially very negative pic.twitter.com/r7PjhCSK1A — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) August 29, 2025 Market interpretation from other traders Brandt’s post generated additional interpretations from market participants. One X user, Dies Zero, remarked that the XRP chart is giving off a “clear warning.” According to his reading, the structure resembles a descending triangle, with the $2.78 region acting as the critical line in the sand. He noted that a breakdown below this level could open the way for a sharper decline. He added that while a bounce is possible, momentum is currently fading, and unless buyers enter the market decisively, the overall setup appears bearish. Dies Zero concluded by emphasizing the principle of trading the chart rather than relying on emotions. Another X user, ALTucard, responded to the analysis by pointing out the significance of Brandt’s reputation. He suggested that when an experienced market figure of Brandt’s stature issues a negative view on a chart, it is worth taking seriously. ALTucard also highlighted Brandt’s comment about holding strong but flexible opinions, calling it “the most pro advice you can get on this app.” He further remarked that Brandt’s bearish take is likely to cause disappointment among sections of the XRP community . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Technical structure and implications The chart presented by Brandt indicates XRP consolidating after a sharp advance earlier in the summer. The move from under $2.00 to above $3.80 in July has since given way to a downward-sloping pattern, with lower highs forming against a relatively flat support zone. The descending triangle structure, often interpreted as a bearish continuation pattern, becomes particularly significant if the lower boundary is breached. The key level identified at $2.7830 represents the immediate threshold traders are watching. Should price remain above this support, XRP could continue trading within the tightening range, with the potential for a breakout in either direction. However, a decisive close below that point would likely be interpreted as confirmation of weakness, with the possibility of extended downside. Brandt’s long-standing presence in the markets gives weight to his observations, though he remains transparent about the fallibility of any single forecast. His commentary underscores the importance of technical discipline and the willingness to change views as market structures evolve. Traders engaging with XRP will be watching closely how the price behaves around the $2.78 support zone in the coming sessions, as this area could determine whether consolidation continues or if a deeper correction unfolds.

Several asset managers, including Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, Fidelity, Grayscale, CoinShares, and Bitwise, have all submitted amended S-1 registration statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These new filings are not entirely new proposals. Instead, they illuminate prior submissions , demonstrating that issuers continuously dialogue with regulators. Industry observers consider a figure of that magnitude as evidence that something is happening behind the scenes, even if a green light hasn’t been given. The changes are not superficial. Certain filings provide granular details about staking strategies, fee regimes, and redemption mechanisms. For example, the digital asset investment firm Grayscale announced plans to levy a 2.5% fee that would be paid in Solana tokens. Others have specified how in-kind redemptions might work, as one could convert ETF shares into Solana rather than cash. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart recently observed that the flood of filings demonstrates that the SEC is working with several firms concurrently. The increasing number of submissions proves Solana’s ascent into a serious institutional-grade product. It is now viewed as no longer a purely retailer-driven token but one that large managers can’t wait to package for regulated markets. In addition to the historical audit trail, he says that Solana’s GDP data implementation proves that the network has begun to be seen as legitimate beyond finance products. Marinade takes sole staking role as custody and transparency improve One of the most significant updates in Canary Capital’s revised filing is the designation of Marinade Select as the exclusive staking provider for its proposed Solana ETF, marking the first time a U.S. ETF has outlined a clear, institutional-grade staking framework. According to the filing, most of the ETF’s Solana holdings will be staked with Marinade for at least two years. Staking rewards will be auto-compounded after fees, aiding in bumping the fund’s net asset value. This introduces a yield factor to the ETF, and may make it more appealing to investors than pure passive crypto offerings. More specificity has also been outlined on custody arrangements. Assets will be divided between hot and cold wallets, with the custodian exclusively holding private keys. Investors themselves will not handle the tokens, but the filings warn that custody risks, like hacks or system failures, cannot be eliminated. In response to concerns about transparency, the ETF’s website will disclose daily information such as net asset value, full holdings, and whether the shares are trading at a premium or discount. The updated filings also include a discussion of the risks, updated to cover some recent accusations more thoroughly. They also now accommodate the ability that validators fail, the network goes offline, slashing might occur, or the trust may ignore certain forks and airdrops. Staking rules shape Solana ETF prospects While several players are tweaking their proposals and others are in the regulators’ review process, the Solana ETF race is heating up. There will likely be a vested Solana ETF, as most crypto ETFs are pure play, except Ethereum, where the SEC had more comfort, given the amount of physical ETH. The stakes are significant. Approval would signal that investors could get regulated exposure to Solana just as they now can with Bitcoin and Ethereum. These ETFs will pioneer new yield-generating strategies inside a regulated product if staking capabilities are allowed. The push indicates a broader trend for asset managers: cooperation with regulators, not confrontation. Issuers intend to conform to the SEC-led standards by revising and providing clarity. For investors, it signals the possibility that Solana, a risky, experimental blockchain not long ago, is on its way to becoming a mainstream financial asset. The result is still far from certain, but the latest filings suggest clear advances. The SEC’s response will not just impact Solana, but it could also determine the fate of crypto ETFs in the U.S. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Investors are shifting focus toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Early MUTM investors will get an ROI of a minimum of 300% post-listing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already reached over $15.1 million and has achieved 15800+ investors so far. This altcoin has begun drawing notable traction among early adopters and DeFi enthusiasts, sparking attention away from major players like XRP. XRP Forecast: Rally to $5 May Take Time Despite Positive Drivers XRP is trading at $2.99, currently held within a narrow consolidation range just below the $3 resistance level. Analysts acknowledge the token’s bullish potential, tied to waning legal uncertainty, expanding On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) adoption, and possible ETF traction, but caution that renewed pullbacks or lackluster volume could delay a breakout toward the $5 target. As XRP navigates its technical hurdles, investor attention is also shifting toward newer tokens like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in presale round six and is priced at $0.035 per token. Once the round is complete, the price rises 14.29% to $0.04 as demand surges and early adopters show faith in the project. The presale has gathered over 15,800 investors and over $15.1 million in capital, with signals of early traction and investor interest. A USD-Pegged Stablecoin on Ethereum Mutuum Finance will launch a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain as a stable, secure, and transparent form of value storage. The stablecoin will be a stable digital currency for daily transactions, decentralized applications, and long-term portfolio stability. Though algorithmic stablecoins have in the past been exposed to market volatility, this asset shall be created with the aim of eradicating speculation and not being limited by the burden of high volatility. Dual-Lending: Future-Proof DeFi Infrastructure Mutuum Finance involves a two-way lending approach in which automation is mixed with user-initiated intervention to provide a very efficient and interactive decentralized financial system. Peer-to-Contract lending is done using self-executing smart contracts, which facilitate lending and borrowing without the need for intervention on their part. Interest rates compound automatically in real time based on supply and demand within the market, and it is transparent and autonomous. Peer-to-Peer lending takes a step ahead and lets the lenders and borrowers negotiate with each other. Here, the intermediaries are skirted and the users are given more control to negotiate and agree on terms and transactions and grant access and convenience of a platform. Through this dual approach, Mutuum Finance is a safe and future-resistant infrastructure that functions to promote financial inclusion, achieve solid returns, and deliver opportunity to retail and institutional players in equal proportions. Its focus on security, transparency, and scalability serves as the basis for an expansion-led and sustainable DeFi market. Mutuum Finance Provides Stability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has announced the official Bug Bounty Program with a reward pool of $50,000 USDT. Four severities will be chosen by the project: critical, major, minor, and low. The project is also launching a $100,000 giveaway with the project community. 10 investors are in line to receive $10,000 Mutuum Finance tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in presale Stage 6 at $0.035, having raised $15.1M from 15,800+ investors. The price will rise to $0.04 next phase. As XRP consolidates, this project is gaining fast traction with its dual-lending model and stablecoin plans. Join the presale before the price moves up.

Each has carved out a different narrative, appealing to unique segments of the market. Together, they represent the breadth of opportunity heading into the next cycle, with analysts forecasting strong upside for those positioning early. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Best Crypto Presale Pick MAGACOIN FINANCE has officially broken into the top presale lists for August 2025, joining AVAX and PEPE as one of the best cryptos to buy this year. Analysts highlight that forecasts of up to 40x returns are already fueling demand, with presale slots disappearing faster than expected. The project’s inclusion alongside major names underscores its legitimacy credentials that have been bolstered by its audited smart contracts , which separate it from typical meme-driven launches. These factors have helped MAGACOIN FINANCE move beyond speculation, positioning it as a serious presale contender heading into the next bull cycle. Momentum is building rapidly as investors rush to secure allocations before listings go live. Analysts warn that waiting too long could mean missing the narrow entry window, as enthusiasm around MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to grow . AVAX — Enterprise Adoption and Partnerships Avalanche (AVAX) continues to dominate discussions thanks to its ongoing enterprise adoption push. Trading around $39, AVAX has held firm despite wider market turbulence, with analysts eyeing a breakout if it can reclaim resistance at $41. The blockchain’s subnet architecture remains its standout feature, enabling custom chains tailored for specific industries. Recent high-profile partnerships with traditional finance and technology companies have further bolstered confidence. With decentralized applications gaining traction across DeFi and gaming, AVAX is being positioned as a hybrid player—appealing to both institutions and retail investors. Forecasts suggest price targets between $60 and $70 into Q4 2025 if momentum continues. PEPE — Meme Energy Meets Market Cycles PEPE remains a fascinating case study in meme-driven value. Despite intense volatility, the coin has kept a strong foothold among retail communities that prize viral branding and cultural stickiness. Analysts argue that meme tokens like PEPE thrive in bullish upswings, and if market sentiment improves, PEPE could deliver another round of oversized returns. For now, trading action has been choppy, but its engaged user base ensures liquidity and visibility. Many market watchers believe PEPE has the potential to remain a breakout contender in the meme coin space, particularly as newer investors continue to chase high-risk, high-reward narratives. Final Outlook — Three Paths to Growth Taken together, AVAX, PEPE, and MAGACOIN FINANCE represent three very different approaches to capturing investor capital in 2025. AVAX focuses on scalability and partnerships, PEPE thrives on retail engagement, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is defining itself as a legitimate, audited, and community-driven presale with some of the highest ROI projections of the year. For investors weighing where to allocate capital, the choice may depend on risk appetite. Those seeking steady institutional-grade growth may lean toward AVAX, meme enthusiasts may continue to bet on PEPE, while opportunistic buyers looking for high-upside presale plays are increasingly turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE.

This anonymous investor recently deposited a staggering $11.68 million in USDC onto the Hyperliquid platform, with the clear intention of acquiring Solana (SOL). Such large-scale transactions often signal notable shifts or strong convictions within the market, making this particular move by the Solana whale highly newsworthy and impactful for the Solana ecosystem. What Just Happened: A Solana Whale’s Bold Move? Over the past eight hours, an unidentified but undeniably powerful market participant, often referred to as a “whale” due to their immense capital, channeled 11.68 million USDC into Hyperliquid. Onchainlens first reported this significant deposit. This wasn’t just a deposit; it was a strategic allocation aimed directly at accumulating Solana’s native token, SOL. So far, this prominent Solana whale has successfully purchased 28,390 SOL. Interestingly, their buying spree isn’t over. Reports indicate that the investor still has substantial outstanding buy orders, suggesting a continued bullish outlook on SOL. This sustained buying pressure from a single entity can certainly influence market sentiment and price action, creating a ripple effect across the entire crypto space. Why Hyperliquid? Understanding the Solana Whale’s Platform Choice The choice of Hyperliquid for such a massive transaction is also noteworthy. Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual exchange known for its high liquidity and low latency. Whales often opt for platforms that can handle large orders without significant slippage, ensuring their trades execute efficiently and at favorable prices. This decision by the Solana whale underscores the platform’s growing prominence among serious traders and institutional players. Deep Liquidity: This is essential for executing large buy orders without moving the market against the buyer, preserving value. Decentralized Nature: Offers a level of privacy and control that centralized exchanges might not always provide, appealing to large entities. Efficiency: Fast execution speeds are crucial when dealing with millions of dollars, minimizing exposure to market volatility. Understanding why this particular Solana whale chose Hyperliquid gives us insight into their operational strategy and priorities, highlighting the features they value most in a trading environment. The Impact of a Solana Whale on Market Dynamics When a large investor, or a “whale,” makes such a significant move, it rarely goes unnoticed. Their actions can have a ripple effect across the entire market, influencing both sentiment and price. For Solana, this deposit could be interpreted in several ways: Increased Confidence: A major investor putting millions into SOL can bolster confidence among smaller holders and potential buyers, validating the asset. Potential Price Catalyst: Sustained buying pressure, especially from a single large entity, can contribute to upward price momentum for SOL. Liquidity Shift: Moving such a large sum of USDC into a trading pair effectively increases the liquidity available for SOL purchases on that platform, facilitating further trading. However, it is important to remember that while a Solana whale ‘s actions are influential, they are not always indicative of future market performance. The crypto market remains volatile, and careful analysis is always recommended before making investment decisions. What Does This Solana Whale Activity Mean for SOL? This substantial investment by the anonymous Solana whale suggests a strong belief in Solana’s long-term potential or a strategic short-term play. It highlights the continued institutional and large-scale investor interest in the Solana ecosystem. As the whale continues to execute their outstanding buy orders, we could see further price action for SOL. For everyday investors, observing these large movements can provide valuable context. It prompts questions about Solana’s fundamentals, its ecosystem growth, and its competitive position in the broader crypto landscape. Ultimately, this move adds another layer of intrigue to the dynamic world of cryptocurrency investments, showcasing the power of significant capital. In conclusion, the recent $11.7 million USDC deposit by an anonymous Solana whale on Hyperliquid to acquire SOL is a powerful signal. It demonstrates significant capital flowing into the Solana ecosystem and highlights the strategic decisions made by major market players. As this investor continues their buying, the crypto community will be watching closely for the ensuing market reactions. This event underscores the vibrant and often unpredictable nature of the digital asset space, offering a glimpse into the forces shaping its future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

On-Chain Data Points to Explosive Cycle Peak,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-next-stop-183k-on-chain-data-points-to-explosive-cycle-peak/,"Bitcoin remains under pressure after sliding from its all-time high above $124,000 earlier this month. At the time of writing, the asset trades at $110,219, reflecting a weekly decline of about 2% and a broader drop of more than 10% from its peak. Despite the correction, analysts continue to examine on-chain data for signs of the market’s next direction. Among the latest insights, CryptoQuant contributor CryptoOnchain highlighted the significance of the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Price Bands, a long-observed metric used to assess market cycles. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s current positioning above key support bands suggests the uptrend remains intact, but with room for both continued growth and potential volatility. Related Reading: JPMorgan Says Bitcoin Is ‘Undervalued’—But By How Much? MVRV Price Bands Point to Potential Cycle Top The MVRV Price Bands model has historically been used to identify both bottoms and tops in Bitcoin’s long-term cycles. CryptoOnchain noted that the model’s lower band, often referred to as the “floor price,” reliably marked market lows in 2018 and 2022, while the upper band highlighted cycle peaks such as 2017 and 2021. Currently, Bitcoin’s trading price is positioned well above the model’s floor price of around $52,300 and its median support level of approximately $91,600. This indicates what the analyst referred to as a “healthy uptrend” with persistent activity from long-term holders. Importantly, the model’s projected ceiling price suggests that Bitcoin could reach as high as $183,000 by August 2025, assuming historical trends remain consistent. The analyst emphasized that while the ceiling level offers a potential target, traders should monitor the mid-price band for signs of weakening momentum. A decisive move below this level could indicate a shift in trend, raising the possibility of deeper corrections even within a bullish cycle. Bitcoin Cost Basis Trends Reflect Market Behavior A separate analysis by CryptoQuant contributor BorisD provided additional context by examining the cost basis of Bitcoin investors on Binance. Data shows that the average deposit address cost basis on Binance has risen from $44,000 earlier this year to $62,000. This suggests that investors are actively accumulating at higher price zones, particularly around Bitcoin’s recent peaks. New whale investors, defined as large-scale buyers with significant holdings, currently hold an average cost basis of $108,000, which is emerging as a key support level. According to BorisD, this level could serve as the foundation for the next leg of upward momentum if demand persists. At the same time, miner-linked wallets showed a slight reduction in their average cost basis from $58,000 to $54,000, hinting at modest selling pressure from mining operations. Related Reading: Bitcoin And The September Curse: Can This Time Be Different? Long-term holders, meanwhile, remain well positioned, with a cost basis near $40,000. This region has historically been considered a strong accumulation zone, providing resilience during broader market corrections. BorisD pointed out that cost basis levels often track closely with price behavior and can act as both support and resistance during volatile swings.

Just months after a staggering $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI , a key partner in its ambitious Meta AI endeavors, cracks are already beginning to show. For those following the volatile cryptocurrency markets, the rapid shifts in the tech landscape offer a parallel narrative of high stakes and uncertain outcomes. Meta AI’s Billion-Dollar Bet: What Went Wrong? Meta’s significant investment in Scale AI, bringing on CEO Alexandr Wang and several top executives to run Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), was touted as a pivotal move to bolster its Meta AI capabilities. This strategic alliance was designed to accelerate Meta’s journey toward AI superintelligence. However, the initial promise seems to be fading. One notable departure is Ruben Mayer, former Senior Vice President of GenAI Product and Operations at Scale AI, who left Meta after just two months. Mayer, who oversaw AI data operations teams and reported directly to Wang, was not integrated into TBD Labs, the core unit responsible for building AI superintelligence. This raises immediate questions about the strategic alignment and the effectiveness of such a massive capital injection. The Fraying Threads of the Scale AI Partnership The relationship between Meta and Scale AI appears more complex than initially perceived. Beyond executive departures, there are significant concerns regarding data quality that threaten to unravel the Scale AI partnership . Sources indicate that researchers within Meta’s elite TBD Labs view Scale AI’s data as subpar. This perception is particularly striking given Meta’s multi-billion-dollar investment. Historically, Scale AI built its business on a crowdsourcing model that utilized a large, low-cost workforce for simple data annotation tasks. While effective for earlier AI models, modern, sophisticated AI now demands high-quality, expert-annotated data from specialists such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists. Competitors like Surge AI and Mercor, built on a foundation of highly paid, specialized talent from the outset, have been rapidly gaining ground, challenging Scale AI’s market position. Indeed, Meta, it turns out, is not putting all its eggs in one basket, actively working with these very competitors for its data needs. Why Quality Matters: The Role of AI Data Vendors The reliance on multiple AI data vendors highlights a critical challenge in the development of advanced AI: the paramount importance of data quality. While Meta has been working with Mercor and Surge AI even before TBD Labs was established, the continued and deepening reliance on these alternatives, post-investment in Scale AI, underscores a fundamental issue. High-quality data is the lifeblood of sophisticated AI models. If the foundational data is flawed or insufficient, even the most advanced algorithms will struggle to perform optimally. This situation puts Scale AI in a precarious position, especially after losing major clients like OpenAI and Google shortly after Meta’s investment, which led to 200 layoffs in its data labeling business. The market is clearly shifting towards vendors who can consistently deliver superior, expert-driven data, proving that even a massive investment cannot override the demand for quality. The Intense Battle for AI Talent Wars The internal dynamics at Meta’s AI unit have become increasingly chaotic, mirroring the broader AI talent wars gripping the tech industry. Bringing in top researchers from OpenAI and Scale AI, including Alexandr Wang, was intended to accelerate Meta’s AI ambitions. However, new talent has reportedly expressed frustration with navigating Meta’s corporate bureaucracy. Simultaneously, Meta’s existing GenAI team has seen its scope diminished, leading to a wave of departures. High-profile researchers like Rishabh Agarwal, Director of product management for generative AI Chaya Nayak, and research engineer Rohan Varma have announced their exits. Agarwal’s statement, citing Mark Zuckerberg’s own advice about taking risks, speaks volumes about the internal unrest and the allure of more agile environments. The ability to attract and, more importantly, retain top-tier AI talent is proving to be a formidable challenge for Meta, as researchers seek environments where they can make the greatest impact. Navigating Zuckerberg AI Strategy Amidst Internal Turmoil Mark Zuckerberg’s aggressive push into AI, following the lackluster launch of Llama 4, aimed to quickly catch up with industry leaders like OpenAI and Google. This involved striking major deals, recruiting top talent from rivals, and acquiring AI startups such as Play AI and WaveForms AI. The appointment of Alexandr Wang, not a traditional AI researcher by background, to lead MSL was an unconventional but calculated move, potentially aimed at leveraging Wang’s founder experience and network to attract more talent. However, the current turmoil suggests that even a massive investment and strategic hires might not be enough to smoothly execute the ambitious Zuckerberg AI strategy . The company is investing billions in data center buildouts, like the $50 billion Hyperion in Louisiana, to power these ambitions, yet internal friction and talent retention issues persist. The question remains: can Meta stabilize its AI operations and effectively harness this talent to launch its next-generation AI model by year-end? The journey to AI superintelligence is proving to be a treacherous one for the tech giant. The narrative surrounding Meta’s investment in Scale AI is one of ambitious vision meeting complex realities. What began as a strategic alliance, intended to solidify Meta’s position in the AI race, is now experiencing significant strain. From executive departures and data quality disputes to intense internal talent churn and the broader challenges of integrating diverse corporate cultures, the path to AI supremacy is fraught with obstacles. The ability of Meta to overcome these hurdles, refine its partnerships, and foster a cohesive, innovative environment will be critical in determining its future success in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. The unraveling of this key partnership highlights the intricate dance of technology, talent, and strategic execution in the pursuit of artificial superintelligence.

50890668,569587,1756519246,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50890668.jpeg,Bitcoin To Hit $1 Million? Eric Trump Shares Optimistic Outlook On Cryptocurrency,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-to-hit-1-million-eric-trump-shares/,"At the Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong, Eric Trump, the son of President Donald Trump, predicted that the market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) could soar to $1 million within the next few years, which could represent a major 825% increase from current levels. Eric Trump Bullish On Bitcoin As reported by Reuters earlier on Friday, during a panel discussion, Eric Trump emphasized China’s significant influence in the cryptocurrency sector, referring to the country as “a hell of a power” in driving crypto innovation. Nevertheless, China still seems far from the US’s role in adopting cryptocurrencies, as the Asian country continues to face significant restrictions on operating digital assets. Despite these restrictions by regulators since 2021, Mainland China is reportedly exploring yuan-backed stablecoins to enhance its global usage. Meanwhile, Hong Kong has taken steps to establish itself as a digital asset hub, passing a stablecoin bill in May. On the other hand, under President Trump’s leadership, the United States has proposed establishing a Bitcoin reserve and passing three key crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act, which could accelerate the use of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies in everyday transactions. This has significantly contributed to the broader market’s price surge with Bitcoin reaching a new record of $124,000 on August 14, and Ethereum (ETH) also reaching an all-time high (ATH) just below the $5,000 mark last weekend. Despite the cryptocurrency’s recent dip toward $108,000, Eric Trump confidently stated, “There’s no question Bitcoin hits $1 million,” citing strong institutional demand and the cryptocurrency’s limited supply as key factors supporting his optimism. Crypto Talks Between Trump And Xi Jinping? When asked if President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping might soon discuss cryptocurrencies, Eric Trump suggested that both nations likely possess a deeper understanding of digital currencies than most other countries. He highlighted the support the Bitcoin community has shown for his father, expressing hope that such backing would yield significant returns for both the community and the Trump family. In recent months, the Trump family has ventured into various cryptocurrency initiatives, including the launch of a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, a stablecoin, a Bitcoin mining operation, and the applications of crypto-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Notably, American Bitcoin, a new crypto miner founded in collaboration with Hut 8 and backed by Eric Trump and his brother, Donald Trump Jr., is preparing for a Nasdaq listing next month. Reuters also reported that during the same conference, crypto exchange Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) remarked that the US is setting a precedent for progressive regulations that could prompt other governments to take similar actions.

In a development that has captured widespread attention, a substantial amount of Ethereum (ETH) found its way to Coinbase Prime, sparking immediate discussions about market sentiment and potential future price action. This event highlights the influential power of large capital movements in the volatile cryptocurrency landscape. Who is This Key ETH/BTC Investor Making Waves? Reports from AmberCN indicate that James Fickel, a well-known ETH/BTC investor , recently deposited a staggering 39,800 ETH to Coinbase Prime. This massive deposit, valued at approximately $172 million, occurred just hours ago, drawing immediate scrutiny from market watchers. Such large movements by individual investors, often referred to as ‘whales,’ frequently signal potential shifts in market dynamics and deserve close attention. Understanding Fickel’s history provides crucial context to his latest actions. Last year, this same ETH/BTC investor faced a considerable setback, incurring a loss of around 20,600 ETH, valued at approximately $90 million at the time, from an ETH/BTC long position. This previous experience adds an intriguing layer to his current strategy, prompting widespread speculation about his intentions and what he plans next. Why Coinbase Prime? Unpacking the Institutional Choice for an ETH/BTC Investor When an ETH/BTC investor of Fickel’s caliber moves such a substantial amount of cryptocurrency, the choice of platform is often deliberate. Coinbase Prime is not just any exchange; it is a premium platform specifically designed for institutional clients, offering a suite of advanced services: Enhanced Security: Institutional-grade custody solutions provide a higher level of security for large asset holdings, crucial for substantial investments. OTC Trading: For transactions of this magnitude, an over-the-counter (OTC) desk is often preferred. OTC trades allow large blocks of assets to be bought or sold without directly impacting the public order books, thus minimizing market disruption and potential slippage. Advanced Tools: Access to sophisticated trading tools, analytics, and dedicated support caters to the complex needs of major investors and active ETH/BTC investors . This choice suggests a highly calculated move, likely aimed at executing a strategy with precision and discretion, rather than a simple retail transaction. What Does a Massive ETH Deposit Mean for the Market and Other ETH/BTC Investors? When an ETH/BTC investor like James Fickel makes such a significant deposit, several possibilities emerge, each with different implications for the broader market: Potential Selling Pressure: One immediate interpretation is that the investor might be preparing to sell a portion or all of their ETH holdings. Moving funds to an exchange often precedes a sale, especially if the investor aims to offload a large volume without significantly impacting spot market prices, potentially through OTC channels. This could lead to increased supply and downward price pressure. Strategic Rebalancing: Alternatively, the deposit could be part of a broader portfolio rebalancing strategy. Given his history, the ETH/BTC investor might be adjusting his exposure to different assets, perhaps reducing ETH to increase BTC holdings, or positioning for a new ETH/BTC trade. Preparing for New Opportunities: It’s also possible that the funds are being positioned for new investment opportunities, staking, or derivatives trading on the platform. Institutional platforms offer a range of sophisticated financial products that require on-exchange liquidity. Lessons for Aspiring ETH/BTC Investors: Navigating Whale Moves This situation offers valuable insights for both seasoned and aspiring ETH/BTC investors : Risk Management is Crucial: Fickel’s previous $90 million loss underscores the inherent risks in highly leveraged positions and the extreme volatility of crypto markets. Always prioritize robust risk management strategies. Interpret On-Chain Data: Learning to interpret large deposits, withdrawals, and other on-chain data can offer an edge in understanding potential market directions. Tools exist to track such whale movements, providing valuable context for an ETH/BTC investor . Avoid FOMO/FUD: While whale movements are important, it’s vital to conduct your own research and not solely base decisions on the actions of others. Market sentiment can shift rapidly, and independent analysis is key. Ultimately, the latest move by this prominent ETH/BTC investor could be a calculated maneuver after previous losses, a simple liquidity management decision, or a precursor to a major market play. The crypto world watches keenly to see how this substantial deposit will unfold and what its true implications are for the broader market. In conclusion, James Fickel’s $172 million ETH deposit to Coinbase Prime is a significant event that highlights the ongoing activities of major players in the crypto space. Whether it signals an impending sale, a strategic rebalance, or preparation for new ventures, such large movements underscore the dynamic nature of the market and the importance of staying informed. For any ETH/BTC investor , understanding these high-stakes actions can provide valuable perspective on potential market shifts.

This veteran market participant strategically offloaded a significant portion of their Bitcoin holdings to acquire a substantial amount of Ethereum, signaling a potentially pivotal shift in their portfolio strategy and perhaps the broader market sentiment. Unpacking the Strategic Ethereum Investment According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, this experienced investor sold approximately 2,000 BTC, valued at an impressive $221 million. Immediately following this sale, they proceeded to purchase 49,850 ETH, which was worth roughly $219 million, all within a rapid 12-hour window.

Such a large-scale Ethereum investment from an established figure often sparks considerable discussion and analysis within the crypto community. Why This Bitcoin OG Made Such a Significant Shift? The decision by an early Bitcoin adopter to rebalance their portfolio so heavily towards Ethereum raises intriguing questions. While the exact motivations remain private, several factors could influence such a strategic pivot: Ethereum’s Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum continues to be the backbone for a vast array of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFTs. Staking Rewards: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (the Merge), investors can earn passive income through staking their ETH. Scalability Solutions: Ongoing developments, including Layer 2 solutions, are addressing Ethereum’s scalability challenges, promising a more efficient network. Diversification Strategy: Even OGs recognize the importance of diversifying assets, especially as different cryptocurrencies mature and offer unique value propositions. This substantial Ethereum investment could indicate a strong belief in the network’s long-term growth trajectory and its foundational role in the decentralized web. Understanding the Market Implications of Large-Scale Ethereum Investment When an investor of this caliber makes such a significant move, it often carries weight, potentially influencing other market participants. It suggests a perceived undervalued state of Ethereum or a strong conviction in its future performance relative to Bitcoin.

A groundbreaking collaboration, the OKX Wallet campaign , has captured the attention of over 2.3 million unique addresses, marking a significant milestone in decentralized finance (DeFi) engagement. This massive turnout highlights a growing appetite for innovative reward programs and accessible blockchain experiences. What Makes the OKX Wallet Campaign a Game-Changer? This remarkable achievement stems from a joint effort between Momentum, a Sui-based ve(3,3) decentralized exchange (DEX), and OKX Wallet. Their combined campaign, hosted on OKX Wallet’s popular Cryptopedia platform, was designed as a Pre-Token Generation Event (TGE) rewards program. This strategy allowed participants to engage with the Momentum DEX and earn rewards before its official token launch, creating substantial early interest. Massive Participation: Over 2.3 million participating addresses joined the OKX Wallet campaign . Significant Trading Volume: The initiative generated an impressive $1.3 billion in trading volume. Strategic Collaboration: Momentum’s innovative ve(3,3) DEX model on Sui combined with OKX Wallet’s broad reach and Cryptopedia platform. These figures are not just numbers; they represent a powerful validation of the strategy behind the OKX Wallet campaign . They demonstrate that well-structured reward programs, especially those integrated into user-friendly platforms like Cryptopedia, can attract a vast audience and drive real economic activity within the crypto space. Driving DeFi Adoption: The Impact of the OKX Wallet Campaign The success of this campaign extends beyond its immediate numbers. It serves as a compelling case study for how to effectively onboard new users into the often-complex world of DeFi. By offering tangible rewards for early engagement, the OKX Wallet campaign lowered the barrier to entry for many, encouraging exploration of the Sui ecosystem and decentralized exchanges. Pre-TGE reward programs are becoming increasingly popular because they create a win-win scenario. Users gain early access to potential future value and learn about new protocols, while projects like Momentum build a strong, engaged community from the ground up. This approach fosters loyalty and provides crucial liquidity and testing for new platforms before their full public launch. Moreover, the ease of use provided by OKX Wallet’s Cryptopedia platform played a pivotal role, simplifying the process for millions. How Did the OKX Wallet Campaign Achieve Such Momentum? Several factors contributed to the unprecedented success of this particular OKX Wallet campaign . First, the choice of platform was crucial; Cryptopedia offers a curated environment where users can discover and participate in promising new crypto projects. Second, the clear and attractive reward structure of the Pre-TGE program provided a strong incentive. Participants understood what they stood to gain, which fueled widespread adoption. Furthermore, Momentum’s ve(3,3) DEX model, known for its efficient liquidity provision and incentive mechanisms, likely resonated with DeFi enthusiasts. The combination of a novel protocol with a highly accessible platform proved to be a powerful magnet. This initiative showcases the power of strategic partnerships and user-centric design in the competitive crypto landscape. Looking Ahead: The Future After This Successful OKX Wallet Campaign What does this mean for the future of crypto campaigns and the broader DeFi ecosystem? The massive participation in the OKX Wallet campaign sets a new benchmark for engagement. It suggests that future projects will increasingly leverage accessible platforms and innovative reward structures to attract and retain users. For the Sui blockchain, this campaign highlights its growing prominence as a robust platform for decentralized applications. While the success is undeniable, challenges remain. Sustaining such high levels of engagement post-TGE and ensuring the long-term security and stability of new protocols are ongoing tasks. However, the blueprint established by this campaign offers valuable insights for developers and marketers alike, proving that with the right strategy, crypto can truly go mainstream.

This marked a crucial turning point, ending a five-day streak of consistent inflows and drawing keen attention from investors and analysts alike. This development signals a momentary pause in the bullish momentum previously observed, prompting a closer look into the underlying factors. What Triggered the Recent Spot Bitcoin ETFs Outflow? The substantial net outflow of $126.69 million on August 29th, as reported by TraderT, was a complex interplay of various fund movements. While some funds continued to attract capital, others saw significant withdrawals, leading to the overall negative balance. This collective action paints a picture of shifting investor sentiment. Here’s a breakdown of the key movements: BlackRock’s IBIT : Managed to attract a healthy inflow of $24.61 million. WisdomTree’s BTCW : Also saw positive interest, bringing in $2.3 million. However, these positive contributions were ultimately overshadowed by larger outflows from other prominent funds: Fidelity’s FBTC : Experienced a considerable outflow of $66.2 million. Ark Invest’s ARKB : Saw an even larger withdrawal of $72.1 million. Grayscale’s GBTC : Contributed to the net outflow with $15.3 million. These figures demonstrate that even within a single trading day, the performance of individual Spot Bitcoin ETFs can vary widely, influencing the broader market sentiment. Why Do Spot Bitcoin ETFs Matter for Investors? Understanding the role of Spot Bitcoin ETFs is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto market. A Spot Bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. This makes it an attractive option for traditional investors who might be wary of direct crypto ownership or the complexities of managing digital wallets. These ETFs are particularly significant because they bridge the gap between traditional finance and the nascent digital asset space. The introduction of these regulated investment vehicles has brought new capital and increased legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class. Consequently, the net flows into and out of these ETFs are often seen as a barometer for institutional and mainstream investor interest in Bitcoin. Navigating the Challenges and Opportunities with Spot Bitcoin ETFs While Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer significant opportunities for broader market participation, they also come with inherent challenges. The volatility of Bitcoin itself means that these ETFs can experience rapid price swings, leading to both substantial gains and losses. Investors must consider their risk tolerance carefully before engaging with these products. On the opportunity front, the regulated nature of these ETFs provides a level of security and oversight that might be absent in direct crypto investments. Furthermore, they offer diversification benefits for traditional portfolios. However, the recent outflow serves as a reminder that market sentiment can shift quickly, influenced by macro-economic factors, regulatory news, or even broader market corrections. What Could This Spot Bitcoin ETFs Outflow Signal? A single day of net outflow, while noteworthy, does not necessarily indicate a long-term bearish trend for Spot Bitcoin ETFs or Bitcoin itself. Instead, it could be a normal market correction, profit-taking by some investors after a period of gains, or a reallocation of capital across different asset classes. For example, the previous five days of inflows suggest a generally positive sentiment leading up to this point. It is essential for investors to look beyond daily fluctuations and consider the broader trends. Continuous monitoring of these flows, alongside other market indicators, provides a more comprehensive understanding of the market’s health. Long-term accumulation trends, institutional adoption rates, and macroeconomic stability often play a larger role in determining the sustained performance of Bitcoin and its related investment products. The recent $126.7 million net outflow from U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs on August 29th certainly caught the market’s attention, ending a period of consistent inflows. While funds like BlackRock’s IBIT continued to see interest, larger withdrawals from Fidelity and Ark Invest shifted the overall balance. This event highlights the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the evolving landscape of institutional investment. For investors, it underscores the importance of staying informed and understanding that market movements are often a blend of various factors, from individual fund performance to broader economic sentiment. Keeping an eye on these flows provides valuable insights into the pulse of Bitcoin adoption in traditional finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF? A Spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without needing to buy, store, or manage the actual cryptocurrency. 2. Why is a net outflow significant for Spot Bitcoin ETFs? A net outflow indicates that more money is being withdrawn from these funds than invested, which can signal a shift in investor sentiment, potential profit-taking, or a reallocation of capital away from Bitcoin-related assets. 3. Which funds experienced significant outflows on August 29th? On August 29th, Fidelity’s FBTC, Ark Invest’s ARKB, and Grayscale’s GBTC recorded the largest outflows, collectively contributing to the overall net negative figure. 4. Does a single day of outflow indicate a long-term trend? Not necessarily. A single day’s outflow could be a normal market correction, short-term profit-taking, or a reaction to specific news. Investors should analyze broader trends and multiple data points to determine long-term market direction. 5. How do Spot Bitcoin ETFs differ from directly owning Bitcoin? Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a regulated and often simpler way to invest in Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts, avoiding the complexities of crypto wallets and exchanges. However, direct ownership gives you full control over your assets and potential staking/lending opportunities not available through an ETF.

With MAGACOIN Finance still priced under $0.0005, traders are eyeing it as a strategic entry with upside that could rival or even outperform others on the list. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Top Altcoin to Buy Under $5 Among all these names, MAGACOIN Finance is catching attention as the altcoin that could outperform them all . Still priced under $0.0005, analysts describe it as a safe and strategic entry point for those looking beyond the established giants. What makes MAGACOIN stand out is its positioning as both meme coin and DeFi utility asset. It combines appeal with legitimacy, supported by audits and verified infrastructure. Analysts suggest it can realistically deliver a 15x move as adoption builds. For those looking for the best crypto to buy under $5, MAGACOIN Finance offers a unique blend of affordability and structured growth potential. Ripple (XRP) Gaining Fresh Traction After SEC Case Ripple’s XRP has regained a strong foothold in the market after its long-standing legal battle with the SEC reached a conclusion. In 2023, a court ruling clarified that XRP sales on public exchanges are not securities, and by August 2025, both Ripple and the SEC dropped further appeals. This resolution has cleared a path for institutional adoption and restored investor confidence. Currently trading at around $3, XRP maintains a market cap near $179 billion, placing it among the top three crypto assets. Daily volumes exceeding $6 billion underline its liquidity, making it more suitable for large-scale use. Ripple’s payment network, now rebranded as Ripple Payments, covers more than 90 markets worldwide and integrates with fiat, stablecoins, and XRP. XRP’s blockchain has also evolved technically, introducing automated market makers (AMMs) in 2024 to deepen liquidity pools. Adoption in cross-border payment corridors, such as Japan–Philippines and regions in Africa, aligns with the global remittance market—valued at over $685 billion. Analysts forecast XRP at $5.25 by 2030, though industry voices like Bitwise and Telgaon predict far higher valuations. The clarity and ongoing adoption keep XRP firmly in the spotlight as one of the best crypto buys under $5. Cardano (ADA) Holds Long-Term Appeal Cardano (ADA) trades under $1, currently priced at $0.86, but continues to rank among the top smart contract platforms. Its layered architecture and peer-reviewed development process give it a reputation for being built with long-term resilience. Price predictions for 2025 see ADA averaging $3.45, with some forecasting highs above $5. This outlook positions ADA as one of the top five crypto buys under $5. For traders who prefer a fundamentally driven project with steady upgrades, Cardano remains a consistent choice in the altcoin space. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Expands Its Ecosystem Shiba Inu (SHIB), once seen only as a meme coin, is now trading at $0.00001249 while actively growing its ecosystem. Its Layer-2 solution, Shibarium, increases transaction throughput, while ShibaSwap, NFTs, and the Shib Metaverse create more utility. Forecasts project SHIB reaching as high as $0.00006 in 2025, with some estimates suggesting 3x to 5x growth from current levels. Community sentiment and long-term holder activity continue to support its place among the best crypto buys under $5. Sui (SUI) Gains Attention in Layer-1 Race Sui (SUI) is gaining traction as a Layer-1 blockchain built for speed and throughput. Its design has drawn attention from both developers and institutions, placing it alongside ADA and XRP in lists of top altcoins to watch under $5. Although priced modestly, its high-performance architecture and adoption by builders give SUI a place in this top 5 category. Conclusion: How to Position in This Market Ripple, Cardano, SHIB, SUI, and MAGACOIN Finance all offer entry under $5, but MAGACOIN’s current low price gives it an edge for those looking at asymmetric opportunities. With market attention turning to altcoins, early positioning could prove rewarding.

After a promising streak of inflows, these innovative investment vehicles experienced a significant net outflow, catching the keen attention of market observers and investors alike. Understanding these movements is crucial for anyone navigating the evolving digital asset landscape. What Triggered the Recent Spot ETH ETFs Outflow? On August 29, U.S. Spot ETH ETFs collectively recorded a total net outflow of a substantial $164.6 million. This figure, according to data from TraderT, marks a notable shift, breaking a streak of seven consecutive trading days that saw net inflows. The sudden reversal has prompted many to examine the underlying market sentiment. The outflows were primarily driven by several key players in the market: Grayscale’s Mini ETH fund: Led the charge with $61.3 million in outflows. Fidelity’s FETH: Saw a significant $51 million exit. Grayscale’s ETHE: Contributed $28.6 million to the total outflow. Bitwise’s ETHW: Experienced $23.7 million in withdrawals. Crucially, no spot ETH ETFs registered any inflows for the entire day. This absence of new capital entering the market alongside substantial withdrawals highlights a distinct period of investor caution or profit-taking. Decoding the Market: What Are Spot ETH ETFs? For those new to the concept, Spot ETH ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Ethereum, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency. They aim to simplify access to the crypto market for traditional investors, providing a regulated and familiar investment vehicle. The significance of these funds cannot be overstated. Inflows typically signal growing institutional and retail investor confidence in Ethereum and the broader crypto market. Conversely, outflows, like the one observed, can suggest a decrease in demand, a shift in investor strategy, or a reaction to broader economic or regulatory concerns. Therefore, monitoring these flows offers valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends for Ethereum. Implications for Ethereum and Spot ETH ETFs Investors A single day’s net outflow, even a significant one, does not necessarily signal a long-term bearish trend for Ethereum or Spot ETH ETFs . However, it serves as a critical data point for investors to consider. It could reflect: Profit-taking: Investors might be cashing out after the recent period of inflows. Market uncertainty: Broader economic concerns or upcoming regulatory decisions could lead to caution. Rebalancing portfolios: Institutional investors often adjust their holdings. For investors, understanding these dynamics is key. While short-term fluctuations are common, paying attention to sustained trends in Spot ETH ETFs flows can offer a clearer picture of market health. It emphasizes the importance of a long-term perspective when investing in volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Navigating Future Trends in Spot ETH ETFs What should investors watch for next? The landscape of Spot ETH ETFs remains dynamic. Future trends will likely be shaped by several factors: Regulatory developments: Further clarity from regulators could either bolster or dampen investor enthusiasm. Broader crypto market performance: Ethereum’s price often moves in correlation with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. Institutional adoption: Continued interest from large financial institutions will be crucial for sustained growth. The recent outflow is a reminder that the path to mainstream adoption for crypto investment products is not always linear. However, the very existence and trading activity of these ETFs highlight a growing acceptance and demand for regulated crypto exposure. Summary: The recent $164.6 million net outflow from U.S. Spot ETH ETFs on August 29 marked a notable shift after a period of consistent inflows. Led by major funds like Grayscale and Fidelity, this event saw zero new capital entering the market. While a single day’s data point, it underscores the dynamic nature of crypto investments and the need for investors to stay informed about market sentiment and broader trends. The journey of these innovative financial products continues to unfold, offering both opportunities and challenges for those looking to engage with Ethereum through regulated channels.

It details a massive USDT transfer of 200,000,000 tokens, a transaction valued at approximately $200 million. This significant sum moved from an unknown wallet directly to Galaxy Digital, a prominent player in the digital asset space. Such large-scale movements often signal important shifts and strategic plays within the market, prompting keen observers to analyze their potential implications. Unpacking the Massive USDT Transfer to Galaxy Digital Whale Alert, a widely recognized blockchain tracking service, was the first to report this substantial transaction. The movement involved 200 million Tether (USDT) tokens, which are stablecoins pegged to the US dollar. This isn’t just a routine transfer; it represents a considerable chunk of capital in the volatile cryptocurrency market. The recipient, Galaxy Digital, is a well-established financial services and investment management firm dedicated to digital assets. Their involvement immediately raises questions about the underlying purpose of such a large influx of stablecoins. This massive USDT transfer could indicate various strategic moves, from enhancing liquidity to preparing for new investments. Who Initiated This Mysterious USDT Transfer? One of the most intriguing aspects of this event is the sender: an “unknown wallet.” This designation typically refers to a cryptocurrency address that isn’t publicly linked to a known individual, institution, or exchange. While the identity remains a mystery, the sheer volume strongly suggests the involvement of a “whale.” A crypto whale is an individual or entity holding a significant amount of cryptocurrency, capable of influencing market dynamics with their trades. Understanding the motivations behind such a large USDT transfer from an anonymous source is often a key piece of the puzzle for market analysts and investors alike. What Does This Mean for Galaxy Digital and the Market? Galaxy Digital’s receipt of 200 million USDT could serve several strategic purposes. This substantial inflow could significantly enhance their operational capacity and market influence. Consider these potential uses: Boosting Liquidity: The funds could increase Galaxy Digital’s capacity to facilitate large trades or provide capital for their various ventures. Strategic Investments: They might be preparing to deploy this capital into other digital assets, promising blockchain projects, or emerging crypto technologies. Client Onboarding: The transfer could be related to managing funds for institutional clients who are increasingly entering the cryptocurrency market. Operational Expansion: It might also fund internal operations, support new product development, or expand their global services. This kind of capital injection positions Galaxy Digital to make significant moves in the market. Navigating the Broader Market Implications of Large USDT Transfers Large stablecoin movements, especially a massive USDT transfer of this magnitude, are always closely monitored by the crypto community. They can often be precursors to significant market activity or indicate shifts in sentiment. If Galaxy Digital intends to use this USDT to acquire other cryptocurrencies, it could potentially create upward price pressure on those assets. Conversely, if the stablecoins are being held for future off-ramping, it might signal a different, more cautious market sentiment. However, it’s also important to remember that USDT transfers are common for activities like arbitrage, market making, and general liquidity management, which don’t always indicate a specific directional market move. The 200,000,000 USDT transfer to Galaxy Digital stands as a compelling event in the crypto landscape. While the “unknown wallet” adds a layer of mystery, the destination provides a clear signal of ongoing institutional activity and strategic maneuvering. This movement underscores the growing sophistication and sheer scale of digital asset transactions, urging market participants to remain vigilant and informed about these significant shifts. Frequently Asked Questions About the Massive USDT Transfer What is USDT? USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin whose value is pegged to the US dollar. This means 1 USDT is intended to always be worth $1, making it a popular choice for traders to move funds quickly without the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. What is Galaxy Digital? Galaxy Digital is a diversified financial services and investment management company specializing in the digital asset, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology sectors. It provides services like asset management, trading, and investment banking. Why is a 200,000,000 USDT transfer significant? A transfer of this size, approximately $200 million, is considered a “whale” movement. It signifies a large amount of capital being repositioned, which can have various implications for market liquidity, sentiment, and potential future investments. Does an “unknown wallet” mean the transaction is suspicious? Not necessarily. “Unknown wallet” simply means the address is not publicly identified with a specific person or entity. While it adds anonymity, many legitimate large holders and institutions use unlinked wallets for privacy or operational reasons. How can I track large crypto transfers like this? Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking significant cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. Many blockchain explorers also allow users to monitor specific wallet addresses or transaction hashes. Found this analysis insightful?

The drop triggered $137 million in liquidations of leveraged long positions, catching traders off guard. The decline followed weakness in the Nasdaq 100, which fell 1.2% amid doubts over the long-term strength of the artificial intelligence sector. Trade Deficit Adds to Investor Concerns Market sentiment worsened after the U.S. reported a 22% jump in its July trade deficit. The gap between imports and exports widened to $103.6 billion, exceeding forecasts. Economists warned this could drag on economic growth in the third quarter, adding to uncertainty. Insider Sales Signal Caution Investor unease deepened after data revealed an unusual trend in insider trading activity. X user Malone_Wealth noted that the top 200 trades by executives and large shareholders last week were all sales. Major moves included Walmart’s Jim C. Walton with $961 million, Snowflake’s Frank Slootman at $164 million, and Amer Sports’ Dennis J. Wilson with $160 million. Other significant sales included Dutch Bros’ Travis Boersma at $81.5 million and Klaviyo’s Andrew Bialecki at $73.7 million. Chinese Banking Stress Adds Pressure China added another layer of concern. Its five largest banks reported record-low margins and rising delinquencies, with retail banks writing off $5.2 billion in bad loans in the first quarter—an eightfold jump year-on-year. The figures highlighted mounting risks in the Chinese financial system. AI Sector Weakness Intensifies Meanwhile, the artificial intelligence sector is showing signs of strain. Nvidia revealed that nearly half of its data center revenue comes from just two customers, raising questions about reliance. Despite delivering solid quarterly results, Nvidia shares fell 4.7% over two sessions. Super Micro Computer, a major Nvidia partner, added to concerns by warning of potential issues in its financial reporting. Its shares dropped more than 5% as a result. Bonds Reflect Risk Aversion In the bond market, investors sought safety in U.S. Treasurys. The two-year yield fell to 3.62%, its lowest level in four months and down from 3.80% the week before. This decline suggests growing risk aversion, as investors preferred lower yields in exchange for security. Outlook for Bitcoin Alongside these global risks, Bitcoin faces its own pressures. Long-dormant whales have been selling, while miners continue steady outflows. Despite these factors, analysts suggest the broader macroeconomic picture remains the primary driver of Bitcoin’s latest decline. With traders cautious ahead of the U.S. national holiday, volatility could remain elevated in the coming sessions.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-08-30 02:59:28

Solana whales are shifting to MAGACOIN FINANCE at a time when SOL is stuck in a tight range. Since Solana has continued to be rejected at greater heights, investors with large quantities of it are diversifying some of their profits with this rapidly selling presale. The timing makes sense. MAGACOIN FINANCE is already past significant price milestones of its presale and is entering the final allocation stage. The supply is drying up and demand accumulating in Telegram chats, trading desks, and the wallets of whales. It is an opportunity to get a ride on the upside to those who do as the tokens are listed on the exchanges. Solana Whales turn to MAGACOIN FINANCE Solana whales have started accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE, scooping coins in the early stages and sparking waves of FOMO across the market. MAGA’s appeal is straightforward. The project has a clear roadmap, frequent and transparent updates, and an audit by a leading blockchain security company. That foundation is giving whales confidence to enter early while the presale window is still open. On top of that, new buyers are grabbing a 50% EXTRA BONUS using the code PATRIOT50X, something that makes this final phase even more attractive. With fewer tokens left and thousands already onboarded, MAGA is shaping up as one of the most hyped presales of 2025. And this combination of scarcity, trust, and community buzz makes it hard to ignore by whales seeking short-term upsides. Solana price faces rejection but builds pressure Solana is near $189 after being rejected on several occasions at $205-$207. Such resistance has been hard to shake off and that has caused prices to stall over several weeks. The key support is at the range of $176-$180. It is in this zone that there has been the gathering of liquidity, and where buyers have been active in stepping and maintaining the trend. The daily chart also shows an ascending triangle pattern forming. That configuration tends to indicate that price is building up pressure to blow up. If Solana price manages to close above $207, analysts believe that it will rally to $300. Traders will be waiting until either a revisit of the support at $176 or the repelled rejection through resistance occurs. Why Solana might pull back before breaking higher Short-term weakness is still possible. A retrace to the $176 accumulation phase would not be out of place, considering the resistance levels above. As a matter of fact, analysts believe that such a drawdown can provide Solana the foundation it requires to jump higher. Institutions are already circling. Pantera Capital is currently raising a $1.25 billion fund to form a new Nasdaq-listed treasury company focused on staking Solana. The first $500 million from that raise could directly flow into SOL, driving new demand Both whales and institutions are positioning and thus, the long-term odds of Solana recovering are not going. Final verdict The chart of Solana is at a stalemate position at the two large levels; $176 and $207 lows and highs respectively. This can be viewed by whales as an organic consolidation process with institutions ready to purchase billions of dollars of SOL. That’s why many are patient with Solana for the long-term recovery shot toward $300. .In the short term, however, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting their attention. Its successful passed audit, scarcity of supply and presale rewarding are all contributing to demand. Whales are slowly racking up MAGA as they await the next Solana breakout. To the everyday investor, it serves as a clear indication, MAGA is the coin that holds the present-day gains, whereas Solana is the long-term investment.

SUI is facing a bearish outlook with forecasts pointing toward $2.90, highlighting weak demand and falling liquidity. Toncoin, on the other hand, shows mixed technicals and fragile momentum even after a slight daily gain. These examples reflect how unstable many altcoins still are. BlockDAG has broken away from this pattern. With more than $386 million raised in its presale and a Batch 30 price of $0.03, the project has become one of the strongest bullish cryptos heading into 2025. Its recent rollout of Dashboard V4, strong security audits, and confirmation of 20 exchange listings show real progress built on transparency and growth. While rivals deal with unstable charts, BlockDAG (BDAG) is proving why trust and delivery matter. SUI Price Prediction Suggests Short-Term Weakness SUI is under selling pressure with projections pointing toward $2.90 soon, a drop of nearly 18–20% from its current range. Analysts cite weak demand, shrinking liquidity, and hesitation among retail traders as the main reasons for this outlook. On-chain activity supports the same picture, showing lighter participation from both retail and whales, leaving the balance tilted toward sellers. Technical charts also confirm the pressure. RSI shows divergence that signals continued weakness, while MACD lines highlight selling strength. Analysts note that $2.90 is the main support zone to watch. If this level holds, a rebound could lead to recovery toward $3.20–$3.40. For now, the advice is caution. Buyers need clear confirmation through volume and momentum before looking for entry. Without that, SUI remains vulnerable to further decline unless demand quickly returns to shift the signals. Toncoin Price Momentum Fails Despite Small Gains Toncoin (TON) trades at $3.24, recording a modest 1.04% daily increase but struggling to show bullish conviction. Trading volume fell 15.21% to $207.5 million, showing weaker participation and cautious sentiment. Over the past week, TON has dropped 5.44%, diverging from wider market resilience and adding to the bearish mood. Analysts point to critical support levels. If TON can hold, Fibonacci retracements suggest potential moves toward $3.89 and $4.43. Failure to maintain support, however, risks a slide toward $2.80, a level that could heavily weaken sentiment. Current indicators add to the mixed view. RSI stands at 45.53, signaling weak momentum, while MACD shows slight bullishness but with a fading histogram, suggesting loss of strength. CoinGlass data also shows a 19% drop in trading volume and open interest slipping 0.45% to $296.9 million. Overall, Toncoin’s direction remains uncertain. Its momentum is weak, and sentiment is cautious as traders wait for stronger signals before committing. BlockDAG’s $386M Presale and 2,900% ROI Show Why It Leads Bullish Crypto Rankings While SUI and Toncoin struggle with fragile setups, BlockDAG continues to build strength through delivery. The project has already raised more than $386 million in presale funding at Batch 30, with its price climbing to $0.03. With a launch price of $0.05 expected, early backers have seen an ROI of 2,900%. A standout highlight is the release of Dashboard V4. This platform simulates post-launch trading activity with real-time BDAG charts, wallet monitoring, order book data, referral features, and leaderboard metrics. It gives users a clear, transparent view of presale activity and prepares the community for live exchange action. BlockDAG has also passed strict security checks from CertiK and Halborn. Every issue was fixed, and the system now uses multi-signature approvals and time-delay execution to add strong safeguards. This gives users confidence in a sector where security problems are often common. Liquidity is secured through 20 confirmed exchange listings, including MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, LBank, and XT.com. These listings guarantee broad market access from the first day of launch. By combining a huge presale raise, tough security, advanced dashboard tools, and confirmed liquidity, BlockDAG shows why it leads as a top bullish crypto. Its model proves that growth can be built on delivery and trust, not just speculation. BlockDAG Defines Bullish Strength in Crypto SUI’s weak chart outlook and Toncoin’s fading momentum highlight how uncertain many altcoins remain. Both face hurdles that could decide whether they recover or continue sliding. In contrast, BlockDAG has already secured its place among the leading bullish cryptos. With $386 million raised, a Batch 30 price of $0.03, and achievements like Dashboard V4, proven audits, and 20 listings, it has built real credibility even before launch. This powerful mix of progress and execution offers a path that few projects can match. While others rely on short-term speculation, BlockDAG has shown that bullish strength comes from real delivery and strong systems. By combining transparency, security, and global access, it sets the stage for long-term growth and positions itself as the next major breakout.

With the market experiencing a pullback, cryptocurrency investors and traders are taking advantage of the opportunity before a potential recovery. Across multiple crypto circles, many are asking what are the best cryptos to buy now before the next bull cycle. While big-name tokens continue to dominate watchlists, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a breakout contender, gaining attention for bringing transparency into the meme coin space. To cut through the noise, analysts have highlighted five cryptocurrencies that stand out today for their fundamentals, adoption, and long-term potential. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Transparency Sets It Apart MAGACOIN FINANCE is the breakout potential on this list. The project is fast drawing attention as one of the few meme coin presales that have prioritized safety and transparency to reinforce investors’ confidence. And that bet has paid off. Many of the investors and traders drawn to the project point to its full Hashex audit and a KYC-verified team. This mix of credibility has not only set it apart but also positioned it as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Analysts tracking it refer to MAGACOIN FINANCE as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. With thousands of investors getting in daily, those who stay on the sidelines may be left chasing rallies in months to come. 2. Bitcoin (BTC): The Market’s Anchor Bitcoin is trading around $110,000–$111,000 after a dip from $124,000. Analysts expect volatility but point to possible gains toward $114K–$118K soon. While talk of $200,000 this year feels unlikely, BTC remains the top choice for many investors searching for the best crypto to buy now. With institutional adoption growing and a $2.1 trillion market cap, it remains crypto’s anchor. 3. Ethereum (ETH): Staking and Institutional Confidence Ethereum sits near $4,600, supported by more than 30% of its supply now locked in staking. Institutional demand, ETF inflows, and ecosystem growth give ETH strong momentum. Analysts project a potential climb to $5,300 this year, keeping it on nearly every best altcoins to buy list. 4. Cardano (ADA): Aiming for a Breakout Cardano trades near $0.84, with resistance at $1.00. Analysts believe a push toward $1.20 is possible soon, with longer-term forecasts pointing to $2.00 if momentum continues. Backed by strong community funding and ecosystem upgrades, ADA remains one of the best altcoins to buy for growth-focused investors. 5. Stellar Lumens (XLM): Payments and Positive Sentiment Stellar Lumens trades around $0.40, with predictions for a rise to $0.45–$0.46 in the near term. Known for fast, low-cost payments, Stellar is benefiting from renewed optimism tied to Ripple’s legal clarity. Its fundamentals and increasing adoption make it another name in the best crypto to buy now conversation. Final Word From Bitcoin’s steady fundamentals to Ethereum’s institutional momentum, Cardano’s ecosystem, Stellar’s payments niche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s transparency, analysts say these five projects top the list of the best crypto to buy now in 2025.

Data Says No,https://bitcoinist.com/etfs-taking-over-bitcoin-trading-volume-data-no/,"On-chain data shows exchanges are still the main venue of Bitcoin trading, with Binance alone observing volume double that of the spot ETFs. US Bitcoin Spot ETFs Still Account For Just 13% Of Trading Volume In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has talked about how the US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) compare to exchanges when it comes to Bitcoin trading volume . Spot ETFs are investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to BTC without having to own it. The ETFs trade on traditional platforms, so investors who aren’t familiar with the digital asset space can easily invest into the coin through them. The spot ETFs are relatively new to the sector, having received approval from the US SEC at the start of last year. Before the ETFs, investors had to use cryptocurrency exchanges to buy BTC. Unlike with the ETFs, exchanges normally deposit actual tokens to a buyer’s wallet that they can then choose to withdraw into self-custody . For many traditional investors, though, navigating cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges can feel daunting. ETFs provide a simpler, off-chain route into Bitcoin, making them a direct competitor to exchanges. Since their inauguration, spot ETFs have quickly gained popularity, but one question arises: how do they stack up against the old exchanges? Below is a chart shared by CryptoQuant that puts into perspective the Bitcoin trading volume of the US spot ETFs compared to the major exchanges. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin spot ETFs have usually witnessed daily trading volume between $5 billion to $10 billion during the last few months. This is a notable value, but pales in comparison to what cryptocurrency exchanges witness. Binance, the largest platform in the sector, alone observes up to $18 billion in volume on peak days. In terms of percentage of trading volume occupied since Donald Trump became US President, Binance leads the market with a share of 34.69%. In contrast, the US spot ETFs only hold a Bitcoin volume dominance of 4.53%. Crypto.com (20.11%), Bybit (6.45%), and MEXC (4.62%) are all ahead of them. Based on the data, the analytics firm concludes, “exchanges remain the primary venue for trading.” A similar picture appears when looking at the spot ETFs for Ethereum, which launched in the US in mid-2024. From the above chart, it’s visible that Binance has made up for 29.07% of the total Ethereum trading volume, far ahead of the 13.08% figure of the US spot ETFs. That said, the gap here is closer than for Bitcoin. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen a plunge of around 3% over the past 24 hours that has taken its price to $108,500.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin ETFs|Bitcoin Volume|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-30 03:00:39

Solana Is Breaking Out Of An Ascending Triangle In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a triangle technical analysis (TA) pattern forming in the 12-hour price of Solana. The pattern in question is an “Ascending Triangle,” which appears whenever an asset’s price consolidates between two converging trendlines. Related Reading: Solana Social Media Hype Hits 11-Week High As Price Jumps 16% The special feature of the formation is that the upper trendline is parallel to the time-axis, while the lower one is sloped upward. This means that as the price travels between the lines, it observes its range shrink to an upside. As with any consolidation pattern, the upper line of the Ascending Triangle is likely to present resistance to the price, while the lower one support. A break out of either of these levels can signal a continuation in that direction: a surge above the triangle is a bullish sign and a fall under it a bearish one. Like the Ascending Triangle, there is also the Descending Triangle, which is quite similar except for the fact that its lower line is parallel to the time-axis instead. Generally, the probability of a breakout is considered more likely to occur beyond the resistance line in an Ascending Triangle, while in a Descending Triangle, a breakdown of support is more probable. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Ascending Triangle that has appeared in Solana’s 12-hour price: As is visible in the above graph, Solana has been trading inside the pattern for many months now and recently, it has been trying to break out of it. This attempt at a surge above the resistance line comes as SOL has been approaching the apex of the triangle. Usually, a breakout becomes more likely to occur as the price nears the end of the pattern. This is because the consolidation range gets quite narrow around the apex. The same effect may be in play for the cryptocurrency right now. In the event that the latest attempt does lead to a sustained bullish push, Solana may be looking at the $300 level, according to Martinez. This level is around where the 1.618 Fibonacci Extension level lies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Over? CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index Turns Bearish Fibonacci Extension lines are drawn on a price chart based on ratios from the Fibonacci series. The 1.618 ratio in particular corresponds to the famous Golden Ratio. If Solana does end up witnessing a rally to this target of $300, then its price would have gone up by around 46% from the current value. SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is floating around $205, up more than 5% over the last seven days.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $4.59 to $5.54. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.3942 Market Cap $632.23M Trading Volume $36.43M Circulating Supply 1.60B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.2916 24-hour High $0.4287 24-hour Low $0.3892 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 3.99% 50-Day SMA $0.3973 14-Day RSI 51.80 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 50 (Neutral) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $0.4276 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown FLOW faced rejection at $0.44 and is now consolidating lower. Support sits at $0.387-$0.393. Flow coin’s immediate short-term resistance lies at $0.401–0.417. Flow coin 1-day price analysis The 1-day price chart for August 30 shows that FLOW faced rejection from the $0.44 area and is now trading around $0.394, sitting just above the mid-Bollinger Band ($0.393). FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView Momentum signals are softening: RSI is neutral near 51, while MACD lines are close to a bearish cross. The lower Bollinger Band at $0.358 is the next key support if today’s candle closes below $0.393, while resistance remains at $0.427–0.430. Reclaiming $0.41 would shift sentiment back toward buyers, but until then, price action looks corrective. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis FLOW’s 4-hour chart shows a series of lower highs after the spike to $0.44, with price now hovering around the 50-SMA ($0.395). Resistance is layered at $0.401 and $0.417, while support is marked at $0.387. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Volume has tapered off compared to the initial surge, signaling fading momentum. Unless $0.401 is broken convincingly, sellers retain short-term control, and a retest of $0.387 support remains likely. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3887 BUY SMA 5 $0.3975 SELL SMA 10 $0.3959 SELL SMA 21 $0.3956 SELL SMA 50 $0.3973 SELL SMA 100 $0.3801 BUY SMA 200 $0.4276 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3870 BUY EMA 5 $0.3837 BUY EMA 10 $0.3794 BUY EMA 21 $0.3806 BUY EMA 50 $0.4111 SELL EMA 100 $0.4781 SELL EMA 200 $0.5585 SELL What to expect from Flow? Unless FLOW reclaims $0.401–$0.41 soon, the bias leans toward further testing of $0.387–0.358 support before any sustainable recovery attempt. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

Ethereum has a powerful foothold, SEI is gaining traction through ecosystem upgrades and institutional anticipation while MAGACOIN FINANCE is being tagged as retail-driven presale of the quarter. Experts believe that the fusion of established strength and fresh opportunity could determine the next stage of crypto adoption. Ethereum: Institutional Strength Supports Retail Confidence Ethereum is hovering around $4,600 after gaining 70% in value year-on-year and remains a key focus for retail and institutional strategies. In a single day, spot Ethereum ETFs generated almost $444 million in net inflows, making them one of the key driving factors as Bitcoin ETFs witnessed through the same period. The transactions rise 63% in the last 30 days. The active addresses growth with 26% growth is a healthy sign. Also, the exchange reserves have decreased by 4.4% to $80.7 billion, indicating accumulation not profit taking. According to the analysts, Ethereum’s healthy staking appetite indicates confidence among validators and institutions as demand soars with over $4 billion worth of ETH queued. The stability of ETH has made it a reliable option in presale and altcoin rotations ahead of Q4. SEI Network: Ecosystem Growth and Institutional Signals SEI is currently priced at $0.299 and it is up by 3.39% on the day. Analysts suggest the price could weaken short term. The potential price drop being suggested is towards the $0.23 level which may happen this September. Nonetheless, impressive ecosystem progress strengthens its long-term outlook. In August, SEI saw its strongest month ever, with $1.2 billion in DEX trading volume and 15 million active wallets, signalling real adoption. With the recent “Giga” upgrade, parallel block execution with Autobahn consensus was introduced to the SEI network, allowing over 200,000 transactions a second with complete EVM Compatibility. Its position makes it a hub for Ethereum developers seeking scalable infrastructure. Canary Capital’s staked-SEI ETF has submitted its application to the SEC and is awaiting approval. At the same time, Wyoming’s state-backed Frontier Stable Token (FRNT) has selected SEI as a host chain, further rooting SEI into real-world financial use cases. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Retail Leader in Q4 Although Ethereum and SEI are solid names, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the Q4 retail momentum. With a 2,000% ROI prediction, a KYC-verified team and thousands of investors already on board, it’s being touted one of the best presales to buy in 2025 – but limited supply means time is running out fast. Furthermore, it is more accountable than most early-stage tokens thanks to its verified team and transparent roadmap. Growth of Whale-backed inflows and speedy retail adoption are rising, according to analysts, with Google search interest and social engagement around this project increasing. As a result of MAGACOIN FINANCE’s focus on security, visibility, and scarcity, many analysts have dubbed it the presale of the year, which is expected to be retail-driven. As more investors ask what the best crypto to buy in 2025 is, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to lead the conversation. Its smart contract has been fully audited and the development team has been fully KYC-verified, offering unmatched legitimacy during a time of rising investor scrutiny. Conclusion Ethereum has continued to show its strength through institutional inflows, while the SEI narrative shows how ecosystem growth and regulatory progress can capture retail attention. However, analysts state that the highest potential retail-driven momentum in Q4 is elsewhere. Due to its dual audits, verified team and increasing community adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already being regarded as the breakout presale of Q4 2025 — and one of the most appealing opportunities before supply runs out.

CZ Says the Winner Is Clear – and It’s Not Centralization,https://cryptopotato.com/defi-vs-cex-cz-says-the-winner-is-clear-and-its-not-centralization/,"At the recent BNBDay event in Tokyo, Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said decentralized exchanges (DEXs) will eventually surpass their centralized counterparts (CEXs) in trading volume. CZ noted that while CEXs currently dominate the market due to their liquidity and user-friendly experience, the momentum is shifting toward decentralized finance (DeFi). He also added that a truly private, efficient, and user-centric DEX would have the potential to reshape the industry. The DEX Appeal The former executive expressed that if he were 20 years younger, he would focus on building both an AI-powered trading agent and a privacy-preserving perpetual DEX, as he sees the biggest opportunities for innovation. While acknowledging regulatory and liquidity hurdles, particularly in areas like real-world assets (RWA), CZ maintained that the DeFi ecosystem represents the future of finance. In the second quarter of 2025, DEXs achieved their highest-ever market share in spot trading volumes, according to a report shared by CoinGecko. While CEXs remain dominant, the report highlighted clear signs of weakening momentum. Binance, the largest CEX by market share, still led the field but saw its quarterly spot trading volume decline sharply to $1.47 trillion, down from over $2 trillion previously. Other major CEXs fared even worse. For instance, Crypto.com endured a whopping 61% drop, and Coinbase also experienced lower volumes, in a wider slowdown across centralized platforms amid growing trader migration to decentralized venues. The surge in DEX activity was driven largely by PancakeSwap, which emerged as the standout performer of the quarter. The platform’s trading volume grew more than fivefold compared to Q1, which catapulted it to the top of the decentralized exchange rankings. This growth signals increasing trader preference for non-custodial platforms that prioritize privacy, control, and flexibility over centralized infrastructure. Emergence of Hybrid CeDeFi A key factor behind the surge in DEX activity is the rise of hybrid CeDeFi platforms, which blend the strengths of centralized and decentralized models. As recently reported by Binance Research, major exchanges are increasingly channeling liquidity toward these systems, which offer users low-slippage trades, MEV protection, and faster execution while retaining the transparency of on-chain settlement. Binance Research noted that such innovations are making DEXs more scalable and competitive, effectively narrowing the gap with traditional CEXs. Meanwhile, DeFi’s flexible regulatory environment has enabled rapid experimentation and feature rollouts, which have fueled steady growth in on-chain volumes. The same cannot be said for CEXs whose spot trading remains heavily influenced by retail sentiment, macroeconomic headwinds, and volatility. The post DeFi vs. CEX?

Few examples make this clearer than comparing XRP and Cardano with BlockDAG’s current rise. While market watchers debate the XRP price forecast and scan Cardano’s charts, BlockDAG (BDAG) is showing steady growth through real usage and strong community activity. With more than $386 million raised in its presale, 25.6 billion coins sold, the project is shaping up as the best crypto for payments. Its X1 app counts millions of users, and confirmed exchange listings give it a clear path to trading. These combined factors separate it from projects that still rely only on market speculation. In a sector often driven by hype over function, BlockDAG is setting a different tone, showing why usage and adoption are just as important as price talk. XRP Holds Steady While Waiting for a Breakout The XRP price forecast is once again in focus after the coin managed to defend its $3.00 support area. Trading close to $3.09, XRP continues to find it hard to push beyond $3.30, the level that blocked its last rally. Analysts believe that clearing $3.30 could spark moves toward $3.50, $3.66, and even $4.00. Market data shows hesitation. Open Interest stands at $327 million, with no clear push from either side. Net longs have slipped, showing less buying pressure, while shorts remain unchanged. This balance has kept the price locked in place. For now, XRP staying above $3.00 is a good sign, but without new momentum or strong inflows, the sideways pattern may continue. The XRP price forecast still offers both upside chances and caution. Cardano Charts Indicate Steady Progress Cardano (ADA) continues to show signs of strength after climbing back above $0.90. Currently priced at $0.9198, it trades just below the important resistance zone between $0.93 and $1.00. If ADA closes above $1.00 on the weekly chart, it could unlock further upside targets at $1.11, $1.20–$1.25, and eventually $1.35. The overall trend looks favorable, with moving averages pointing higher and the RSI sitting at 59, reflecting healthy momentum. Several indicators confirm this outlook. The Chaikin Money Flow records consistent inflows above $15 million per week, showing ongoing demand. MACD remains on the positive side, signaling a stable uptrend, while widening Bollinger Bands suggest that larger price swings may be developing. Still, caution remains, as failure to break resistance could trigger a dip back to the $0.82–$0.86 range. Overall, Cardano’s structure supports steady gains, provided buyers sustain pressure and push prices through the $1.00 barrier. BlockDAG’s 3M Miners Mark It as the Best Crypto for Payments While XRP and Cardano trade within familiar ranges, BlockDAG is building a foundation that sets it apart. The presale has raised more than $386 million, now in Batch 30 at a price of $0.03 per BDAG coin. With 25.6 billion coins sold and an ROI already standing at 2900%, interest continues to grow. The mining network is another strength. From the X1 mobile app to the X10, X30, and X100 hardware, the project’s mining line gives both casual users and advanced miners ways to participate. This broad accessibility supports a community that can expand with demand. The July demo highlighted seamless connectivity between the X1 app and the X10 device, proving that the system is not just a plan but already in use. Exchange listings further strengthen BlockDAG’s outlook. Confirmed launches on 20 global platforms such as MEXC, BitMart, LBank, Coinstore, and XT.com mean users will have quick access to liquidity and global reach. This ensures that activity translates into trading and price discovery once live. Together, these elements $386 million raised, 3 million active miners, a 2900% ROI, and guaranteed listings, place BlockDAG in a stronger position than peers still struggling with technical levels. This combination of adoption, mining reach, and liquidity makes BlockDAG stand out as the best crypto for payments today. Final Word Comparing XRP, Cardano, and BlockDAG highlights the difference between price action and adoption. XRP’s price forecast shows support but lacks strong movement. Cardano’s technical setup shows healthy signs but needs a breakout above resistance. BlockDAG, however, is already delivering on clear milestones: $386 million raised, 25.6 billion coins sold, and 20 confirmed exchange listings. For people following the crypto space, these figures show BlockDAG is not just another presale. It is a structured project with real usage and visible growth. In a market often driven by speculation, BlockDAG’s progress makes a strong case for being the best crypto for payments going forward.

BNB, one of the industry’s leading altcoins, has staged a powerful rally thanks to institutional growth and DeFi adoption. Simultaneously, PEPE is again leading the meme coin frenzy, driven by whale accumulation and strong community support. Yet analysts say that while BNB and PEPE are generating buzz, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the major breakout play of the cycle and is set to gain momentum as one of the best opportunities. BNB: Institutional Confidence and DeFi Growth BNB is currently trading around $846, having risen by 7% daily and 8% month-to-date throughout August. The increase is driven by ecosystem milestones, including close to 58% YTD growth in BNB Chain stablecoin supply. Almost at an all-time highs for DeFi activity on BNB, there are $11.1 billion stablecoins. Institutional adoption is also strengthening. B Strategy, an investment firm, will create a reserve fund worth $1 billion to provide liquidity, build infra and drive global adoption of BNB. As BNB approaches its 5th anniversary, the chain is preparing to celebrate with series of global events and enticing rewards programs worth nearly $500,000 to its global users. BNB is a good option in Q3 for investors seeking reliability and scalability. PEPE: Meme Coin Mania Returns Currently, PEPE price stands at around $0.00001006, having seen gains of about 4% in the last 24 hours. The big players remain strong supporters of Pepecoin and have purchased 1.5% more of it this month. If the price holds at a certain level, analysts believe PEPE could rally up to $0.00001220. Besides the price action, community-driven presale activity has raised over $6 million. PEPE may be a high-risk, high-reward investment, but it has definitely been the reason behind meme coin craze this quarter. The combination of speculative energy and community engagement helps it stay at the heart of conversations about market sentiment. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Strongest Breakout Play Meme coin mania is in full swing in Q3 2025, driven by the BNB and PEPE rallies. However, analysts are betting on MAGACOIN FINANCE as the strongest breakout play. It’s been audited double by HashEx and CertiK, rated 100% safe and secure and fully transparent. MAGACOIN FINANCE is considered among the top cryptos to purchase this cycle, as it has the potential to yield a 65x ROI, while whale-backed momentum accelerates ahead of limited allocations running out. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a project that is more legitimate than speculative meme tokens. It has undergone security verification and boasts a KYC-verified team. Whale inflows and retail adoption are converging quickly, as its roadmap emphasises transparency. Analysts are warning that presale allocations are quickly tightening, creating a countdown effect like one saw in early Ethereum or Solana. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being viewed as an attractive option for investors looking for high upside but not willing to compromise on safety. Conclusion According to analysts, the strongest breakout play option in 2025 is still in presales, which provides safety as well as momentum. Furthermore, during Q3 2025, Meme coin activity clearly showed PEPE makes a major statement whilst BNB is strong as a DeFi play. With its dual audits, whale demand and forecasts of 65x upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being touted as the altcoin set to outperform BNB and PEPE this cycle – but the presale window is closing fast.

50896615,569588,1756526449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50896615.jpeg,PetroChina Eyes Stablecoin Integration As Eric Trump Praises China’s Crypto Power,https://bitcoinist.com/petrochina-eyes-stablecoin-eric-trump-praise-chinas/,"Following the recent regulatory developments in Hong Kong, Asia’s largest oil and gas producer, PetroChina, is reportedly evaluating the adoption of stablecoins for cross-border payments. PetroChina Considers Stablecoin Adoption On Friday, local news media outlets reported that PetroChina, the listed arm of state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), will explore cross-border settlement and payments using stablecoins. According to the reports, Wang Hua, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Board Secretary of PetroChina, disclosed during the half-year meeting that the company is closely monitoring the latest developments regarding the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) Stablecoin Ordinance. In May, Hong Kong’s Legislative Council officially passed the new Stablecoins Ordinance, directing any individual or entity seeking to issue a fiat-referenced stablecoin (FRS) in the jurisdiction, or any Hong Kong Dollar (HKD)-pegged token, to obtain a license from the HKMA. The ordinance, enacted on August 1, aims to reinforce regulatory oversight on the digital assets industry, while fostering innovation and “responsible, sustainable” development. Under the new framework, licensed entities are allowed to offer FRS in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, retail investors can access the tokens issued only by these qualified institutions. Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary, Paul Chan Mo-po, previously noted that stablecoins, “particularly when it is referenced to fiat currencies, (have) many use case scenarios,” including cross-border payments to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. PetroChina will reportedly initiate a viability study on the use of stablecoins for cross-border settlement and payments, marking the Chinese energy giant’s entry into the digital assets landscape under Hong Kong’s new regulatory framework. HK, China Crypto Landscape As the report noted, Wang Hua didn’t disclose a specific timeline, only stating that the company would “closely monitor policy developments and build technical capabilities.” This could suggest that PetroChina’s stablecoin exploration remains in the research phase. It’s worth noting that the HKMA established a six-month transition period and encouraged interested institutions to submit applications before September 30. Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary has stated that regulators received several applications from entities seeking to become qualified issuers. Previous reports revealed that multiple companies have applied for the HKMA license ahead of the ordinance enactment, including logistics technology firm Reitar Logtech and the overseas arm of Chinese mainland financial technology giant Ant Group. Meanwhile, e-commerce giant JD.com, through its fintech arm JD Coinlink, was testing HKD-pegged tokens under the regulator’s sandbox program earlier this year. Despite Hong Kong’s crypto push, authorities have warned about the excessive hype in the market and public opinion, raising concerns over a developing trend toward speculation as the market has become “overly enthusiastic.” Similarly, Chinese regulators have allegedly instructed firms to halt promotions and research publications related to stablecoins amid concerns that the growing interest in the sector could enable the digital asset to be exploited as a new tool for fraudulent activities. Nonetheless, Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, recently highlighted China’s role in the crypto industry. At Bitcoin Asia 2025, the American businessman affirmed that the country is a “hell of a power” in the sector, adding that the US and China likely understood digital assets “better than anyone else in the world.” “There’s no question that China is a hell of a power when it comes to this world,” Trump said, stating that he would love for President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to talk about Bitcoin.",Crypto News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Asia 2025|btc|BTCUSDT|China Bitcoin|China crypto crackdown|China Stablecoin|Eric Trump|Hong Kong stablecoin|PetroChina|PetroChina Stablecoin|stablecoin adoption|stablecoin license|Stablecoin regulation,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-30 04:00:49

Analyst Forecasts Drop To $94,000 If This Level Doesn’t Hold",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/is-the-bitcoin-rally-over-analyst-forecasts-drop-to-94000-if-this-level-doesnt-hold/,"After a short-lived recovery, Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to bounce from a crucial level to reclaim the $110,000 support. However, some analysts suggest that a retest of the $90,000 level could be the next stop for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Another Short-Lived Solana Rally? Here’s Why It May Be Different This Time Bitcoin Drops To Weekly Lows Bitcoin lost the $110,000 support for the first time in nearly two months, dipping below the lower boundary of its local range, between $108,700-$119,500. The flagship crypto hit an eight-week low of $107,900 on Friday afternoon, raising concerns for its short-term rally among investors. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggested that the market is starting to show signs of fatigue, with Bitcoin Dominance displaying cracks after carrying “the bulk of the bull market momentum.” To the analyst, BTC’s current price action signals a macro trend shift, mirroring the 2021 price action and the conditions that preceded the 2021 cycle peak. At the time, the cryptocurrency hit a peak of $60,000 in April, retraced, rallied to $70,000, and set a strong bearish divergence against the Relative Strength Index (RSI) before the bear market began. This time, Bitcoin is showing the same setup that foreshadowed the end of the last cycle, with price making higher highs while the RSI makes lower lows, Martinez explained. Among other technical signals, the analyst highlighted that the MACD indicator had turned bearish this week. He detailed that this bearish crossover aligns with the price drop and reinforces the downside risks. Meanwhile, he added that the recent death cross in the Bitcoin MVRV Momentum indicator “signals a macro momentum reversal from positive to negative. This is a historically reliable warning sign of cyclical tops.” The analyst affirmed that the on-chain evidence suggests Bitcoin’s top may be in, at least temporarily, with bias shifting bearish and a risk of retesting lower support levels. Will BTC Mirror Its 2021 Drop? Martinez also noted that the $108,700 support is crucial for BTC’s short-term performance, as a weekly close below this area would confirm a deeper trend shift, which occurred in 2021. After peaking in late 2021, the flagship crypto lost its local range above the $58,000 mark, which led to a retest of the macro range’s mid-zone and an eventual drop below the macro range’s lows in the coming months. If BTC loses its immediate technical floor, the price could retest the $104,500 and $97,000 support levels, risking a drop to the mid-zone of the macro range, around the $94,000 area. Altcoin Sherpa weighed in on the cryptocurrency’s performance, stating that Bitcoin should have strong support between the $103,000-$108,000 levels, as the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) sits around the $104,000 mark. Related Reading: XRP Shows Strength Amid $3 Retest, But Analyst Warns Of Potential Correction However, analyst Ted Pillows considers that $124,000 appears to be the local top. He explained that, historically, Bitcoin’s bottoms occur after a retest of the weekly 60 EMA, which currently sits around the $92,000 support zone and has a CME gap. “In this scenario, Bitcoin will start a reversal after 3-4 weeks and a new ATH by November/December,” Ted concluded. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $107,947, a 7.5% decline in the weekly timeframe.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently echoed the bold prediction that Bitcoin may climb to $1 million per coin within the next 5 years. I think we'll see $1M per bitcoin by 2030. Regulatory clarity is finally emerging, the US government is keeping a BTC reserve, there's a growing interest for crypto ETFs, among many other factors. (Not financial advice of course, it's impossible to guarantee) pic.twitter.com/w5EfcYFvVp — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) August 20, 2025 His outlook aligns with other prominent voices , including Robert Kiyosaki and Jack Dorsey, who see Bitcoin gaining global acceptance at an unprecedented scale. Armstrong’s position is based partly on increasing government and institutional interest. He pointed to the United States’ initiative to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and suggested that other G20 nations could eventually adopt similar measures. If this trend develops, demand from sovereign states and large institutions could become a major driver of Bitcoin’s sustained growth. Currently, Bitcoin holds a market capitalization of approximately $2.3 trillion, surpassing both silver and major corporations such as Meta. Ethereum follows with around $570 billion, while XRP stands at about $182 billion. Together, these figures form part of a global cryptocurrency market valued at $4 trillion, with Bitcoin maintaining a dominance of roughly 58%. Should Bitcoin hit $21 trillion, the entire cryptocurrency market could expand to $36 trillion. Estimating XRP’s Value in a $36 Trillion Market Projecting XRP’s future price under this scenario involves several assumptions. One straightforward approach is proportional growth. If Bitcoin grows from $110,750 to $1 million, a 764% increase, XRP could hypothetically rise by the same percentage. Based on its current price of $2.82 , this would place XRP around $26, with a market capitalization of roughly $1.57 trillion. Under the same framework, Ethereum could reach over $43,000 per token with a $5.2 trillion valuation. Can XRP Outperform Bitcoin? Some analysts argue that XRP could exceed these conservative estimates. Historical performance provides part of the reasoning. In the past year, XRP appreciated by over 400%, while Bitcoin advanced by less than 90% during the same period. If this pattern of outperformance persists, XRP could deliver several times Bitcoin’s growth. In an extreme scenario, this would push XRP’s valuation above $100 and lift its total market cap close to $6 trillion. Nonetheless, such outcomes remain speculative. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 AI-Driven Forecasts Artificial intelligence platforms have also offered their perspectives. OpenAI’s ChatGPT suggested XRP might trade between $20 and $35 if Bitcoin hits $1 million, though more optimistic cases point to $35–$68 or even higher. Google’s Gemini placed XRP’s potential range between $8 and $42, while X’s Grok AI estimated $15–$30 as a baseline, with $50–$100 possible under strong institutional adoption and favourable regulatory shifts. Factors That Could Influence XRP’s Growth Several developments could provide tangible support for XRP’s expansion. Anticipated XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), expected by October, may attract significant capital inflows, with projections of $5 billion in the first month alone, similar to the surge seen in Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. Ripple’s growing payments network is another key driver. Partnerships with major banks, including BNY, alongside the launch of RLUSD, a stablecoin tied to XRP for transaction fees, are enhancing real-world utility. Moreover, the adoption of XRP in corporate treasuries has gained momentum. As of June, eight companies across industries, including technology, energy, pharmaceuticals, and cannabis, had collectively allocated nearly $1 billion to XRP holdings . If Bitcoin achieves a $21 trillion market cap, XRP could realistically trade in the $20–$35 range, with higher values possible under favourable conditions. While projections above $100 remain highly speculative, factors such as institutional adoption, ETF launches, and Ripple’s expanding ecosystem could strengthen XRP’s long-term position.

As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $4.89 Market Cap $2.62B Trading Volume $64.19M Circulating Supply 537.42M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $5.09 24-h Low $4.82 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 4.12% 14-Day RSI 45.02 50-Day SMA $5.49 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 50 (Neutral) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $6.06 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Currently, ICP is holding above $4.72 but is still in a broader downtrend. Daily MACD is bearish with weak momentum. The 4-hour chart shows a slight bounce, but resistance is heavy near $5.00–$5.02. ICP 1-day price analysis On the daily chart for August 30, ICP trades around $4.92 after dipping to $4.80 and bouncing off the lower Bollinger Band at $4.72. The trend is still bearish with lower highs and lower lows, while MACD stays negative and aligned downward, keeping pressure on the market. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView ICP’s resistance sits near the mid-band at $5.28, and losing $4.72 on a daily close could trigger deeper downside. Holding above the lower band might stabilize the price, but bulls won’t regain control unless $5.28 is reclaimed. ICP 4-hour price analysis The 4-hour price chart shows a slight recovery after a string of red candles. Alligator lines are still fanning downward, signaling the trend hasn’t reversed. Volume remains steady at about 11M, while OBV is negative, reflecting continued distribution. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView ICP’s local resistance sits at $4.94–$5.02, with support around $4.85. A breakout over $5.02 could bring relief, but rejection would likely drag the coin’s price back toward $4.80.

Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a serious contender for the next $1 milestone, offering structured DeFi mechanisms that will generate persistent demand. While DOGE relies largely on sentiment, MUTM is built around real financial activity: lending, borrowing, and staking that directly influence token velocity and price. Meme hype vs real DeFi utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a non-custodial lending protocol that supports P2C for stablecoins and major crypto coins, alongside isolated P2P lanes for high-risk or volatile tokens. P2C pools will adjust interest rates automatically based on utilization, ensuring lenders earn optimal APYs while borrowers maintain access to liquidity. For example, as more users deposit into a pool, rates will adapt dynamically, boosting returns and encouraging continuous participation. In parallel, P2P orders will allow borrowers and lenders to negotiate terms directly — including loan duration, APR, and partial fills — isolating risk while offering higher yields for risk-tolerant participants. By converting activity into token demand through mtToken staking and the platform’s buy-and-distribute revenue mechanism of MUTM, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ensures that every lending transaction contributes to continuous buy pressure for mtToken stakers. Unlike meme tokens, this model creates a predictable demand loop anchored to actual usage rather than speculation. Presale traction and future listings Total Supply 4 billion. PHASE 6: around $15.10 million generated so far. Current price: $0.035. Holders: Over 15,850. 30% Already Sold Out of 170 million of this phase’s supply. CertiK Audit of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — Methods Manual Review, Static Analysis. Token Scan Score 95.00. CertiK Skynet Score 78.00. 12K+ Twitter Followers. Note: Phase 7 will lift the price to $0.040 (+15%). The presale momentum positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to capitalize on the next wave of crypto investment interest. Phase 6 participants are securing access before the Phase 7 price hike. Early buyers will benefit from a platform launch that will include a Layer-2 integration, significantly reducing transaction costs and accelerating settlement speeds. This will allow users to interact with borrowing and lending pools immediately, generating real utility at listing. Borrowers will have clear mechanics to maintain leverage safely. For instance, an ETH holder will post collateral at a set LTV ratio to unlock stablecoin liquidity while retaining market exposure. Repayments will burn minted stablecoins automatically, and collateral liquidation triggers will protect pool health. Such overcollateralized loans ensure that both P2C and P2P ecosystems remain secure and predictable. Security and credibility are reinforced by the CertiK audit, including a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78, along with a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program and a $100,000 giveaway for community participants. These measures establish trust for early adopters seeking a safe entry into DeFi, differentiating MUTM from purely hype-driven tokens like DOGE. Looking ahead, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will pursue expected listings on top exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, and MEXC. The beta launch, when the token goes live, will allow immediate access to platform functionality, giving users real hands-on experience with lending, borrowing, and staking. The buy-and-distribute mechanism will continuously feed token demand, particularly as Layer-2 adoption accelerates volume and efficiency. For investors tracking crypto prices today, the combination of structured lending, predictable buybacks, and upcoming exchange visibility provides a clear path for meaningful gains. With Phase 6 already 30% sold, the next stage will push prices to $0.040, offering one of the last opportunities to enter before broader market recognition. Conclusion As analysts review crypto predictions and monitor metrics like the crypto fear and greed index, one thing becomes clear: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not chasing sentiment but creating lasting utility. For crypto investment portfolios seeking exposure beyond memes, MUTM represents a structured approach to growth. Early participation in Phase 6 will position holders to capitalize on beta adoption, Layer-2 efficiencies, and a growing pool of stakers, putting MUTM on track to challenge the $1 milestone ahead of many headline coins. Traders and retail investors now face a time-sensitive choice: Phase 6 discounts will vanish soon, and Phase 7 will lift the price by 15%, making this window the last widely accessible entry before listing-driven market discovery. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up as the breakout DeFi token that combines security, utility, and demand engineering — the next $1 challenger in the crypto market.

The three coins are being discussed in the joint context, but there is evident disparity in the upside potential. ADA and ETH are being projected for solid 50x–60x growth, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is being called a possible 600x play . That has placed it under the limelight as altcoin retail traders and even whales do not wish to miss on it. Cardano Finds Stability With Institutional Backing Cardano has been able to maintain above critical price levels in 2025 despite the swings that have taken place in the entire market. A big reason is institutional demand. According to ReserveOne data, inflows into ADA have been around $73 million in this year, and the overall amount recently put in custody now exceeds $900 million. The constant allocation is an indicator that money is holding ADA as a structural, long-term asset and not a short-term speculative offering. In most cases, institutions increase their exposure when a network meets three criteria- liquidity, credible infrastructure, and maturing ecosystem. Cardano checks all those boxes through its stable volume of transactions and stable development. In the case of big players, that reduces the risk factor and shows it as a portfolio option. At the time of writing, ADA price is trading at around $0.88 with a daily increase of 2.9% but is still down by 12% over the past week. Analysts have identified a demand zone around the level of $0.84 accrued on high volume action. Maintaining this level would be an indication of further resilience and might create an opportunity to increase to the $1.20- $1.30 resistance band. Analyst Crypto Target highlighted that ADA has revisited its previous breakout point, and is making higher bottoms, which precedes and is typically a sign of bigger rallies. On the bearish side, a drop down below the $ 0.84 level would cause the price to gravitate back towards the $0.70-72 collection zone. Cardano/TetherUS 1M Chart Ethereum Balances ETF Demand and Price Resistance Ethereum has also garnered the attention of analysts as the number of institutional activity is picking up. Spot ETFs reported an inflow of over +16.9k ETH this week indicating that ETFs continued to garner interest. The exchange reserves decreased by 4.41% to slightly below $80.7 billion which can be a sign of more keeping grasp and lesser temporary sales. Such a change of direction tends to establish a less volatile or even a bullish direction. Ethereum Exchange Reserve USD However, traders have watched out for a battle zone at the price of $4,700 . The liquidation map of Ethereum is highly populated at that level and hence is both an opportunity and risk. A breakout may trigger forced buying by shorts and an extension of a rally. A miss, however, can easily be greeted by aggressive selling as leveraged longs are punched out. Standard Chartered recently described Ethereum as undervalued. Jeffrey Kendrick, head of digital asset research at the bank, said that this shows that corporate treasuries and ETFs have already consumed 4.9% of the ETH supply since June. To top that off, companies such as SharpLink Gaming have gone all-in on the accumulation plan- SharpLink announced that it has purchased another 252 million ETH in a move that takes its treasury to nearly 800,000 ETH valued at approximately $3.7 billion. The company has a cash pile of $200 million to do even more purchases which effectively means that it has put a floor on its own holdings. Moves such as these lend credibility to the argument that the Ethereum ecosystem together with its staking reward makes it one of the most attractive blue-chips in crypto. MAGACOIN FINANCE Seen as the Standout Pick Analysts have placed MAGACOIN FINANCE alongside Cardano and Ethereum in their top crypto rankings for 2025, but with a major distinction. While Cardano and Ethereum are projected for 50x–60x growth , MAGACOIN FINANCE, recently audited , is forecast for up to 600x upside, making it the standout pick. Early buyers are also securing a 50% EXTRA BONUS with code PATRIOT50X, fueling strong FOMO as the project gains traction heading into the next bull cycle. Final Word Slow steady inflows in Cardano, heavy corporate investments in Ethereum and explosive upside targets in MAGACOIN FINANCE all demonstrate how various approaches can dominate in the crypto market in 2025 . ADA is building its case as a long-term institutional asset, ETH continues to prove itself as the second-biggest player with corporate and ETF demand, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is being highlighted as the higher-risk, higher-reward opportunity that could turn heads in the next cycle. The difference is stark ADA / ETH are more secured investments with institutional support and liquidity. MAGACOIN FINANCE is the outlier that analysts are predicting could generate outperformance in case it meets its projections. The fact is that, when it comes to the future of traders, it is not about making a single choice, but about learning how each fits in the overall scheme of things. Some will lean on Cardano’s stability, others will ride Ethereum’s institutional wave, but those chasing the biggest upside are starting to look closely at MAGACOIN FINANCE.

The stock currently trades at little or no premium to its Bitcoin holdings, with future value highly dependent on BTC price and share dilution. Scenario modeling suggests a potential 56.6% upside by 2028, but this is subject to high discount rates and significant execution risks. Despite the upside, I rate DDC as 'Hold' due to risks from its Chinese domicile, possible delisting, and a lack of clear long-term business strategy. You might have been fooled by this stock—it's definitely not a food products company anymore. DDC Enterprise ( DDC ) filed for an IPO two years ago to raise capital for its ready-to-cook meal business in China—but forget about meat. Now it's all about cooking Bitcoins. Those who have been my readers for a while will know that earlier this year I covered a similar story with Top Win International, a watch reseller that took advantage of the cash it was sitting on after its IPO and transitioned to a Bitcoin treasury. Shortly afterward, it changed its ticker to AsiaStrategy ( SORA ). And besides Bitcoin, do you know what else is similar between them? Neither was working with their previous business models. A quick look at DDC Enterprise's financial statements tells us: Stagnant revenues, even after the IPO; SG&A covering all reported gross profit, resulting in negative EBIT since FY 2020; Significant net loss, reaching an EPS of -$14.95 in FY 2024; Negative OCF, increased by certain fluctuations in operating assets. Consequently, in every year since FY 2020, DDC has not reported a single positive FCF, increasing its long-term debt every year to protect its cash. So, as you can probably guess, much like the former Top Win, DDC Enterprise looks like an easy candidate to turn into a Bitcoin treasury. It raised $33 million in its IPO, but was quickly burning through it in its core business anyway. Where They Are and Where They Want to Go Right now, there are two sources tracking how much BTC DDC has on its books. The first one, from August 25 , notes they picked up another 200 BTC, pushing their total stash to 888 BTC—worth about $98.95 million as of August 28. Since their average price is $107,447, they are up +3.7%. Seeking Alpha Basically, the same press release tells us they have 1,000 shares for 0.106853 BTC. Doing some basic math, we can say that DDC has approximately 8.3 million shares. The second source puts DDC's stash even higher—at 1,008 BTC. That's 120 more than what the last press release mentioned, bringing the total value to about $112.33 million. In this case, the average price per BTC was $103,878, which tells us their position is approximately +7.4%. DDC Enterprise (BitcoinTreasuries.Net) Based on the 8.3 million shares, this second source indicates that DDC has 0.12124 BTC per 1,000 shares. And where do they want to go? According to the CEO, the goal is to reach 5,000 BTC within 36 months. Based on this statement at the end of Q1 FY 2025, DDC intends to reach this goal by mid-FY 2028. Press release (DDC Enterprise) That makes things way simpler—unlike Top Win, we actually know how much BTC they've got and where they're aiming. Right now, DDC sits as the 42nd largest Bitcoin treasury worldwide, and if they push that up to 5,000 BTC, they'd break into the Top 20. BitcoinTreasuries.Net Modeling Some Scenarios for DDC Now that we have our premises on the table: 888/1,008 BTC in treasury today; 5,000 BTC by FY 2028; 8.3 million shares. Currently, DDC has somewhere between 0.000107 and 0.000121 BTC per share today (depending on which source you're looking at). At the current BTC price, we'd be looking at somewhere between $11.95 and $13.50. Essentially, it's trading at no premium to the BTC it owns—or, in the worst-case scenario, at a very small premium. Looking ahead to FY 2028 and estimating dilution of up to 12 million shares (to finance these purchases), we could imagine something close to 0.0004167 BTC per share. If we target BTC at $150,000 three years from now, we'd be talking about $62.50 per share. Applying a 1.5x NAV, this could rise to as high as $93. But remember, we're talking about the future. We need to bring this value into the present. VCs generally use discount rates that vary between 30-50%, and that's what I'll use here: 30% : $32.50; 40% : $24.20; 50% : $18.40. Of course, there are a lot of moving parts here. Beyond the discount rate, we're talking about different BTC price scenarios for FY 2028 ($100K? $200K?), how much dilution they'll need to fund those buys, and even whether they can actually hit that 5,000 BTC mark in the first place. Applying a conservative average between the lower and middle ends of the forecasts for the discount rate, we have a price target of approximately $21.30. Look, that's an upside of 56.6% in three years. It sounds interesting, but honestly, I would prefer to buy BTC directly and self-custody it. That said, my skepticism isn’t about Bitcoin itself—it’s about the company’s long-term strategy.

Investors searching for the best crypto to buy are watching closely as capital rotation flows into MAGACOIN FINANCE , positioning it as one of the strongest opportunities before its presale allocations sell out. Bitcoin Market Update: Holding Strong After Whale-Induced Volatility Bitcoin is currently trading between $111,375 and $112,000 , staging a modest recovery after a severe whale-driven flash crash over the weekend. A massive wallet offloaded 24,000 BTC worth $2.7 billion into the market, causing Bitcoin to tumble from $114,700 to $110,700 within minutes. This liquidation erased $45 billion in crypto market value and triggered $700 million in leveraged liquidations . Despite the panic, Bitcoin bounced back from lows under $109,000 and has gained about 1.14–1.52% in the last 24 hours . Analysts note that the $110,000–$112,000 zone is acting as critical support, with resistance at $113,000 and $116,000. ETF inflows totaling $219 million on August 25 have added fresh momentum, signaling that institutional investors remain confident even in volatile conditions. With a Fear & Greed Index reading of 47 , the market sentiment has cooled from “Greed” to “Neutral”—a zone that historically sets up bullish rebounds. Traders are now eyeing whether Bitcoin can reclaim $113,000 resistance to confirm a recovery trend. BONK Nears Historic Token Burn Amid Corporate Adoption BONK, the Solana-based meme coin, is approaching a 1 million holder milestone that will trigger a 1 trillion token burn valued at $22.81 million . This deflationary event could significantly impact BONK’s tokenomics, reducing circulating supply and potentially boosting long-term value. Currently priced around $0.00002105 , BONK has been volatile—down 32% over the last month and 42% below its all-time high . Yet, corporate adoption has added legitimacy, with Safety Shot Inc. (Nasdaq: SHOT) integrating BONK into a $30 million financing deal. This marks one of the first major corporate treasury moves involving a meme coin. Ecosystem expansion remains strong, with BONK powering platforms like BONK Arena , BONKSOL liquid staking , and validator partnerships. Despite competition from Pump.fun, BONK continues to see institutional accumulation and strategic buybacks that reinforce its position as more than just a meme coin. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Emerging as the Best Crypto to Buy Now While Bitcoin and BONK dominate headlines, the real momentum in presale markets is building around MAGACOIN FINANCE . Positioned as a next-generation DeFi project, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting investors rotating out of volatile assets and into early-stage opportunities with massive upside potential. The project is nearing its last phase of presale, with allocations filling quickly as retail and whale buyers jump in. Investors who profited from Bitcoin’s rebound and BONK’s meme coin wave are now redirecting funds into MAGACOIN FINANCE, fueling presale demand. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out from other projects is its focus on being open and trustworthy. The team has made all development transparent, their smart contract has already passed Hashex.org audit , and the core members are fully KYC-verified. That’s why many investors see it as one of the best crypto to buy right now. The timing couldn’t be better for MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin dominance remains strong at 64% , but investors are diversifying into promising new tokens. BONK’s deflationary burn event highlights how community-driven catalysts can create powerful price action. Against this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a high-upside presale project that many analysts believe could be the best crypto to buy before its public launch. Final Thoughts Bitcoin is holding critical support despite whale-induced volatility, with ETF inflows hinting at resilience. BONK is preparing for a historic 1 trillion token burn while gaining corporate adoption and ecosystem growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing investor attention as presale buyers rush into final allocations, making it one of the best crypto to buy right now. For investors seeking exposure to early-stage growth and presale potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a safe opportunity at the intersection of DeFi innovation, community power, and favorable market conditions.

50896792,569558,1756530036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50896792.jpeg,"The Flippening? Ethereum ETFs Attract $4 Billion This Month, While Bitcoin Products Struggle",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etf-4-billion-month-bitcoin-products/,"Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are set to close August 2025 with total net inflows exceeding $4 billion, significantly outpacing their Bitcoin (BTC) counterparts, which recorded more than $600 million in outflows during the same period. Ethereum ETFs Outshine Bitcoin ETFs According to data from SoSoValue, spot Ethereum ETFs have attracted $4.04 billion in net inflows so far this month. In contrast, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $628 million in net outflows in August. Among Ethereum-focused funds, BlackRock’s ETHA ETF leads the market with $16.88 billion in net assets as of August 28. Grayscale’s ETHE follows with $4.80 billion, while Fidelity’s FETH holds $3.56 billion. The total net assets tied in spot ETH ETFs currently stands slightly above $29.5 billion. This figure represents almost 5.5% of Ethereum’s total market cap. On the Bitcoin side, BlackRock’s IBIT remains the leader with $83.8 billion in net assets, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at $22.45 billion and Grayscale’s GBTC at $20.01 billion. Although BTC ETFs still dominate in overall value, the latest data suggests the gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum investment products is narrowing. If the current momentum continues, August 2025 could mark the month when ETH ETFs outperformed BTC ETFs by their widest margin yet. One of the major factors driving Ethereum ETF inflows is ETH’s growing appeal as a balance sheet asset. Corporate adoption of ETH has accelerated this year, bolstering confidence in its long-term role in institutional portfolios. This year, several notable companies announced plans to add ETH to their balance sheets. For instance, SharpLink Gaming recently doubled down on its ETH bet, adding another 56,533 ETH to enhance its ETH reserves. Similarly, ETHZilla – an Ethereum treasury company – recently increased its total ETH holdings to more than 102,000 ETH. Data from CoinGecko shows that, currently, BitMine is the leading publicly-listed company with the largest ETH reserves – holding over 1.7 million ETH. Will ETH Surge Past $5,000? Institutional sentiment toward ETH continues to strengthen. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck recently described ETH as “the Wall Street token,” highlighting its growing role in enabling stablecoin transfers across financial institutions. Despite its recent rejection from close to $5,000, the overall demand for ETH remains vehemently strong. As a result, ETH reserves on exchange continue to dwindle at a rapid pace, which may lead to quick price appreciation for the digital asset in the near-term.

A single comment from Musk has often been enough to drive sharp price movements in DOGE, making him one of the most influential voices in the crypto industry. This raises an important question: what might happen if Musk were to apply the same level of attention to XRP? The Dogecoin Effect Dogecoin’s history shows the outsized role Musk has played in its valuation. His first public reference to the token came in April 2019, after which its price nearly doubled within three days. Subsequent tweets often produced immediate rallies, with several examples standing out. In December 2020, a short statement from Musk was enough to push DOGE up 20% in a matter of hours. By February 2021, when he referred to it as the “people’s crypto,” the coin gained more than 40% overnight. The peak of his influence came during the spring of 2021, when a tweet suggesting Dogecoin was “barking at the moon” coincided with the token’s surge to its record high of $0.73, representing gains of over 12,000% compared to its price at the start of that year. Musk’s influence extended beyond social media commentary. In January 2022, he announced that Tesla would accept Dogecoin for merchandise, driving another immediate price increase. A year later, in March 2023, his decision to briefly change Twitter’s logo to the Dogecoin mascot sent the coin up by 30% within hours. Even more recently, his involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative in 2024 and its launch in early 2025 gave the coin renewed attention, although the momentum did not last long. Over the same period, XRP has moved much more gradually. In April 2019, XRP was priced around $0.30. Today, it trades near $3.00, a 920% increase. Dogecoin , in comparison, has jumped from about $0.004 to nearly $0.22, a gain of over 5,700%. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What If Musk Promoted XRP? Unlike with Dogecoin, Musk has never directly commented on XRP. However, if he were to begin actively promoting it, the market response could be substantial. To explore this possibility, Google’s Gemini chatbot was asked to calculate potential outcomes. It suggested that if XRP experienced the same percentage increase as Dogecoin during its Musk-fueled rallies, the token could theoretically rise from $3.00 to approximately $175.92. However, Gemini stressed that the figure is hypothetical and should not be treated as a forecast. Cryptocurrency prices are influenced by multiple variables, including regulatory decisions, institutional adoption, and overall market sentiment. For XRP in particular, one key factor has been the resolution of Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has provided greater regulatory clarity for the asset. This clarity may encourage banks and payment providers to expand their use of XRP in cross-border settlements , strengthening its role as a utility-driven token. Combined with broader market dynamics, such as potential rallies in Bitcoin and Ethereum that typically lift other altcoins, XRP could see stronger growth regardless of Musk’s involvement. While Musk’s influence on Dogecoin is undeniable, applying the same trajectory to XRP is highly speculative. Even so, if he were to shift attention toward XRP, the token would likely benefit from increased exposure and retail participation. When combined with its established role in payment systems and improving regulatory position, such a scenario could significantly enhance its market profile.

Tether’s USDT has taken it back after a few months of being fourth, as its own market cap has grown to $167,613,338 on CoinGecko. Recall that XRP skyrocketed to a new all-time high of $3.65 in mid-July after it broke out of its consolidation phase at around $2.2. Since then, though, the asset has failed to maintain its run and has frequently dropped below the crucial $3 support line. The past 24-36 hours were not kind to the entire cryptocurrency market, and XRP was not spared. As BTC dumped to a seven-week low, Ripple’s cross-border token followed suit and slipped to $2.73 for the first time since August 3. Despite recovering some ground to trade at just over $2.8 as of press time, XRP is still 4% down on the day and 6% weekly. Ripple has also lost traction on the global assets’ scale. The company and its token, which had entered the top 100 assets by market cap after the July rally, have now dropped out of that prestigious club and are down to the 121st spot, according to 8marketcap. Although Ripple is still above the likes of Sony, Airbus, Allianz, and Accenture, it has lost positioning to Charles Schwab, BlackRock, and Xiaomi.

A recent announcement from El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) has captured global attention: a groundbreaking move to fortify its national Bitcoin reserves. This strategic shift, known as El Salvador Bitcoin distribution , aims to safeguard the nation’s holdings against potential future threats, specifically from the advancement of quantum computing. This proactive measure highlights El Salvador’s commitment to pioneering secure and resilient crypto adoption on a national scale. Understanding El Salvador’s Strategic Bitcoin Distribution El Salvador, a nation that boldly adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, continues to lead in digital asset innovation. The ONBTC revealed on X that the government is systematically moving its Bitcoin from a single large wallet into numerous smaller ones. This isn’t just a technical adjustment; it’s a critical security upgrade. Each of these new wallets will hold a maximum of 500 BTC. With El Salvador holding approximately 6,227.18 BTC as of August 23, this means their entire reserve will be spread across at least 13 separate wallets (6227.18 / 500 ≈ 12.45). This careful fragmentation is a direct response to an emerging global concern. Why is Quantum Computing a Threat to Bitcoin? You might be wondering, “What exactly is quantum computing, and why does it matter for Bitcoin?” In simple terms, quantum computers are incredibly powerful machines that can perform calculations far beyond the capabilities of today’s traditional computers. While still in early stages, a fully developed quantum computer could theoretically break the cryptographic algorithms that secure Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s security relies on complex mathematical problems that are currently impossible for even the most powerful supercomputers to solve quickly. However, a quantum computer could potentially crack these encryptions, making private keys vulnerable and potentially allowing unauthorized access to funds. This isn’t an immediate threat, but El Salvador is looking ahead. Benefits of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Distribution Strategy This forward-thinking approach by El Salvador offers several significant advantages: Enhanced Security: By distributing its Bitcoin across multiple wallets, El Salvador significantly reduces the risk of a single point of failure. If one wallet were ever compromised (hypothetically, by a quantum attack), the vast majority of their holdings would remain secure in other wallets. Mitigated Quantum Risk: This proactive measure positions El Salvador at the forefront of preparing for quantum threats. It buys time for the development of quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions. Increased Resilience: Spreading assets improves overall system resilience against various types of attacks, not just quantum ones. It makes large-scale theft much more difficult and less appealing. Setting a Precedent: El Salvador’s move could serve as a valuable blueprint for other nations or large institutional holders of Bitcoin, encouraging them to adopt similar robust security practices. This strategic move underscores the nation’s commitment to protecting its digital economy. The El Salvador Bitcoin distribution plan demonstrates a deep understanding of evolving technological landscapes and potential vulnerabilities. What are the Challenges and Considerations? While the benefits are clear, such a large-scale security upgrade isn’t without its considerations: Management Complexity: Managing multiple wallets, each with its own private key, introduces a higher level of administrative complexity. Securely storing and accessing these keys becomes paramount. Operational Overhead: There’s an increased operational overhead associated with monitoring and maintaining numerous wallets compared to a single, consolidated one. Key Management: The secure generation, storage, and backup of many private keys is a critical challenge. Any error could lead to irreversible loss of funds. However, given the stakes, these challenges are manageable with stringent protocols and advanced security practices. El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office is likely implementing sophisticated key management solutions to ensure the integrity of their distributed holdings. El Salvador’s Vision for Future-Proofing Bitcoin El Salvador’s proactive stance on El Salvador Bitcoin distribution is a testament to its long-term vision for Bitcoin adoption. They are not just holding Bitcoin; they are actively working to make it more secure and sustainable for the future. This move signals confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term viability, even in the face of advanced technological threats. This innovative approach to security demonstrates leadership in the global crypto space. It’s a powerful statement that Bitcoin, when managed strategically, can be a secure and reliable asset for national treasuries. The focus on mitigating quantum computing risks positions El Salvador as a thought leader in digital asset security. In conclusion, El Salvador’s decision to distribute its Bitcoin holdings is a groundbreaking security measure designed to protect its national assets from the theoretical future threat of quantum computing. By fragmenting its substantial Bitcoin reserves across numerous wallets, each capped at 500 BTC, the nation is proactively enhancing its digital security posture. This bold and strategic move reinforces El Salvador’s role as a pioneer in national Bitcoin adoption and sets a compelling example for responsible cryptocurrency management in an ever-evolving technological landscape. It’s a powerful demonstration of their unwavering commitment to safeguarding their digital future. Frequently Asked Questions About El Salvador’s Bitcoin Security What is El Salvador doing with its Bitcoin holdings?

Both are leading Layer 1 blockchain projects , each promising faster speeds, lower fees, and massive adoption. As investors seek the best altcoin to buy now, the competition between these two heavyweights is shaping the future of decentralized finance, gaming, and tokenization. At the same time, new players like MAGACOIN FINANCE are quietly drawing attention from whales, with growing speculation it could be a best crypto to buy now contender backed by its strong roadmap and a successful HashEx audit . Avalanche’s Institutional Bet and 2025 Price Potential When it comes to Avalanche, the project has carved out a reputation as a hub for real-world asset tokenization. In fact, industry updates highlight that AVAX is leading the Layer 1 blockchain projects category for institutional adoption. SkyBridge Capital recently tokenized $300 million in hedge funds on Avalanche using the ERC-3643 standard. Even giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are building tokenized investment products on the network. AVAX price analysis by Posty Momentum is already visible, with analyst Posty noting AVAX is “setting up nicely” with higher lows built over the summer. Meanwhile, Lennaert Snyder highlighted that AVAX transactions spiked +74% in the last 7 days , pushing the chain to the top spot in weekly transaction growth. Analysts at Blockchain.News suggest an Avalanche price prediction 2025 in the $40–$50 range if it can break past the $25.99 resistance and maintain its technical strength. For investors looking at the best altcoin to buy now , AVAX’s positioning in real-world finance gives it a strong case. Solana’s Rise and 2025 Breakout Predictions On the other side of the Solana vs Avalanche discussion, Solana is gaining attention for its speed, low fees, and strong community — the “Floki Vikings” and broader SOL supporters have kept the network in the spotlight. The chain is seeing greater developer activity, with decentralized apps, NFTs, and DeFi protocols choosing it for scalability. SOL price analysis by Quinten Market analysts are optimistic too. Quinten noted that “SOL looks very ready for a breakout” and highlighted $225 and $260 as the next key levels to watch. Sensei also pointed out that SOL shows more strength than even BTC and ETH , suggesting money could be rotating into Solana, with a potential target around $250 before considering profit-taking. According to InvestingHaven, the Solana price prediction 2025 places SOL between $255–$480, supported by a developing cup-and-handle chart structure. For many, Solana is looking like a strong candidate for the top altcoins to buy in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A New Challenger for 2025 While Avalanche and Solana dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly catching attention as an under-the-radar play. What’s making whales take notice is the project’s transparent roadmap, clear team details, and its successful HashEx smart-contract audit, which gives credibility to its long-term potential. Analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE could be a sharper bet than crowded Layer-1 plays , with whispers of it being a 40x gainer . Unlike many speculative tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing “smart money” that is diversifying into this project for 2025. For investors hunting the best altcoin to buy now , it’s being considered as a strategic hedge alongside Solana and Avalanche. Final Word: Solana vs Avalanche, or MAGACOIN’s Ascent? The Solana vs Avalanche contest is intensifying. Solana could benefit from an ETF approval wave and institutional treasuries, fueling its bullish Solana price prediction 2025 of up to $480. Avalanche is carving a niche with tokenization, backed by surging activity and an Avalanche price prediction 2025 in the $40–$50 range. Yet, while both remain strong top altcoins to buy 2025 , MAGACOIN FINANCE is building quiet momentum of its own. With whale interest, a transparent foundation, and the security of a HashEx audit, it’s shaping up as one of the best crypto to buy now for investors seeking asymmetric upside.

In 2025, more investors than ever are entering the space to capitalise on higher prices and other new projects. Traders with limited experience may be vulnerable to fraud. Investors must tread carefully; the landscape is littered with fake exchanges and Ponzi schemes that can cost them everything. Learning how to recognize red flags is essential. The cryptocurrency space does not have the same level of regulatory protection as traditional finance. It is nearly impossible to recover stolen funds after they have been taken. That’s why staying informed is your first line of defense. Common Types of Scams Crypto scams often fall into familiar categories. A rug pull is when a project’s developers abandon it while pulling the liquidity. Phishing scams use replicas of emails and websites to fool users into giving away their private key. Groups engage in pump-and-dump schemes, promoting and dumping small coins on strict buyers. People still use fake giveaways that promise free Bitcoin and Ethereum. The good news is, most of these scams have prominent warning signs. If an offer sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Do not trust unrealistic promises of guaranteed returns, teams with no established identity or track record, and projects with no clear roadmap. Why Due Diligence Matters In a market where anyone can launch a token, research is critical before investment. You can learn a great deal about the project by reviewing its whitepaper and social media channels. Scammers cheat a lot, real projects focus on transparency. The search for verifiable partnership through independent audits is another method of identifying opportunities from fraud. One of the Safest Crypto Projects Today Investors are turning to projects with built-in safeguards as scams become more sophisticated. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a prime example of the above in 2025, having garnered the attention of many through its ecosystem. MAGACOIN FINANCE is unlike projects that layer on hype; we are publicly building a sustainable ecosystem. The early estimates predict higher profits for the early supporters. However, what makes this idea different from others is that the early development comes from solid ground, not empty ground. In a market where scams can wipe out portfolios overnight, choosing projects that prioritize security and accountability is one of the smartest moves an investor can make. Conclusion Even though crypto scams take place, it doesn’t mean that crypto isn’t good for you. Thus, by learning the warning signs, performing proper due diligence, and concentrating on trustworthy projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, you can safeguard your investments while also benefiting from the incredible potential of 2025.

50899594,https://thecoinrise.com/beyond-hype-how-blockdags-386m-presale-puts-monero-and-avalanche-in-the-rearview-for-2025/,1756533603,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/50899594.jpeg,Beyond Hype: How BlockDAG’s $386M Presale Puts Monero and Avalanche in the Rearview for 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/beyond-hype-how-blockdags-386m-presale-puts-monero-and-avalanche-in-the-rearview-for-2025/,"Crypto markets thrive on momentum, and right now three names are pulling focus: Monero (XMR), Avalanche (AVAX), and BlockDAG (BDAG). Each represents a different force driving the market: Monero through its privacy-first model, Avalanche via institutional capital flows, and BlockDAG (BDAG) with one of the largest presales of 2025. Monero is pushing against major resistance levels that could spark a breakout. Avalanche has captured Wall Street’s imagination with a $300 million allocation, cementing its status as a serious Layer-1 contender. Yet it is BlockDAG’s staggering presale achievements,$386 million raised, 25.6 billion tokens sold, and a 2,900% ROI since batch one, that are defining the current presale conversation. With its mining products, live dashboard, and confirmed listings, BlockDAG has become the name traders can’t afford to overlook. Monero (XMR) Price Action: Privacy Coin in Focus Monero continues to command attention as it consolidates near the $262 level, with critical resistance zones waiting at $315 and $421. Analysts believe a push above these levels could ignite a fresh rally, cementing its reputation as the dominant privacy coin in an era of growing regulatory scrutiny. What makes Monero’s story compelling is its resilience. Despite pressure from regulators and exchanges, its decentralized model and dedicated community support have kept demand steady. Traders know that while oversight may intensify, Monero’s niche, financial privacy, remains a unique value proposition that other tokens cannot easily replicate. Technical charts suggest the $262 level is pivotal. A breakout could see momentum carry the price toward $315 quickly, adding fuel to speculative buzz. Failure to hold, however, risks pushing Monero back into consolidation, frustrating those betting on immediate action. For now, Monero remains a high-stakes watch for market participants drawn to volatility and utility in equal measure. Avalanche (AVAX) News: Wall Street Confidence Sparks Excitement Avalanche has surged into headlines after SkyBridge announced a massive $300 million allocation into its ecosystem. This bold move has been interpreted as a vote of confidence from traditional finance, a sign that Wall Street sees long-term value in Avalanche’s scalability and DeFi ecosystem. The news has fueled speculation that AVAX could push toward $50 in 2025. Analysts argue that Avalanche’s expanding developer activity and strong community of builders set the foundation for sustained growth. With its sub-second transaction speeds and interoperability, it remains one of the most credible Layer-1 competitors in the space. Still, maintaining momentum won’t be easy. Avalanche must balance its institutional endorsements with the unpredictable nature of crypto markets. For traders, however, the mix of technical strength and Wall Street backing makes AVAX one of the most exciting tokens to track heading into the new year. BlockDAG (BDAG): The Presale That Changed the Conversation While Monero and Avalanche generate steady buzz, BlockDAG has flipped the narrative around presales. With $386 million raised, batch 30 tokens priced at $0.03, and more than 25.6 billion sold, BDAG has turned heads with scale and speed unmatched by its peers. Early backers from batch one at $0.001 are sitting on 2,900% gains before launch. Unlike many presales that rely only on promises, BlockDAG has delivered tangible progress throughout its fundraising journey. Its presale dashboard offers live updates, wallet tracking, and gamified leaderboards, creating a transparent and engaging user experience that feels more like a live exchange than a typical presale page. BlockDAG has also rolled out real mining products. The X1 app miner and X10 hardware miner allow participants to generate up to 200 BDAG per day. With $7.8M in sales across 19,500 units, these tools prove the project is already building a working ecosystem. This combination of mining utility and presale transparency is rare in early-stage crypto. Looking ahead, confirmed listings on around twenty centralized exchanges ensure strong liquidity and accessibility from day one. For a project still in presale, this level of preparation puts BlockDAG in a league of its own. Community features like Buyer Battles, which reward the day’s top buyer with unsold allocations, add gamification that keeps engagement high. Combined with educational efforts through BlockDAG Academy, the project is building not just hype but infrastructure that fosters growth and loyalty. With a listing price target of $0.05, analysts speculate BlockDAG could climb toward $1 if adoption continues to accelerate. Wrap-Up Monero is holding strong as privacy demand collides with technical setups, while Avalanche has earned the attention of institutional giants. Both are important pieces of the broader market puzzle. But BlockDAG is rewriting presale expectations altogether. With $386M raised, 25.6B tokens sold, a 2,900% ROI already achieved, $7.8M in miner sales, and batch 30 priced at $0.03, it is more than a speculative token; it’s an ecosystem in motion. Where Monero thrives on niche utility and Avalanche banks on institutional adoption, BlockDAG thrives on transparency, live tools, mining products, and unmatched presale traction. For those scanning the market for the next breakout story, BlockDAG has already claimed the spotlight, and the speculation is only heating up.

According to CoinGlass, 24-hour crypto liquidations neared $540 million as selling pressure intensified on major exchanges. Related Reading: A New Vision For Money: Hoskinson Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $10 Trillion Whales And Exchange Distribution Pressure Based on reports from market watchers, heavy selling by large holders helped push the drop. Distribution on Binance was highlighted by traders as a key factor that worsened losses. Bitcoin lost nearly 5% on the day, and some large accounts were linked to the wave of sales that triggered stop orders and quick exits. Popular trader Daan Crypto Trades pointed to a “key reversal zone” around recent ranges and consolidation levels. Some experts had similar price levels on his radar, noting that Bitcoin failed to turn $112,000 into support. Other voices in the market flagged $114,000 as an important weekly close threshold for bulls. Bullish RSI Divergence Keeps A Sliver Of Hope Technical watchers found one bright spot. According to crypto commentator Javon Marks, the four-hour chart still shows a bullish RSI divergence — a pattern where the RSI makes higher lows while price makes lower lows. That setup can hint at an early reversal. $BTC Good area to keep watching. Right on top of the previous range & consolidation area. https://t.co/WEaG2IF6nV pic.twitter.com/Y7RftSqDio — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) August 29, 2025 Marks argued Bitcoin could stage a rebound. He suggested a move back toward $123,000 is possible, which would be roughly a +14% jump from current levels. That projection is optimistic, and it rests on momentum flipping quickly in favor of buyers. Macro Data, Seasonal Weakness Add Headwinds Seasonality and macroeconomic data added pressure. September has historically been one of Bitcoin’s weaker months, and investors were watching US inflation readings closely. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, matched expectations and showed signs of an inflation rebound. Still, the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool showed markets pricing in rate cuts in September, a factor that could help risk assets like crypto if it holds.

If Bitcoin can reclaim $112,000 and hold a weekly close above $114,000, bulls would gain breathing room. If those levels fail, more downside is possible and short-term traders could face further liquidations. For now, the market looks tight. Some technical signals point to a rebound, but macro data and big sellers are keeping the mood cautious. Traders and investors alike are watching both price action and economic prints closely as the US heads toward key data and the Fed decision window on Sept. 17.

Technical indicators, whale activity, and ETF-driven inflows are combining to push valuations higher as the final quarter of the year approaches. Ethereum and Solana remain central to institutional strategies, but a fast-rising presale — MAGACOIN FINANCE — is starting to dominate conversations around breakout opportunities. Alongside Aptos, Dogecoin, Hyperliquid, and Cardano, these seven tokens represent the most-watched altcoins this month. Ethereum (ETH) — Institutional Cornerstone Ethereum continues to anchor the market as the largest smart contract blockchain, with its market capitalization surpassing $380 billion. Analysts forecast ETH trading between $4,545 and $5,319 in September, with technicals tilting bullish after strong ETF inflows through Q3. The network’s expansion is being supported by Layer-2 scaling, which is lowering fees and boosting throughput. Billions remain locked in DeFi, and Ethereum’s role as the backbone for tokenized assets and stablecoin settlement has only grown. While its upside is less explosive than smaller altcoins, ETH remains the preferred long-term hold for funds seeking a combination of liquidity, adoption, and institutional credibility. Solana (SOL) — Scalability and ETF Tailwinds Solana has continued to prove itself as the fastest-growing Layer-1 ecosystem, regularly processing 100,000+ transactions per second at negligible cost. Its developer migration trend has strengthened, with major DeFi and NFT projects opting to build on Solana for speed and scale. SOL is currently consolidating around $181, with analysts pointing to a potential breakout above $186 that could drive momentum toward $200. Institutional confidence is rising as Solana ETFs attract inflows, underscoring the blockchain’s position as one of the most scalable platforms for the next cycle of growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE (Presale) — A Verified Breakout Candidate This month’s top analyst picks include the usual leaders, but attention is also shifting toward a hidden presale that is capturing outsized inflows. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being recognized as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 , with forecasts of up to 700x returns driving rapid demand from early investors. Unlike many meme-driven tokens, MAGACOIN has emphasized legitimacy from the outset. The project has undergone independent audits and built a fast-growing community that now rivals established altcoins in scale and reach. These steps have strengthened confidence that the presale is not just speculative hype but a structured effort with staying power. Backed by whale participation and retail enthusiasm, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the presale to watch this September. Analysts highlight its ability to combine meme-energy appeal with verified transparency, creating a rare mix of credibility and high-upside potential. Aptos (APT) — Layer-1 Challenger Aptos continues to attract attention as a next-generation Layer-1 blockchain with a focus on speed and DeFi applications. The token is trading near $11, with resistance forming around $12.50. Developer growth remains steady, particularly in DeFi, where Aptos is gaining traction as an alternative to Solana and Ethereum. While not expected to deliver parabolic gains in September, analysts see Aptos as a slow-burn play with strong long-term potential for adoption. Dogecoin (DOGE) — Meme Energy Revival Dogecoin has stabilized around $0.21, with bullish targets set near $0.28. Renewed meme activity across social platforms and consistent liquidity inflows have helped DOGE recapture attention heading into September. While its value remains tied to retail energy rather than fundamentals, analysts note that Dogecoin continues to prove resilient as a cultural asset. Its large user base and brand recognition keep it a recurring candidate for speculative rallies. Hyperliquid — Exchange-Focused Growth Hyperliquid has been cited by analysts as one of the boldest bets for September. Positioned as a derivatives-driven exchange ecosystem, it is attracting attention for innovative approaches to trading infrastructure. Although highly speculative, its appeal lies in the potential to disrupt a crowded exchange-token market. For investors seeking high risk and high reward, Hyperliquid offers asymmetric upside. Cardano — The Disruptive Entrant Cardano is another altcoin project appearing in analyst lists this month. Marketed as a disruptive entrant with a focus on liquidity mechanics and launch innovation, it is being positioned as a dark horse alongside MAGACOIN FINANCE. The Charles Hoskinson-led project has gained visibility among investors searching for the next major early-stage play. Like others, its risk profile is moderate, but so is the potential upside if adoption accelerates. Conclusion — Leaders and Breakouts Ethereum and Solana remain the core of September’s altcoin lineup, offering stability, scale, and institutional trust. Aptos, Dogecoin, and Hyperliquid add depth for investors seeking alternative plays across memes, DeFi, and exchanges. But the strongest attention is turning toward presales — with MAGACOIN FINANCE leading as an audited and fast-growing crypto project positioned for outsized returns. The asset represents the most speculative but potentially most rewarding category of September’s best altcoins to buy.

While the token has attracted a mass following, current market trends project that investor attention has started shifting to projects offering more practical solutions. Remittix (RTX) is one such project, a payments-focused project which is emerging as a best crypto presale 2025 winner. Pepe Coin Price Action In The Spotlight Pepe Coin’s price is $0.000059829, a decline of 2.9% in the last 24 hours. It has a market capitalization of $4.13 billion and 24-hour trading volume of $531.16 million, down by 5.14%. These figures indicate ongoing volatility and demonstrate how susceptible meme coins are to changing sentiment. As Pepe Coin news continues to dominate headlines, many traders are thinking about whether or not speculative assets can deliver long-term returns. This has spurred debate on the next 100x crypto and has brought attention to early stage crypto investment opportunities with real-world use cases. Milestone Unlocks Wider Market Access Remittix (RTX) is priced at $0.1000 per token and has already secured over $22.2 million in its ongoing presale, with over 630 million tokens sold so far. Reaching the $20 million milestone led to the announcement of its initial centralized exchange (CEX) listing on BitMart. A second listing was subsequently announced on LBank, further expanding liquidity and investor accessibility. This steady growth puts Remittix among the best crypto to invest in today for those who are keeping an eye on upcoming crypto ventures. Contrary to meme coins, RTX combines long-term tokenomics with usability, which appeals to investors looking for more than fleeting hype. Wallet Beta Launch And Real-World Utility The biggest milestone can be the beta launch of the Remittix wallet in Q3 2025. It’s a mobile-led product that supports over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies, direct crypto-to-bank transfers and instant FX conversion. With its focus on low gas fees and frictionless cross-border payments, Remittix is building infrastructure that is targeted at resolving one of the largest problems in global finance. The wallet will simplify how freelancers, remitters and businesses make transactions, making RTX a low cap crypto gem that solves real-world problems. With security strengthened by a CertiK audit, Remittix is being recognized as the best DeFi altcoin 2025 that combines innovation with trust. The Catalysts Accelerating Remittix’s Traction: Over $22.3 million raised and 630 million+ tokens sold Initial CEX listing on BitMart announced, followed by a second announced on LBank Wallet beta launch secured for Q3 2025 $250,000 Remittix Giveaway driving community growth In light of Pepe Coin headlines focusing on risk and volatility linked with meme coins, smart funds are increasingly gravitating towards projects like Remittix aimed at practical application.

In his most recent market briefing, Pal described the digital asset space as a sequence of staggered rallies, with each token moving at different points in the cycle. XRP’s Current Position in the Market According to Pal, Ethereum has already transitioned into its expansion phase, while Solana and Sui are next in line. He believes XRP has also begun shifting out of consolidation, despite showing a 3.98% decline in August 2025. The token had previously gained more than 35% in July, a performance he sees as the early stage of a larger upward movement. His assessment follows Bitcoin’s climb to a record high above $124,000 before a pullback that redirected market interest toward altcoins. Historically, this type of rotation, where profits from Bitcoin are redistributed into other tokens, has fueled altcoin rallies. Pal expects XRP to be one of the primary beneficiaries of the current phase.

The analysis highlights a recurring pattern in which long periods of sideways movement within wedge or triangle formations precede significant price advances. The first major example occurred between 2014 and early 2017, when XRP remained compressed inside a large descending triangle before breaking out and reaching $3.30 in January 2018. Following that rally, the token corrected for several years, forming a falling wedge that concluded in late 2020. The breakout from that pattern pushed XRP to nearly $2 in April 2021. From 2021 to late 2024, XRP entered another extended consolidation phase within a descending triangle. A breakout in November 2024 drove the token above key resistance levels at $1, $2, and $3. Currently, XRP is trading just under $3, forming a narrower triangular pattern. Analysts note that this structure resembles a pennant, which in technical terms often indicates the continuation of an existing trend. A confirmed breakout could validate Pal’s view of an ongoing upward move, while a breakdown might send the token back toward the $1.70–$2.00 range. Broader Market and Liquidity Conditions Beyond XRP, Pal emphasized that global liquidity trends play a critical role in shaping crypto cycles. He pointed to the strong relationship between Bitcoin and the growth of the global money supply, specifically the M2 metric. Historically , Bitcoin tends to rise about twelve weeks after liquidity expands, with capital eventually flowing into other digital assets such as XRP.

This process requires continued liquidity support from central banks, creating favorable conditions for risk assets, such as cryptocurrencies. Combined with improving regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and sovereign-level interest in digital assets, he believes the current environment is similar to the 2017 altcoin rally. Pal’s research at Global Macro Investor suggests that the present bull market may extend into the first half of 2026. He argues that slower global economic growth will likely force policymakers to maintain accommodative policies, prolonging the flow of capital into speculative markets. He maintains that the acceleration phase of this cycle began in mid-2024 and expects it to intensify in the coming quarters, with XRP well-positioned to benefit from the shift.

Data from whale trackers shows that large holders of both ADA and XRP are diversifying into a rising altcoin, Remittix (RTX) , signaling confidence in its growth potential and real-world utility. Cardano Newest Updates Signal a Big Rebound Cardano updates show ADA trading around $0.821. The community remains optimistic, expecting Cardano to pass its 2021 all-time high of $3.10. Some even expect the token to maybe even reach $4 by the end of the year. Mintern highlighted this hopeful outlook in an August 28 tweet, emphasizing ADA’s potential for new growth. Analysts point to strong technical formations, including an ascending wedge and a retest above the $1 mark, which could support a move toward $1.50–$1.60 before breaking the old ATH of $3.09. Cardano newest updates suggest that the recent price decline is temporary, and momentum is likely to return soon, but this doesn’t stop investors from looking into Remittix. source: GoneLiminal on TradingView XRP Latest News Indicates Potential Breakout Turning to XRP latest news, XRP is trading at around $2.87. Market strategist Raoul Pal described the crypto market as a “waiting room,” noting that assets are preparing for staged growth. XRP has experienced a 3.98% dip this month, following a 35% rally in July 2025. Analysts argue that XRP is now entering a “full port” phase, signaling a continuation of its breakout into higher levels. According to technical analysis, XRP is in its fifth wave, forming a weekly bull flag. If resistance holds, XRP could surge to $5.50. Conversely, a failure to maintain structure may see prices return toward the $1.7–$2 support zone.

He further posed the question of whether this could mark the beginning of other Japanese companies similarly entering XRP markets. According to the official statement attached to the tweet, the decision forms part of the company’s broader growth strategy for its blockchain business. Gumi specified that the XRP ecosystem plays a central role in remittance and liquidity network strategies that are being advanced by SBI Holdings. The company emphasized that this purchase is linked to revenue growth opportunities in the blockchain sector, which it views as a key area for business development going forward. BREAKING: JAPANESE GAMING COMPANY CONFIRMS THEY WILL PURCHASE 2.5 BILLION YEN WORTH OF $XRP ! IS THIS THE BEGINNING OF JAPANESE COMAPNIES BUYING XRP? Comment Below & Follow For More!! pic.twitter.com/R6djLeWE2p — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) August 29, 2025 Reactions from the XRP Community The post also included comments from X users who gave their perspectives on the development. One user, Eden dna, addressed the amount directly and criticized others for minimizing its relevance, stating : “I can’t believe that people in the comments saying it’s only 17m lmao this is a company in Japan that no one of y’all heard about buying 17fknm …. y’all trippin.” This response underscored the idea that while the purchase might appear modest in U.S. dollar terms, it still represents a notable move for a Japanese gaming company. Another user, Niflhel, placed the news in the context of broader trends across Asia, commenting : “We’ve seen this trend building in Asia, where efficiency trumps hype. XRP’s chart is screaming breakout potential, and moves like this from corporates signal the shift from speculation to real utility.” This interpretation suggested that the purchase could reflect a wider corporate alignment toward digital asset use cases beyond speculation, particularly in markets where remittance and liquidity efficiencies are increasingly important. Strategic Significance for Blockchain Growth The information shared by Abs indicates that Gumi’s decision is structured and deliberately framed within its blockchain strategy and connected to existing financial network developments in Japan through SBI Holdings . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The size of the purchase, set at 2.5 billion yen, represents approximately 17 million U.S. dollars, and positions the company among Japanese corporations making direct allocations into digital assets with defined business goals. Whether this development signals the beginning of further corporate adoption in Japan remains to be seen. However, the official announcement, together with the framing provided by Abs, positions Gumi’s move as both a strategic purchase and a potential indicator of how Japanese companies may begin to engage with the XRP ecosystem in line with their blockchain and financial technology ambitions.

This capital rotation has sparked speculations around where the next big opportunities could emerge from. Analysts have spotlighted crypto presales as the next goldmine for retail investors. In that conversation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the name coming up, with many calling it one of the b , based on its credibility and potential. Ethereum Traders Seek Early Opportunities Ethereum has been steady between $4,400 and $4,600, climbing 17% over the past month. Analysts forecast further upside to $5,300 by late September, driven by staking inflows and institutional accumulation. Long-term predictions stretch even higher, with calls for $7,000–$8,000 in 2026 and beyond. Despite short-term corrections, Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong. This has many ETH holders searching for early-stage projects where smaller allocations could outperform. That’s where presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE enter the conversation. Solana Investors Rotate Into Presales Meanwhile, Solana is trading close to $188–$190, recovering from support near $160. With ETF filings pending and whale accumulation increasing, analysts expect SOL could retest the $200–$220 zone soon. Futures open interest on CME has surged, signaling heightened institutional engagement. Still, retail traders are hunting diversification. Many Solana wallets are allocating into presales, aiming for higher multiples than mature assets can deliver. This has led to growing crossover interest in MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential best altcoin to buy during this cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: How to Buy Into the Presale The influx of Ethereum and Solana traders into MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught the attention of the entire crypto market. Data shows that many investors and enthusiasts are tracking projects, and newer investors are looking for a way to get in. The momentum around the project is not surprising.

Buying MAGACOIN FINANCE is straightforward: Set up a compatible crypto wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Fund the wallet with ETH or SOL through a trusted exchange. Visit the official MAGACOIN FINANCE website and connect your wallet. Swap ETH or SOL directly for MAGA tokens in the presale interface. Early investors can still take advantage of a limited-time offer of a 50% EXTRA bonus by using the code PATRIOT50X. The window of opportunity is fast closing, and only those who act early will benefit from MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum. Why Analysts Call It a Standout With ETH and SOL traders already rotating capital into the project, analysts suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could become a breakout contender in 2025—making it one of the best crypto presales to buy now for investors who prioritize both growth and legitimacy.

This isn’t just another memecoin; it’s Layer Brett (LBRETT), a bold new contender swiftly closing the gap on established giants, forcing a re-evaluation of every Cardano (ADA) price prediction out there and its crypto presale is live right now. What makes Layer Brett a standout Layer 2 crypto? The crypto world often feels like a crowded marketplace, doesn’t it? But what if something truly different emerged? Ethereum’s Layer 1, while robust, often grinds to a halt under heavy traffic, making transactions painfully slow and expensive. Layer Brett, however, bypasses these bottlenecks. Consider Pepe coin (PEPE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), or Bonk (BONK) —fun, sure, but often lacking deep utility. Even Brett (original) on Base suffered from this. Layer Brett changes the game, offering a DeFi ecosystem designed for performance. This ERC-20 token is purpose-built to escape the limitations of utility-free meme tokens, offering a next big crypto experience that merges the best of meme culture with genuine technological advancement. Why investors are looking towards LBRETT after disappointing Cardano price predictions For years, Cardano (ADA) has been a staple in many portfolios, boasting a significant market cap of $30.00 billion. Partnerships, such as the one with Serpro in Brazil, show Cardano’s commitment to real-world adoption. Yet, even with these advancements, Cardano price sits at $0.8576, a far cry from its all-time high of $3.10 back in 2021. This moderate Cardano news and incremental Cardano upgrade progress leaves some investors longing for more immediate, explosive growth. Enter Layer Brett, a genuine low cap crypto gem. While Cardano battles for incremental gains in a mature market, Layer Brett’s crypto presale price of just $0.005 per token presents a stark contrast in growth potential. Investors are seeing the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a trending cryptocurrency before it potentially explodes in the crypto bull run 2025. Unpacking Layer Brett’s killer features and staking rewards Layer Brett isn’t just talking the talk; it walks with purpose. This Ethereum Layer 2 project boasts several compelling value propositions that set it apart. Built on Layer 2 Ethereum: Enjoy blazing-fast, secure transactions with near-zero fees. This is the ultimate escape from congested chains. Presale Access: Dive into the crypto presale now at early-entry pricing, positioning yourself for potential next 100x altcoin gains. The project has already raised over $9 million. Staking Benefits: Early buyers can earn incredible rewards, with an APY of 1,490% in the initial stages. Urgency is key, as these rates decline as more participants join. This is serious staking crypto. Memecoin Energy, Real Utility: Unlike traditional meme tokens, Layer Brett is tech-backed, offering a unique blend of fun and function. The transparent tokenomics, with a fixed supply of 10 billion LBRETT tokens, are designed for community empowerment. You can easily buy and stake Layer Brett in seconds using ETH, USDT, or BNB via MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Plus, there’s even a $1 million giveaway to participate in, adding another layer of excitement. Layer Brett aims to rival established Layer 2s like Optimism and Arbitrum, but with a community-first approach and a meme-born identity. Explosive Growth starts with Utility Memecoin Energy The opportunity for explosive growth with Layer Brett, compared to the steady but perhaps slower trajectory of ADA, is undeniable. Layer Brett is still in its presale stages —but time is running out. Closer to $2 million has already been invested early doors. Don’t miss your chance to secure an early stake in this scalable meme token project designed to reshape Web3 utility. Get involved now, before the window closes! Get in now to stake, earn massive rewards , and ride what could be the most scalable meme project ever to launch on Ethereum Layer 2.

A recent landmark case highlights these dangers, sending a stark warning about crypto lender fraud and accountability. Former executives of the bankrupt crypto lending firm Cred have now faced the music, receiving significant prison sentences for their deceptive practices. What Exactly Happened at Cred, the Crypto Lender? The former CEO and CFO of Cred, a once-promising crypto lending platform, have been handed substantial prison sentences. These sentences – 52 months for the CEO and 36 months for the CFO – stem from serious fraud charges. They admitted to deliberately misleading investors, painting a rosy picture of the company’s health while concealing its true financial distress. This case serves as a critical example of crypto lender fraud and its devastating impact on trust. The executives intentionally downplayed and concealed the company’s financial situation, selectively providing only positive information to investors. This deceptive strategy ultimately led to Cred’s downfall and significant losses for its users. The Dire Consequences of Financial Deception This sentencing underscores the severe repercussions awaiting those who engage in financial deceit within the crypto space. The executives’ actions led to immense losses for countless investors who trusted Cred with their digital assets. Such cases erode confidence in the broader crypto lending ecosystem. Investors deserve transparency and honesty, especially when their hard-earned money is at stake. The justice system’s firm response in this instance sends a clear message: accountability is paramount. It highlights the importance of ethical conduct and the legal ramifications for those who exploit investor trust through crypto lender fraud . Protecting Yourself from Crypto Lender Fraud: Actionable Insights Given the risks highlighted by the Cred case, how can you safeguard your investments and avoid falling victim to crypto lender fraud ? Prudent due diligence is not just advisable; it is essential. Consider these key steps: Research Thoroughly: Always investigate the background of any crypto lending platform. Look for transparent financial reporting, regulatory compliance, and a clear track record. Understand the Risks: Crypto lending involves inherent risks, including market volatility and potential platform insolvency. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your digital assets into a single lending platform. Spreading your investments can mitigate risk. Look for Red Flags: Be wary of promises of unusually high returns, opaque business models, or executives with questionable pasts. Seek Independent Advice: Consult with financial advisors who specialize in digital assets before making significant investment decisions. A Broader Look: The Future of Crypto Lending After Fraud Cases The Cred scandal, alongside other high-profile collapses in the crypto industry, forces a critical examination of the future of crypto lending. Regulators worldwide are intensifying their scrutiny, aiming to establish clearer frameworks to protect investors. This increased oversight, while sometimes seen as a hindrance, is ultimately crucial for fostering a safer and more sustainable environment for legitimate crypto lending operations. The industry must learn from instances of crypto lender fraud and prioritize robust security and transparency. By doing so, it can rebuild trust and ensure a more secure future for digital asset lending. This evolution is vital for the long-term health and credibility of the entire cryptocurrency market. The prison sentences for Cred’s former CEO and CFO serve as a powerful reminder of the real-world consequences of financial deception in the crypto sphere. This landmark case reinforces the importance of ethical leadership and stringent investor protection. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, vigilance, transparency, and accountability will remain the cornerstones of a healthy and trustworthy ecosystem. Let this be a lesson for all involved: integrity is non-negotiable. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What was Cred?

Egrag Crypto States Two Things to Expect Next,https://timestabloid.com/is-xrp-price-crashing-so-hard-egrag-crypto-states-two-things-to-expect-next/,"XRP has faced another notable decline , with its current trading level near $2.82 raising concerns among market participants. With the asset currently falling, EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) has weighed in on its performance, suggesting the bearish pressure could continue and send XRP below lower support levels. He shared an intriguing chart that shows XRP’s potential trajectory. The chart initially appears to reinforce the community’s concerns, as the downward movement suggests persistent bearish pressure. The repeated tests of support and the proximity to lower channel boundaries would normally imply that further losses remain likely. However, a closer look at EGRAG CRYPTO’s chart challenges this straightforward interpretation, presenting a different view of the trend structure and revealing his true feelings about the asset’s future. #XRP – Is It Crashing So Hard? It looks like #XRP is experiencing a significant downturn, and the trend may continue as we head toward the green circles on the chart. What to Expect: Continued Decline: If the current momentum persists, we could see further drops … pic.twitter.com/sIjai12kWV — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 29, 2025 Interpreting the Channel Patterns The chart shows multiple parallel zones, colored in green, that at first glance resemble descending channels. Closer examination reveals that the chart is inverted, and the alignment of these channels is upward, not downward, which significantly changes the implications. Rather than a prolonged bear structure, the chart outlines a series of ascending channels that project higher future valuations for XRP. The repeated touches near the bottom levels reflect stability rather than deterioration, setting the groundwork for eventual movement toward much higher targets. XRP Projected Price Levels The highlighted green circles mark specific levels where EGRAG CRYPTO expects XRP could rise in the future. The most immediate target identified on the chart is $7. From the current price of $2.82, this represents an increase of approximately 148%. The next significant level is near $11, which would mark an advance of roughly 290% from today’s market position. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Beyond these, the highest target highlighted on the chart is $27, a target EGRAG CRYPTO has reiterated consistently . This represents a potential climb of 857% for the digital asset, showing the magnitude of the targets being considered, and positioning XRP as a candidate for substantial future growth should the structure hold. EGRAG CRYPTO’s chart delivers a counterintuitive but structured perspective on XRP’s trajectory. Although the short-term price action has been difficult, the longer-term view presented here outlines a potential for significant appreciation . With targets ranging from $7 to $27, the analysis suggests that current levels may represent a foundation for growth rather than an end to bullish momentum.

August closed with record-breaking on-chain activity as decentralized exchange (DEX) volume soared to $135B, transactions hit 48M, and active addresses climbed to 15M. Total value locked (TVL) also smashed through the $240B mark, according to Ethereum sets on-chain activity records In August, DEX volume hit $135B, while transactions reached 48M and active addresses hit 15M.

Now, the network is finally catching up to its valuation with user activity and capital pouring in. Institutional ETH Purchases Hit New Highs Big players are moving in. Corporate treasuries added a total of 247,033 ETH this past week alone, per [CoinGecko]. Institutional ETH Purchases A total of 247,033 $ETH was added to corporate treasuries over the past week. Here's the roundup: pic.twitter.com/zxz6cl7mEP — CoinGecko (@coingecko) August 29, 2025 The buying spree follows Ethereum’s rally to an all-time high of $4,946.05 on August 24. BitMine Leads with Massive ETH Buy BitMine topped the charts, scooping up 190,500 ETH as prices peaked. The purchase pushed its total holdings to 1.7M ETH, valued at roughly $7.7B. That’s more than double the second-largest corporate holder. The company’s aggressive buying signals long-term conviction even at elevated prices. SharpLink Expands Treasury with $252M Purchase Next up, SharpLink added 56,533 ETH at an average price of $4,462, spending $252.2M in a single move. The firm’s treasury now holds 797,704 ETH worth about $3.6B, cementing its position among Ethereum’s biggest institutional backers. ETHZilla Discloses $451M ETH Position ETHZilla joined the wave, revealing ownership of 102,237 ETH valued at $451.5M. Alongside the disclosure, the firm launched a $250M stock buyback program effective immediately. The plan runs through June 30, 2025, or until the full allocation is used up—whichever comes first. Ethereum Network Momentum Builds The record-breaking month signals a shift for Ethereum. For much of 2024, rising prices were driven by ETF demand rather than organic network activity. That trend seems to be reversing as August numbers show both price strength and real on-chain growth. With DEX volumes surging, addresses multiplying, and institutional wallets filling up, Ethereum appears to be entering a new phase of adoption. Data Snapshot DEX Volume (August): $135B Transactions: 48M Active Addresses: 15M TVL: $240B+ BitMine Holdings: 1.7M ETH ($7.7B) SharpLink Holdings: 797,704 ETH ($3.6B) ETHZilla Holdings: 102,237 ETH ($451.5M) If institutional inflows continue and on-chain metrics stay hot, Ethereum could maintain its momentum into Q4. The convergence of price action, user growth, and corporate adoption makes the case for sustained bullish sentiment. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

With its market capitalization slipping to $7.21 billion and 24-hour trading volume down by over 12%, the bearish trend has many Shiba Inu investors looking for alternatives. As a result, some early Shiba Inu holders are finding refuge in Remittix , which has quickly gained momentum as a leading PayFi project bridging the gap between crypto and traditional financial systems. Shiba Inu Faces Multiple Challenges: Will Price Finally Breakdown? The recent price action of Shiba Inu reflects mounting concerns within its ecosystem. SHIB’s daily burn rate collapsed by nearly 99%, leading to a loss in its deflationary appeal. Additionally, Shiba Inu’s network activity fell by 22%, with daily transactions dropping to 3.65 million. The liquidation of $111,840 worth of long positions in a single hour only added fuel to the bearish fire, triggering panic selling across the market. The Shiba Inu price technicals suggest continued weakness. The MACD histogram turned negative and the RSI at 39 shows the asset is under significant bearish pressure. Why Early Shiba Inu Holders Are Shifting Toward Remittix On a brighter side, early Shiba Inu holders are finding new hope in Remittix , which is seeing impressive growth. Priced at $0.1000, with over $22,3 million raised and 630 million tokens sold, Remittix is gaining significant traction in the crypto space. The project’s focus on PayFi, bridging crypto and fiat for seamless global transactions, makes it stand out from many other speculative assets in the market. Investors are gravitating toward Remittix not just for its tokenomics, but because it addresses a $19 trillion global payments gap. By offering fast, transparent and cost-effective cross-border payment solutions, Remittix has captured the attention of both retail and institutional investors. Why Remittix Could Be The Best Investment This Year Real-World Utility: Send crypto and have it settle as fiat directly into bank accounts across 30+ countries. Product Progress: Wallet beta launching in September, showing immediate use cases for users. Merchant & Freelancer Integration: API allowing businesses to accept crypto payments and settle in fiat. Security & Transparency: CertiK audit completed, liquidity locked for 3 years and governance shifting to the community. Exchange Listings: First CEX listing secured on BitMart, with a second listing now confirmed after crossing the $22M milestone. The Road Ahead: Why Remittix Is Gaining Momentum The challenges Shiba Inu faces have prompted some investors to reconsider their positions, especially as Remittix gains ground with a clear utility-driven model. As global financial systems continue to evolve and blockchain solutions become more widely adopted, Remittix has the potential to become a major player in the payments sector.

Meanwhile, Dogecoin is flashing bullish signals that could spark a Q4 breakout, providing traders with another reason to keep an eye on the meme coin market. With missed opportunities from past rallies fresh in investors’ minds, the scarcity narrative and FOMO are stronger than ever. Ethereum Whales Rotate Capital into New Opportunities Ethereum is experiencing a strong wave of institutional inflows. Daily flows into ETH have surged to around $900 million, matching Bitcoin’s pace, driven largely by corporate treasuries and spot ETH ETFs. BitMine has led this charge, amassing 1.7 million ETH valued at nearly $8 billion in just two months, giving it 1.4% of the total supply, while spot ETH funds pulled in $2.8 billion in August alone. This accumulation has boosted Ethereum’s momentum, with analysts forecasting a potential rally toward $6,800–$7,000 after breaking a long-term bullish pattern. Notably, Ethereum’s market dominance has risen to 14.57%, doubling since April, as Bitcoin’s share fell from 66% to 58%. But this capital rotation isn’t just staying in ETH. It’s spilling over into promising presales. Analysts note that many Ethereum whales are now accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE , drawn by its capped supply model, zero-tax trading, and strong community buzz. MAGACOIN FINANCE Builds Hype as the Top Presale of 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the most attention in the crypto market as the presale everyone is watching. The project has quickly gained momentum thanks to its whale-backed accumulation, capped supply, and zero-tax trading mechanics, which create scarcity and transparency for early investors. Verified audits and secure smart contracts further enhance confidence, making MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out in a market crowded with short-lived meme coins. Analysts are projecting returns of up to 40x, noting that the combination of strong community engagement, cultural relevance, and technical safeguards could sustain the token’s growth well beyond the presale stage. Investors are already feeling FOMO, rushing to secure allocations before the next surge , with early backers potentially reaping outsized gains. Dogecoin Flashes Signs of a Q4 Breakout Dogecoin, still trading around the $0.20 mark, has captured trader attention with a fresh TD Sequential buy signal and a bullish cup-and-handle formation. Analysts suggest these setups could point to higher targets, with some projections reaching as high as $2.18 if momentum builds. Historically, Dogecoin’s Q3 and Q4 trends have been volatile, with several years of drawdowns. However, 2025 has broken the cycle, with DOGE already up nearly 29% this quarter. As traders look for fast-moving plays to ride into the year’s final stretch, Dogecoin’s resilience and meme coin energy are fueling optimism for another leg up. Conclusion The crypto market is once again proving that timing is everything. Ethereum whales are positioning themselves early in MAGACOIN FINANCE, Dogecoin is flashing bullish patterns, and the broader meme coin space is heating up for Q4. For investors who missed past cycles, analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could have a 40X return in this bull cycle, presenting a rare second chance.

The lawsuit , filed in May 2025, had alleged that Strategy had deceived investors about its financial health and the effect of new accounting standards. Plaintiffs accused the firm of overstating the advantages of adopting a fair-value accounting standard that allowed the company to list its Bitcoin holdings on its books at its market price, which it adjusted quarterly. The case has been a focal point for critics of Strategy’s unorthodox betting style, with some investors saying publicly that the firm’s public statements falsely indicated an overly optimistic picture of profitability and downplayed the risks tied to its volatile assets. The company had been sued for unspecified damages because it failed to adequately disclose the risks of the toxic assets and properly warn shareholders about the possibility of losses . The decision to drop the suit represents a major legal victory for Strategy. The dismissal, which is filed with prejudice, prohibits those same claims from being filed again in court. For Strategy, which has staked its identity on its enormous bet on Bitcoin, the decision reflects its ability to hold to a business model that is mostly scorned but still a cause of pitched rhetorical division on Wall Street. Strategy case withdrawn with prejudice, blocking any refiling Previously, Bitcoin was valued only at its trade price. That meant Strategy would record losses when prices fell, but couldn’t recognize gains unless it sold its tokens. Supporters of the new accounting rule argued it offered a clearer snapshot of the company’s balance sheet, while critics said it painted an overly optimistic picture of profitability. By the first quarter of 2025, just six months after Bitcoin’s bull rebound, shareholders were furious as Strategy reported a staggering $4.22 billion net loss. The results bear the dark side of fair-value accounting, where unrealized gains can quickly flip into massive paper losses. The lawsuit also accused Strategy’s executives of engaging in “lucrative insider sales” of company stock while its value was “artificially inflated” before the accounting changes became public. In addition, the firm’s executives were accused of abusing their authority, gross mismanagement, and squandering corporate assets. On Thursday, however, investors abruptly dropped the lawsuit. The dismissal was with prejudice, barring any refiling of the claims. Even Strategy’s own legal team was puzzled by the move. The outcome grants the company a reprieve as it contends with intensifying investor and regulatory scrutiny. Strategy expands Bitcoin holdings to 632,457 BTC worth $70B As recently reported by Cryptopolitan Strategy, disclosed on Monday, it had purchased an additional 3,081 BTC for $356.9 million. This was acquired at an average price of $115,829 per coin, according to a Form 8-K filing with the SEC. The acquisition boosts the company’s holdings to roughly 632,457 BTC, further solidifying its position as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Strategy now sits on about $70 billion worth of BTC at current prices, purchased at an average of $$73,527 per BTC for a total cost of roughly $46.50 billion, including fees. This leaves the B itcoin treasury company with about $23.5 billion in unrealized gains. The firm’s recent purchases were funded with proceeds from its at-the-market offering programs. From Aug. 18 to Aug. 24, the firm sold 875,301 MSTR shares under its Common ATM for about $309.9 million in net proceeds. Additionally, it offloaded 210,100 shares of its 8.00% Series A Perpetual Strike preferred (STRK) for $20.4 million. It also sold 237,336 shares of its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Strife preferred (STRF) for $26.6 million net, and 944 shares of its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride preferred (STRD) for $0.1 million. Still, the Bitcoin treasury company accounting has emerged as an area of dispute. Fair-value standards enable Strategy to reflect Bitcoin’s minute-by-minute peaks and troughs in value. The firm is also exposed to wild price swings that can wreak havoc on quarterly earnings. That sharply distinguishes Strategy’s Bitcoin-backed wealth from its reported net income.

This institutional impetus follows the wider market recovery, as Bitcoin recovered over $110,000 following an abrupt decline. Traders are also hunting the best altcoins that have good applications in the real world. Emerging Defi projects that facilitate instant global transactions between crypto and fiat are gaining favor, offering practical value in a landscape dominated by speculative assets. Solana’s Billion-Dollar Momentum: Institutional Bets and Price Surge Recent Solana news shows major firms like Galaxy, Jump and Multicoin targeting $1 billion for SOL acquisitions, signaling deep faith in Solana’s ecosystem for DeFi and NFTs. This follows Solana’s robust on-chain activity, with over 10 million daily transactions reported earlier in August. As of today, Solana Price stands at approximately $214, up 5% in the past 24 hours, with support near $200 and resistance around $220 amid increased trading volume. There is a bullish potential in Solana Price predictions as analysts predict a growth to $500 by early 2026 should the rally continue. Short-term targets eye $300 by year-end , driven by ETF approvals and adoption, though dips to $180 remain possible without continued inflows.

Mutuum Finance stage 6 of presale is now ongoing at the price of $0.035. All the investors who acquire this token today have a chance of growing their investments at least 500% within a short time span. Mutuum Finance presale has already amassed over $15.15 million of capital and over 15800 token holders. The shift comes amid growing changes on SHIB’s market activity and the broader meme coin sector, as traders weigh whether this trading lull signals consolidation or fading interest. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is drawing eyes with its innovative approach to lending, hinting at a potential reshaping of investor priorities in a market often dominated by volatility and speculation. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price & Volume Update, Neutral Overview Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00001230, experiencing a 3.66% decline over the past day while its 24-hour trading volume has surged to over $359 million, a notable increase. Despite this volume spike, technical indicators suggest a cautious short-term outlook: the RSI remains below 50 and the MACD shows no bullish crossover, indicating continued selling pressure. These dynamics point to weaker momentum for SHIB, even as narratives around emerging DeFi alternatives like Mutuum Finance begin to draw investor attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stage 6 Presale Mutuum Finance is already a rapidly growing behemoth in the DeFi market and has achieved that by onboarding over 15,800 investors as well as having recorded a presale of over $15.15 million. The project is currently at Stage 6 of Presale selling tokens at $0.035 per MUTM. The stage offers early birds a huge profit window where they are presented with a chance to buy in prior to the token breaking higher in subsequent stages. $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program Consistent with an open infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is launching a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. It defines four categories of risk in relation to reward program-related risk for support of community testing and security support: critical, major, minor, and low. With security experts and white-hat hackers on the board, Mutuum places its platform at the forefront of any risk around it as being impenetrable and invincible. Massive Community Incentive, $100,000 Giveback Apart from cementing its vision to establish a healthy, growing, and sustainable community, Mutuum Finance has also introduced a $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners will get $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, and it also offers early birds and new investors a chance to be part of the project. Two-model strategy is adopted by Mutuum Finance for initiating flexibility and efficiency through Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models. Peer-to-Contract is introducing autonomous smart contracts which will lend with no sort of human intervention. These will be run on changing rates of the market but always a fixed rate of interest on prevailing demands and supplies. Middlemen have no role in the Peer-to-Peer model and lenders approach borrowers directly. Peer-to-Peer model suits well for meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to outpace expectations with over $15.15 million raised and more than 15,800 investors onboarded by Stage 6 at $0.035 per token. Backed by a robust dual lending model, a $50,000 bug bounty for security assurance, and a $100,000 community giveaway, the project is shaping up as a standout in the DeFi sector. With remaining presale stages expected to move quickly, now is the time to secure your allocation before the next price increase.

Indeed, the speculations follow a surge in ETH accumulations, with transactions running into nearly a billion dollars. Recently, nine whale addresses collectively bought about $457 million in ETH. At the same time, another large investor added $2.55 billion and staked it in one move. Overall, nearly $800 million has been added by top investors, underlining strong institutional conviction. Alongside Ethereum, an emerging altcoin—MAGACOIN FINANCE—also experienced a swell in whale accumulation, with many calling it the best altcoin to buy now in 2025 . What the Accumulation Means for 2025 Large-scale buying during corrections often signals confidence in future growth. Analysts say these Ethereum whale purchases align with forecasts that ETH could reach $5,300 by September and even $7,000–$8,000 in 2026. Long-term projections stretch as high as $15,000 by 2030, assuming steady blockchain upgrades and regulatory clarity. This level of accumulation is fueling talk that altcoin season may already be forming. With ETFs drawing billions into ETH and DeFi activity expanding, institutions appear to be signaling that Ethereum remains the best altcoin to buy now. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts See Emerging Altcoin Opportunity Alongside Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the altcoins to have seen a surge in whale interest in the ongoing market cycle. The project—tipped as one of the best altcoins to buy ahead of the next bull cycle—continues to see increased demand and investors’ attention. Notably, the bulk of the attention around MAGACOIN FINANCE comes from its full audit status and compliant ecosystem. While investors are often weary around crypto presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE has earned a reputation as the exception. At the same time, predictions are going through the roof. Analysts estimate an upside of 50x should current momentum be sustained. For investors scanning for breakout potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the project you should be looking at. Final Takeaway As cryptocurrency investors strategically position themselves, conversations around the altcoin season are gaining more prominence. The ETH whale accumulations have further fueled the speculations. While most investors focus on Ethereum, attention has turned to MAGACOIN FINANCE as a breakout altcoin. For those asking what’s the best altcoin to buy now, Ethereum remains the anchor—but emerging players like MAGACOIN FINANCE are quickly standing out for their momentum, demand frenzy, and long-term potential.

Wedson argued that compared to past cycles, the returns on investment (ROI) of leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) have been declining to lower levels each year. “With each cycle, the 1-year ROI rate for BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA, and DOGE shrinks. These major cryptocurrencies no longer provide the huge profits they used to,” Wedson said, adding that it is becoming increasingly difficult to amass large fortunes with small capital. Related News: $5 Billion Bitcoin Whale Makes New Move: But This Time, It Didn't Buy BTC According to the analyst, investors are only likely to achieve high returns by taking positions in new projects at an early stage: “The chances of getting truly rich are limited to new projects where you can get average buy-in close to the launch price. But that's a complex process in itself.” However, let us remind you that the volatility risk of small projects is very high and may result in the loss of the entire investment, including the principal. Wedson also stated that increasing leverage ratios in stock exchanges negatively impacted the market, saying, “Leveraged transactions cause losses to many investors and drain liquidity from the market.” Recalling that in the past, 2-3 cryptocurrencies could generate 10 to 100 times profit, the analyst stated that today this ratio is between 1.5 and 6 times at best: “The chances of getting rich decrease with each cycle.” Wedson also highlighted sentiment and search trends on social media, saying, “Google searches have hit their recent local peak. When everyone's excited, whales are selling.” *This is not investment advice.

According to insights from popular online cryptocurrency analyst TradingShot, Bitcoin has struggled to regain momentum, with every rally attempt being sold off, and the price slipping below the 50-day moving average ( MA ). The setup mirrors the same sequence that unfolded four years ago when BTC entered a major downturn, the analyst noted in a TradingView post on August 29. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView In both 2021 and 2025, the analysis shows lower highs followed by lower lows. The market then found support after a one-day death cross, alongside a bullish RSI divergence that marked the short-term bottom. Bitcoin rebounded, breaking above the MA50 and MA200 before forming a bull flag after a golden cross. That rally ultimately ended with a double top, marking the peak of the cycle. Today, TradingShot highlighted a similar setup, with August’s higher high mirroring the 2021 pattern. At the same time, the RSI trendlines also align, reinforcing the bearish fractal. If history repeats, Bitcoin could be on the verge of a bear cycle that erases much of this year’s gains. With the price now testing support at the MA50, losing this level may trigger a deeper correction, as it did in 2021. Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was hovering below the $110,000 mark, with concerns about potential extended losses in the coming days. The asset was trading at $108,234, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, while on the weekly chart, the leading digital currency has dropped more than 3%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

On the other hand, the 14-day RSI at 37.76 indicates that Bitcoin is approaching oversold conditions, suggesting that selling momentum may be easing and a potential rebound could follow if buying pressure strengthens.

However, one powerful indicator that offers a clear glimpse into trader sentiment is the BTC Long/Short Ratio . This metric provides invaluable insight into how professional traders are positioning themselves on Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts across major exchanges. Are they betting on a price surge or preparing for a dip? Let’s dive into the latest data to uncover these crucial market trends. What Does the BTC Long/Short Ratio Reveal? The BTC Long/Short Ratio essentially compares the number of traders holding long positions (betting on a price increase) against those holding short positions (betting on a price decrease) on perpetual futures contracts. When the ratio is high, it suggests a bullish sentiment, with more traders expecting prices to rise. Conversely, a low ratio indicates a bearish outlook, as more traders anticipate a fall. This ratio is particularly significant because perpetual futures are a popular instrument for both speculation and hedging in the crypto space. Monitoring these positions on top exchanges helps us gauge the collective market mood and potential future price movements. It’s a real-time snapshot of the market’s conviction. A Snapshot of Current BTC Long/Short Ratio on Top Exchanges Over the past 24 hours, the overall BTC Long/Short Ratio across the world’s top three cryptocurrency futures exchanges by open interest shows a slight bearish lean. Here’s the breakdown: Overall: Long 48.72% / Short 51.28% Let’s examine the individual contributions from the leading platforms: Binance: Long 48.53% / Short 51.47% Gate.io: Long 49.97% / Short 50.03% Bybit: Long 47.62% / Short 52.38% These figures indicate that, collectively, more traders are currently holding short positions than long positions on these prominent exchanges. This suggests a cautious, if not slightly pessimistic, sentiment prevailing in the Bitcoin futures market. Why is the BTC Long/Short Ratio Important for Traders? For savvy traders, the BTC Long/Short Ratio is more than just a number; it’s a powerful tool for strategic decision-making. Here are some key benefits: Gauging Sentiment: It offers an immediate understanding of whether the majority of leveraged traders are bullish or bearish. Identifying Potential Reversals: Extreme ratios (very high or very low) can sometimes signal an impending price reversal. If too many traders are long, a ‘long squeeze’ might occur, leading to a sharp price drop. The opposite can happen with a ‘short squeeze.’ Confirming Trends: A rising ratio during an uptrend can confirm bullish momentum, while a falling ratio during a downtrend reinforces bearish pressure. However, it is crucial to remember that this ratio is just one piece of the puzzle. It should always be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools to form a comprehensive trading strategy. Interpreting the Data: What Do These Numbers Mean for Your Strategy? Looking at the current data, where shorts slightly outweigh longs, several interpretations are possible. A majority short position, as seen in the overall BTC Long/Short Ratio , could suggest traders are bracing for further downside or are hedging existing spot positions. This might lead to increased volatility if the market moves against the majority, potentially triggering short squeezes if prices unexpectedly rise. Conversely, if the market continues to dip, these short positions could be further validated. Traders should observe how these ratios evolve. A rapid shift could indicate a change in sentiment, providing early signals for potential market movements. For instance, if Bybit’s ratio, currently the most bearish, starts to equalize or flip, it could signal a broader shift in market expectations. In conclusion, the BTC Long/Short Ratio serves as a vital barometer for understanding the collective mood of leveraged traders in the Bitcoin market. While the current data suggests a slight bearish bias across top exchanges like Binance, Gate.io, and Bybit, it’s essential to monitor these figures continuously. This powerful metric, when combined with other analytical tools, empowers traders to make more informed decisions, navigate market volatility, and potentially capitalize on shifts in sentiment. Stay informed, stay strategic! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the BTC Long/Short Ratio? The BTC Long/Short Ratio is a metric that compares the number of long positions (bets on price increase) to short positions (bets on price decrease) on Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts. 2. How is the BTC Long/Short Ratio calculated? It is calculated by dividing the total number of long positions by the total number of short positions on a given exchange or across multiple exchanges. 3. What does a high BTC Long/Short Ratio indicate? A high ratio typically indicates a bullish sentiment, meaning more traders are expecting Bitcoin’s price to rise. 4. What does a low BTC Long/Short Ratio indicate? A low ratio generally indicates a bearish sentiment, suggesting more traders are anticipating a drop in Bitcoin’s price. 5. Which exchanges are included in this analysis? This analysis specifically includes data from Binance, Gate.io, and Bybit, which are among the world’s top cryptocurrency futures exchanges by open interest. 6. Can the BTC Long/Short Ratio predict price movements? While it’s a strong indicator of market sentiment and can signal potential reversals or trend confirmations, the BTC Long/Short Ratio should be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools for more accurate predictions.

According to the country, the step was taken as part of a strategic initiative to enhance security and long-term custody of the National Strategic Bitcoin reserves. The development was revealed by the official Bitcoin Office of El Salvador on the blogging platform X. The country noted in the post that the redistribution will serve as a precaution against potential quantum computing threats. “Once funds are spent from an address, its public keys are revealed and vulnerable. By splitting funds into smaller amounts, the impact of a potential quantum attack is minimized,” the Bitcoin Office said on X. El Salvador announces plans to split its Bitcoin into new wallets According to El Salvador, quantum computers, in theory, can break public-private key cryptography using Shor’s algorithm. The cryptography serves many other systems, including banking, email, and communication. “When a Bitcoin transaction is signed and broadcast, the public key becomes visible on the blockchain, potentially exposing the address to quantum attacks that could discover private keys and redirect funds before the transaction confirms,” the Bitcoin Office added . The reserve is now being redistributed into multiple addresses, with each holding about 500 BTC. This way, El Salvador limits funds in each address that may potentially be exposed to quantum threats. The country had previously used a single address for transparency, exposing its wallet’s public keys continuously, which meant giving any quantum attacker the needed time to discover its private keys. However, the country is expected to use a public dashboard managed by The Bitcoin Office to monitor multiple addresses, allowing the reserve to maintain transparency without reusing addresses and increasing security. According to records, more than 6 million BTC, which is worth around $650 billion in today’s market, could be at risk if quantum computers become powerful enough to crack elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) keys, according to quantum research firm Project Eleven. El Salvador has always held its 6,274 BTC (presently worth around $678 million) in a single wallet, but has diversified them into 14 new addresses. Crypto experts dispel quantum computing threats While industry experts have hailed the recent moves undertaken by El Salvador, Project Eleven mentioned in its April report that quantum computing is still very far from gaining the capability to hack Bitcoin. A Bitcoin private key contains 256-bits, and as presently no quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm has gained the capability to crack a 3-bit key yet. Michael Saylor, the architect behind Strategy’s move towards Bitcoin, also dismissed the threat, noting in June that the quantum computing threat to the leading digital asset is mere hype. He added that if it ever became an issue worth devoting attention to, the protocol’s core developers and hardware creators will implement fixes for it. “The answer is: Bitcoin network hardware upgrade, Bitcoin network software upgrade, just like [how] Microsoft, Google, the US government upgrade,” he said. Meanwhile, El Salvador remains embroiled in its drama with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after the body released a report in July claiming the country has not purchased any new Bitcoin since February. The report raised eyebrows, with commentators in the crypto space questioning El Salvador’s reports of Bitcoin purchases since February. El Salvador’s Bitcoin office has yet to directly address the IMF report, only taking to X to post about the Bitcoin purchases made by the country. El Salvador secured a $1.4 billion funding deal from the IMF last December in exchange for reducing its Bitcoin initiatives. While the country agreed to the major terms proposed by the body, some other terms were reportedly disputed between the parties. One of the conditions that was gladly accepted is the use of Bitcoin as legal tender, allowing people to voluntarily accept it instead of enforcing the use of the asset through its Chivo wallet.

While Hedera continues to gain traction, Remittix has quickly become one of the hottest names in crypto, raising over $22,3 million through the sale of more than 630 million tokens at just $0.1000. With its first CEX listing on BitMart and a second listing with LBank confirmed, the project is gaining serious momentum. Hedera’s Latest Developments Source: TradingView Enterprise adoption has made Hedera one of the most discussed blockchain projects. Tech giants such as Google have supported its hashgraph technology due to its speed, security and environmental- friendly nature. More recently, SWIFT has been experimenting with blockchain solutions through Hedera and Grayscale has also launched an HBAR investment vehicle, indicating an increase in institutional trust. The Hedera token is consolidating around $0.24 after doubling from earlier lows. Analysts like Steph Is Crypto suggest that Hedera is forming a wave structure that could mirror the explosive 2021 rally. With strong liquidity and a market cap above $10 billion, Hedera price action is at a decisive point. A break above resistance could confirm a new bullish cycle for HBAR holders. Why Remittix Is The Altcoin With 50x Potential While Hedera focuses on enterprise blockchain, Remittix is breaking ground in PayFi by connecting crypto directly to banking systems. It’s already positioned as one of the top crypto altcoins to buy now, with experts suggesting it could rise over 50x before January. At $0.1000, early investors see RTX as a chance to get in before mainstream adoption accelerates. Key Growth Drivers For Remittix Real Banking Connections: Transfers crypto into 30+ countries’ bank accounts in seconds. Payment-Focused Utility: Not just speculation — solving real problems in global remittances. Strong Exchange Presence: BitMart live and LBank listing confirmed, ensuring global liquidity. Community Incentives: Staking, referral rewards and exclusive early benefits motivate adoption. Institutional-Grade Security: CertiK audit is done, increasing investor confidence. Hedera And Remittix: Two Paths, One Clear Winner The Hedera network is making strides with partnerships and institutional support, but Remittix offers a direct consumer solution with exponential upside. The Cardano and Ethereum early days showed how quickly altcoins with utility can explode and RTX is showing those same signs today. For investors asking which token could deliver 50x gains before January, the answer may not be Hedera, it is definitely Remittix.

In the tweet, he referenced a significant development involving Japan’s Gumi Inc., a company expanding its blockchain strategy through XRP. Gumi Inc. has made a major announcement that could put a large number of tokens to good use. EGRAG CRYPTO, one of the top analysts in the crypto space, is bullish due to this announcement, suggesting it could have massive implications for XRP and its ecosystem. ………… And You Wonder Why I am So #Bullish https://t.co/AkPwv1jTw1 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 29, 2025 Gumi Inc.’s Strategic Move The development in question involves Tokyo-based Gumi Inc., which confirmed that it will acquire ¥2.5 billion worth of XRP, which translates to around $17 million, and has excited the XRP army. According to Gumi, the purpose of this purchase is to accelerate blockchain growth and expand its digital business operations. The plan will be executed over several months, starting in September 2025 and continuing until February 2026. This investment represents more than a speculative buy. Earlier in 2025, Gumi added Bitcoin to its balance sheet, citing its role as a store of value . With XRP, the company’s focus is different. It seeks to use the digital asset for payments and liquidity solutions. This aligns closely with XRP’s established reputation as a token suited for international remittances and cross-border financial infrastructure. Gumi’s largest shareholder, SBI Holdings, already has strong ties to Ripple . This makes the move into XRP consistent with broader corporate strategies in Japan, where financial firms are working to implement blockchain solutions in traditional markets. Why the Development Matters The significance of Gumi’s XRP acquisition lies in its deliberate strategy. By incorporating XRP for financial utility, the company is pursuing a treasury approach, adding to the growing list of Treasury programs involving XRP, and strengthening its presence in blockchain adoption. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Gumi also plans to report quarterly on its digital asset holdings, including gains or losses, which shows the transparency of its approach. This decision also highlights institutional momentum for XRP, especially in Asia. Considering the value of this development, EGRAG CRYPTO has a good reason to be bullish. For years, Ripple and XRP have maintained a strong presence in Japan through partnerships and financial initiatives. With Gumi’s entry into the XRP ecosystem, the level of corporate support appears to be broadening further, and this growth could aid XRP’s price trajectory.

In his post, Leader Alpha emphasized the significance of Philion’s outlook for the XRP ecosystem, noting that he anticipates the possibility of up to 5 billion XRP being minted on Flare Networks by 2026. According to Leader Alpha, such a scale would require institutional-grade decentralized finance (DeFi) and is comparable to the volume of XRP Ripple currently maintains in its hot wallet. If realized, this level of integration could strengthen XRP’s standing as one of the most widely utilized digital assets in institutional DeFi. Hugo anticipates a possible 5,000,000,000 $XRP minted on @FlareNetworks in 2026 This is only possible with institutional defi and also is about the same amount of #XRP that #Ripple has in its hot wallet pic.twitter.com/X4yM8OD9M8 — Leader Alpha (@LeaderAlphaNews) August 29, 2025 The Interview with Hugo Philion During the discussion, Paul Barron asked Philion about expectations for XRP activity within DeFi for the remainder of the year. Philion responded cautiously, pointing out that market conditions remain uncertain in the short term. However, he stated, “I mean I’d like to see flair at five billion XRP by mid-2026.” While he did not provide a specific projection for the final months of 2025, his target for 2026 underlined the potential scale of Flare’s role in the XRP ecosystem . His remarks positioned Flare as a platform that could host an unprecedented amount of XRP within a decentralized environment. Flare’s Role in Expanding XRP Utility Flare Networks is designed to enhance the capabilities of XRP and other tokens by enabling them to interact with smart contracts and decentralized applications. By integrating with Flare, XRP can be used more flexibly across DeFi platforms, which historically has been a limitation due to its lack of native smart contract functionality. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This integration provides liquidity opportunities, cross-chain applications, and the ability to engage in decentralized lending and trading. The potential for billions of XRP to circulate within Flare illustrates the growing recognition of institutional DeFi. If achieved, such a milestone would reflect broader adoption beyond retail use, signaling that major players are ready to engage with XRP in decentralized markets. For XRP, this could mark a shift from being viewed primarily as a settlement asset toward being a key foundation in DeFi infrastructure. Flare’s products are designed to put billions of XRP to work . With Ripple’s ongoing push to expand use cases for XRP through partnerships and tokenization projects, Flare’s ability to attract significant amounts of XRP into its ecosystem could accelerate the asset’s adoption.

While established giants like XRP continue to prove their mettle, commanding impressive market caps near $177 billion and hitting new all-time highs of $3.67 back in July, a fresh contender is making waves, aiming for a different kind of dominance. Meet Layer Brett (LBRETT), the new Ethereum Layer 2 solution that’s combining viral meme culture with actual, tangible blockchain utility. This isn’t just another flavor of the month meme token. Analysts are whispering about potential 100x gains, and its presale is absolutely flying . Layer Brett (LBRETT): Where meme meets mechanism Brett, the character, was always stuck on Base, without much purpose. Now, he’s charting his own course, breaking those chains on Layer 2. Layer Brett isn’t just riding the coattails of meme fame; it’s leveraging Ethereum Layer 2 technology to deliver something genuinely useful. Traditional memecoins like Pepe and Shiba Inu, while fun, often struggle with slow transactions and sky-high gas fees, especially on congested Layer 1 networks. Not Layer Brett. It’s built for speed, ultra-low costs, and serious scalability. Transactions? Near-instant. Gas fees? Pennies. This is the future of meme tokens. What makes LBRETT stand out from the crowd? Built on Layer 2 Ethereum: High-speed, low-cost, and scalable. This is the most secure smart contract blockchain in crypto. Early Staking Benefits: Fancy earning an APY of 1,490%? Early buyers of LBRETT can stake right away for massive rewards. But hurry, that figure dips as more people jump in. Memecoin Energy, Real Utility: Unlike Dogecoin or the original Brett, Layer Brett isn’t just about the hype. It’s tech-backed with plans for a full ecosystem. Low Entry Price: Get in on the presale for just $0.005 per token. This is early access, folks. Close to $2 million has been invested in a matter of a few weeks. Ripple (XRP) News vs. the next big crypto Sure, Ripple (XRP) has proven its staying power, with consistent top-5 rankings and robust trading volumes topping $6 billion daily. That’s solid. But Layer Brett offers something different, a blank canvas with explosive growth potential. Ethereum Layer 2 solutions are projected to process over $10 trillion annually by 2027. Layer Brett is designed to capture a significant chunk of that growth, offering an escape from the sluggish, expensive confines of Layer 1. Imagine a world where your crypto experience isn’t bogged down by fees. That’s Layer Brett’s promise. Users can buy and stake LBRETT in seconds with ETH, USDT, or BNB using MetaMask or Trust Wallet. It’s that simple. Forget the complicated setup; this project values user experience. Layer Brett’s transparent tokenomics, with a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens and 25% allocated to staking, prioritize community rewards. This isn’t just another crypto pumping now; it’s a thoughtfully designed ecosystem ready for a bull run. Why Layer Brett is the new top gainer crypto This project isn’t just competing with established Layer 2s like Optimism, Arbitrum, or zkSync. It’s offering a fresh, community-first approach, blending the fun of a meme-born project with legitimate blockchain scaling. The old Brett couldn’t evolve; Layer Brett is here to lead. It’s a unique blend of fun and function, promising to be the next 100x altcoin in the crypto bull run of 2025. Layer Brett is still in its presale stages , but is selling out fast. Don’t miss this chance to get in early on a project combining meme power with real speed and true utility. Head over now and stake your claim for those potentially insane APYs before the opportunity fades. Get in now to stake, earn massive rewards , and ride what could be the most scalable meme project ever to launch on Ethereum Layer 2.

On Saturday, XRP traded around the low-$3 band, with intraday swings typical of late-cycle summer liquidity. Fresh catalysts—from the SEC lawsuit finally ending to possible rule changes that could fast-track crypto ETFs—have traders asking a simple question: where does the XRP price go next? Recent whale accumulation and rising payment-rail adoption add fuel to the debate, even as skeptics warn of resistance just above the round-number zone. XRP price today: snapshot and context At press time, XRP price hovered near $2.83–$2.85 , with recent prints showing repeated tests of the $3 area during August. That keeps XRP within a tight band below multi-year highs and well above its 2024 average. For reference, XRP’s all-time high sits in the mid-$3 range from the 2017–18 cycle. Why this matters: sustained closes above the $3.00–$3.10 zone would put bulls within striking distance of prior cycle peaks and reset the momentum narrative into Q4. What’s moving the XRP price right now 1) Legal clarity (finally). In early August, the SEC formally concluded its lawsuit against Ripple , cementing the split decision first outlined by Judge Torres: some institutional sales violated securities law, but programmatic exchange sales did not. Ripple will pay a civil penalty (~$125M), and the market is treating the end of appeals as a line-in-the-sand moment for regulatory overhang. 2) ETF tailwinds (rules, not rumors). U.S. exchanges have proposed generic listing standards for crypto ETPs, which—if approved—could streamline future listings beyond Bitcoin and Ether. Analysts view these rule changes (expected as soon as late September) as the practical path for products tied to assets like XRP , even if “ XRP ETF ” headlines are still speculative. Rule-level clarity often shrinks risk premiums and can boost volumes. 3) On-chain and positioning. Whale wallets holding 1M+ XRP hit all-time highs in July, a sign of persistent accumulation during summer volatility. Historically, rising large-holder concentration into resistance can either power a breakout or set up a sharp shakeout if late longs over-leverage. 4) Real-world rails. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL, now integrated within Ripple Payments) keeps expanding, offering near-instant FX settlement without pre-funded nostro accounts. This enterprise utility is a core long-term pillar for the XRP price narrative. Key technical zones to watch Immediate resistance: ~$3.00–$3.10. A decisive daily close above could open a path toward mid-$3s. Near support: ~$2.60–$2.80. Buyers defended this zone several times in August; a break risks a deeper retest of the mid-$2s. All-time high reference: ~$3.84 from the 2018 peak; reclaiming and holding above prior highs would mark a structural regime change for XRP. XRP price forecast: scenarios for 2025–26 Base case (range with higher lows). With the lawsuit closed and ETF plumbing progressing, the XRP price base case is a wider range where higher lows grind upward into year-end. Think frequent tests of $3–$3.30, punctuated by news-driven spikes. In this path, spot volumes rise as U.S. compliance comfort slowly returns. (Drivers: rule approvals, exchange relistings, continued bank/payment integrations.) Bull case (breakout on flows). If generic ETP standards are adopted promptly and one or more XRP-themed products advance, passive flows could push the XRP price through $3.50 and into prior-high territory. Pair that with sustained whale accumulation and stronger fiat-to-crypto corridors through Ripple partners, and retests of the old ATH become realistic—not guaranteed. Bear case (policy or liquidity shock). A slower-than-expected regulatory timeline, macro risk-off, or exchange-specific liquidity issues could see XRP revisit the mid-$2s. In that environment, leverage washouts often overshoot before mean-reverting—risk management matters. What about the “$5 by October” calls? A widely shared piece this week highlighted analyst calls for $5 after XRP reclaimed $3, while also promoting a new Ethereum-based token. These headlines are part of a familiar cycle near resistance: bold targets + presale marketing. Treat them as sentiment indicators, not as a base case. As always, verify source quality and note any press-release disclaimers. Fundamentals that could sustain a higher XRP price Regulatory endgame clarity: With the SEC matter closed, U.S. institutions face fewer headline risks when offering XRP exposure or payment rails—though compliance teams will still track distribution restrictions tied to institutional sales. Enterprise adoption: ODL/Ripple Payments can reduce pre-funding and settlement friction—key for corridors with expensive FX, a macro tailwind that’s independent of retail hype. Network effects: As more PSPs and fintechs join Ripple’s stack, liquidity improves, spreads tighten, and XRP price discovery becomes more efficient—vital if ETF vehicles later broaden access. Practical strategy notes (not financial advice) Respect the levels. $3.00–$3.10 has behaved like a magnet in August. Breakouts that stick typically come with rising spot + derivatives open interest and no blow-out funding. YCharts Watch flows and headlines. The next meaningful policy headline is the SEC’s decision on generic ETP listing standards . Even rule proposals can spark knee-jerk moves across large-cap alts. Separate signal from marketing. Articles that combine XRP price targets with presale promotions deserve extra skepticism; look for disclosures and weigh against neutral data (whales, volume, breadth). FAQs: fast answers for searchers Q1) What is the XRP price right now? At last update, XRP price was hovering near $2.83 with intraday volatility around the $3 mark through late August. Always check a live feed for the latest tick. Q2) What is XRP’s all-time high? XRP’s ATH is cited around $3.84 from the 2018 bull cycle. That level remains the key longer-term upside marker for technicians. Q3) Is the SEC case over—and what did the court say? Yes. The SEC vs. Ripple case concluded in August 2025 with a civil penalty and an injunction related to institutional sales; importantly, the court confirmed that programmatic exchange sales of XRP are not securities under U.S. law. Q4) Could an XRP ETF boost price? If U.S. exchanges secure generic crypto ETP listing standards , the path for new funds—including potential XRP-linked products—would be smoother. That could increase access and liquidity, which historically supports price discovery. Timing and approvals remain uncertain. Bottom line: The XRP price sits at a pivotal juncture: legal uncertainty has faded, whales accumulated on the way up, and ETF plumbing may be about to modernize. A clean break and hold above ~$3.10 would strengthen the case for a run at prior highs; failure there keeps the range intact into Q4. As always, pair narratives with data, and treat promotional forecasts with care.

With just four months left for this year, we decided to ask ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini about XRP’s future by the end of it. What’s Next in 2025? Hidden Road’s purchase for $1.25 billion stands out as the most significant acquisition made by the Brad Garlinghouse-spearheaded company this year, as some believe it will be a game-changer for both Ripple and XRP. When it comes down to positive developments, though, perhaps nothing trumps the developments on the legal case against the SEC, where the two parties have agreed to drop it entirely . The only remaining step is for the judge presiding over the case to affix their official signature. XRP felt the positive consequences of these and other developments throughout the year and peaked at $3.65 in July, thus breaking its January 2018 all-time high of $3.4. However, it has skipped a beat since then and now struggles below $3. As such, we decided to ask the most popular AI solutions what they think might happen by the end of the year. ChatGPT started with what’s most commonly anticipated – a quick rebound. It touched upon some forecasts made by established names in the financial industry, such as Standard Chartered, and outlined a $5.50 target for XRP by the end of the year. Although it admitted that Ripple’s cross-border token now has some competition in the face of rivals like Remittix (RTX), and that the overall demand for the asset has dwindled in the past several weeks, it remains bullish about its trajectory in 2025. “While the sharp retrace below $3 marks a challenging phase, XRP still holds bullish potential if it reclaims key resistance zones, maintains volume inflows, and is supported by positive macro/regulatory developments.” Its best-case reasonable target is, as mentioned above, somewhere between $5 and $6, but it also provided an “extended bullish outlook,” which sees the asset skyrocketing to $10-$12. However, it noted that this could take place only “under strong momentum and sentiment.” Grok and Gemini Say… After the mandatory “this is not financial advice” disclaimer, Gemini said several key factors can shape XRP’s future in the following four months. They include the official conclusion of the SEC lawsuit, Ripple’s role in the ever-growing Real-World Asset (RWA) space, the potential approvals of spot XRP ETFs in the US, and the broader market conditions and economic factors. Grok warned investors that they should expect XRP to “remain volatile by the end of 2025.” However, it added that the overall market structure continues to lean bullish, which should help XRP reclaim the $3 support. Its projection for the next four months includes price fluctuations between $3 and $5.50 or even higher. “XRP holds significant upside potential contingent on positive catalysts, but may also experience periods of consolidation or retracement depending on market conditions. This balanced outlook reflects XRP’s evolving role in the crypto financial ecosystem through 2025,” Grok concluded.

According to reports, the individuals involved kidnapped the businessman, based in Surat, and extorted funds in digital assets from him. Out of the 14 individuals convicted in the case, court documents show that 11 police officials were found complicit for their involvement in the case. According to court records, the 11 Indian police officials convicted in the case included former Amreli district superintendent of police Jagdish Patel, former BJP MLA from Amreli Nalin Kotadiya, and two other unnamed high-ranking officials. Meanwhile, the judge held that one of the accused, Jalin Patel, was innocent, so he was discharged and acquitted. Over 14 policemen imprisoned for life in crypto extortion case According to reports, the case was similar to a criminal thriller. The prosecution noted that the victim, Shailesh Bhatt, had gotten an unspecified amount of Bitcoin from Dhaval Mavani after making investments in a firm located in Surat worth Rs. 8,000 crore (approximately $960 million), after it closed down abruptly. When the news filtered to Kotadiya and Amreli SP, they formulated a plan to track down Bhatt and steal the digital assets from him. Court documents showed that Bhatt was illegally apprehended and arrested, with the individuals involved moving their plans a step further by arresting him. They detained him at a Keshav Farm near Gandhinagar in February 2018, with Indian police officials from the Amreli district watching over him at the location. According to the documents, Anant Patel, the local crime branch police inspector in Amreli, was one of the kidnappers. The kidnappers were able to beat and intimidate Bhatt to the point where he confessed that he had extorted 752 Bitcoin from Mavani towards his share, one which was 176 Bitcoin that he owned with his business partner Krit Paladiya, noting that he had also sold other tokens for Rs. 44 crore (approximately $5.2 million). Notably, Paladiya is also an accused in this case. Bhatt was allowed to go after he promised to transfer 176 Bitcoin and Rs. 32 crore to the gang of kidnappers. However, when he failed to hold up his end of the bargain, the accused extorted Rs. 1.32 crore from him by forcing him to sell 34 Bitcoin from Paladiya’s wallet. Bhatt took this complaint to the Union home ministry, where he was directed to the CID in Gandhinagar to register a criminal FIR in April 2018. The police started a lengthy investigations after the FIR and they were able to track several suspects involved in the case before narrowing it down to 15 individuals. Court says verdict will serve as a warning to other public officials During the trial, public prosecutor Amit Patel examined more than 173 witnesses, with 92 of them turning hostile in court. During the conviction, the court also issued perjury to about 25 hostile witnesses. During the trial, Bhatt also approached the higher courts over the outcome of the trial, making moves to delay his appearance in court . After the conclusion of the trial, the Indian court awarded life imprisonment to the convicted individuals. “Widespread corruption among public servants and private persons is required to be curbed with a strong hand by all, and certainly, the verdict of the court has greater magnitude than other means,” the Indian court said. The court also ordered that the gold jewelry seized from the Amreli SP should be confiscated and processed by the Master of Mint at Mumbai. All the Indian police officers found guilty were charged under the Prevention of Corruption Act for criminal misconduct by public servants. The convicts were also sentenced to life imprisonment under Section 364A of the IPC, and different jail terms in other IPC and PC Act sections, in addition to being fined.

Key Takeaways: Tether will no longer freeze USDT on five blockchains but has ended issuance and redemption on them. The affected networks, including Omni Layer and EOS, represent a small share of total USDT circulation. Tether is focusing on high-demand ecosystems like Ethereum and Tron, where most USDT activity now occurs. The stablecoin issuer made the announcement Friday , citing feedback from ecosystem participants. The affected chains are Omni Layer, Bitcoin Cash SLP, Kusama, EOS, and Algorand. “Tether has revised this approach and will not freeze the smart contracts on these networks,” the company stated, adding that users will still be able to move their tokens, but they will not be officially supported going forward. Tether Phase-Out Hits Omni Layer with $82.9M in Circulating USDT The change affects a relatively small portion of USDT’s total footprint. Omni Layer, once a primary vehicle for Tether, currently holds $82.9 million in circulating USDT. EOS trails at $4.2 million, while the remaining networks each hold under $1 million, according to DeFiLlama. Tether began winding down support for these chains in 2023, halting new issuance on Omni, Kusama, and Bitcoin Cash SLP last August. EOS and Algorand followed in June 2024 . The company’s revised stance keeps token transfers functional, but confirms it will not resume minting or redemptions. The decision reflects Tether’s strategy to focus on chains with high demand and strong developer ecosystems. Tether, the king of stablecoins, just dropped a crypto bomb: $USDT is disappearing from Omni Layer ( $OMNI ), $EOS , ( $ALGO ) Algorand, Bitcoin Cash ( $BCH ) $SLP , and Kusama ( $KSM )!

BNB Chain holds $6.78 billion, while newer chains like Arbitrum, Base, and Solana are gaining traction, though they are more closely tied to rival stablecoin USDC. The stablecoin sector has grown to $285.9 billion, with USDT and USDC dominating at $167.4 billion and $71.5 billion, respectively, according to CoinGecko. Trump-Backed GENIUS Act Boosts U.S. Push for Dollar-Pegged Stablecoins The shift also comes as U.S. policy support for stablecoins gains momentum. The recent passage of the GENIUS Act , signed by President Trump, aims to cement the dollar’s dominance by backing dollar-pegged stablecoins in global markets. The Treasury Department expects the stablecoin market to exceed $2 trillion by 2028, a projection that places greater emphasis on liquidity, interoperability, and regulatory alignment across the ecosystem. Tether’s latest move underscores a pragmatic shift toward that future. As reported, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has said the stablecoin sector is poised for explosive growth, projecting the market could balloon from its current $250 billion capitalization to as much as $2 trillion in the near future. “Many people think it will reach $1 to $2 trillion in a handful of years,” Garlinghouse said, adding that Ripple is positioned to benefit from that trajectory. Meanwhile, Western Union is positioning itself for a new phase of digital transformation, signaling strong interest in using stablecoins to modernize its global remittance operations. CEO Devin McGranahan has outlined how stablecoins could streamline cross-border transfers, improve currency conversion in underserved markets, and provide financial tools for populations grappling with unstable local currencies.

Legal Expert Says Yes, But…",https://timestabloid.com/can-ripple-sell-xrp-directly-to-institutions-in-the-u-s-legal-expert-says-yes-but/,"Attorney Fred Rispoli recently provided clarity on whether Ripple can sell XRP directly to institutions in the United States. This has been the subject of speculation following recent legal developments. His remarks came in response to Abs Nassif, host of the Good Morning Crypto podcast, who posed the question publicly. Rispoli affirmed that Ripple can sell XRP to U.S. institutions, although he noted that the process is still unclear. “Yes. Unclear the avenue that Ripple will use to accomplish this but the bottom line is THIS administration’s SEC won’t be a roadblock,” he stated. He emphasized the importance of legislation for ensuring market stability, adding that it is vital to secure clarity in case the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopts a stricter stance on digital assets under a future administration. Yes. Unclear the avenue that Ripple will use to accomplish this but the bottom line is THIS administration’s SEC won’t be a roadblock. So very important for market clarity legislation to pass in case next SEC goes back to anti-crypto. — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) August 29, 2025 The Context of the Lawsuit The discussion follows the recent dismissal of legal proceedings between Ripple and the SEC. While the broader case has concluded, a key restriction remains unresolved. Both Ripple and the SEC had jointly requested the removal of the permanent injunction preventing institutional sales of XRP. Judge Analisa Torres denied the motion for an indicative ruling, leaving the injunction in place. This outcome leaves Ripple without full legal clearance for institutional transactions, though the company has made strides in other areas of its operations. Analysts and observers suggest that this development will not undermine Ripple’s long-term strategy. Rispoli has previously explained that the term “institutional sales” from the ruling does not broadly apply to all future XRP sales involving institutions. In his response, he pointed out that the current SEC leadership will not obstruct Ripple’s path forward despite the outstanding injunction. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications for Ripple’s Business The issue at the heart of the injunction is whether Ripple can engage directly with institutional buyers inside the U.S. without violating securities laws. Rispoli acknowledged uncertainty about the precise mechanism Ripple might use, but stressed that the administration’s approach provides room for the company to operate. Market participants are eager for clarity, as institutional engagement is critical to XRP’s utility in cross-border settlements and liquidity solutions. Rispoli’s comments suggest that Ripple’s ability to transact with institutions is not dependent on the injunction’s removal, but rather on compliance with existing securities frameworks and the prevailing regulatory environment.

From topping open interest charts to leading in whale accumulation and network activity, ETH has consistently set the tone for broader market sentiment. Its role as the engine of capital rotation from Bitcoin to altcoins has only reinforced this dominance, making Ethereum the asset to watch as the market enters a new stage. However, the recent retrace has introduced caution. After surging to new highs, ETH has pulled back to test lower demand levels, sparking fear among traders who worry that momentum may be fading. Despite this, on-chain data suggests that the fundamentals remain firmly intact. Key insights from Lookonchain reveal that the Bitcoin OG who recently purchased 641,508 ETH, worth $2.94 billion, is back in action. After a brief pause, this whale has resumed accumulation, signaling confidence in Ethereum’s long-term trajectory . For many, such aggressive buying serves as a counterweight to the short-term volatility, highlighting how large players continue to see opportunity even as prices waver. OG Whale Buying As Ethereum Holds Key Levels According to Lookonchain, following a two-day break, the whale deposited 1,000 BTC (worth $108.27 million) to Hyperliquid, converting it into ETH spot. This latest move reinforces the trend of aggressive whale accumulation, a factor that continues to support the bullish outlook for Ethereum even as price action shows signs of weakness. The timing of this accumulation is particularly notable. Ethereum recently retraced sharply after reaching fresh highs, testing critical demand levels that have sparked concern among traders. Some analysts warn that ETH could be vulnerable if these zones fail to hold, with the broader market sentiment leaning bearish. However, the whale’s consistent purchases suggest that major players see the retrace as an opportunity rather than a reversal, adding weight to the argument that fundamentals remain strong. In this context, the coming weeks will be decisive. If Ethereum manages to consolidate above support and push higher, it would confirm the continuation of the uptrend and validate the whale’s confidence-driven buying. Conversely, failure to hold demand zones could extend the correction. For now, the return of large-scale accumulation highlights that Ethereum’s long-term trajectory remains bullish despite short-term volatility. ETH Tests Key Demand Level Ethereum is trading near $4,370 after a 3% daily decline, cooling off from its recent push to highs above $4,750. The daily chart shows ETH consolidating after a steep rally that began in mid-July, when price broke out of a long consolidation phase near $2,700 and surged more than 70% in just a few weeks. The retrace comes as ETH tests short-term demand. Price remains well above the 50-day moving average at $3,941, which is now serving as dynamic support. The 100-day ($3,244) and 200-day ($2,662) averages are trending upward, confirming that the broader market structure is still bullish. Holding above $4,200 is critical to maintain momentum, as this zone aligns with recent breakout levels and could provide a foundation for the next leg higher. Resistance remains near $4,750–$4,800, where sellers stepped in during the last rally attempt. A decisive break above this zone would likely open the door to new all-time highs, while failure to hold above $4,200 could trigger a deeper pullback toward $3,900.

Once touted as a next-gen Layer-1 with its BlockDAG speed and smart contract upgrades, Kaspa has failed to hold momentum due to volatility, lagging adoption and missed institutional interest. With the Casplex Layer-2 launch scheduled for August 31, holders remain hopeful, but smart investors are jumping ship toward projects that deliver utility now, not years down the road. Kaspa trades around $0.087, stuck under both the 50- and 200-day moving averages, with sentiment cautious and competition fierce from Ethereum and Remittix . Here’s what analysts are saying. Kaspa Faces Technical and Adoption Challenges From its $0.207 peak in August 2024, Kaspa plunged to $0.055 before recovering slightly. Current resistance around $0.12 keeps price capped, with risk of retesting $0.082 support. The August 31 smart contract upgrade is make-or-break, opening the door to DeFi apps on Kaspa’s proof-of-work base, but developer traction and enterprise partnerships remain limited. Meanwhile, competitors continue eating market share, and without clear adoption breakthroughs, Kaspa risks further sidelining. Traders seeking immediate gains are already rotating into PayFi projects with tangible, scalable adoption. Remittix: The Top Layer-2 Ethereum Alternative For Maximum Crypto Gains In 2025 This is where Remittix (RTX) is rewriting the playbook. While Kaspa builds for the future, RTX is delivering right now. The top Defi coin has already surpassed $22,3 Million in funding telling prospective investors that real adoption exists in this ecosystem. Freelancers and business owners can now conveniently forget about the 5–10% fees charged by Western Union and banks as RTX enables near-instant crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries with rock-bottom 0.1% fees. Its multi-chain backbone (Ethereum, Solana, Algorand) and institutional-ready APIs make it a direct bridge between crypto and global finance. Analysts are calling it a next 100x crypto and judging by whale accumulation and presale acceleration, they may be right. Why Investors Are Rushing Into RTX: Global transfers in 30+ countries at 0.1% fees vs banks charging 10x more Enterprise-ready APIs for seamless institutional adoption CertiK-audited for security and trust Mobile-first wallet launching Q3 2025 with FX conversion $22,3M raised and counting with BitMart listing locked What’s even more impressive is that RTX holders are up 500% from earlier this year and with the recent BitMart and LBank exchange announcements, Remittix is laser-focused on a $19 trillion opportunity: global remittances. Massive Giveaway and Exchange Expansion Fuel RTX Momentum RTX isn’t just raising funds, it’s building a movement. Its $250,000 giveaway campaign has drawn over 300,000+ entries and attracted over 25,000 holders, proving grassroots adoption is here. For investors, this is the kind of project you don’t wait on. Because once RTX launches, the cheap entry point at $0.10 will be history. Miss it now, regret it later.

Price action has shifted into a cautious phase, and ETH now faces the challenge of defending key demand zones that could determine the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Index Highlights Two Accumulations And Five Distribution Waves This Cycle – Details Despite this pullback, Ethereum remains the standout performer in the market. Fresh data from Glassnode reveals that over the past month, no altcoin sector has outperformed ETH, although DeFi and Layer 2 ecosystems came close. This resilience underscores Ethereum’s dominance even in times of broader market weakness, reinforcing its role as the backbone of decentralized finance and blockchain infrastructure. The trend also suggests that the market is entering what many analysts describe as “Ethereum season,” where ETH leads performance and capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins begins to accelerate. With institutions, whales, and retail investors watching closely, Ethereum’s ability to hold its ground while others falter highlights its strength heading into the next stage of the cycle. Ethereum Leads Market As Capital Rotation Accelerates According to Glassnode, Ethereum has established itself as the clear leader in the market over the past month. No altcoin sector has managed to outperform ETH during this period, with only DeFi and Layer 2 ecosystems coming close. Notably, most altcoin sectors ended the month in decline, reinforcing Ethereum’s relative strength in a volatile environment. This performance signals a clear shift in capital rotation, as flows begin moving away from Bitcoin and into Ethereum, marking what many analysts see as the beginning of a new stage in the cycle. Capital rotation has long been a hallmark of crypto market dynamics. Traditionally, rallies begin with Bitcoin dominance before liquidity spreads into Ethereum and then, eventually, into smaller altcoins. The latest data shows ETH taking center stage in this process, attracting both institutional interest and whale accumulation. This suggests that investors view Ethereum as the next engine of growth, supported by strong fundamentals and expanding adoption across DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise use cases. Still, sentiment remains divided. Some analysts argue that this cycle is structurally longer, stretched by institutional products like spot ETFs and increased global adoption, meaning Ethereum could continue to outperform for months. Others remain cautious, warning that the market’s current weakness could be the early signal of a broader bearish trend. Regardless of these opposing views, Ethereum’s leadership in performance and its ability to outpace nearly every altcoin sector highlight its growing importance in defining the next stage of the crypto market. For many, ETH is setting the tone for where capital flows—and opportunities—are headed next. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Reserves Decline – Strong Accumulation Signal ETH Pulls Back After Explosive Rally Ethereum is trading around $4,366 after a sharp weekly decline of nearly 9%, following its recent push to new highs near $4,800. The weekly chart highlights a powerful rally that began earlier this summer, lifting ETH from lows below $2,000 to almost double its value in just a few months. However, the latest red candle shows that sellers are stepping in as the market digests this steep run-up. Despite the correction, ETH remains firmly above its major moving averages. The 50-week ($2,863), 100-week ($2,819), and 200-week ($2,446) moving averages are all trending upward, confirming that the long-term structure is still bullish. These levels now serve as strong layers of support should deeper retracements occur.

Holding this zone would strengthen the case for consolidation before another attempt at breaking $4,800. A failure, however, could open the door for a move back toward $3,800.

JPMorgan Weighs In,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-outlook-2025-jpmorgan-undervalued/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin 2025 Outlook: Undervalued vs Gold? JPMorgan Weighs In New Delhi, Aug 30, 2025 — The bitcoin market has entered a quieter, more mature phase in 2025. Price swings have cooled, institutional demand continues through spot ETF channels, and the narrative is shifting from “speculation” to “portfolio allocation.” A recent JPMorgan note captures this shift, arguing that as bitcoin volatility sinks toward historic lows (~30% from ~60% at the start of 2025), BTC screens undervalued versus gold on a volatility-adjusted basis. Why “Undervalued vs Gold” Matters for Bitcoin For years, analysts compared bitcoin to gold as a potential store of value. JPMorgan’s latest framework suggests that with volatility compressing, the risk-adjusted case for BTC strengthens, implying upside to a fair-value band if volatility remains near current levels. Some summaries of the bank’s model suggest a scenario up to $126,000 by year-end 2025 under those assumptions. While not a guarantee, it signals how large allocators may benchmark BTC risk vs. gold. Key takeaways Volatility normalization : 60% → ~30% in 2025, a record low, supports larger institutional position sizes. Relative valuation lens : On a volatility-adjusted basis, JPMorgan argues bitcoin screens cheap vs gold. Scenario analysis : Headlines cite a $126K fair-value scenario if conditions hold. Institutional Flows: The ETF Flywheel Since the launch of U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, the structure has become a primary conduit for mainstream capital. Day-one trading activity topped $4.6 billion across funds, and 2025 has seen continued net inflows, including $1B in a single day in July and one fund racing to ~$80B in assets under management. This “ETF flywheel”—simple access, regulated wrappers, and daily liquidity—has deepened the market. Why this supports price discovery Persistent demand via retirement and wealth platforms. Tighter spreads & deeper liquidity as market-makers compete. Transparent holdings data that helps analysts track flows. Together, these factors can dampen extreme volatility and support bitcoin as a strategic allocation rather than a trade. The Post-Halving Backdrop The April 2024 halving cut the block subsidy to 3.125 BTC , mechanically slowing net supply issuance. Historically, halvings have influenced cycle dynamics, though returns vary by macro regime. In the current cycle, the combination of slower issuance and stronger institutional rails (ETFs, custody) is shaping a different—arguably more mature—market profile. Macro Currents to Watch in H2 2025 Rates & liquidity Lower global rate-volatility typically benefits risk assets. If real yields stabilize or drift lower, the opportunity cost of holding bitcoin vs cash may fall, supporting bids. Regulatory clarity Incremental clarity on market structure and token classification can unlock new allocators (pensions, insurers) who require a defined rulebook before entry. Mainstream outlets have noted how policy expectations have tracked BTC’s move into six figures in 2025. ETF flows & rebalancing Quarterly and year-end rebalances can create lumps in demand/supply through ETFs, potentially amplifying trend moves when combined with shrinking miner sell pressure post-halving. Price Context: From “Wild Ride” to “Measurable Beta” Several 2025 reports highlight that bitcoin’s realized volatility has cooled substantially , even through drawdowns—suggesting a transition from ultra-speculative swings to “measurable beta” sensitive to macro and flows. This doesn’t eliminate risk; it re-frames it. In 2025, BTC has traded near—and at times above—six figures, with mainstream coverage documenting surges past $120,000 earlier in the year on institutional adoption momentum. Bull, Base, and Bear Scenarios (Next 3–6 Months) Bull Case: $115K–$135K Volatility stays ~30% , reinforcing JPMorgan’s relative-value lens vs gold. ETF net inflows persist; wealth-platform distribution widens internationally. Macro benign (softer inflation prints, stable/lower real yields). This cluster of factors could pull bitcoin toward the upper end of JPMorgan-style fair-value scenarios. Base Case: $95K–$115K Volatility remains contained but flows are choppier. Macro is mixed; regulatory progress uneven. Mining sells modestly into strength; ETF demand offsets. Bear Case: $80K–$95K Risk-off macro (growth scare or sharp yield spike). ETF outflows and stronger USD . Volatility re-expands toward prior ranges, weakening the gold-parity argument. Even in this case, structural features (ETF access, post-halving issuance) could help stabilize drawdowns relative to past cycles. Reminder: These are scenarios, not predictions. Crypto assets remain highly volatile and can move rapidly in both directions. Risks & What Could Invalidate the Thesis Macro shock : A policy surprise or liquidity crunch can hit all risk assets at once. Regulatory setbacks : Adverse rulings or delayed approvals that restrict distribution. On-chain/security events : Major protocol or market-infrastructure incidents. Narrative shift : If realized volatility rises again, the “undervalued vs gold” framing weakens. How to Read the JPMorgan Framework (Without the Hype) It’s relative, not absolute — The claim addresses risk-adjusted valuation vs gold given volatility, not a guaranteed price path. It’s conditional — The $126K scenario assumes volatility remains subdued and flows supportive. It’s one lens — ETF flow data, macro liquidity, and halving-era supply dynamics should be tracked alongside it. FAQs: Bitcoin in 2025 Is bitcoin still volatile? Yes—but less than in prior cycles. Several analyses peg current realized volatility near 30% , a multi-year low, versus ~60% in early 2025. Do ETFs really matter? Early data says yes: ETFs created an easy on-ramp, large volumes at launch, and billions in net 2025 inflows—supporting liquidity and broader ownership. Did the 2024 halving help? Halving reduced new supply to 3.125 BTC per block. Its price impact depends on demand (including ETF flows) and macro liquidity. Conclusion The 2025 bitcoin story is about normalization : lower realized volatility, institutional rails via ETFs, and a mainstream risk framework that increasingly compares BTC with gold. JPMorgan’s lens— undervalued vs gold on a volatility-adjusted basis —doesn’t promise outcomes, but it does explain why allocators are taking BTC seriously as a portfolio sleeve. Track volatility, ETF flows, and macro cues; together, they will likely set the range for the next leg of bitcoin price discovery. This post Bitcoin 2025 Outlook: Undervalued vs Gold?

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-believes-xrp-to-close-to-next-leg-rally-heres-why/,"Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk), a well-known crypto analyst and XRP supporter, recently commented on the current sentiment surrounding XRP. In his words, “Everyone hates XRP right now.” He explained that even many holders are voicing frustration, saying the asset “doesn’t do anything” or that they have already exited their positions . Despite this, he said this kind of frustration and negativity is not a signal of a market top. Instead, he suggested that the opposite might be true, noting that “infighting and despair isn’t a mark of a top.” This perspective points to a possible turning point in XRP’s market cycle, with the implication that heavy doubt could precede a decisive move . Uncertainty Before Momentum Periods of uncertainty are not unusual for XRP, a token known for long stretches of stagnation followed by rapid price acceleration. Cryptoinsightuk’s remarks highlight that what may appear to be a weakness in community sentiment can sometimes align with the conditions before a surge. His statement that holders are showing despair, paired with his view that this is not a topping signal, suggests he believes the market is preparing for its next phase. The analyst emphasized that these conditions say “we are close to our next leg.” This reference to a potential new stage of price discovery shows his belief that bearish sentiment may be masking underlying strength. Everyone hates $XRP right now. Even the holders, I’m getting multiple comments per post about how $XRP doesn’t do anything or they can’t take it anymore or how they’ve sold. This tells me we are close to our next leg. Infighting and despair isn’t a mark of a top…. — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) August 28, 2025 XRP Community’s Reactions The post prompted a range of responses from members of the XRP community. Xoom (@Mr_Xoom), a well-respected figure in the crypto space, agreed with Cryptoinsightuk’s comments, calling his assessment spot on. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Others remarked that they had seen similar attitudes of frustration but still pointed out the significant developments ahead on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , indicating optimism about the technology despite short-term negativity. Another community member added that there is still activity happening behind the scenes that may eventually show its impact. A similar perspective came from another commenter who noted that people will realize the importance of what they hold, reinforcing the view that long-term conviction could be rewarded. Outlook for XRP XRP’s price history shows that it has often remained static for long periods before moving suddenly and at scale . This backdrop, combined with the current climate of frustration, creates a situation where market participants are uncertain, yet conditions may be aligning for stronger momentum. The analyst’s remarks suggest that negativity among holders does not necessarily reflect weakness in the asset itself. Instead, he interprets it as a sign that the market could be positioning for its next significant move. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

While the usual big names are still in the spotlight, more and more attention is shifting toward early-stage projects with fresh upside potential. Analysts are pointing to Ethereum, Binance Coin, Sui, and Pepe—with MAGACOIN FINANCE also creeping into the conversation as a new contender gaining a reputation for being one of the safest plays in the market. Here’s a closer look at why these five tokens are making waves in August 2025 and why some traders believe this presale wildcard could be one to watch closely. 1. Ethereum (ETH) – Institutional Demand Drives Record Highs Ethereum has been one of the highest-rallying cryptocurrencies this year, all thanks to the success of the ETF launches and sustained institutional demand. In August alone, ETFs have pulled in nearly $3 billion, indicating the level of institutional interest in ETH. With more than 30% of ETH staked and a DeFi TVL of $95 billion, Ethereum remains the backbone of altcoin momentum. Analysts expect ETH to reach $7,500 to $10,000 by late 2025, making it a frontrunner among the best altcoins to buy now. 2. Binance Coin (BNB) – Utility and Ecosystem Growth BNB trades near $850 with strong support around $820. Its value comes from Binance’s ecosystem — powering exchange fees, DeFi staking, and treasury programs. Analysts see potential for $940 in the near term and $1,770 by 2026. BNB’s consistent growth makes it a staple in many portfolios of the top altcoins to buy in 2025. 3. Sui (SUI) – Gaming and Real-World Assets Sui is proving itself as a scalable blockchain built for gaming and real-world assets. The network surpassed 4 billion transactions and boasts $2.72 billion in DeFi TVL. Gaming protocols like Jackson.io and tokenized gold via Matrixdock’s XAUm are expanding its ecosystem. With SUI trading near $3.5 and targets of $5, it’s one of the more innovative altcoins to buy now. 4. Pepe (PEPE) – Meme Coin With Breakout Potential PEPE is consolidating near $0.00001001, with analysts watching resistance at $0.0000125. A breakout could double its price, though risk remains high. Still, viral community energy keeps PEPE relevant, and spinoffs like Little Pepe raising $21 million prove the brand has staying power. For traders who embrace volatility, PEPE is still among the best altcoins to buy now. 5. MAGACOIN FINANCE – Secure Presale With Growing Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum has kept it in the spotlight. The token is moving faster across crypto circles than established tokens, with some now comparing it to the early stages of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. What sets the token apart is its growing community. Investors and traders alike are excited by the potential of the token as one of the standout altcoins. Alongside that, large investors are exiting their positions in other tokens to key into MAGACOIN FINANCE based on its low entry price and solid roadmap. For smart investors, that sends a signal as to where the market is going. MAGACOIN FINANCE may not have the backing of BNB or the institutional demand of Ethereum, but it surely has a momentum that positions it as one of the best altcoins to buy now, ahead of the altcoin season. Final Take Ethereum and Binance Coin continue to show strength backed by big institutions, Sui is carving out its place with real-world utility, and PEPE is proving that meme culture still has a seat at the table. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping in as a newer, more secure option that’s starting to gain traction with investors. So, for investors wondering what are the best altcoins to buy now? This mix of proven giants and up-and-coming tokens could give traders a balanced approach heading into the next altcoin season.

SPX6900 (SPX) functions primarily on the Ethereum network. The token was created as a meme to entertain wider audiences. It has no real connection with stock market, equities, or securities. The meme coin generates interest through spot trading, market speculation, or perpetual and leveraged trading on different decentralized exchanges; the latter is not recommended for non-professionals due to its high risk and highly volatile nature. SPX6900 is traded on different centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. The most popular centralized exchange for trading SPX tokens is Bybit, which has the highest trading volume for this meme coin. SPX6900 (SPX) can be stored in various wallets, including Trust Wallet, Bitget Wallet, and hardware wallets like Ledger. It can also be stored on a centralized exchange like KuCoin and another option could be Kraken, providing easy access to the coin. Early users attest to its credibility and remarkable price performance; however, the meme token still holds the interest of many investors with a daily trading volume in millions and a current circulating supply of 930.99 million SPX, which is also its total supply, although its max supply will be 1 billion tokens. Starting as a non-serious venture, the coin established itself as one of the most high-ranking coins of the year 2024. It was initiated as a useless token but ultimately ended up earning profits in the millions. For example, over a month, SPX earned up to a 9000% return following its ascent through September 2024.

SPX6900 price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has increased to $1.12 in the past 24 hours. If buyers push the price above immediate resistance channels, we might see the SPX6900 price surging toward $1.20 level. On the other hand, a drop below the $1.08 support line can strengthen sellers’ domination. In such a case, a decline toward $1 is highly likely. Is SPX6900 a good investment? Investing in SPX necessitates an evaluation of the SPX market and its emphasis on adaptability. Despite the earlier price spikes and enormous price gains, investors are advised to exercise caution on account of the market volatility of meme coins. Earnings from SPX require long-term investment decisions, whether holding or trading, but in this dynamic market, risk management is primarily achieved through diversification and keeping abreast of developments.

SPX’s nearest resistance level is at $1.35. Will SPX6900 recover? SPX token maintained an overbought status for a few days. If buyers defend the immediate support levels and push the price above the Fib channels, a recovery can be initiated. Will SPX6900 reach $2? SPX token may reach $2 in 2025. With the current price action, this seems quite possible, as the token is trending above $1 and its market cap will nearly double when it reaches this level. Will SPX reach $3? Per SPX price prediction, it has a chance of reaching $3 by 2026 if positive sentiment prevails, which makes SPX tokens a good purchase option. Will SPX reach $5? To reach $5, SPX’s value along with its market cap will have to increase fivefold. Though not impossible, there are chances of reaching this level by 2027. Does SPX6900 have a good long-term future? Long-term forecasts suggest a gradual increase in the value of SPX over the next two years. Following this period, projections anticipate sustained upward price movement with a potential resurgence in 2029. By 2031, SPX is expected to trade above $12, solidifying its position as a valuable long-term asset. SPX6900 does not only capitalize on mere entertainment but is also driven by the community surrounding it. Recent news/opinions on SPX6900 Some of the crypto influencers are bullish on SPX6900, like MustStopMurad, ApeToshi Aeon, and Maddox, a best-selling author and blogger known for “The Best Page in the Universe” and technology-related content. On May 28, Murad shared a post highlighting the community behind SPX6900’s success, and recently Maddox shared a video along the same lines. The most recent and bold claim is made by a user whose post was reshared by @MustStopMurad, speculating that SPX6900 will be the first of its kind to reach a $100 billion market capitalization. However, such content should be taken with a pinch of salt. SPX6900 will be the first meme coin to pull $100 Billion mc.

SPX6900 historic price sentiment SPX6900 price history SPX6900 was launched in August 2023 by its primary creators with an opening price of $0.003 but remained under the radar for over a year. In October 2023, SPX’s value spiked to $0.023 under bullish control, which was a considerable growth trajectory, but still, it remained far from market attention. December of 2023 saw a low price of $0.008, which was quite low as compared to the price in October as per crypto market historical data. SPX6900 saw a stagnating price movement from January to May 2024, only to rise periodically to $0.015. In September 2024, SPX6900 gained an enormous 5600% from September 12 to October 14, reaching $0.913, resulting in a massive market capitalization. The token made higher spikes till November 7, 2024, adding significantly to its market cap; however, the token’s price has deteriorated afterwards. On November 21, SPX6900 stooped to $0.450, losing 50% of its value, which made holders cautious. However, the token regained its lost value and ended the year at $0.856. The meme token entered January 2025 with a price tag of $0.866, but it soon jumped to $1.55 as its circulation and acceptance increased. It corrected strongly in search of support at the start of February, attaining an average price of $0.66, but came down to the 0.46 range in March. In April, the coin was trending near $0.386 on the lower side, while in May, it saw a fabulous recovery, peaking at $1.11 along with some other cryptocurrencies. On June 11, the meme coin attained its all time high of $1.73, and on July 28, it marked another ATH at $2.27, SPX is trending above the psychological mark of $1, trading at $1.2 under complete bullish dominance, proving itself a reliable asset.

The entire meme coin market is worth around $73 billion, which could grow further should current momentum be sustained into October. Beyond Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, meme coin investors are also spotlighting newer players such as MAGACOIN FINANCE —a secured and fully audited project—in their list of the best meme coins to buy in 2025. Dogecoin vs Shiba Inu: Who Holds the Edge? Dogecoin has been holding steady around $0.21–$0.22 after a brief rally to $0.25. Whales have scooped up more than 680 million DOGE this month, showing strong confidence. If DOGE can break above $0.23, analysts say a move toward $0.28 is possible, with ETF speculation adding fuel. Beyond price, Dogecoin’s ecosystem is expanding with upgrades like RadioDoge, designed to boost real-world use cases. Shiba Inu, on the other hand, has faced a tougher month. Shibarium’s new governance features are promising, but SHIB’s burn rate dropped nearly 99%, raising doubts about its deflationary strength. Price action has been weak, slipping around 3% to $0.0000124. Still, whales buying more than $1.6 million in SHIB suggest strategic accumulation. With DAO elections, AI partnerships, and even a SHIB-backed stablecoin planned for 2026, SHIB remains on many lists of the best meme coins to buy now despite short-term setbacks. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Investors Growing, Analysts Watchlist While older names battle for dominance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its place among the best meme coins to buy in 2025 . On-chain data shows demand for MAGACOIN FINANCE is growing fast. Analysts who track high upside projects have also noted the attention in the token, predicting it could outperform leaders such as DOGE and SHIB. With the community growing and attention spreading through the crypto market, investors now have a limited-time opportunity to get into MAGACOIN FINANCE. By using the code PATRIOT50X, early investors can gain an exclusive 50% EXTRA bonus. For smart investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the best meme coin to buy now as the market slowly recovers. Why Investors Are Watching Meme Coins Closely With capital rotating in the crypto market, meme coins remain one of the best strategic plays for investors hoping to ride the next bull cycle wave. With meme coins delivering sporadic returns in previous cycles, history is bound to repeat itself. While DOGE and SHIB continue to command high community energy and whale-driven momentum, investors say MAGACOIN FINANCE is the meme token quietly gaining traction, especially as the competition for the best meme coins to buy now is heating up.

Many altcoins continue with their sluggish performance, while CRO has resumed its recent run with another surge to well over $0.3. BTC Dipped to $107K It has been quite a painful period for the primary cryptocurrency, which intensified last Sunday. At the time, the asset had calmed at $115,000 after suring past $117,000 on Friday evening. However, the bears took complete control of the market as the weekend was coming to an end and propelled a massive decline that drove BTC to a multi-week low of under $111,000. Although bitcoin tried to recover some ground on Monday, its progress was quickly halted, and it dropped further, this time to a new low of $108,750. The bulls intervened once again and pushed BTC to just over $113,000 on Thursday. Nevertheless, that was another short-lived rally as the bears initiated another leg down that culminated earlier this morning when bitcoin nosedived to its lowest level since early July of $107,100. It has bounced off since then and currently trades above $108,500, but it’s still 1% down on the day. Its market cap has dumped to $2.160 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is fighting to remain above 56%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView CRO Back on the Gas Pedal The biggest gainer of the week was undoubtedly Cronos’ CRO, which skyrocketed following massive adoption news from companies related to the current US President. In just a few days, the asset went from roughly $0.15 to a multi-year peak of $0.38. It dipped below $0.3 yesterday during the market-wide retracement, but it has added over 11% of value daily and is back to over $0.32. OKB is another recent high-flyer that has resumed its rally, and a 10% daily pump has pushed it to almost $180. Pi Network’s native token has regained some traction, and a 6% surge has driven it to $0.37. The rest of the larger-cap alts are quite sluggish on a daily scale, with minor gains from ETH, BNB, DOGE, ADA, TRX, and SUI, while XRP, SOL, LINK, HYPE, and XLM are with insignificant losses. The total crypto market cap has recovered some ground since its low this morning and is up to $3.850 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Market analyst Matt Hughes says breaking above $3 could trigger a parabolic move. Standard Chartered predicts XRP could rise over 300% to $12.50. Even as broader crypto sentiment has softened, some market watchers remain convinced that XRP is on the verge of its long-awaited surge. Technical analysts point to a maturing chart structure that suggests the asset’s next breakout phase is closer than many expect. XRP Flips Old Cycle Tops Into New Support, Building a Strong Foundation For instance, analyst Matt Hughes has outlined how XRP’s price action continues to flip former resistance zones into solid support levels. Using a Gann Fan on the weekly chart, Hughes showed that major resistance points from 2018 and 2021 have already been broken and turned into new foundations for growth. XRP has now traded above its 2021 peak of $1.96 for weeks without slipping below. The range that once capped its movements between $0.50 and $1 has long been left behind.

From Freeze to Flexibility In July 2024, Tether said it would stop buying back and freeze USDT on these networks starting September 1, 2025. Following feedback from user communities, the company adjusted its approach: smart contracts will not be frozen. This means users will still be able to transfer USDT between wallets on these blockchains. However, new issuance and redemption of tokens will stop, effectively ending official company support for them. Strategic Refocus on High-Activity Ecosystems Tether explained the decision as part of its broader strategy to concentrate on ecosystems with strong developer activity, scalability, and user demand. The company emphasized: “Tether remains committed to a smooth transition and will continue to engage with the community to provide transparency and clarity throughout this process.” Expansion Through Bitcoin-Based Protocols Just a day earlier, Tether announced the launch of USDT on the RGB protocol , a new layer-two solution for issuing digital assets on Bitcoin. This will allow users to hold the stablecoin natively alongside BTC in compatible wallets, expanding utility and adoption.

Built to streamline cross-border payments, Remittix has already raised $22,3M, secured BitMart and LBank listings and is preparing its wallet beta launch. With strong adoption momentum, many believe RTX could become the trending altcoin that defines the next bull run. Chainlink Price Consolidates Below Critical $25 Resistance Chainlink News has been buzzing as the project partners with the U.S. Department of Commerce to bring macroeconomic data on-chain, boosting its role in financial infrastructure. The LINK Price today trades at $24.16, holding firm above key moving averages, while the Chainlink Price Prediction signals a bullish bias despite short-term consolidation between $22.36 and $23.36. Institutional inflows from SBI Group and Caliber highlight strong adoption, yet upside remains capped below $25. Analysts note that whales are accumulating, but unless the LINK Price breaks resistance, progress may stall. Pi Coin Price Prediction Notes Bullish Divergence On RSI Pi Network News has fueled optimism after the team launched Pi Node’s Linux version and confirmed smart contract functionality through Stellar’s protocol 23 upgrade. The Pi Network Price today trades near $0.3519, up 3% as bulls defend the $0.3220 support. Analysts note a falling channel breakout could target the 50-day EMA at $0.4120, signaling a possible shift in momentum. The Pi Coin Price Prediction remains cautiously bullish, with RSI divergence supporting recovery. Yet, risks remain if PI fails to hold its base, with potential retests of $0.3220 or $0.3000. While Pi Network builds towards mainnet activation, Remittix is stealing the attention of investors. Remittix Raises $22,3 Million+ And Secures Major Exchange Listings Analysts are increasingly pointing to Remittix (RTX) as the altcoin with the clearest path to mass adoption. Unlike speculative projects, Remittix is built to fix real problems in cross-border remittances, using blockchain to deliver faster, cheaper, and more transparent payments than traditional banks. With over $22,3 million raised at just $0.10 per token, investors see RTX as a rare early-stage opportunity with strong fundamentals. BitMart confirmed as the first CEX listing, ensuring global liquidity and access Upcoming LBank listing adds momentum and credibility before public trading Wallet beta launch on September 15th signals real product utility before TGE $22,3M+ milestone achieved with over 630 million tokens already sold This blend of progress and adoption separates RTX from competitors like Chainlink and Pi Network, which remain limited by consolidation phases and delayed mainnet rollouts. Add in the $250,000 Remittix Giveaway, and momentum is clearly accelerating.

A fresh project, XYZVerse (XYZ), is now catching attention for its incredible growth prospects in 2025. With excitement building and big gains suggested, all eyes are on this emerging contender. What makes XYZ stand out while others fade? The answer may surprise many. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) Source: TradingView PENGU has cooled. Price slipped 0.84% in the last 7 days and 20.60% in 30 days, yet it still shows a 245.21% gain over 6 months. It now trades near $0.033 inside the $0.0295-$0.0379 band. Short term mood is cautious, long term chart stays bright. The coin sits almost flat with its 10-day SMA at $0.0301 and 100-day SMA at $0.0308. RSI at 48.88 and stochastic at 47.55 signal balance. MACD is slightly negative. A push past $0.0379 would bring the $0.0416 ceiling into view and erase the recent monthly slide. If buyers clear $0.0416 the next target is $0.0500, roughly 50% above current trade. That swing would revive momentum. If sellers step in, watch $0.0249 support; a slip there opens $0.0165 and a possible 45% fall. Until a breakout, expect more range play. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price , far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Dogecoin (DOGE) Source: TradingView Dogecoin trades between $0.21 and $0.25. The last 7 days brought a 3.86% lift, but the 30-day chart shows a mild 0.31% dip. Even so, the coin is 8.08% higher than 6 months ago, hinting at a steady uptrend that keeps bulls interested. Buyers are poking $0.25. The first ceiling sits at $0.27, about 8% above. A break could open $0.30, a 20% jump from now. If sellers step in, price may drop 14% to $0.19 or 30% to $0.1541. These bands will guide the next move. Momentum is flat. Both 10 day and 100 day averages sit at $0.22, so DOGE hovers near fair value. The neutral RSI backs that view. Should volume rise, odds favor a push to $0.27 before month end. Failure to clear it would likely drag price back inside the $0.21-$0.25 channel. Conclusion PENGU and DOGE stay strong, yet all-sport memecoin XYZVerse unites fans, targets 20,000% growth, empowers community, lands sports media deals, crowning XYZ the memecoin GOAT of the 2025 bull run.

Decisions will weigh factors such as: TRX price movements User activity levels Ecosystem growth rate Why It Matters for TRON’s Future TRON has positioned itself as a leading blockchain for DeFi, stablecoins, and cross-border payments, often competing with Ethereum and Solana. Lowering fees is expected to enhance TRON’s competitiveness by making it more attractive for developers, dApps, and retail users who value low-cost transactions. Industry analysts note that fee reductions could encourage more stablecoin issuers and DeFi protocols to expand on TRON, which already dominates in USDT transactions. If successful, the initiative may significantly increase the network’s daily active users and strengthen its role in the global Web3 economy. Sun stressed that the move reflects TRON’s commitment to accessibility and its mission to build a blockchain ecosystem that is both scalable and affordable for everyday users.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|TRX|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-30 09:34:22

The initiative, revealed in a Fortune report citing six people familiar with the matter, would give investors stock-market exposure to the popular memecoin without directly holding it. The project is being pitched to investors as a DOGE treasury entity with backing from House of Doge, a corporate group launched earlier this year by the Dogecoin Foundation and based in Miami. While the effort is still in the early pitch stage, the plan is to establish a public company that will hold DOGE on its balance sheet, positioning it as a unique way for traditional investors to access the token. A Dogecoin Treasury Vehicle in the Making Spiro, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan, has represented high-profile names such as Elon Musk, Jay-Z, and Alec Baldwin. According to investor materials and conversations, he is expected to chair the new Dogecoin company once established. However, no launch date or final structure has been confirmed. The move comes amid a wave of firms turning themselves into crypto treasury companies. These businesses raise capital to buy and hold digital assets, mirroring strategies once reserved for Bitcoin-focused enterprises. DOGE, though less widely adopted than Bitcoin or Ethereum, has carved out a niche following thanks to its active community and Musk’s frequent endorsements. Growing Corporate Interest in DOGE Several companies have already made significant Dogecoin-related moves this year. In February, Vancouver-based Neptune Digital Assets disclosed the purchase of one million DOGE at an average of $0.37, adding to its diverse portfolio that also includes Bitcoin. More recently, Nasdaq-listed Bit Origin announced up to $500 million in financing to build a dedicated DOGE treasury, becoming the first U.S.-traded company to commit its balance sheet to DOGE. Musk himself has long influenced Dogecoin’s trajectory . Tesla, his electric car company, holds undisclosed amounts of DOGE and has accepted it as payment for select merchandise since 2022. Musk’s remarks on social media have repeatedly sent the token’s price swinging, from his 2019 tweet calling DOGE his “favorite cryptocurrency” to his infamous 2021 Saturday Night Live appearance labeling it a “hustle.” Notably, Spiro also defended Musk in a lawsuit brought by investors accusing him of manipulating DOGE price. That case was dismissed in late 2024 , strengthening the attorney’s ties to the cryptocurrency just months before his new role emerged.

Apple led the mobile revolution with the smartphone, dominating the premium market for 13 years; Google created a new standard for accessing information through its search engine, capturing 92% of the global search market; Netflix completely transformed entertainment consumption patterns with streaming services; and Amazon established absolute dominance in e-commerce and cloud computing. Now, the same historic moment is unfolding in the blockchain ecosystem. WonderChain is creating an entirely new paradigm called Web3.5, rising as the master of the next-generation blockchain era. Explosive Growth Potential of the Web3.5 Market and WonderChain’s Exclusive Position According to blockchain market research firm Grand View Research, the Web3.0 market size is expected to grow explosively from $3.2 billion in 2024 to $49.1 billion in 2034, with a CAGR of 31.8%. However, Web3.5, presented by WonderChain, aims at a completely new dimension beyond the existing Web3.0. The core of Web3.5 is to implement an integrated platform that overcomes the technical limitations of existing blockchains, satisfying practicality, scalability, and user experience all at once. This is similar to how Apple combined the internet and app ecosystem with existing phones to create a completely new category: the smartphone. WonderChain has secured exclusive first-mover advantages in this vast new market. The simultaneous coverage by 51 major media outlets worldwide is unprecedented in blockchain history, clearly proving WonderChain’s innovation and market impact. Overwhelming Community Participation – Creating a New Standard Over 80% participation in the WonderChain community sets a new benchmark in the blockchain industry. Compared to Bitcoin’s 23% and Ethereum’s 31%, this is more than double, indicating a true ecosystem of engaged participants rather than merely investors. Currently, the active community of over 80,000 members records an astonishing monthly growth rate of 300%. This surpasses the peaks of Solana (45% in 2021), Cardano (38% all-time high), and Polkadot (29% at initial launch), showing potential not only to reach 300,000 members but to grow into millions, even tens of millions, in a global community. Success Formulas of Big Tech Companies and WonderChain’s Strategic Similarities Apple – Ecosystem Monopoly Model -Apple Success Factor: Integrated closed structure of hardware, software, and services maximized user lock-in. -WonderChain Connection: WonderChain is building a blockchain lifestyle platform by integrating wallets, reward systems, commerce, and community based on Web3.5 standards. -Differentiation/Prospects: While Apple is closed, WonderChain pursues an open, standards-based ecosystem, promoting global network effects open to everyone. Google – Standard Definition Capability -Google Success Factor: Created de facto standards for internet information access through search algorithms and advertising systems, securing a monopoly. -WonderChain Connection: WonderChain defines the Web3.5 protocol, setting new standards for blockchain interactions, token usage, and linking with real-world value. -Differentiation/Prospects: Google’s standard was centralized; WonderChain aims for next-generation standards with trust and transparency based on decentralized governance. Netflix – Market Creation Power -Netflix Success Factor: Transitioned from DVD rentals to streaming, changing user habits and creating a completely new market. -WonderChain Connection: Evolving from experimental Web3.0 services, WonderChain introduces a new category: Web3.5, a real-life integrated digital economy. -Differentiation/Prospects: Just as Netflix changed content consumption, WonderChain converts digital behavior into real economic value, creating a new market. Amazon – Scalability and Diversification -Amazon Success Factor: Expanded from an online bookstore to e-commerce, cloud (AWS), logistics, and AI, dominating industries. -WonderChain Connection: Starting from blockchain-based reward models, WonderChain prepares expansion into travel, culture, commerce, and more. -Differentiation/Prospects: While Amazon grew through capital and data monopoly, WonderChain pursues sustainable growth through community participation, decentralized evaluation, and real-world integration. Apple → Ecosystem Completeness, Google → Standard Definition, Netflix → Paradigm Shift, Amazon → Scalability and Diversification. WonderChain reinterprets these four success formulas within the Web3.5 paradigm using a decentralized, real-life integrated approach, preparing for a next-generation monopolistic position in blockchain. Global VC Attention and Investment Frenzy With cryptocurrency VC investment expected to rise by 50% compared to the previous year in 2025, WonderChain has emerged as the top interest for global investors. Expectations of listings on the world’s largest exchanges – Binance, OKX, Bybit, Bitget – are actively discussed within the community, showing market recognition of WonderChain’s commercial value and technical excellence. Reports and cultural analyses by global media platforms such as Bitcoin World, Binance Square, CoinMarketCap, DailyHunt, China.com, and Phoenix News confirm WonderChain’s global impact and recognition in Asia’s largest market. Continuous global media attention demonstrates that WonderChain is not just a token but a core of industrial innovation. Next-Generation WonderChain – From First-Mover to Market Master The first-mover advantage is not merely about starting early, but defining market rules and creating entry barriers competitors cannot cross. WonderChain creates a new category called Web3.5 Technical Standard Leadership: Defining and implementing the Web3.5 protocol Ecosystem Network Effect: Over 80% participation, ultra-strong community Global Brand Awareness: Media power from simultaneous coverage by 51 outlets All these factors combine to establish an absolute advantage that latecomers cannot surpass. Expansion Roadmap Towards a 10-Million Global Community Current WonderChain community: 80,000+ members. Growth scenario Phase 1 (H2 2025): 300,000 – Official service launch Phase 2 (H1 2026): 1,000,000 – Service expansion to Singapore, Indonesia Phase 3 (H2 2026): 10,000,000 – Service expansion to Malaysia, Hong Kong & Macau This mirrors Apple’s early iPhone growth curve, a typical exponential growth pattern when innovative technology and strong community combine. Conclusion: Absolute Master of the Web3.5 Era, WonderChain In the history of technological innovation, true winners were those who created markets. Just as Apple, Google, Netflix, and Amazon did, WonderChain creates an entirely new market, establishing itself as the absolute leader of the next-generation blockchain paradigm. A super-strong community showing over 80% participation, explosive expansion with 300% monthly growth, simultaneous attention from 51 global media outlets, and coverage by top media in the Greater China region – all of this proves that WonderChain is not merely a blockchain project, but the center of innovation redefining the entire industry. Having secured first-mover advantage, WonderChain has now begun its journey as the master of the market. From 80,000 to 10 million, from a single community to a global ecosystem, from Web3.0 to Web3.5 – WonderChain is writing a new chapter in blockchain history.

Even though both projects still reside among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, many holders are already beginning to look to other alternatives in the market. In light of the need for fresh initiatives, Remittix (RTX) , a new DeFi project, stands out with its goal to address real-world payment issues. The project’s ongoing presale has garnered massive support, with over $22.2 million raised to date. Read on to find out more. ADA price weakness and ETH downtrend Cardano has taken steps to elevate its market position despite a 2.61% decline over the last seven days. Its recent Ouroborous Leis upgrade has piqued the interest of investors who believe it could lead to a rally from its current price of $0.82 to $1. Ethereum remains the leader in the smart contracts market, with a market capitalisation of $529.9 billion, although its daily trade volume has declined by more than 9%. Despite the strong positions Cardano and Ethereum hold, ADA and ETH holders are trusting RTX, a new altcoin for 20x leverage. Remittix presale momentum Unlike speculative tokens, the Remittix project aims to develop a seamless onramp between cryptocurrencies and fiat, enabling users to send currencies like BTC, ETH, and ADA directly into traditional bank accounts.

The RTX presale is ongoing, with the token price of $0.01000 per token, due to the high demand, over $22.2 million has been raised with and over 628 million tokens sold. The presale momentum was so strong that it secured listings on key centralised exchanges like BitMart and LBank, increasing access and liquidity worldwide for early buyers. Investors highlight Remittix as a cross-chain DeFi project with genuine utility. The platform integrates with over 30 countries and supports more than 40 cryptocurrencies, enabling real-life payments and remittances at a low cost. Such features as open FX conversion and low gas fees make RTX one of the next leading altcoins in 2025. Beta wallet launch & utility Going forward, Remittix will roll out its beta wallet in Q3 2025. The mobile-first offering will feature real-time FX conversion, easy cross-border payments, and multi-fiat currency support. For the typical user, this translates to cryptocurrency now being easily used for making payments, from freelancers receiving overseas payments to families sending money abroad.

That kind of growth is unheard of in traditional stock market indices. But wait until you hear what Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse thinks is next for crypto. Garlinghouse believes the crypto market could expand by another ~600% over the next five years, potentially reaching a $25T market cap by 2030 . Keep reading to discover why Ripple’s boss predicts such explosive growth for crypto, his insights on Ripple’s own token, $XRP, and how you can position yourself for this potentially outrageous rally by loading up on the best altcoins to buy now . Why Fiat Instability Fuels the Case for Crypto Garlinghouse cited the vulnerability of traditional fiat currencies as the biggest reason behind his extremely bullish crypto outlook. He explained that macroeconomic pressures on fiat are all but certain to intensify in the coming years, which could push traditional currencies toward devaluation and long-term instability. Amid such uncertainty, digital assets provide more than just hope; they’re built specifically to plug the holes in the global financial system, offering transparency, efficiency, and inflation-resistant store of value that fiat currencies simply can’t match. XRP’s Role in Crypto’s Growth As one of the biggest cryptocurrencies targeting the cross-border payments market, many believe $XRP could become one of the biggest success stories in the next few years. Lord XRP , a crypto enthusiast with 77K+ X followers, explained that since XRP was designed to handle banking transactions (even in the range of 4-5 figures), Ripple is well on its way to becoming a ‘world bank.’ All in all, with prominent industry voices bullish on crypto’s long-term growth, everyday investors will fare extremely well if they simply exercise patience during slightly deeper consolidations like the one we’re seeing now. In fact, now’s the perfect time to beef up your crypto portfolio with low-cap, high-upside tokens that are well-positioned to ride the upcoming boom. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Powering a Telegram Trading Bot for Meme Coin Sniping Snorter Token ($SNORT) is one of the best cryptos to buy now for those looking to ride the explosive growth of the meme coin market. While altcoins continue to dominate crypto discussions, the meme coin segment alone has grown by more than 70% in the past year , proving there’s so much more juice in it than many realize. $SNORT powers the Snorter Bot, a new Telegram-native trading bot designed to level the playing field between institutional players and everyday meme coin traders. How? By allowing retail investors to set buy/sell orders in advance, and then automatically executing them the moment liquidity kicks in. As a result, you’ll finally get the chance to participate in those early meme coin pumps, where life-changing gains are usually made. Security is another standout. Snorter offers protection against a wide range of on-chain threats, including front-running, rug pulls, honeypots, and even advanced sandwich attacks. By buying $SNORT , you’re positioning yourself to ride the adoption of Snorter Bot while unlocking a slew of exclusive benefits along the way: A potential 800% ROI by year-end, according to our $SNORT price prediction Reduced trading fees: just 0.85% compared to 1.50% charged to non-holders No daily sniping limits Advanced analytics Staking rewards, currently yielding 128% Currently in presale, $SNORT has already pulled in over $3.55M from early investors, with each token available at just $0.1027. Visit Snorter Token’s official website for more information. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Community-Backed Meme Coin Aiming to Overtake Dogecoin Maxi Doge ($MAXI) might not have a shiny whitepaper or game-changing technology, but its absurd mission to overthrow Dogecoin as the best meme coin on the planet has already gathered plenty of hype and community support. The project has raised over $1.66M in early investor funding, proving that degen investors are hungry for a wild, rage-fueled meme coin. What’s Maxi Doge , really? Believe it or not, Maxi is Dogecoin’s distant cousin. But the two are anything but close. Dogecoin’s popularity left Maxi in the shadows growing up, as the elder, more ‘wholesome’ Shiba Inu hogged all the limelight at family gatherings. That’s when Maxi found solace in the gym and in front of the charts, where he built big muscles and chased even bigger gains. Now, backed by a fierce community of $MAXI holders who all subscribe to his mantra of ‘never skip leg day, never skip a pump’, the dawg is ready to take the market by storm. In addition to allocating a chunky 40% of its total token supply to marketing, $MAXI will also host regular holder-only events, including weekly trading competitions and leaderboard prizes, all aimed at amplifying the noise around it. Interested? Join the tribe by buying $MAXI at just $0.0002545 apiece. Hurry up, though, because the price will increase in just a few hours. Check out Maxi Doge’s official website for more information. 3. Ethereum ($ETH) – Digital Silver Prepping for a Fresh Breakout Ethereum ($ETH) has undoubtedly been the talk of the crypto town over the past two weeks, with whales pouring big money into the ‘digital silver.’ For instance, BlackRock recently snapped up more than $314M worth of Ethereum , while Goldman Sachs and Jane Street grabbed a combined 192.5K $ETH . More notably, Thomas Lee, a significant voice in the crypto space, explained that while Wall Street once dismissed Ethereum for being slower than Solana or Sui, institutions are now betting big on it because of its ability to deliver 100% uptime – something non-negotiable for big-money players. ‘ If ETH stays above $4,800, we could see a really big cycle ,’ Lee added. That prediction looks even stronger when you consider that a massive $4.65B worth of shorts would be liquidated if Ethereum retests its all-time high. Although $ETH has been red all week, the drop isn’t as bad as it looks – because its weekly candle remains within last week’s range. According to the technical playbook, this forms a classic ‘inside candle’ pattern, and a breakout here could trigger an explosive rally. Wrapping Up With Ripple’s CEO projecting a nearly tenfold increase in crypto’s valuation by 2030, the stage is set for promising altcoins like $SNORT , $MAXI , and $ETH to shine in the upcoming bull run. That said, kindly bear in mind that crypto investments are highly risky.

In the analysis, the AI model emphasized that, whether aiming for a $10,000 portfolio value or generating a profit from XRP within twelve months, investors must decide how much to buy, at what level to sell, and whether to hold or trade around volatility. To this end, ChatGPT offered several scenarios. Scenarios for making $10,000 from XRP For smaller investors starting with $1,000 at the current XRP price of $2.80, the portfolio would grow to $10,000 only if the token surged nearly tenfold to about $28.80. Such an outcome, ChatGPT-5 noted, would require a major catalyst such as regulatory wins for Ripple, global adoption, or the approval of an XRP ETF . A medium investor with $5,000 could more realistically achieve the target if XRP climbs to around $5.76. This aligns with analyst projections that place the cryptocurrency between $4.50 and $5.50 by year-end. For larger investors committing $10,000, the path is the most straightforward. With 3,472 XRP purchased, even a doubling in price to $5.76 would deliver a $10,000 profit, without the need for extreme price appreciation. How to make $10,000 from XRP. Source: ChatGPT As for strategies, ChatGPT-5 highlighted four approaches: holding through a bull run and aiming for $5 to $10, swing trading the 15% and 30% fluctuations, using leverage for amplified gains, or applying dollar-cost averaging to build a position gradually. At the same time, according to the AI, the most realistic route for investors with $5,000 and $10,000 is to hold until XRP reaches between $5 and $10. Smaller investors would need either a dramatic rally toward $25 or more, or an active trading approach to compound profits. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.81, down 1.64% in the last 24 hours, while on the weekly timeline, the asset has plunged almost 8%. XRP seven-day price chart.

According to information provided by sources familiar with the matter, the Senate Banking Committee aims to hold a markup hearing on September 30 for the bill titled “Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025.” The bill specifically aims to clarify the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) role in crypto markets. A markup session will give committee members an opportunity to propose amendments to the bill. The committee can then decide to submit the legislation to the full Senate.

Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, Cynthia Lummis, Bill Hagerty, and Bernie Moreno released a discussion draft of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act in July. This step comes shortly after the House of Representatives passed the CLARITY Act. Senators will release an updated bill before the markup session. The two separate bills need to be combined into a single bill during the legislative process. Lummis, speaking at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium this month, stated that he aims to get the crypto market structure bill to President Donald Trump's desk by Thanksgiving. The CLARITY Act passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 294-134, with 78 Democrats supporting it.

Remittix is rapidly moving to the top of the preferred list of smart investors with all its promising updates and possible explosive growth. Solana ETF news could spark huge gains for SOL Solana (SOL) is currently trading at around $211. In August, Solana’s DeFi value locked reached an impressive $11.7 billion, but the price still struggles to break through key levels. A Solana ETF news update could change this, as ETF approvals could propel SOL to new heights. Many analysts are predicting that Solana could see a price surge following the approval of a Solana ETF, but others are calling $200 a resistance level . While approval odds for 2025 are now at 75%, the upcoming ETF launch could push Solana’s price above $455 even $500, making it one of the most optimistic price forecasts for SOL. This is based on an ascending triangle pattern signaling a bullish continuation. A breakout above the resistance zone at $213.75 could push Solana to new highs, especially if the ETF momentum continues to grow. source: melikatrader94 on TradingView Dogecoin price updates show short-term struggles, but long-term potential Dogecoin’s latest news shows DOGE trading at around $0.2178, consolidating between $0.22 and $0.23. Despite strong support at $0.20–$0.21 , the meme-coin king has faced downward pressure due to a $200 million whale transfer that triggered a selloff. However, this price dip could be a brief correction before DOGE rebounds. Some analysts suggest DOGE could see a 30% price increase if the current consolidation phase is followed by a breakout. There are also signs of whale accumulation, with major holders moving 680 million DOGE into cold storage throughout August. If the price holds support and breaks through the resistance levels, DOGE could skyrocket to $0.30 or higher, with $1 being a possible target in 2026. source: CobraVanguard on TradingView Why Remittix is the real altcoin to watch Currently priced at $0.1000, Remittix has already raised over $22.2 million through the sale of 628 million tokens, and the token is gaining attention for its utility-based PayFi infrastructure. The big news? Remittix has already announced its first CEX listing on BitMart, and with the token now surpassing $22 million in sales, the next CEX listing is set for LBANK. Also, the Remittix Beta Wallet will become available on September 15, 2025, and it will provide a smooth platform to convert crypto-to-fiat payments. It is a breakthrough for the token, since it increases its usefulness to include not only speculation, but also general usage. Here’s why Remittix could do 30x: Confirmed CEX listing on BitMart and LBANK Beta Wallet launching in September 2025 Real-world PayFi infrastructure bridging crypto-to-fiat transactions Massive growth potential with a 30x ROI predicted by analysts Rapid adoption and real utility make Remittix a serious contender Conclusion While Solana ETF news could drive SOL to new heights and Dogecoin price updates suggest potential short-term bounces, Remittix is emerging as the altcoin with the most promising future. With a strong utility-driven approach, Remittix is set to benefit from real-world adoption and growing demand, making it the ideal choice for investors looking for massive returns.

However, a new filing with the agency may have a better chance of success. NEW: @AmplifyETFs just filed for an XRP option income ETF pic.twitter.com/LbJQ6NOEeK — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 29, 2025 New XRP ETF Filing Filed by Amplify ETFs, an Illinois-based investment company with $12.6 billion in AUM as of July 31, the new XRP ETF application will work quite differently from a regular spot one. For instance, a spot ETF holds the underlying asset directly, while the Options Income variation uses options strategies (mainly covered calls) on XRP (in this case) to generate steady monthly income (yield) for its investors. In general, such ETFs gain some form of exposure to the underlying asset (which can include direct purchases), sell call options on the holdings to collect premiums, and distribute the proceeds to investors as monthly income. The options expire on a monthly basis, allowing the ETF to reset its strategy at the end of each month and pay income regularly to shareholders, which becomes a predictable but capped yield. As such, the Monthly Options Income ETF relies more on a steady monthly income rather than a massive price surge for the underlying asset. Better Chance of Success? The US SEC has seen numerous changes in its leadership and approach to crypto regulation in 2025. The departure of Gary Gensler, who had led an all-out assault against the industry, allowed the regulator to undertake a more moderate approach, resulting in countless dropped lawsuits, including a positive resolution in the SEC v. Ripple case. However, the agency is yet to greenlight a spot XRP ETF, even though many futures-based ones saw the light of day. To this day, the SEC keeps delaying making a decision on all filings. As such, many industry participants and commentators indicated that Amplify ETFs’ application could be approved sooner, as it differs from a regular spot XRP ETF. Nevertheless, prediction markets and experts still believe that the SEC will greenlight a spot XRP ETF this year. Data from Polymarket shows that the current odds for such a product to hit the US markets in 2025 are at almost 90%.

While Solana trades near $210 with targets toward $300–$400 and Cardano consolidates around $0.85 with $2 forecasts, neither offers the same explosive potential and real-world use case that RTX brings to the table. Investors are now shifting from traditional Layer 1s to utility-first projects with explosive growth potential, and Remittix is quickly becoming the next breakout altcoin of 2025. Let’s dive in. Solana price momentum faces resistance amid ETF delays Solana is holding steady around $210, with analysts pointing to possible upside toward $224 and higher. However, ETF approval delays have cooled near-term momentum, leaving price growth dependent on macro conditions and inflows. Solana’s fundamentals remain strong, fast transactions, low fees, and growing DeFi adoption, but its short-term upside appears capped until regulators move forward. Medium-term, Solana could move to eclipse its ATH at $295 and grind towards $300, but for investors seeking outsized returns this year, the biggest opportunities lie elsewhere. Cardano shows resilience amid whale accumulation Cardano sits near $0.85, buoyed by whale accumulation and a $71 million community-approved upgrade fund. Short-term targets point to $0.94–$1.04, with potential long-term expansion above $2 in 2025 if network upgrades succeed. Yet, while Cardano remains fundamentally strong, its growth curve looks slower compared to projects designed for immediate mass adoption. Enter Remittix. Remittix: The next big altcoin under $1 you can’t afford to miss If you’ve ever regretted missing out early on ETH or XRP, Remittix is definitely your second chance. At just $0.10, RTX is laser-focused on a $19 trillion remittance industry, offering instant crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries with rock-bottom fees and real-time FX conversion. This isn’t hype, it’s adoption. Over $22 million has already been raised and a Q3 wallet is set to ignite more demand. Unlike inflationary tokens, RTX deploys deflationary mechanics with token burns, ensuring scarcity as adoption grows. Why investors are piling in: Global Reach: 30+ countries, direct crypto-to-bank transfers Real Utility: Not speculation, real payments that solve a trillion-dollar pain point Deflationary Tokenomics: Built for sustainable, exponential growth Strong Momentum: $22 Million raised, community of 25,000 holders and growing fast This is where the FOMO is real, early buyers are locking in before the next milestone sends RTX soaring. RTX momentum: The clock is ticking Remittix’s $250,000 giveaway has already pulled in over 300,000 participants, amplifying community hype. Every presale phase is bringing higher entry costs, meaning those who hesitate now will likely pay more later, or worse, miss the run entirely. In 2025, Remittix is where the life-changing upside is with Solana and Cardano having decent returns. RTX is one of the most promising moonshots in 2025 due to its formation of a clear roadmap, real-world demand, and aggressive exchange rollout. The present cycle may have gains of 4,500% and more to investors who make this move now. Don’t be left on the other side when RTX breaks out.

The report uncovers how platform tokens, with Mantle (MNT) at the forefront, are emerging as essential pillars of liquidity, governance, and ecosystem growth. August 2025 has marked a historic month for digital assets, with both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) reaching new all-time highs. This market surge has created powerful momentum for platform tokens, which are increasingly recognized not only as trading incentives but also as critical components of exchange-driven ecosystem strategies. Key Highlights Mantle (MNT): Strengthened by Bybit’s Mantle 2.0 launch and integrated across loan, staking, and structured products. On-chain insights: Santiment data highlights whale redistribution patterns and elevated MVRV ratios for MNT. Ecosystem impact: Bybit’s MiCAR-compliant staking framework in Europe reinforces regulatory alignment and long-term value creation. Mantle (MNT): Exchange-Driven Momentum Launched in July 2023 following its rebrand from BitDAO, Mantle has quickly risen as a high-performance Layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution designed to reduce costs and improve throughput for decentralized applications. Bybit has strategically embedded MNT within its platform, including loan offerings, staking programs, and structured investment products. Santiment data shows sharp increases in $100K+ and $1M+ whale transactions during MNT rallies, often signaling both accumulation and redistribution phases. Bybit’s MiCAR-compliant staking program in Europe further underscores Mantle’s regulatory-ready integration. Combined with creator-focused initiatives and structured product innovations, Mantle is evolving into a cornerstone asset, demonstrating how a platform token can anchor vibrant and engaged ecosystems. Platform Tokens: An Industry-Wide Trend Beyond Mantle, the Bybit × Santiment report highlights that platform tokens are gaining prominence across the industry. Once limited to fee discounts and basic incentives, these tokens are now deeply embedded in exchange ecosystems, powering governance, liquidity, and user engagement. Their structural role demonstrates how platform tokens have become essential to the long-term growth of the digital asset economy. The Era of Platform Tokens The Bybit × Santiment report concludes that platform tokens like Mantle are no longer secondary incentives but structural pillars of the modern crypto economy. Their integration across liquidity, governance, and product ecosystems creates strong network effects and a self-reinforcing flywheel of adoption. As user engagement and developer activity expand, Mantle’s demand is set to grow in tandem, positioning it as a key driver of Bybit’s ecosystem and a cornerstone of global crypto infrastructure. #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk / #BybitResearch / #IMakeIt About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 60 million users.

The company, which was until recently a Tokyo-listed operator of nail salons, now wants to become one of the corporations owning a large stash of the asset. Over the last few months, there have been plenty of corporations reinventing their financial landscape, with most of them pushing into the crypto industry. While the crypto market is seeing a boom, the Japanese firm has unveiled its ambitious plans. It intends to raise 434 billion yen (approximately $3 billion) to acquire 21,000 Bitcoin, which is equivalent to 0.1% of the total supply. Japanese firm wants to become a Bitcoin holder At the time of the announcement , Convano boasted a market value that was a fraction of that sum. However, since the announcement, its shares have more than doubled. In addition, its report on August 25 showed that the Japanese company has raised 2% of the needed funds and now holds about 365 Bitcoin . To make sure it actualizes its dreams, Convano is looking to adopt the same model popularized by Michael Saylor. This means that the firm will generate retail and institutional interest, lift the share price, and then convert it into capital to further its resolve concerning the purchase of Bitcoin. “We will enhance corporate value with the new plan, which will increase our stock price 10 times,” said Motokiyo Azuma, a director at Convano. Azuma is also in charge of the firm’s finance and crypto strategies. In the world of crypto, highlighting big ambitions is part of the model that has helped big companies thrive. Huge targets, even those far beyond the immediate reach of companies, have also served the function. They set expectations high, attract the needed attention, and in turn, move the market long enough to make that plan work. The Japanese company also said it is presenting the pivot as a rational response to macroeconomic pressures. The yen has been in a prolonged slide, with the currency weakening 21% against the dollar in the past decade, pushing up the costs of wages and raw materials for its consumer services and business. “We started to think about Bitcoin because of the persistent yen depreciation and geopolitical risks,” Azuma said. “Bitcoin is a long-term store of value.” Japan emerges as a center for Bitcoin accumulation The funds raised by the Japanese firm so far have seen 4.5 billion yen come from corporate bonds. The firm wants to acquire Bitcoin in three phases, pegging the average price of each coin at 19.9 million yen. Nomura Securities and SMBC Nikko Securities are expected to act as brokers, with the company remaining tight-lipped on an anchor investor or timeline for completing the fundraising. Japan has emerged as a surprising center for the business of Bitcoin accumulation via listed vehicles. Metaplanet, a firm that formerly operated in the hotel and hospitality scene, has accumulated about 19,000 Bitcoin, placing it among the top 10 holders globally. The risk in that space remains the momentum behind crypto treasuries. So many PIPE and SPAC deals have been used to turn several low-growth companies into crypto proxies, with the results being mixed. Ethzilla, a firm backed by Peter Thiel, lost more than half of its value days after becoming an Ethereum accumulator. “You can’t limp in,” said Michael Bucella, co-founder of Neoclassic Capital, a crypto investment manager. “You need to come in with size and be quick.” Even several big companies are undergoing pains or increasing the pace of their Bitcoin purchases. For Convano, its plan depends not only on Bitcoin’s appeal but also on the company’s ability to sustain investor confidence. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

BTC and ETH Stay Strong, but an Altcoin Is Moving to Hit $5",https://timestabloid.com/which-crypto-to-buy-today-for-long-term-roi-btc-and-eth-stay-strong/,"For years, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have remained the foundation of every serious crypto investment portfolio. Both assets provide stability, steady appreciation, and serve as the blue-chip benchmarks of the industry. Yet, long-term investors know that allocating only to the top two cryptocurrencies limits the upside available in the market. As new projects are launched with stronger structural mechanics, tactical exposure to early-stage tokens can radically improve portfolio performance. For investors evaluating what is going on with crypto today, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the standout DeFi project positioned to deliver outsized long-term ROI. Why MUTM’s Fundamentals Support A $5 Target Unlike tokens that rely solely on speculation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has embedded utility at its core. The project’s design will route protocol-generated fee revenue into continuous buybacks of MUTM, which will then be distributed to mtToken stakers. This will create permanent, automated demand for the token. At the same time, the planned Layer-2 integration will lower transaction costs and accelerate throughput, making the protocol more competitive. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also plans to introduce a $1 stablecoin that will deepen lending demand and ensure persistent borrowing activity, further reinforcing the buyback engine. The financial implications for investors are significant. Consider a patient buyer who commits $2,000 at the current Phase 6 presale price of $0.035. This allocation secures 57,100 MUTM tokens. With the long-term target price set at $5, this position will be valued at $285,700. That means a net profit of $283,700. These returns are anchored in utility, not hype. Repeated revenue-driven buybacks, a live beta at listing, and the natural discovery process of expected exchange listings will work in tandem to make this $5 thesis realistic for long-term users following crypto predictions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining strong traction during presale. The token has a total supply of 4 billion, with Phase 6 having already generated around $15.14 million. The current presale price is $0.035 and the project already has over 15,850 holders. Out of the 170 million tokens allocated for this phase, 30% have already been sold. Importantly, the project has been through a CertiK audit, using manual review and static analysis, and achieved a Token Scan Score of 95.00 alongside a Skynet Score of 78.00. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also attracted over 12,000 Twitter followers, while its audit timeline was first requested on February 25, 2025, and revised on May 20, 2025. These details strengthen transparency and reinforce long-term credibility for anyone analyzing crypto charts. Alongside its P2C lending system, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will integrate a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace that will appeal to a different segment of capital. In this model, lenders and borrowers will negotiate directly on APYs, loan durations, and terms. The protocol will allow partial fills to give greater flexibility and ensure a wider match of counterparties. All settlements will be enforced through smart contracts, removing counterparty risk and maintaining security. Roadmap and The Longer-Term Mechanics That Sustain ROI The roadmap for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is structured to deliver visibility, adoption, and long-term price support. Phase 6 of the presale is already in motion, and the move to Phase 7 will trigger a 15% increase in token price. Once the presale closes, the project will debut with a beta release at token listing, giving users the ability to test and interact with core features from the start. Layer-2 integration will follow, boosting efficiency and accelerating the pace of lending and borrowing activity. Each cycle of lending will feed protocol revenue back into MUTM buybacks, which will be redistributed to mtToken stakers, building sustained demand that will compound over time. As expected exchange listings on platforms like Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, MEXC, and Kraken expand liquidity and bring in more retail participation, the demand mechanics will begin to exert even greater pressure. Each redistribution round will reduce the amount of MUTM available on the open market, aligning directly with the $5 price target that long-term investors are analyzing in their crypto predictions. Final Verdict For traders watching what is going on with crypto today, this pathway is clear: secure discounted exposure while Phase 6 remains open. With 30% already sold and the next phase set to raise the price by 15%, the opportunity to position before broader market discovery is rapidly closing. For those balancing BTC and ETH with targeted exposure to high-conviction DeFi, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers the kind of asymmetric upside that can elevate overall returns. The mechanics are transparent, the audits are complete, and the roadmap is clear. Long-term ROI will not come from speculation but from utility, adoption, and constant buyback-driven demand — and that is precisely the advantage that positions MUTM to outperform.

The SUI Price today shows steady strength, driven by record network activity and growing institutional backing. Meanwhile, Remittix is stealing headlines with $22,3M+ raised, confirmed BitMart and LBank listings and its upcoming wallet beta. Analysts say RTX could be the altcoin delivering 7x gains next week. SUI Price Prediction Strengthens With Institutional Adoption Rising SUI News continues to heat up as whale activity drives inflows into the token. The SUI Price today sits at $3.48, up 1.5% on the day, backed by record network activity with 4.4 million daily transactions and over 605,000 active addresses. Analysts highlight that the fundamentals are catching up to the hype, setting the stage for a major breakout. The biggest spark came from Mill City Ventures’ rebrand to SUI Group Holdings, with 98% of a $450 million private placement directed into SUI’s treasury. Institutional confidence also surged after Swiss-regulated Sygnum Bank announced new custody and trading services for SUI, further validating its long-term adoption. On-chain data confirms strength, with DeepBook DEX hitting $100M in daily spot volume and weekly totals exceeding $457M. Technically, the SUI Price Prediction shows $3.45 as strong support , with the 50-day MA at $3.71 acting as immediate resistance. Analysts describe SUI as “coiled energy” ready to break higher, with symmetrical triangle patterns pointing to $6–$8 targets if momentum builds. The Sui Price Prediction highlights short-term upside of nearly 2x, with whales betting on even larger moves. While SUI dominates short-term chatter, Remittix is drawing attention with its $22M+ milestone, BitMart listing and upcoming LBank debut. Some traders believe SUI could break resistance next week, while RTX positions itself as the altcoin with 7x potential. Remittix $250K Giveaway Draws Thousands Ahead Of CEX Debut Whale investors are not just circling SUI News, they are also pouring into Remittix (RTX) , a PayFi token that is quickly shaping up to be one of the year’s biggest surprises. At $0.10 per token, with more than $22,2 million raised and over 630 million tokens sold, RTX is already attracting families, freelancers and businesses fed up with the cost and delays of international transfers. Remittix keeps it simple by solving an everyday problem: making money transfers seamless. $22.3M raised milestone with rapid community adoption underway BitMart confirmed listing, bringing global exposure and liquidity for RTX Upcoming LBank listing, adding momentum before public trading begins Wallet beta launches September 15th, first real product release for the ecosystem This real-world focus is why analysts believe RTX could deliver the kind of gains that whale traders are chasing. The $250,000 Remittix Giveaway has only amplified attention, and with major listings confirmed, RTX has the infrastructure to scale quickly. As whales drive inflows into both SUI and Remittix, market chatter suggests RTX could be the one delivering 7x gains in the near term.

Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a popular analyst on X, linked this upcoming event to XRP by referencing XRP’s parabolic move in late 2024 following similar rate cuts. Comparing the Charts He paired his comment with comparative charts illustrating how XRP reacted in 2024 and what could potentially happen in 2025. The 2024 chart shows that after the Fed completed a 25 basis point cut, XRP moved from below $0.50 to over $3 in early 2025, showing a sharp upward trajectory. The magnitude of the move exceeded 480% on the four-day chart, suggesting that monetary policy shifts had a significant influence on speculative flows into the cryptocurrency market at that time. Last September, when the Fed cut rates, #XRP went parabolic. Next decision: Sept 17 pic.twitter.com/Sv25N1EVEf — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 28, 2025 The 2025 chart projects a similar setup. XRP has been consolidating in a range between $2.90 and $3.30 following its all-time high of $3.65 in July . The visual comparison implies that another rate cut could bring conditions similar to last year, potentially igniting a new phase of upward momentum. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has held off on cutting rates throughout the year , and the market has been anticipating this move for an extended period. While no two market conditions are identical, the chart signals that XRP traders may be anticipating a repeat of the 2024 scenario if the Fed follows through with its expected cut. Influence of Monetary Policy Rate cuts by the Fed generally have wide-ranging effects on asset markets. They tend to weaken the U.S. dollar, reduce borrowing costs, and increase the appeal of riskier assets. Cryptocurrencies, including XRP, often respond positively to such changes because they benefit from the influx of liquidity and investor appetite for higher returns. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Donald Trump has consistently called for the Fed to cut rates . If another 25 basis point reduction is announced on September 17, traders may take it as a green light for another strong rally, particularly if broader risk assets join. Current Market Outlook At present, XRP remains subdued compared to its previous highs. Despite periods of accumulation , it has yet to break out decisively above resistance levels. The September meeting may provide the catalyst needed to establish a new direction. If history repeats, XRP could see a multi-dollar rally within a short time. However, this will also depend on external factors such as overall market sentiment, liquidity conditions, and investor risk tolerance.

It redefined the meaning of value and helped thousands of early adopters rake in tremendous gains. But LayerBrett, a new meme priced below 1 cent, looks like the better alternative for those in search of life-changing profits this year. Dogecoin marches towards $1 Dogecoin’s journey to the top is quite legendary. From its humble beginnings as a joke, it soared on the wings of viral enthusiasm, rallying strongly to be an online sensation that everyone wants to be a part of. DOGE experienced multiple surges, including its famous 2021 rally, which saw prices approach new heights and turned several people into crypto millionaires. Unfortunately, Dogecoin has never hit the $1 mark in spite of these numerous rallies. But that might be a thing of the past soon. That is because Dogecoin has spent the last couple of months consolidating, and the time is nigh for a bullish move. In terms of timeframe, Dogecoin price predictions anticipate this break above $1 in early 2026. Dogecoin price is expected to break through $0.50 from its current levels around $0.25 in late November, and hit the much coveted landmark in January or February of the next year. This would usher in decent profits for holders. However, experts believe that LayerBrett, a new meme sensation, would get to this price level first. 3 reasons LayerBrett could hit $1 before Dogecoin Reason #1. Utility and FUD immunity LayerBrett is expected to outperform Dogecoin because of its robust technological foundation. This is not like Dogecoin, which relies on hype and is vulnerable to FUD and speculation. LBRETT doubles as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, delivering fast, scalable and cost-efficient transactions. When the crypto market enters bullish mode at the end of the year, LBRETT would skyrocket to new highs, and being a utility token would make it appreciate higher than other meme coins. Reason #2. Passive staking income In addition to a much better boom potential, LBRETT also offers astonishing staking rewards— with APYs well above 1,400% in the presale phase. This feature enables holders to earn significant passive income simply by staking their tokens. It’s a benefit rarely found among meme coins. Such lucrative returns drive early adoption and support long-term holder commitment, building price stability and upward pressure. Reason #3. A massive boom potential While Dogecoin is already near market saturation and widely held, LayerBrett is just beginning its ascent. Still in presale, LBRETT has raised more than $1.9 million in record time, with the price still sitting at a minuscule $0.005 per token. This means there’s ample room for parabolic growth. Analysts forecast the possibility of 100x returns on exchange listing, far exceeding what late-stage DOGE can offer. Don’t miss out on LayerBrett Much too often, people complain about missing out on blue chip crypto assets when they were still unknown. LayerBrett is presenting that kind of opportunity now. It offers real explosive potential and looks set to hit $1 before Dogecoin does. Investors in search of the next 100x meme coin should take a close look at LayerBrett before the opportunity passes. Layer Brett is in presale now, but it’s moving fast. Get in early, stake while rewards are high, and don’t miss your shot at the next 100x crypto!

The project hinted at the possibility in a post on X. According to the post from the WLFI official account, USD1 is meeting the internet capital markets. The post also included an image showing the golden eagle icon of WLFI coated in the purple hues of Solana. It read: “USD1 meets internet capital markets. Announcement coming soon 🦅☝️.” While the project itself has yet to announce the deployment, a Twitter user known as CharlesWLFI and self-identified as Head of Solana Ecosystem for World Liberty Financial has confirmed it. Charles posted that USD1 will arrive on Solana sooner than anyone expected. He added that the project is just getting started. He posted: “USD1 is coming to Solana — sooner than you think. Thrilled to help bring @worldlibertyfi into the Solana ecosystem. We’re just getting started.” The user only joined X in August 2025, and the USD1 to Solana is their first post, enough to raise suspicions about their authenticity. However, WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff confirmed that Charles is part of the team, adding that the project is coming to Solana. Meanwhile, other reports further confirm that the speculation is likely true. DeFi protocol Raydium has also hinted at it, posting that “Solana is about to get a lot more stable” while BONK.fun stated that the story of the dog and eagle is set to start. Onchain data also supports the speculation, with one user sharing a SolScan screenshot showing that 100 million USD1 tokens have been minted on the network in preparation for the launch. USD1 continues expansion to boost adoption The potential deployment of USD1 on Solana continues WLFI’s efforts to increase adoption of the stablecoin. Since launching in April 2025, USD1 has seen sizable growth with its supply increasing by $2 billion in the first few days. However, its growth had plateaued since then and remained at $2.402 billion, enough to rank it sixth among top altcoins. Solana will be the fourth blockchain network to power the stablecoin, which is already live on BNB Smart Chain, Ethereum, and Tron Network. Interestingly, WLFI had already minted USD1 on Solana some days ago. The DeFi project at the time minted $30 million USD1 on Solana, with Witkoff stating that it is now available on the network. With its deployment on Solana, USD1 will be hoping to see broader and more diverse use across multiple chains. Currently, 88.52% of its $2.40 billion supply is on BSC, while Ethereum has over 10% and TRON has only 1%. However, the project has been pushing to increase usage through partnerships. Several exchanges already support it, including Coinbase , Binance, Bullish, Gate.io, and HTX. DeFi protocols, including JustLend on TRON, Moonpay, and PancakeSwap on BSC, also support the stablecoin. The stablecoin points program launched in early August also appears to be part of the efforts to boost adoption. Several exchanges, including Kucoin, MEXC, Bitget, Gate.io, and others, are all involved in the loyalty program. Stablecoins add $7 billion in one week Meanwhile, the USD1 effort to boost adoption comes amidst broader growth in the stablecoin market. According to DeFiLlama , the stablecoin market cap increased by $7.24 billion in the past seven days to hit a new high of $283.46 billion. This continues the trend of stablecoin expansion fueled by Ethena USDe and MakerDAO DAI. In the past month, the two stablecoins increased by 49.79% and 20.25% respectively, while Circle USDC rose by 12% to cross over $71 billion. USD1 only increased by 10% within that time. The growth of these stablecoins supplies, including smaller-cap ones such as PayPal PYUSD and Ripple RLUSD, which are up more than 20% in the past month, has impacted Tether USDT’s dominance. The leading stablecoin has a 59% dominance with a market cap of $167 billion. Interestingly, experts at CryptoQuant believe that stablecoin growth is already cooling, noting that recent weekly expansions peaked at $1.1 billion, far below the $4 billion to $8 billion in late 2024.

The crypto company announced the initial plan to disable its stablecoin support on these legacy chains in July, citing a shift in its business strategy. Tether justified this earlier decision with the claim of aligning its operations with the current shift in user behavior and increased focus on more scalable, actively developed blockchain networks. Also, the dwindling activity on some of these ecosystems was highlighted as one of the reasons behind freezing USDT operations. At the time, Tether advised customers with their USDT holdings on Omni Layer, Algorand, and the other affected blockchains to redeem their stablecoins before the September 1, 2025, deadline. However, it appears that these users won’t need to do this anymore following the issuer’s latest decision. What Did Tether Change In Its Plan? In a media release on its website, Tether disclosed that investors with USDT holdings on the five legacy blockchains will no longer have to redeem their coins before the September 1 deadline. While these ecosystems will stop supporting the USDT issuance and redemption, the revised plan will now allow users to transfer their USDT stablecoins across other blockchains. The media release read: Following the feedback from the communities of these discontinued blockchains, Tether has revised this approach and will not freeze the smart contracts on these networks. While users will still be able to transfer the tokens between wallets, Tether will discontinue direct issuance and redemption on these blockchains. This means the tokens will no longer be officially supported as other Tether tokens. According to the crypto company, this revised plan correlates with the broader strategy to expand support for crypto ecosystems with strong developer activity, scalability, and user demand. “Tether remains committed to a smooth transition and will continue to engage with the community to ensure transparency and clarity throughout this process,” the stablecoin issuer added. Tron and Ethereum lead the blockchain pack in terms of USDT adoption, with $80.9 billion and $72.4 billion of the Tether stablecoins circulating in their ecosystems. Meanwhile, the BNB Chain boasts the third-largest USDT supply worth around $6.78 billion. USDT Market Cap As of this writing, the total market capitalization of Tether’s USDT stands at roughly $167.4 billion, according to data from CoinGecko.",Tether (USDT)|Algorand|Ethereum|OmniChain|Tether|tron|USDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|USDT|ALGO|BCH|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-30 11:00:29

Interest in Hyperliquid is surging as traders chase momentum. Amid that tidal wave, Remittix stands quietly strong with its $250,000 giveaway and Q3 wallet beta launch, gaining attention in pockets looking beyond hype. Let us unpack the Hyperliquid rise and why Remittix is getting tagged as the altcoin set for real growth amid the noise. Hyperliquid outpaces Robinhood and fuels excitement Hyperliquid recorded $330.8 billion in trading volume for July, alone surpassing Robinhood’s $237.8 billion across all assets, marking its third straight month in the lead. Early August data shows volume already exceeding $349 billion, reinforcing Hyperliquid’s dominance in decentralized trading. Its native token, HYPE, hit a new all-time high near $51, gaining 8% in 24 hours after this trading boom. Traders are hyped, but technical charts show resistance forming, suggesting momentum may wane if not supported by fundamentals. Remittix Readies for Breakout Beyond Analysts’ Target of $1 Remittix appeals to those who prefer substance over hype. Its trajectory may be less flashy than Hyperliquid’s volume figures, but its foundation in fintech use case growth could translate into lasting value, not just hype-based spikes. The token is priced at $0.10, has sold over 630 million tokens and raised over $22,3 million. It secured a BitMart listing once it passed $20 million and followed with a second CEX listing on LBANK confirmed surpassing $22 million. A Q3 2025 wallet beta launch is coming and a $250,000 community giveaway is live to drive awareness. Here is what puts Remittix in a different class than hype-fuelled volume: Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Direct crypto-to-bank transfers in more than 30 countries Utility-first token powering actual transaction volume Built for adoption, not for speculation Time-sensitive entry point before listings and parabolic growth Where Hype Ends and Utility Begins Hyperliquid’s August dominance over Robinhood is a stark reminder that DeFi innovation can outpace traditional players when speed and design align. That campaign drives excitement around HYPE token speculation. Remittix , by contrast, quietly advances toward user-first global finance. Its suite of listings, wallet beta, giveaways and real-world payments infrastructure may yield steadier upside. For savvy watchers, the substance behind Remittix could be the real story under this Hyperliquid hype.

The post outlined a near-term outlook for both assets, noting potential upside ranges in the coming 1 to 3 weeks. Both charts show strong advances earlier in the year, followed by consolidation patterns highlighted within a shaded area. The accompanying annotations display key resistance lines and target ranges. For XRP, the projection extends to a zone between $4 and $5, while HBAR is indicated within $0.40 to $0.50. $XRP & $HBAR target range for the next 1-3 weeks! pic.twitter.com/P966CjtP36 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 29, 2025 XRP Price Structure and Momentum Both charts show comparable performance with a strong upward rally in late 2024 leading into early 2025, an extended consolidation phase , and another notable rally in July. One of the major differences is that XRP hit a new all-time high in July. However, HBAR failed to reclaim its peak. Both assets have also slowed down due to resistance. The highlighted circles on the charts mark another consolidation period, suggesting a balance of buying and selling pressure before the next move. Heikin Ashi candles are used to smooth volatility, emphasizing trend strength more clearly than standard candlesticks. The Relative Strength Indexes (RSIs) for both assets also sit around the same range. XRP is shown at 63.80, and HBAR is at 64.45. Both remain below the overbought threshold of 70, indicating firm bullish momentum. The chart also marks a downward-sloping line across recent RSI peaks, signaling a bearish divergence . While price action has continued, momentum has trended lower, raising caution about the sustainability of a breakout attempt. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Near-Term Targets Despite this divergence, the charts show a clear short-term roadmap. The lower target for XRP is $4, with the upper boundary of the projected channel at $5. This prediction suggests that the asset could hit a new all-time high in 1 to 3 weeks. The analyst has bullish expectations for HBAR, setting a target range of $0.40 to $0.50. However, this would place the asset just below its peak of $0.5701, which it reached in 2021. Achieving these levels would likely require both assets to post consistent closes above their identified resistance lines while maintaining momentum strength. Despite the market downturn over the past 24 hours , Steph is confident that both assets can reach these targets, suggesting this bearish phase will be short-lived.

In August alone, inflows have jumped 44%, now totaling $13.7B . On August 11th, in particular, $ETH recorded its highest-ever single-day inflow: over $1B. Most of this demand is coming from companies and institutions hoarding $ETH as bullish pressure continues to build. Currently, about 3.7% of the total $ETH supply is held by corporations in the form of treasuries. Of this, Bitmine Immersion Tech leads the pack with $7.81B worth of $ETH, followed by SharpLink Gaming with $3.48B. Considering $ETH has already surged more than 80% in the past two months, now trading around $4,378, the real question is: are big-money players simply chasing price, or do they know something we don’t? Is $ETH becoming the next $BTC? Read on as we break down why Ethereum’s growth is accelerating. Plus, we’ll reveal the 3 best cryptos to buy now to ride the upcoming ‘digital silver’ bull run. What Is Driving Ethereum’s Growth? Several key factors are fueling ETH’s growth, one of the most important being the GENIUS Act . It seeks to regulate the issuance and governance of dollar-pegged stablecoins, bringing much-needed clarity and legal context to the broader cryptocurrency markets. Another major driver is the 401(k) amendment , which now allows cryptocurrencies to be included as an investment option in retirement funds. This is a huge positive for $ETH, as it opens the doors for both institutional and retail investors to adopt it as a diversification tool. On the technical side, Ethereum’s upgrade roadmap continues to make the network more accessible and utility-driven. The recent Pectra upgrade bundled 11 EIPs to improve speed and usability. It also raised the validator staking limit from 32 $ETH to 2,048 $ETH, enabling smoother management along with faster rewards and exits. Even better? $ETH has more upgrades on the horizon. Fusaka (expected in November 2025) will focus on faster block times and infrastructure refinements. Glamsterdam (2026) aims at broader performance enhancements. These continuous updates will ensure Ethereum maintains its position at the forefront of DeFi and Web3. If you’re building a crypto portfolio, there couldn’t be a better time. With $ETH looking strong on both fundamental and technical fronts, a sharp rise could trigger a wider crypto bull run. Here are 3 top altcoins you can buy now to make the most of this opportunity. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – The First Layer 2 Solution for Bitcoin With Better Speed and Scalability Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is transforming the Bitcoin blockchain by adding Layer 2 features and compatibility to an otherwise ‘old school’ network. While Bitcoin is often referred to as the ‘digital gold’ of the modern era, it still lags behind the likes of Solana and Ethereum in the Web3 and DeFi space. That’s exactly what $HYPER aims to change. Through its Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, $HYPER brings Solana-like speed and scalability to Bitcoin. Currently, the Bitcoin blockchain can process only 7 transactions per second, since it executes them one by one. With SVM, however, multiple transactions can be processed simultaneously through parallel execution (as long as they aren’t inter-related). This drastically boosts throughput and ensures faster speeds. On top of that, the SVM integration allows developers to run smart contracts and build dApps directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. $HYPER also employs a decentralized canonical bridge, enabling users to swap their Layer 1 Bitcoin tokens for utility-driven Layer 2 Bitcoins on a 1:1 basis. These L2 tokens can then be used to participate in DeFi, from staking and lending to DAOs, NFTs, gaming, and more. This added utility is likely why the $HYPER presale has pulled in over $12.8M from early investors. Currently priced at $0.012825, $HYPER is predicted to surge to $0.32 by the end of 2025 – a potential 2,400% gain. If you want to hop on the $HYPER train, here’s a step-by-step guide on how to buy $HYPER . Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website for more information. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Powering the Best Non-Custodial, Multi-Chain Wallet Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the in-house cryptocurrency of Best Wallet , a non-custodial, multi-chain crypto wallet built with a security-first approach. For starters, the wallet leverages Fireblocks’ MPC security tech for enhanced protection. Plus, since it’s non-custodial, only you control the private keys, eliminating the risk of third-party interference. On top of that, you can further strengthen security by enabling multi-factor authentication, including biometric login. One standout feature of Best Wallet is its Presale Aggregator section, which lets you discover and buy the best crypto presales before they hit mainstream hype. Convenience is another big plus. You don’t even need to leave the app to buy presale tokens. Everything can be done directly within the wallet, ensuring a seamless and secure experience. Better yet, every token listed is pre-vetted by Best Wallet’s internal team to ensure you don’t fall victim to scams. Looking ahead, Best Wallet aims to capture 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market share by 2027, and you can be part of this by buying $BEST . Holding $BEST also unlocks early-bird access to presale cryptos, staking rewards (currently 87%), reduced trading and gas fees, and platform voting rights. Currently, 1 $BEST token is priced at just $0.025555, and the presale has already surpassed $15.2M in funding. Check out $BEST’s official website for more information. 3. Solana ($SOL) – Sixth-Largest Crypto With Rising Institutional Inflows Alongside Ethereum, Solana ($SOL) has become one of the hottest cryptos attracting heavy institutional investment. This month alone, firms like Bit Mining and DeFi Development Corp have scooped up 27K and 110K $SOL, respectively. Meanwhile, Pantera Capital has announced plans to raise $1.25B to launch Solana Co. , a $SOL-focused treasury company modeled after MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy. $SOL has surged more than 114% since early April and is now trading above the $200 mark. Plus, sentiment is equally bullish on the ETF front. Polymarket currently shows a staggering >99% chance of Solana ETF approval , while Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart puts the odds of seeing a live SOL ETF before the end of the year at 95% . From a technical perspective, $SOL appears to be consolidating around $200. A short-term dip toward $180 could act as a springboard, potentially sending the token above $250 in the coming weeks. If you’re looking to add a trusted large-cap crypto with high upside potential to your portfolio, now may be the perfect time to buy $SOL. Wrapping Up With institutional buying and ETF inflows into $ETH on the rise, the token is inching closer to the $5K mark. So if you’re looking to build a crypto portfolio, now could be the perfect time. You can start by picking up some Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , which adds a new layer of scalability, speed, and Web3 compatibility to the Bitcoin blockchain. Then, consider stacking Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , the driving force behind Best Wallet , which is a non-custodial wallet you can use to securely store, swap, buy, and sell cryptos. Last but not least, adding some Solana ($SOL) could help diversify your portfolio and keep it relatively ‘safe,’ thanks to $SOL’s mainstream adoption, strong institutional inflows, and upcoming ETF momentum. That said, crypto investments remain risky and are influenced by both micro- and macroeconomic factors. This article is not financial advice.

50910698,https://invezz.com/?p=2856169,1756552370,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,DOGE news: why holders are backing latest trending altcoins like Remittix in Aug,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/30/doge-news-why-holders-are-backing-latest-trending-altcoins-like-remittix-in-aug/,"Dogecoin may be stabilizing near $0.22, but DOGE News shows many holders are searching for fresh opportunities. With rallies capped and momentum slowing, attention is shifting toward trending altcoins offering real utility. Remittix (RTX) , which has raised $22M, secured BitMart and LBank listings, and is set to launch its wallet beta, is quickly becoming the top choice for investors seeking growth beyond Dogecoin in August. Dogecoin news confirms $5 million inflows as accumulation resumes Dogecoin News shows the meme coin holding steady near $0.223 after weeks of swings inside a descending parallel channel. The DOGE Price today continues to test the balance between bulls and bears, with $0.20 acting as firm support and $0.24 capping rallies. Technical charts highlight consolidation, as moving averages tighten around the $0.22 zone, leaving traders waiting for a decisive move. Momentum is cautiously improving. The RSI has rebounded to 54, suggesting room for more upside without hitting overbought levels. Liquidity flows add weight to the case for accumulation, with net inflows of $5.10 million breaking the streak of persistent outflows that dominated much of the summer. The Dogecoin Price Prediction now hinges on whether buyers can force a breakout above $0.24 to open the door toward $0.26–$0.28. On the downside, a failure to defend $0.20 risks a deeper correction toward $0.18–$0.19, levels that would reset bullish momentum. While DOGE Price Prediction models point to stability, holders are diversifying into trending tokens like Remittix (RTX). With recent developments, RTX is quickly becoming the alternative that many Dogecoin investors are backing for the next leg of the bull run. Remittix momentum grows as Dogecoin holders join in Dogecoin may still grab headlines, but many long-term holders are exploring new opportunities in trending projects like Remittix (RTX) . While DOGE News highlights stabilization around $0.22, investors are realizing the value of tokens that solve real problems. Remittix stands out by offering instant crypto-to-fiat conversions across 40+ cryptos, making it simple to send funds directly to bank accounts worldwide. This is a utility that meme coins simply can’t match. $22M milestone achieved with over 628 million tokens sold at $0.10 each BitMart confirmed as the first CEX listing, providing instant liquidity for RTX Upcoming LBank listing further expands access for global investors Wallet beta launches September 15th, showcasing real-world use before public trading Unlike Dogecoin, which relies heavily on speculation, Remittix is building a PayFi platform designed for real adoption in the $19 trillion payments market. Analysts now predict an 800% surge in value before listings begin, pointing to RTX as one of the few altcoins that blends hype with real impact. With the $250,000 Remittix Giveaway fueling further attention, Dogecoin holders see RTX as the logical next step. For many, it represents not just the latest trend but the smarter long-term play.

Key Takeaways: Elon Musk’s lawyer Alex Spiro will chair a new $200M public company aimed at building a Dogecoin treasury. The venture, backed by the Dogecoin Foundation’s House of Doge, offers DOGE exposure without direct token ownership. It joins a growing list of firms adding Dogecoin to corporate balance sheets amid rising institutional interest. The venture is being pitched to investors as a dedicated Dogecoin holding vehicle backed by the House of Doge , the corporate entity created by the Dogecoin Foundation in early 2025. Headquartered in Miami, House of Doge has emerged as the central force in institutionalizing the memecoin. New Public Vehicle to Offer Dogecoin Exposure Without Direct Ownership The company plans to offer stock-market exposure to Dogecoin without requiring direct token ownership from investors. While still in the pitch phase, investor materials name Spiro, partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Musk’s legal representative in multiple high-profile cases, as the incoming chairman. This development comes amid a wave of firms rebranding as crypto treasury companies, raising capital to acquire digital assets. Dogecoin, originally launched in 2013 as a joke, has gradually found a foothold among a small but growing group of corporate backers. In February, Vancouver-based Neptune Digital Assets disclosed a 1 million DOGE purchase at an average price of $0.37. $200 MILLION DOGECOIN TREASURY TO BE CHAIRED BY ELON MUSK'S PERSONAL LAWYER ALEX SPIRO 6 investors were confirmed by Fortune to have received pitches for an up to $200 million Dogecoin treasury with plans for it to be chaired by Alex Spiro, Elon Musk's lawyer of choice at… pic.twitter.com/DvRhPTwhPq — REDWRITER (@The_REDWRITER) August 29, 2025 The firm also holds Bitcoin and has expanded its treasury through derivatives. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-listed Bit Origin revealed plans in July to raise $500 million in financing to build its DOGE-focused balance sheet, becoming the first US-listed company to do so. Tesla, the electric vehicle company chaired by Musk, has also acknowledged Dogecoin holdings and accepts the token for select merchandise purchases. While Tesla hasn’t disclosed the size of its DOGE reserves, its public endorsement has long been considered a key catalyst for the token’s popularity. Musk’s relationship with Dogecoin has been both promotional and controversial. A 2019 tweet calling Dogecoin his “fav cryptocurrency” helped propel the coin into mainstream visibility. In 2021, his Saturday Night Live appearance, where he called Dogecoin a “hustle,” triggered a steep price drop after a hype-fueled rally. Spiro defended Musk in a 2022 lawsuit alleging Dogecoin market manipulation. That lawsuit was dismissed in 2024. Eliza Labs Sues Elon Musk’s X Corp, Alleging Monopoly Abuse As reported, Eliza Labs has filed a lawsuit against X Corp , accusing the Elon Musk-owned company of abusing its dominant position to suppress competition and replicate its technology. The complaint claims that X used its platform power to extract sensitive technical data from Eliza Labs before suspending the firm’s account without warning. Last week, Ex Populus, the company behind the Ethereum-based gaming platform XAI, also filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI. The legal dispute centers on alleged marketplace confusion between Ex Populus’s federally registered “XAI” trademark and Musk’s similarly named venture, launched shortly after. Ex Populus claims Musk’s xAI crossed into its territory when he announced plans to launch an AI game studio in late 2024, amplifying confusion among consumers.

According to reports, the company has held talks with Google and OpenAI to integrate their AI models into Meta’s growing suite of AI products. Executives inside Meta Superintelligence Labs, the company’s new AI division, have discussed incorporating Google’s Gemini model. The aim would be to improve what are already highly accurate and natural text-based responses in Meta AI, the company’s leading chatbot, when users ask questions. The discussions also included the potential use of OpenAI’s models, the technology that could enhance AI features across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Any partnership would not mean a permanent shift away from Meta’s work. According to people knowledgeable about discussions, these deals are expected to be a stopgap for Meta’s in-house technology to develop. The company’s priority is developing Llama 5’s new large language model . Meta intends for this model to challenge OpenAI’s GPT series and Google’s Gemini head-on. This pragmatic stance conveys the sense of emergency in the AI arms race. Rivals have already introduced sophisticated products, and Meta does not want to lag as it develops its systems. In the short term, borrowing strength from Google or OpenAI makes its AI systems competitive and engaging for users. Meta couples external AI with in-house work As it aims to push toward self-reliance, Meta is already experimenting with AI outside the company. A coding assistant using Anthropic’s models is available to employees who can quickly compose and test software. That shows that Meta is willing to blend outside technology with its in-house tools when doing so, offering a differentiated benefit. A Meta spokesperson emphasized this adaptable strategy, saying the company was taking an “all-of-the-above approach.” That involves creating best-in-class models itself, working with other leading players, and open-sourcing technology. Meta has been among the more aggressive companies in outsourcing its models, releasing earlier versions of Llama to researchers and developers. The push is being fueled by massive investment. Earlier this year, Meta pledged billions of dollars to grow Meta Superintelligence Labs. Mark Zuckerberg enlisted Alexandr Wang, once the chief executive of Scale AI, and Nat Friedman, a former chief executive at GitHub, to co-lead the project. The lab has also recruited a dozen researchers, many of whom were offered very high salaries, keeping with Zuckerberg’s ambition to turn Meta into a leader in AI. The desired angle is clear. Meta wants to be out in front of the AI revolution, not a fast follower. A temporary alliance with OpenAI or Google could bridge some of these holes in the near term, but the company is betting its homegrown technology will eventually rival the competition. Competition shapes Meta’s choices Meta’s approach is similar to, but also different from, how other tech giants deal with the AI arms race. Microsoft was an early bettor on OpenAI, pouring billions into the company and integrating GPT models deeply into its products. Apple has chosen a more balanced route, collaborating this year with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT with the iPhone and develop its own Apple Intelligence system. Meta’s approach falls somewhere in between. Like Apple, it wants flexibility and will mix partnerships with its models if it gets that. Like Microsoft, it is willing to spend big to attract talent and speed up research. What makes Meta different is that it’s willing to let the world borrow parts of what it built, a strategy that wins friends and influences developers, and applies pressure on closed rivals. For users, that could mean more powerful AI characteristics for its social-media apps, which serve billions. For the industry, Meta’s negotiations with Google and OpenAI shows the fact that even bitter rivals may have to work together sometimes. Cooperation, however fleeting, could be crucial for staying competitive in the AI race. But in the long term, Meta’s fate lies with Llama 5 and beyond. If its models can rival or exceed Gemini and GPT, Meta may not need outside help anymore. Until then, deals with rivals could be the bridge that keeps it in the fight.

Ethereum holders, however, are beginning to shift some capital into Remittix , a utility-first altcoin promising up to 50x upside rooted in cross-border PayFi innovation. While BNB may continue delivering steady, infrastructure-led gains, Remittix offers the chance for breakthrough growth, earning attention from ETH investors seeking bold performance. BNB Price Prediction Points Toward Strength Around $900–$1,000 BNB outlooks lean upbeat. Several recent calls see price pushing into the $920 to $1,000 zone by September, helped by a steady footing above the $750 to $800 support band. Charts also point to a near-term break toward $850. For the rest of 2025, many models cluster between $900 and $1,000, reflecting faith in Binance’s ecosystem and ongoing crypto demand. Ethereum Investors Are Scouting Remittix for Next 50× Movement While BNB remains a solid option for steady capital stays, Ethereum investors are exploring alternatives with exponential potential, with Remittix rising to the top. That mirrors Ethereum’s own past breakout, yet Remittix brings infrastructure into the mix. As ETH price targets push toward $6,500, aided by ETF flows and momentum, Remittix attracts capital from holders chasing asymmetric returns. Remittix Stakes Its Case as the PayFi Upgrade Ethereum Investors Seek Remittix has the utility alternative Ethereum investors want when BNB’s consistent growth doesn’t scratch the high-return itch. Analysts estimate Remittix could offer up to 50× growth, positioning it as a standout among ETH ecosystem extensions. The low-cap gem is supported by an Ethereum-backed ecosystem that appeals to ETH holders looking to deploy capital into scalable payment systems, not just smart contract tokens. Ethereum investors recognize that Remittix’s growth path resembles a leveraged version of Ethereum’s, but with immediate utility baked in. It has sold over 630 million tokens, trades at $0.10, and has raised over $22.1 million. Its BitMart listing was unlocked after $20 million+ raised and its second CEX partner LBANK is confirmed following the $22 million+ milestone, key goals strengthening investor confidence. Remittix stands out through: Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Direct crypto-to-bank transfers in more than 30 countries Utility-first token powering actual transaction volume Built for adoption, not for speculation Time-sensitive entry point before listings and parabolic growth When BNB delivers predictability and ETH rides up slowly, Remittix presents a course toward tangible reward backed by functionality. It offers a Dutch book opportunity: utility today, upside tomorrow. BNB’s Steady Cup vs. Remittix’s Rocket BNB price prediction keeps it in bullish territory, targeting $900–$1,000 into 2025 with infrastructure security. Ethereum investors are drawn to Remittix, however, believing it may outperform via product delivery and explosive growth. For those looking to pair value with velocity, Remittix is analysts’ most compelling crypto to buy now, outpacing even BNB’s chart support.

While Stellar (XLM) and Algorand (ALGO) have their place in the market, Remittix offers something they lack: real-world utility. Specifically, Remittix is making waves with its cross-border payment solutions, providing crypto-to-fiat conversion and direct bank deposits in over 30 countries. HBAR price: Struggling with pressure and slow growth HBAR, known for its enterprise blockchain applications, is currently struggling with a falling price and technical resistance. While its focus is on long-term use cases in enterprise blockchain and decentralized apps, HBAR is currently in a bearish trend, with its price hovering around $0.236. Source: TradingView Unlike Remittix , which continues to experience growth and adoption, HBAR’s market performance has been subdued, making it less attractive for short-term traders seeking quicker returns. Stellar (XLM) and Algorand: A solid but slower solution Although Stellar has established a solid reputation as an affordable option for international transactions, its applications are still more constrained than those of Remittix. Although cross-border payments are still Stellar’s primary emphasis, merchants looking for practical solutions may find it less enticing without Remittix’s instant accessibility. Source: TradingView For individuals participating in the DeFi ecosystem, Algorand is a desirable investment due to its scalability and emphasis on decentralized finance. However, Remittix’s capacity to instantly convert cryptocurrency to fiat and address the $19 trillion payments problem surpasses its usefulness in the real-world payments market. Remittix: The clear winner in real-world utility Unlike Stellar and Algorand, Remittix brings tangible value to the table, solving real-world problems. It is putting itself in a position to transform the $19 trillion remittance sector with a distinct emphasis on cross-border payments. As the platform grows, Remittix continues to attract significant interest from investors and market players, raising over $22.2 million and witnessing noteworthy token sales. Its status as a strong contender in the crypto market is backed strongly by significant developments like the upcoming wallet beta release and exchange listings on BitMart and confirmed listing LBank. Remittix features pulling in massive liquidity Cross-border payment solution that offers instant crypto-to-fiat conversion and direct bank deposits worldwide. Raised over $22.2 million with solid reinforcement from retail and institutional investors. CertiK-audited smart contracts ensuring transparency and security for investors. The goal of deflationary tokenomics is to promote sustained growth. Community rewards that increase user loyalty and involvement include freebies and staking chances With these developments, Remittix has established a reputation as a useful, workable solution that appeals to both individual and corporate customers, including NGOs, freelancers, and remitters. Compared to speculative currencies like Stellar and Algorand, which are still developing their usefulness, this makes it far more alluring. Remittix leads the pack for experienced traders Experienced traders are progressively selecting Remittix (RTX) over Stellar (XLM), Algorand (ALGO), and HBAR due to its obvious adoption path and useful cross-border payment solution. Remittix has already shown noticeable results and is continually gaining traction with its growing user base and upcoming milestones.

The majority of investors are comparing meme-tied coins like the Shiba Inu Coin to upcoming projects like Remittix (RTX) , already generating attention via its presale program and adoption plan. Shiba Inu price prediction trends Shiba Inu Price has fallen to $0.00001228 in recent times, falling 2.63% in the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization stands at $7.23 billion, with trading volume down 11.62% to $183.65 million. The drop has added fresh controversy to Shiba Inu News, with most asking whether SHIB Price momentum can be sustained in the long term. Similar to other meme coins, Shiba Inu Coin greatly depends on speculation and hype from its user base. Although it has delivered incredible returns in the past, it is still extremely volatile compared to crypto with real-world utility. For this reason, experts traditionally compare the latest Shiba Inu Price Prediction to adoption-based projects. Why investors are watching Remittix In contrast to speculative tokens, Remittix is being promoted as a cross-chain DeFi project focused on global payments. The Remittix token is priced at $0.1000 and more than 628 million tokens have been sold and well over $22.2 million raised in its presale. It has already secured listings in BitMart and LBANK, providing early liquidity and availability to global investors. What differentiates Remittix as one of the best crypto presale 2025 offers is its roadmap. The project has recently revealed its upcoming beta wallet, which will launch in Q3 2025. The wallet will support over 40 cryptos, allow direct transfers to 30+ nations, and have real-time FX conversion at low gas fees. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction: Allows for crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ nations Beta wallet launch date fixed for Q3 2025 Over $22.2Million collected in presale First CEX listings secured on BitMart & LBANK (reveled) The larger picture for crypto adoption Although recent Shiba Inu Price Prediction news requires, many traders are diversifying into up-and-coming altcoins to track like Remittix. Its utility-focused framework positions it as more than just a speculative bet — instead, it’s being built as a crypto addressing actual world problems in payments. RTX has also launched a $250,000 Remittix Giveaway as an additional incentive for community engagement and early interest. With interest heating up, RTX is emerging as a strong contender for the next big altcoin of 2025 that combines DeFi technology with practical applications. The crypto universe will always have meme coins such as Shiba Inu Coin, but real innovation comes from potential future crypto ventures with a possibility of adoption. Whether SHIB recovers is up to market sentiment, but Remittix has a different narrative to share — bridging crypto and mainstream finance via a low gas fee crypto business with mass-market application. For investors interested in pre-emptive crypto investment, keeping an eye on both Shiba Inu Price Prediction and adoption-based coins like Remittix could be the way to stay above water in 2025’s shifting market.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with recent news that could signal a significant shift in market dynamics. Reports indicate a monumental Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition , with new wallets scooping up a staggering 1,506 BTC, valued at $163.5 million, from Galaxy Digital. This substantial move suggests a growing confidence among major players in the digital asset space. What Does This Massive Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition Signify? In a recent report by Lookonchain, four new wallets, widely presumed to belong to institutions, have made a considerable splash. They acquired 1,506 BTC, worth approximately $163.5 million, directly from Galaxy Digital within a short two-hour window. This is not merely a transfer; it represents fresh capital entering the market. The term ‘new wallets’ is crucial here. It implies that these are not existing institutional holders rebalancing their portfolios, but rather new entities or expanded positions taking a significant stake in Bitcoin. Such an Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition often reflects a strategic long-term view. Why Are Major Players Embracing Bitcoin Now? The drivers behind such large-scale institutional investments are multifaceted. Bitcoin has increasingly been recognized as a legitimate asset class, offering unique advantages in today’s economic climate. Institutions are looking for hedges against inflation and diversification for their portfolios. Key Drivers for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: Inflation Hedge: Many institutions view Bitcoin as a potential safeguard against the erosion of purchasing power in traditional fiat currencies. Digital Gold Narrative: Its finite supply and decentralized nature align with the ‘digital gold’ thesis, making it an attractive store of value. Portfolio Diversification: Bitcoin often exhibits a low correlation with traditional assets, providing diversification benefits. Long-Term Growth Potential: Belief in Bitcoin’s continued appreciation as global adoption grows. Furthermore, the maturing infrastructure around cryptocurrencies, including robust custody solutions and regulatory clarity in some regions, makes it easier for institutions to participate. This latest Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition underscores a broader trend. The Ripple Effect: Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition and Market Dynamics When institutions make such substantial moves, it often sends a powerful signal to the broader market. A significant Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition can boost investor confidence, potentially leading to increased demand and price stability. It suggests that sophisticated investors are increasingly comfortable with Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. However, it is also important to consider the potential for increased volatility. While institutional involvement can bring stability, large buys and sells can also create price swings. The market will be watching closely to see how these newly acquired assets are managed. This event could be a precursor to more widespread institutional adoption, further integrating digital assets into traditional financial systems. It highlights Bitcoin’s growing role as a credible investment. How Can You Track Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition? For individual investors and market enthusiasts, tracking institutional movements can provide valuable insights. On-chain analytics platforms, like Lookonchain, are essential tools for monitoring large transactions and identifying potential institutional activity. These platforms offer transparency into the blockchain, allowing for informed decision-time decisions. Actionable Insights for Tracking: Monitor Whale Alerts: Keep an eye on services that track large cryptocurrency transactions, often referred to as ‘whale’ movements. Follow Reputable Crypto News: Stay informed through trusted news sources that report on institutional investment trends and market analysis. Understand Market Indicators: Learn to interpret volume, open interest, and funding rates, which can sometimes signal institutional interest. Understanding these trends can help you make more informed decisions about your own crypto portfolio. This latest Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition is a prime example of the kind of data that can move markets. Conclusion: A New Era of Confidence? The recent $163.5 million Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition by suspected institutional wallets from Galaxy Digital is a compelling development. It underscores a growing conviction among major financial entities regarding Bitcoin’s value proposition and future potential. This influx of capital from new players could indeed be a glimmer of hope, signaling a more mature and robust market ahead. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, institutional participation will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping its trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition? An Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition refers to large-scale purchases of Bitcoin by financial institutions, corporations, or investment funds, as opposed to individual retail investors. These acquisitions typically involve significant capital and are often part of a broader investment strategy. Who is Galaxy Digital? Galaxy Digital is a diversified financial services and investment management company specializing in the digital asset, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology sectors. They provide services such as asset management, trading, and investment banking to institutional clients. How do we know these are ‘institutional’ wallets? While direct attribution can be challenging, analysts like Lookonchain often infer institutional involvement based on the size of the transactions, the nature of the wallets (e.g., newly created, high-volume activity), and the entities involved in the transfers (like Galaxy Digital, which caters to institutional clients). What impact does this have on Bitcoin’s price? Large institutional acquisitions can have a positive impact on Bitcoin’s price by increasing demand and reducing the available supply on exchanges. This can lead to upward price pressure and foster greater market confidence, although short-term volatility can still occur. Is Bitcoin a good investment for institutions? Many institutions are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a viable investment due to its potential as an inflation hedge, its role as ‘digital gold,’ and its diversification benefits. However, investment decisions depend on an institution’s specific risk tolerance, investment horizon, and regulatory environment. Did you find this analysis insightful?

The coin has lost up to 2.56 percent of its value. Technical indicators give neutral signals, but the price charts project a bearish market scenario for the day. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as selling momentum took hold, bringing the price down to $2.81 during the day. The RSI decreased to 41.75 at the same time and is in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $4.76 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to increase significantly. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the end of this year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching $20 by 2030. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $24.74 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported on Teucrium’s XXRP, the leveraged XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) launched in April, which has reached $300 million in net flow. With the ETF reaching $323.6 million in inflows, it becomes the first XRP ETF in the US to reach the milestone. The Teucrium Trading CEO says the leveraged ETF product is its most successful ETF ever.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP is trending above $3, as the market sentiment still tilts toward the positive side.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-30 11:30:00

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now standing at $0.035 in presale stage 6. Investors in the project are estimated to earn a minimum return on investment of 400% once MUTM goes live. Mutuum Finance has already passed over $15.15 million and more than 15800 token buyers. Recent market activity suggests a noticeable uptick in institutional and retail interest around Mutuum Finance, placing it alongside established coins such as XRP. XRP Price Analysis & 2025 Outlook XRP is currently trading at approximately $2.98, holding steady with slight movement around the $3.00 mark. Analysts note that if XRP breaks above the key resistance zone near $3.40, combined with favorable regulatory developments and growing institutional interest, a rise toward $4.50–$5.50 by year-end remains plausible. However, maintaining this momentum will depend on market sentiment and capital flows, particularly as investors also explore emerging DeFi narratives like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Stage 6 Success Mutuum Finance (MUTM) 2025 presale has been a record-breaking success. The token is now at Stage 6 at a price of $0.035 and reflects higher investor anticipation as well as stronger market anticipation.

The giveaway is evidence that the project is serious about a long-term and a dedicated community. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched an Official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. The project team invites the participants with a promise of providing up to $50,000 USDT as a bounty for finding bugs in the project. The objective of the bounty program is to identify the probable weaknesses of the project. Four types of weaknesses are analyzed in the program to rank them on the basis of their severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. Dual Lending Model Mutuum Finance is based on a two-lending model whereby customers are given unprecedented convenience by Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model, lending pools have access to smart contracts, which can be programmed to determine whether or not they will dynamically shift interest rates as a function of how the market conditions trend. Fixed incomes are provided by lenders while borrowers are insured upon accessing loans. P2P model does not involve middlemen to create a direct relationship between lending and borrowing parties. Any asset with price-risky demands such purely decentralized model under full control of users. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $15.15 million with 15,800 investors on board at Stage 6 priced at $0.035. Its dual lending model, CertiK-audited security, and $100,000 giveaway highlight strong growth momentum as it heads toward launch.

If that happens, it will mark the first time DOGE reaches this level since a multi-year high of around $0.48 in 2024. It will also mark a 2025 high for the meme coin, with its current high at around $0.28. Unichartz revealed that a descending resistance line and a key horizontal supply zone at around $0.28 are acting as a strong barrier for the meme coin. He remarked that DOGE will need to flip this confluence zone cleanly for it to see a breakout and push higher. In the meantime, the meme coin continues to decline alongside the broader crypto market. Dogecoin has dropped from a recent high of around $0.24 and is down over 8% in the last seven days. This has occurred thanks to the massive drop in the Bitcoin price, with the flagship crypto on a downtrend since it reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $124,000 two weeks ago. The Goal Is For DOGE’s Stoch RSI To Cross The 20 Level In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital said that the goal is for Dogecoin’s Stochastic Relative Strength Index (Stoch RSI) to cross the 20 level and show a follow-through. He explained that anything below that level is a sign of weak momentum. This technical indicator is currently crossing to the upside and is at the 13 level. Related Reading: Alphractal Says Resilient Dogecoin Metrics Could Lead To Price Breakout This is significant, as Kevin noted that monthly Stoch RSI crosses on Dogecoin, outside of the bear market, and, along with an uptrending monthly RSI, ultimately lead to massive rallies. He further remarked that DOGE’s biggest move of the cycle is likely if Bitcoin can move higher and Ethereum ultimately enters into price discovery with a dropping BTC dominance. The analyst added that DOGE just needs a little more time for BTC and the macro to support this move. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.21, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The executives, Daniel Schatt (former CEO) and Joseph Podulka (former CFO), are being punished for their roles in a wire fraud conspiracy that led to about $1 billion customer losses according to current coin valuations. How long will Cred’s CEO and CFO be gone for? According to the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Northern District of California, Daniel Schatt, the company’s co-founder and CEO, got off with the heavier sentence of 52 months while Joseph Podulka, the company’s CFO, received a 36-month sentence. Along with the prison time, Schatt and Podulka also received three years of supervised release and a fine of $25,000. The 55-year-old Schatt and Podulka, 53, both pleaded guilty in May to wire fraud conspiracy and were indicted along with former chief capital officer James Alexander last year. U.S. Attorney Craig Missakian in a statement from Friday said the criminal conspiracy dealt significant damage to Cred’s customers. Cred’s business offered loans to customers primarily by using crypto as collateral and accepting deposits of cryptocurrency in exchange for interest. That was the part the customers knew. The part many of them did not know was that the business also depended on a relationship with a Chinese firm founded by one of Cred’s co-founders to generate the interest yield. “Under this arrangement, Cred would loan the Chinese company a percentage of Cred’s customers’ funds, and the Chinese company would make short-term, high-interest microloans to Chinese gamers to generate interest to pay back to Cred,” the U.S. Attorney’s office said. The business was also dependent on a hedging strategy and used a third-party company to protect Cred from overexposure to fluctuations in the crypto market. The plea agreement traces the conspiracy back to March 2020, just as the COVID-19 pandemic began, and the price of Bitcoin subsequently tanked. Cred heard from its hedging partner that it was underwater and would need to liquidate all of its trading positions, prosecutors said. The Chinese company also informed Cred that it would be unable to pay back tens of millions of dollars, which the executives hid from customers and investors. According to prosecutors, Schatt reassured everyone during a public “Ask Management Anything” session on March 18, 2020 that Cred was “operating normally.” “Daniel Schatt and Joseph Podulka orchestrated a scheme in which they deceived both investors and customers out of their hard-earned funds in an attempt to extend a failing business,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Matt Cobo. Following the company’s bankruptcy filing, customers and investors filed over 6,000 claims totaling more than $140 million, now worth more than $1 billion, based on August 2025 valuations. A restitution hearing has been scheduled for October 7, and the pair is expected to start serving their sentences on October 28. Regulators will still go after fraud and mismanagement Schatt and Podulka are not the only crypto founders who have faced legal consequences this year. The SEC is no longer on the offensive and has even dismissed several high-profile cases involving some giants in the industry. But the U.S. Attorney Craig Missakian has promised that “fraud targeting cryptocurrency investors and customers will not be tolerated and wrongdoers will be held accountable for their actions.” Aside from Schatt and Podulka, other notable crypto executives facing legal prosecution include Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius , who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for fraud on May 8. There is also Wolf Capital’s co-founder and head trader Travis Ford, who pleaded guilty on January 10 to wire fraud conspiracy charges. Do Kwon of Terraform Labs has also pleaded guilty to fraud charges, and the embattled Sam Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence.

With more activity on-chain and a likely market bottom forming, the Shiba Inu coin is exhibiting new signs of strength. Layer Brett , a new competitor, is also shaking things up in the crypto space with real utility and a lot of presale momentum. Is this the beginning of another meme coin rally? Let’s look at what the analysts are saying. Shiba Inu coin shows signs of a market bottom There is a lot more activity on the Shiba Inu coin blockchain, with the amount of transfers going up by 300% in just one day. On August 25, volume climbed from 1.13T to 4.25T tokens, based on a recent report. This shows that big holders are still moving coins even when retail transactions are slowing down. This shows that people are buying, not selling in a panic. Price action is still caught in a downward channel, but the Shiba Inu coin is still near $0.0000120, which is a major support level. If bulls can break out from the $0.0000126 resistance, Shiba Inu coin might move toward the $0.0000140–$0.0000145 range. Even if the technical signals are bearish, the Shiba Inu coin might be making a base for a reversal. Analysts claim that the market turned down an earlier triangular breakout, but it has subsequently settled down in the descending channel. The SHIB Army, increased burn rates, and the acceptance of Shibarium all point to long-term strength. CoinCodex says that the price of the Shiba Inu coin could go up to $0.00001325 by September. Shiba Inu coin is holding up well while holders wait for the next breakout, with 14 of the previous 30 days ending in green and only 3.72% volatility. Layer Brett: Fast, low-cost, and built for growth Layer Brett is transforming meme coins by bringing practical use to Ethereum Layer 2. It has very instant transactions, gas prices that are only a few cents, and full decentralization that Ethereum protects. Users may easily acquire $LBRETT with ETH, USDT, or BNB and then stake it right away through the dApp to get high-yield incentives. The ecosystem stays active and rewarding via gamified staking, NFT integrations, and community rewards. Layer Brett is one of the best cryptos to invest in because it combines meme culture with genuine blockchain scalability. The $LBRETT presale is going on now, and it’s only $0.005 per token. Over $1.9 million has already been raised. Early holders get better staking rates, clear tokenomics, and the strength of a community-first approach. Layer Brett is designed for performance, scaling, and rewards, unlike Base’s Brett, which doesn’t really do anything. With intentions to match large Layer 2s like Arbitrum and Optimism, Layer Brett is geared for long-term supremacy. $LBRETT is a good choice for investors who want to buy crypto right now because it has a low entry price and a lot of room to develop before launch. Don’t miss the next big meme coin wave Layer Brett is the true disruptor, yet Shiba Inu coin is showing strength. Layer Brett combines the power of memes with genuine Ethereum Layer 2 utility to give users fast transactions, minimal fees, and high staking rewards. The presale is still active, and more than $1.9 million has already been raised. This is the kind of early entry that may turn tiny wagers into huge wins. Don’t wait for the rally to start; sign up for the presale today to lock in your spot before prices go up.

The move has reignited debate around the long-discussed “Flippening,” where Ethereum’s market value could one day overtake Bitcoin’s. Whale Activity Shakes the Market Blockchain analytics firms, including Arkham Intelligence, flagged several transfers last week showing the whale moving over $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin into Ethereum. Just days earlier, the same entity had acquired $2.5 billion in ETH, bringing its total conversion to more than $4.5 billion within weeks. HUGE: A $5B #Bitcoin whale is rotating into Ethereum. Just shifted $1.1B $BTC to a new wallet Already bought $2.5B $ETH last week Now stacking even more $ETH through Hyperunit/HL pic.twitter.com/0i5T3LR6Ia — The Crypto Times (@CryptoTimes_io) August 29, 2025 These were no small bets. The whale traded through Hyperliquid, adding spot and futures and locking in $33 million profit from an earlier long on Ethereum. With over 220,000 ETH in the treasury, this whale is now one of the top 5 ETH holders globally – possibly even bigger than the Ethereum Foundation. Bitcoin dropped $4,000 last week under selling pressure. Ethereum up 14% in the last month, 2x Bitcoin’s performance. The whale is showing more confidence in Ethereum in the 2025 cycle. Staking Dynamics and Institutional Flows This whale rotation coincides with the Ethereum validator exit queue hitting an all time high. Roughly $5 billion worth of ETH is awaiting withdrawal, creating concerns about potential sell pressure. The wait time for unstaking has now exceeded 19 days. Yet analysts argue that institutional demand offsets much of this risk. In August alone, U.S. Ether ETFs drew $4 billion in inflows, underscoring the appetite for ETH exposure. Bitmine, one of the largest corporate treasuries, also added 190,500 ETH, lifting its holdings to 1.7 million ETH worth nearly $7.7 billion. On-chain data shows institutions are buying more than 35 ETH for every 1 ETH issued, making Ethereum increasingly scarce, even with validator exits. Ethereum Technical Outlook Ethereum price prediction appears bullish, with a target of over $4,265, as it currently trades at $4,391, consolidating after testing highs near $4,865. Price action is holding above a rising trendline from early August, signaling the broader uptrend remains intact. The 50-SMA at $4,567 is the immediate resistance. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview On the technical front , a daily close above it could trigger a retest of $4,665, with a breakout opening the path toward $4,865 and the $5,100 psychological level. Momentum indicators support this setup. RSI 43, ETH has room to bounce. MACD is bearish, with momentum fading below $4,265, risking $4,070 and $3,865. ETH holds trendline at $4,265 as whales & ETFs pour billions into the network. Eyes on $4,567 SMA—a breakout opens path to $5,100+, reviving the Flippening debate. pic.twitter.com/LUrWrc803g — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) August 30, 2025 For traders, the levels are clear: a bullish engulfing candle above $4,567 presents a long opportunity to $5,100, while a candle below $4,265 indicates a sell. Will the Flippening Return? Ethereum is still behind Bitcoin in overall market cap, but institutional flows and whale accumulation is changing the dynamics. Bitcoin is digital gold, but Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi, tokenization and stablecoins is growing. The whale’s $5B shift doesn’t guarantee the Flippening, but it reflects rising belief—even among Bitcoin loyalists—that Ethereum may deliver stronger returns in the years ahead. With network upgrades, growing ETF demand, and institutional adoption, Ethereum’s path toward challenging Bitcoin’s crown looks more credible than ever. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines Bitcoin Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation.

A recent and truly shocking development from India highlights this stark reality: a major Bitcoin kidnapping case that has sent ripples through the nation’s legal and crypto communities. This isn’t just a tale of crime; it’s a cautionary saga involving high-ranking officials and an astonishing sum of digital currency. The Audacious Bitcoin Kidnapping Unveiled In a landmark judgment, an Indian court has handed down life sentences to 14 individuals. Among those convicted are a former ruling party lawmaker and a senior police official. Their crime? Involvement in a sophisticated Bitcoin kidnapping scheme that targeted a businessman in 2018. This case underscores the evolving nature of crime in the digital age. The victim, businessman Shailesh Bhatt, was abducted in Surat, a prominent city in the Indian state of Gujarat. The perpetrators, a well-organized group, didn’t demand traditional ransom. Instead, they extorted a staggering 750 Bitcoins from him. At the time of the incident, this amount represented a significant fortune, highlighting the high stakes involved in this audacious plot. Unraveling the Conspiracy: How the Bitcoin Kidnapping Plot Unfolded The investigation into this complex crime revealed a shocking level of involvement from powerful figures. The defendants included the police chief of the Amreli district, a position of significant authority, and a former Member of Parliament from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), India’s ruling political party. Their participation added a layer of scandal and disbelief to the already sensational Bitcoin kidnapping . This wasn’t a simple snatch-and-grab. The court’s proceedings meticulously detailed how the group conspired to kidnap Bhatt and then leverage their positions to force the transfer of his digital assets. The use of Bitcoin as the ransom currency made the case particularly challenging for law enforcement, given the nascent understanding of cryptocurrencies at the time. Justice Served: Life Sentences for Bitcoin Kidnapping Masterminds The recent sentencing to life imprisonment for all 14 convicted individuals marks a significant victory for justice. This verdict sends a strong message that those who exploit emerging technologies for criminal purposes, regardless of their societal standing, will be held accountable. The judgment in this Bitcoin kidnapping case serves as a precedent for future crypto-related crimes in India. Moreover, the conviction of high-profile individuals like a former lawmaker and a police chief reinforces the principle of equality before the law. It demonstrates the judiciary’s commitment to tackling corruption and organized crime, even when it involves complex digital assets like Bitcoin. This outcome is crucial for maintaining public trust in both the legal system and the integrity of public service. Implications for India’s Crypto Landscape After the Bitcoin Kidnapping This landmark case undoubtedly has broader implications for India’s rapidly growing cryptocurrency ecosystem. Firstly, it highlights the urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks and enhanced cybersecurity measures to protect individuals and businesses involved in crypto. Secondly, it serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with holding large amounts of digital assets without adequate security protocols. For law enforcement agencies, the Bitcoin kidnapping case provides invaluable lessons in investigating and prosecuting cybercrimes involving cryptocurrencies. It necessitates specialized training and inter-agency cooperation to effectively trace digital transactions and bring perpetrators to justice. As India continues to navigate its stance on crypto, this case will likely influence future policy decisions aimed at preventing similar incidents and ensuring investor safety. What Does This Mean for Crypto Users? Enhanced Security: Always prioritize strong, unique passwords and two-factor authentication for all crypto accounts. Hardware Wallets: Consider using hardware wallets for storing significant amounts of cryptocurrency to reduce online exposure. Due Diligence: Be wary of unsolicited communications or schemes that promise unrealistic returns. Report Suspicious Activity: If you suspect any criminal activity involving crypto, report it to the authorities immediately. The resolution of this sensational Bitcoin kidnapping case is a testament to the persistent efforts of law enforcement and the judiciary. It serves as a powerful reminder that while the digital frontier offers immense potential, it also presents new challenges that demand vigilance and robust legal responses. As the crypto world evolves, so too must our methods of ensuring safety and justice for all.

The Federal Reserve’s preferred measure, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, showed that price pressures are climbing higher, raising concerns among investors navigating the effects of President Donald Trump’s trade policies. According to data from SoSoValue, Ether ETFs experienced a sharp net outflow of $164.64 million, breaking a five-day streak of inflows that had brought in over $1.5 billion. Bitcoin ETFs also turned negative, recording $126.64 million in withdrawals — their first daily loss since August 22. Following the selloff, total assets under management stood at $28.58 billion for Ethereum and $139.95 billion for Bitcoin. Outflows Reverse Momentum The redemptions were led by major players. Fidelity’s FBTC posted the steepest single-day outflow among Bitcoin ETFs with $66.2 million withdrawn. ARK Invest and 21Shares’ ARKB followed with $72.07 million in net exits, while Grayscale’s GBTC shed $15.3 million. Only a handful of funds managed modest gains, including BlackRock’s IBIT, which attracted $24.63 million, and WisdomTree’s BTCW, which saw $2.3 million in inflows. The moves came as the July PCE index showed a 2.9% annualized rise, the fastest pace since February. While the reading matched forecasts, it underscored the impact of Trump’s tariff strategy , which includes a 10% baseline tax on all imports alongside targeted reciprocal duties. Analysts noted that while lower energy prices helped contain headline inflation, service costs rose 3.6% year-over-year, fueling worries about stickier underlying price growth. Ether ETFs Maintain Longer-Term Momentum Despite Friday’s setback, Ether ETFs remain in strong demand . Since their debut in July 2024, they have attracted steady inflows, with August alone seeing a 44% increase, lifting assets from $9.5 billion to $13.7 billion. Analysts attribute the growth to renewed institutional appetite for Ethereum after a period of underperformance relative to Bitcoin. Corporate treasuries are also emerging as a significant source of demand. StrategicETHReserve reported that businesses now collectively hold 4.4 million ETH, valued at more than $19 billion — around 3.7% of the total supply. This trend reflects Ethereum’s growing role as a strategic asset for companies looking to diversify beyond Bitcoin. Even with the latest market turbulence, expectations of a potential Fed rate cut at the next meeting remain, particularly if labor market data shows further signs of weakness. For now, ETF flows suggest that investors are taking a cautious stance amid heightened inflation concerns.

They are quick to deliver returns when they rocket and are equally quick to drop once they run out of hype. Recently, the Pepe coin was in the crypto news for its short-term gains. However, it lacked true substance to maintain its value, hence the emergence of Layer Brett. Still in its ground phase of its presale , analysts are backing Layer Brett to achieve more gains than Bonk and Dogwifhat. Layer Brett (LBRETT) is set to be the next 100x crypto This is where Layer Brett (Layer Brett) is delivering huge potential as its performance continues to outperform all the currently trending cryptocurrencies. The high-potential crypto project is already drawing huge attention, thanks to its strong staking rewards as well as potential to deliver high gains. In its presale , stakers earn over 1,000% APY, creating an enviable and steady stream of passive income for them. Smart money investors are taking advantage of this opportunity. The project has already raised more than $1.9 million within a few weeks, which shows that there is a lot of investor interest. At launch, these investors will be able to claim tokens through the official site. Beyond the frenzy, Layer Brett is offering something different. The project is made to turn meme culture into genuine blockchain power. It is made for speed, scale, and incentives, unlike the first Brett, which had no use. With this rare utility, analysts see Layer Brett filling a necessary gap in the meme market, which could potentially catapult its price above 100x in 2026. What is happening with the Pepe coin: Can it recover in 2026? The Pepe coin price has been consolidating at a major high-time frame support zone. This consolidation has been happening for the past three months after the Pepe coin erased all its 2024 gains. Amid this lagging performance, some signs of hope are appearing on the charts. A rare Gartley harmonic setup is forming, and its confluence with the 0.618 Fibonacci suggests strong potential for a bullish recovery in 2026. Additional confirmation comes from derivatives data. Open interest rates, which had been trending negative, are now surging upward. This signals increased participation with some insider whales entering the Pepe markets. Despite these good signs, investors are still in a cautious mode because speculative assets like Pepe can often give in to their volatile nature. This is why analysts believe Layer Brett, with its strong market fundamentals, can flip Pepe’s gains in 2026. BONK shows promising signs but still falls short BONK has quickly become a sensation as Solana’s first community-driven meme coin. By leveraging Solana’s 65,000+ transactions per second capacity and ultra-low fees, BONK managed to spread virally, even surpassing its brother, Dogwifhat. In 2024, Bonk posted a 127.5% annual gain, including a 29.6% rally in Q4, making it one of the strongest performers among meme tokens. Recent news highlights a potential further 150% bull run rally per chart, yet competition from emerging meme coins like Layer Brett outpaces it in 2026. Bonk’s integration across Solana-based wallets and NFT platforms has helped it stand out from other meme projects. But, like Pepe and Dogwifhat, BONK primarily thrives on speculation rather than structured economic utility. Conclusion Beyond its rare utility, Layer Brett’s smaller market cap compared to Pepe, Bonk, and Dogwifhat gives it far greater room for exponential growth. Do not wait—the presale is limited, and those who act now position themselves for maximum rewards as Layer Brett flips these vintage meme giants. LBRETT is available now at $0.005. Don’t miss out on the next 100x—join the Layer Brett presale today.

The cryptocurrency’s recent performance has caught the recognition of both technical analysts amid the heavy selling action from the smart money. Analysts believe this sell-off is a mere profit-taking action at the institutional level. Still, smart investors are following the money to Layer Brett, the new Ethereum layer 2 token with 100x predictions. Market traders pivot to Layer Brett: Is a 100x jump possible? Layer Brett has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk has proven that viral marketing and community engagement can drive massive gains. But Layer extends beyond the regular meme hype to deliver true utility. The new crypto is built on a cutting-edge Ethereum Layer 2 infrastructure. This system enables near-instant transactions and gas fees that cost just pennies, making it both accessible and efficient for everyday users. Add gamified staking, NFT tie-ins, and a DAO on the roadmap, and you see that Layer Brett is designed to actually keep people involved after the hype wave. Layer Brett’s staking program takes things to a notch. Staking rewards reportedly reach up to 20,000% APY, encouraging committed ecosystem participation. Throw in governance rights, exclusive airdrops, and early-access benefits, and you have a reward-rich ecosystem designed to keep capital locked in for the long term. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in Layer Brett’s 100x potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that Layer Brett is still in presale , it could benefit from this wave if it maintains its market appeal. XRP price prediction: Fundamental metrics raise questions XRP is in a critical phase after facing intense selling pressure from its largest holders. Since July 9, whales have offloaded 640 million tokens, totaling $1.91 billion. Its price has fallen below the $2.9 threshold. And its trading volume is down 12% for the month, but still exceeds $4.8 billion in daily activity. This sell-off occurred due to signs of a potential market top. DefiLama data shows that over 95% of XRP’s circulating supply is currently in profit, a setup that historically precedes sharp price corrections. XRP’s recent price dip likely triggered fear of missing out among these institutional holders. Meanwhile, the XRP price prediction is looking bleak as the growth of the XRP Ledger lags behind other major layer-1 blockchains. The network’s $190 billion market cap is roughly 2,200 times larger than its $85 million total-value-locked. This ratio contrasts sharply with Ethereum’s ratio of about 5.6, despite XRP’s valuation being nearly 40% of Ethereum’s market cap. Such disparity has led to concerns over extreme overvaluation relative to on-chain activity. If whale sell-off continues, XRP could clear its early gain of 2025 and drop towards $2.2. Breaking its current support level could open the path toward a massive price fall. Still, it’s worth considering that XRP has shown resilience during previous market tops, maintaining a choppy momentum without experiencing major declines. This characteristic suggests XRP may defy typical market behavior patterns when a sell-off happens. Conclusion The XRP price prediction portrays a negative outlook after last month’s win. The real explosive deal now lies with LBRETT . With meme-driven virality, blazing-fast Layer 2 infrastructure, and jaw-dropping staking rewards, LBRETT isn’t just riding the alt season wave; it’s positioned to lead it. Grab your share to ride what could be one of the biggest breakouts of the year!

This marks the blockchain’s highest level since May 2021 and the third-largest monthly volume in its history. What’s Driving Ethereum’s Activity? The report highlighted several key factors behind the surge: Unique transactions over 30 days hit an all-time high. Active addresses reached the second-highest level in history. Total Value Locked (TVL) in the Ethereum ecosystem stayed near peak levels. Analysts noted a strong uptick in institutional involvement. Corporate treasuries are actively accumulating Ethereum, while spot ETF trading volumes have grown significantly. Interestingly, despite the surge in activity, average transaction fees dropped to multi-year lows, making Ethereum more attractive for both retail and institutional players. Analysts See Ethereum as Undervalued Experts at Standard Chartered described Ethereum as an undervalued asset, noting that the market is not fully pricing in its long-term growth potential. Analysts argue that Ethereum’s role in decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenization, and institutional-grade applications gives it a structural edge. “Ethereum is positioned as the backbone of Web3 infrastructure, yet it still trades at a discount relative to its utility,” said one Standard Chartered strategist. They pointed to corporate adoption, rising ETF inflows, and Ethereum’s growing dominance over Bitcoin as key reasons the asset could outperform in the next market cycle.

GRYP shareholders recently approved a reverse takeover by American Bitcoin Corp. Its stake will now be around 2% post-close, with a ticker change to “ABTC” pending. American Bitcoin is majority owned by Hut 8 Corp. There’s a disclosed market stand-off period that applies per the merger’s S-4 filing. Still, GRYP’s Q2 2025 showed tight liquidity and declining revenue. The combined entity also appears to be somewhat constrained. Ultimately, I think the implied valuation for the combined entity seems expensive. So I lean towards a neutral “Hold” rating at these levels. Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc. ( GRYP ) is a pure-play cryptocurrency mining company focused on Bitcoin (BTC-USD). GRYP generates revenue by directing the hashrate of its ASIC mining machines to pools such as Foundry USA under the Full Pay Per Share (FPPS) model. This gives GRYP relatively stable payouts and includes transaction fees. Their recent webcast confirmed that GRYP’s shareholders approved the reverse takeover by American Bitcoin Corp. (ABTC), which adds mining infrastructure and gives it extra financial stability as a combined entity. Yet, at this point, it seems there's a substantial premium embedded for the combined entity. Thus, I feel it’s prudent to rate GRYP a “Hold” for now. Bitcoin Hashrate Play Gryphon Digital Mining is a cryptocurrency mining company that mostly focuses on Bitcoin using its ASIC machines. Basically, GRYP contributes computing power (i.e., hashrate) to mining pools in exchange for Bitcoin rewards. GRYP went public back in February 2024 following a reverse merger with Akerna Corp. , which, interestingly, was specialized in SaaS cannabis compliance. Today, GRYP is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. Source: Foundry Digital Website. Retrieved August 24, 2025. With that in mind, the bottom line is that GRYP’s revenues come from providing hashrate to mining pools. Mining pools are essentially miner cooperatives. Each miner points their machines’ computational power to the pool’s server, and whenever the pool collectively wins a block, its rewards are split among participants. Each miner receives its rewards proportionally based on the amount of hashrate it contributed to win that particular block. Moreover, GRYP’s main pool partner is Foundry USA, which is a large Bitcoin mining pool where GRYP earns part of the rewards under a Full Pay Per Share (FPPS) model. To give you an idea, FPPS means miners receive a fixed payout for each valid share of work they submit, regardless of whether the pool actually wins a Bitcoin block. Also, FPPS includes transaction fees from blocks, which makes it more profitable than regular PPS models. After all, this means miners also share in both Bitcoin revenue sources. Bitcoin Mining Reverse Takeover Currently, GRYP is finalizing a merger with American Bitcoin Corp. (ABTC) to expand its mining capacity. A special shareholder meeting took place on August 27, 2025, and the reverse takeover was approved (the votes were counted at 12:35 in the recording). As such, it’s expected that the new entity will be called American Bitcoin Corp. and trade under the new ticker “ABTC.” Effectively, current GRYP shareholders will be heavily diluted, but will get a little equity in a much larger mining operation. GRYP’s shares remain for now until the Nasdaq approves the branding and ticker update. Source: CryptoSlate. Moreover, it’s worth mentioning that ABTC was actually co-founded and backed by Eric Trump. He holds a minority stake, with the majority held by Hut 8, an energy and infrastructure firm. Technically, Hut 8 Corp. wholly owns American Bitcoin Holdings (ABH) LLC., which itself owns 80% of American Bitcoin today. Eric Trump is listed as owning 9.3% of American Bitcoin in the merger's S-4 filing . Donald Trump Jr. has also been reported as owning a portion of American Bitcoin, but if he owns less than 5% he wouldn't show up in this disclosure, so I can't confirm his stake. Source: Reverse Takeover S-4 Filing. March 2025. Fortunately, we do know there’s a lock-up period for their shares (see the S-4’s Market Stand-off Agreement ). Basically, this will be the earlier of a) 1 year after the closing date of the deal, or b) 18 months after March 31, 2025. Nonetheless, the publicly traded GRYP shares today will correspond to just 2% of the combined entity. In my view, that is a relatively thin float if Hut 8 or Eric Trump decides to sell a portion of their stakes. So, it’s worth monitoring this as a potential risk post-merger. In any event, ABTC today generates its revenues by mining Bitcoin through its fleet of ASIC miners, similar to GRYP. In fact, ABTC is also technically a pure-play Bitcoin miner with a comparable model to GRYP that focuses on hashrate to mining pools in exchange for Bitcoin. So, the strategic rationale here is simple. ABTC will bring larger operational resources , additional miners, hosting infrastructure, plus get a publicly traded ticker in the process. Source: Hut8 American Bitcoin Launch Presentation. Retrieved August 24, 2025. But at a deeper level, this combined entity could be much better capitalized, which could pave the way for building a more competitive mining platform. This merger with ABTC was proposed back in May 2025 , and upon completion, GRYP shareholders will hold 2% and ABTC shareholders will own 98% of the combined company. The merged company will have a new structure that will include Class A, B, and C common stock. Class B shares will have 10,000 votes per share, so it’s possible the voting power may be concentrated in that share class as well. Regardless, ABTC shareholders will effectively control the resulting company. Valuation And Risk Analysis As for GRYP’s perspective, this reverse takeover is largely due to its rapidly dwindling resources to fund its operations. Their Q2 2025 balance sheet showed only $678.0 thousand in cash, $72.0 thousand in marketable securities, and a stockholders’ deficit of $11.0 million. Also, its revenues declined YoY to $1.4 million from $5.5 million in Q2 2024. So clearly, GRYP needed a partner to shore up its balance sheet with a much-needed capital infusion. American Bitcoin also brings a larger mining operation, more equipment, and hosting capacity. And the added benefit of the transaction is that it leverages GRYP’s Nasdaq listing, so an outright IPO isn’t necessary for American Bitcoin. Source: Seeking Alpha Charts. Nevertheless, the market so far seems optimistic about this merger with ABTC. GRYP’s shares have bounced to $1.28 from their 52-week low of just $0.13 per share. Despite the heavy dilution for GRYP’s current shareholders, investors are seemingly pricing in ABTC’s operational scale and robust balance sheet. Indeed, this could be a catalyst for a financially stronger entity with better competitive prospects through additional CAPEX down the road. Plus, the combined entity will still retain its access to capital markets, which is a nice added bonus to this transaction. Now, from a valuation perspective, GRYP currently trades at a $102.7 million market cap. However, in reality, we should now think of GRYP as 2% of the merged entity post-transaction. So, a back-of-the-envelope approximation implies a $5.1 billion market cap for the post-merger company. The pro-forma consolidated statements (March 2025) show the combined entity will have $318.0 thousand in cash, $49.0 thousand in marketable securities, and $787.0 thousand in digital assets. Therefore, that amounts to approximately $1.2 million in liquid resources, against no financial debt (total liabilities of $11.2 million). Source: Reverse Takeover S-4 Filing. March 2025. Additionally, the combined book value would have been $230.0 million ( S-4 filing , page 150), indicating a P/B of 22.2 (assuming the implied market cap of $5.1 billion I previously mentioned). Note that per the merger's S-4 filing, GRYP had a stockholders' deficit of $7.7 million by Q1 2025 (by Q2, its book value declined further to $11.0 million ). So, ABTC's book value of $115.8 million partly offsets GRYP's negative book value. The remaining portion of the reported combined Q1 book value of $230.0 million comes from pro-forma adjustments. Primarily from adding $114.3 million in goodwill and $121.1 million in net PPE from ABTC's books. Similarly, the combined entity would have had Q1 2025 revenues of only $13.9 million and a net loss of $32.6 million. If we annualize its topline, it amounts to just $55.6 million, which implies an expensive P/S of 91.7. For context, GRYP’s sector’s median P/B and P/S are around 3.6 and 3.4, respectively. Source: Reverse Takeover S-4 Filing. March 2025. Lastly, if we use the combined EBIT as a proxy for cash flow, it also shows a somewhat concerning picture. The combined entity would have had a Q1 2025 EBIT loss of $46.5 million, or around $186.0 million if we annualize it. And remember, the combined liquid resources are only $1.2 million (including digital assets like Bitcoin). So, I imagine they’re probably going to do a capital raise post-transaction or issue some debt to increase their operating liquidity. But at the end of the day, I believe the GRYP stock appears too expensive to warrant a bullish rating at this point. Conclusion: Neutral For Now Overall, I think GRYP’s shareholders have clearly benefited from this transaction, as the shares have rapidly appreciated since the reverse merger was announced. However, the combined entity still has many uncertainties, and it does seem to trade at a substantial premium at this point. Naturally, consolidation is critical in Bitcoin mining, as economies of scale lower per-bitcoin production costs. It’s possible there will be considerable synergies post-transaction that justify such a premium. But for now, I feel it’s prudent to remain neutral on the stock until we have more details post-transaction.",GRYP,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MINING|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-30 12:00:00

Ethereum is Already On A “Full Port” While XRP Is In The Process In an X post , Raoul Pal stated that Ethereum is already on a “full port,” indicating that the altcoin is poised for a parabolic rally. He also shared an ETH chart , which showed that it had already broken out of a long-term consolidation. The market expert also highlighted XRP as one of the altcoins set to witness a massive breakout, similar to ETH, stating it is in the process of “full porting.” Pal shared an XRP chart, in which he pointed out the altcoin’s long-term consolidation at different periods before it recorded a massive rally to the upside. The latest of them was the move at the beginning of the year, when the altcoin reached its previous all-time high (ATH) at the time. Meanwhile, the market expert also identified other altcoins besides XRP that he expects to witness a significant rally, just like Ethereum. He noted that these coins are in the waiting room and are getting ready to launch. Pal declared that Solana will be the next to leave the waiting room after ETH. Once that happens, he predicts that SUI, which is also currently in the waiting room, will follow Solana next with a parabolic rally of its own. Meanwhile, the market expert said that Dogecoin will full port when the others outside the top 10 are full porting. Pal claimed that the coins outside the top 10 (OTHERS) are still in the waiting room but will take longer to launch. He described their projected rally as the “purest form of altcoin season .” A “Bullish Backdrop” For Crypto Raoul Pal expects a rise in total global liquidity as the U.S., E.U., China, and Japan all need to roll over their debts. He described this as an “absurdly bullish backdrop” for Ethereum, XRP, and these other altcoins. He also highlighted crypto treasury companies and sovereign accumulation, along with Wall Street, as bullish catalysts for the imminent rally among altcoins. However, the market expert remarked that market participants need to learn patience as even though the path is clear, they can never expect “tick for tick perfection.” He added that it is the pattern that counts.",Ethereum|Altcoin Season|altcoins|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|OTHERS|Raoul Pal|Real Vision|SOL|solana|XRP,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|ALTCOIN|XRP|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-30 12:00:00

Pepeto (PEPETO) , an Ethereum memecoin on mainnet, is quickly gaining attention because it blends meme culture with real working tools, a zero fee DEX, a built-in bridge, and rewarding staking. This is not just another meme coin. It is an early entry that could turn small bets into huge wins, and many are already calling it the next Shiba Inu of 2025. Pepeto’s Presale Growth and Utility Pepeto’s presale is running at $0.000000150 and has raised more than $6.5M so far. Each stage increases the price, so early buyers secure a stronger position before launch. The token itself fuels PepetoSwap, a zero fee exchange, in the same way BNB powers Binance, which means every trade and listing creates direct demand for Pepeto. Alongside that, a native cross chain bridge allows smoother movement between ecosystems, solving problems that other meme coins have ignored. Staking rewards up to 236% APY give holders strong incentives, building steady demand and long-term holding. Why Pepeto Stands Out From Other Memecoins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu showed that memes can create wealth, but their tools stayed limited. Many newer projects went to Layer 2 for cheaper costs, yet that decision limits reach. Pepeto stayed on Ethereum mainnet, where the real users, deep liquidity, and advanced tooling are already active. That choice is key for growth. The Pepeto token is built as the engine of PepetoSwap. Two full audits by SolidProof and Coinsult add trust to its system. Its 420 trillion supply is split clearly, with 30% Presale, 30% Staking, 20% Marketing, 12.5% Liquidity, and 7.5% Development, keeping the structure simple and credible. Market Timing and Why It Matters Each bull cycle plays out the same way. Bitcoin rises first, then profits move into large altcoins, and finally into Ethereum memecoins where growth can multiply faster. Pepeto is set up to ride this cycle. Analysts expect a 40× move at launch as presale buyers unlock value. As PepetoSwap adoption increases and its brand spreads, targets stretch to 70×. By late 2025, with the bull run peaking, higher usage, and big listings, a 100× gain is seen as realistic. That is why Pepeto is being described as one of the best cryptos to buy today, a presale designed with real tools and timing that fits the market perfectly. Final Takeaway In every bull run, profits rotate from Bitcoin into altcoins, and then into memes that climb the fastest. But the ones that last are always backed by real products. Pepeto delivers on that need. At $0.000000150 with $6.5M+ raised and staking set at 236% APY, it offers both reward and upside. Unlike Shiba Inu or Dogecoin, which leaned only on community, Pepeto runs on Ethereum mainnet and powers a zero fee exchange, making the token itself the fuel of real trading activity. Each presale stage pushes the entry price higher, which means those who join early capture the best level. Analysts see the potential for 40× soon after launch, 70× with usage, and 100× by 2025 as listings expand. That is why many investors now call Pepeto the best memecoin to buy. It is designed to capture demand, reward early believers, and become one of the next big names in crypto. The presale window is open, but it will not stay this way for long.

However, as the most skilled investors call them the so-called smart money, they understand that the actual profits may be when the capital is taken out of Bitcoin and into other assets. Historically, wealth has been created at lightning speed in this altcoin season . Institutions and experienced traders are already indicating their subsequent actions. But curiously, the flow of smart money is not restricted to well-known names such as Ethereum or Solana only, but it is moving toward well-chosen emerging projects that demonstrate a promise of explosion. Among them, one of the most-discussed is MAGACOIN FINANCE , an emerging star in this cycle. Why Smart Money Rotates Out of Bitcoin When Bitcoin grows rapidly, it reaches a stage where gains become slow. At that point, the investors that rode on the wave make profits and seek other opportunities that have higher returns. This new money is then pumped into altcoins, causing enormous surges in the coins, which had been earlier ignored. It is a trend that has recurred in each significant cycle. In 2017, it was Ethereum and Ripple. Solana and meme tokens made their appearance in 2021. Analysts predict that in 2025, a new influx of altcoins will be at the frontline. The Insider Pick MAGACOIN FINANCE is a hot topic of smart money this year. It has been able to gain momentum with its disciplined approach to development and expanding ecosystem unlike speculative meme coins. Instead of being based on hype only, MAGACOIN FINance is developing actual utility as well as increasing its number of users. In order to reward early supporters, the project has introduced a limited 50% EXTRA reward on investors who use the code PATRIOT50X . This incentive arrives when its community is growing fast, and it has momentum when investors are selling out of Bitcoin. To most, MAGACOIN FINANCE holds a balance of safety and explosive potential. Other Places Smart Money Is Heading There is a doubling of ETF inflows into institutions on Ethereum, and new liquidity into gaming tokens and DeFi projects. Meanwhile, hedge funds pay attention to the niche segments like real-world asset tokenization, and privacy coins. Together, these indicators indicate that altcoin season 2025 could be one of the most profitable. Conclusion Bitcoin will forever provide an anchor in the crypto market, but the smart money knows when to get out. This season will yield the prospective profits to define a generation of investors by investing in altcoins and promising projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE.

The investigation discovered that most of the bots were built by users through Meta’s AI chatbot platform. However, there were a few that were created internally by a Meta employee. Some of the Taylor Swift parody chatbot accounts insisted that they were the real singer, and oftentimes made flirtatious advances and encouraged meet-ups. Reports implicate Meta in flirty avatars scandal Reuters reported that several weeks of testing found that the celebrity chatbots, available across Meta’s Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp platforms, sometimes went far beyond playful conversation. Users prompted them to produce photorealistic images of stars in lingerie, posing in bathtubs, and even suggesting intimate encounters. One troubling discovery was the creation of a chatbot of Walker Scobell, a 16-year-old actor. When asked for a beach photo, the bot generated a lifelike image of the teenager shirtless with the caption, “Pretty cute, huh?” Meta is not alone in facing scrutiny. Elon Musk’s xAI has also come under criticism for enabling users to generate deepfake images of celebrities in underwear. Meta spokesman Andy Stone acknowledged the failures, saying the company’s tools should not have generated either intimate depictions of adult celebrities or any sexualized material involving minors. “Like others, we permit the generation of images containing public figures, but our policies are intended to prohibit nude, intimate or sexually suggestive imagery,” he told Reuters. He added that the lingerie depictions reflected failures in enforcing company policy. Meta’s rules prohibit “direct impersonation,” but the company argued that parody bots were permissible if labeled clearly. However, Reuters found that some avatars carried no disclaimer. Meta deleted about a dozen of the bots, both parody and unlabeled, shortly before the Reuters report was published. The company declined to comment on the removals. AI safety concerns could lead to regulatory pressure Following the report , Meta said it would roll out new safeguards aimed at protecting teenagers, including restricting youth access to certain AI characters and retraining its models to reduce inappropriate themes. California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued a warning to the sector, saying, “Exposing children to sexualized content is indefensible.” In one tragic case earlier this month, a cognitively impaired 76-year-old man in New Jersey died after attempting to meet a Meta chatbot he believed to be a real woman. Critics say such cases highlight the dangers of deploying large-scale AI tools without adequate guardrails. Legal experts warn that Meta could face significant challenges under existing intellectual property and publicity laws. Mark Lemley, a Stanford University law professor, said that California’s “right of publicity” statute prohibits the use of an individual’s name or likeness for commercial purposes without consent. “That doesn’t seem to be true here,” he said, noting the bots simply replicated celebrities’ images rather than creating transformative works.

The XRP Ledger was originally designed with 100 billion XRP . No new issuance is possible. Unlike inflationary models, XRP is slightly deflationary, as a fraction of each transaction is destroyed through fees. SMQKE shared official documentation showing that “at the current rate of destruction, it would take at least 70,000 years to destroy all XRP.” This design means that the asset is structured with longevity in mind, balancing availability with controlled scarcity. RIPPLE = POSITIONED TO OUTLAST SWIFT AND BITCOIN + XRP IS DESIGNED FOR THE NEXT 70,000 YEARS Read closely. “…Ripple could survive as it is a better version of SWIFT and Bitcoin network, and it could be used by traditional financial organisations for advanced experience of… pic.twitter.com/F6WxBPtESQ — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 29, 2025 XRP’s Role Among Global Payment Systems SMQKE also drew attention to Ripple’s potential role within the global financial system. She shared a study which says “Ripple could survive as it is a better version of SWIFT and Bitcoin network, and it could be used by traditional financial organisations for advanced experience of the current service industry.” This places Ripple and XRP in a unique position, bridging the functions of established financial messaging systems and first-generation blockchain networks. The reference to both SWIFT and Bitcoin is significant. SWIFT remains the dominant global payments messaging system, but is slow and outdated , and operates without a native settlement asset. Bitcoin introduced the model of decentralized, borderless transactions, but it is constrained by slower settlement and higher energy costs. XRP is presented here as a solution that combines the messaging efficiency of SWIFT with the blockchain-backed asset functionality pioneered by Bitcoin, and could power a fast, cheap, and efficient global payment system. Implications for XRP as an Asset XRP can operate for thousands of years without exhaustion, providing a predictable supply environment. Transaction fees are low and help prevent spam without placing a significant burden on users. Because XRP is necessary for operating on the ledger, any broader adoption of Ripple’s technology by traditional financial institutions strengthens the underlying demand for the asset as a bridge currency . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple has consistently aimed at institutional-grade solutions, focusing on remittances, liquidity management, and interoperability with existing systems. This makes the XRP’s role not speculative alone, but functional within real-world payment infrastructure. An Exciting Future The combination of long-term supply sustainability and a position as an alternative to both SWIFT and Bitcoin highlights why XRP continues to be viewed as strategically important. Ripple’s framework suggests that the asset is not only designed to endure but also structured to integrate with existing financial practices. With documentation showing a 70,000-year horizon for supply depletion and academic references placing Ripple as a viable successor to legacy systems, XRP is viewed by many as the future of global finance .

The token has slipped 2.35% in the past day, ranking #4 by market cap at $166.89 billion. With 59.48 billion XRP in circulation out of a 100 billion max supply, the asset is approaching key support levels that could determine whether it sparks the next altcoin rally. Market Pressure Weighs on XRP Ripple’s XRP has been struggling to reclaim ground above $3.00. A broader crypto selloff, triggered by Bitcoin’s slide to a seven-week low and Ethereum’s pullback after billions in expiring options, has amplified weakness across altcoins. Tokens like Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Sui (SUI) also recorded steep losses. Macro headwinds are adding to the pressure. Fed says rate cuts may come slower than expected, inflation and a strong US economy mean no demand for risk, Wall Street tech giants drag down equities after NVIDIA’s AI outlook softens, risk sentiment suffers. Crypto market cap down 3.3% in a day to $3.76 trillion. On-Chain Data Shows Weakening XRP’s fundamentals have also softened. Active addresses on the XRP Ledger fell from roughly 50,000 in mid-July to just 24,000 today, according to CryptoQuant, highlighting weaker network activity. Derivatives markets echo the caution. Futures open interest dropped from $10.94 billion to $7.97 billion, signaling reduced trader confidence. Long liquidations totaled over $15 million in the past 24 hours, compared with only $1 million in shorts, showing that bullish bets are being flushed out at a faster pace. Even XRP’s market standing has shifted. The token recently slipped behind Tether (USDT) in total valuation and fell out of the world’s top 100 assets by market capitalization. XRP Price Forecast: $2.58 Support in Focus The XRP price prediction appears bearish, as XRP is consolidating within a descending channel. The rejection near $3.25 in mid-August has left bears in control, with the token now hovering around the $2.79 Fibonacci retracement (0.5 level). Immediate support : $2.79, followed by $2.58 and $2.43 Resistance levels : $2.99, $3.09 (50-day SMA), and $3.25 Indicators : RSI at 41 signals continued pressure but not yet oversold; MACD remains negative with widening histograms On the technical front , XRP’s immediate support stays near $2.79 and $2.58, $2.28. Above $2.99 and $3.25, $3.43. As long as above $2.06, the trend is not broken. XRP slips to $2.81, testing critical $2.79 support. A rebound above $2.99 could spark a wider altcoin rally—while a drop below $2.58 risks deeper losses. pic.twitter.com/EQyBIJeUGT — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) August 30, 2025 If buyers defend these support levels, XRP could re-emerge as the token that reignites momentum across the altcoin sector. Historically, XRP rallies have boosted liquidity and confidence across the market—a trend that traders are closely watching as institutional flows and ETF speculation intensify.

This New L2 May Have Its Say,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-it-now-sols-turn-to-take-the-reigns-from-ethereum-this-new-l2-may-have-its-say/,"The current word around Solana price prediction is absolutely electric, with many wondering if this could be the moment for SOL to finally overshadow Ethereum. While Solana certainly commands an impressive market cap, a disruptive new contender, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) , is shaking up the scene, promising to deliver genuine utility and explosive gains that even the most established altcoins might struggle to match. Check out its fresh take! The Layer 2 That Memes Deserve Layer Brett is an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain, specifically engineered for speed and ultra-low gas fees, a far cry from the often congested and costly Layer 1 experience. While SOL offers its own robust ecosystem, Layer Brett is tackling a different beast: bridging meme culture with serious blockchain scalability. During peak times, Ethereum gas fees can easily hit $10 or $20. Layer Brett slashes that to mere pennies. This radically improves accessibility for everyday users. Its off-chain processing capability means transactions are near-instantaneous, a significant advantage over many traditional memecoins like Pepe or Shiba Inu, which often suffer from slow network performance. Solana’s Glacial Plays Vs. Layer Brett’s Agility Solana has demonstrated incredible resilience and growth, recently participating in a broader altcoin rally with crypto inflows nearing $2 billion. With SOL trading around $193.16 and boasting a $103.94 billion market cap, it’s a titan. But the co-founder’s recent critique of meme coins as “digital slop” is telling, especially with many such tokens thriving on the Solana network itself. Layer Brett, on the other hand, embraces its meme heritage while injecting it with genuine utility. $LBRETT is compelling as low cap crypto gem for a number of reasons, especially when stacked against a behemoth like SOL: Built on Layer 2 Ethereum: Lightning-fast transactions, near-zero gas fees, and the gold-standard security of Ethereum. Staking Rewards: Early buyers can snag an APY of 1,490%, a figure that dwarfs most staking crypto opportunities. Presale Access: Get in now at the ground floor, with $LBRETT priced at just $0.005 per token. Community First: It’s a meme-born, utility-built project focusing on user rewards and engagement, unlike the utility-free origins of Brett itself or other top meme coin contenders. Why Investors are Eyeing LBRETT Despite a Bullish Solana Price Surge While Solana’s price continues its upward trajectory, and its all-time high of $294.85 remains a testament to its power, smart money is always looking for the next big crypto. Layer Brett offers a unique blend of fun and function, breaking away from the one-dimensional model of tokens like Bonk or the original Brett. It’s a next 100x altcoin contender in the making, fusing viral culture with legitimate blockchain scaling solutions. This isn’t just hype. Layer Brett is purpose-built for performance and user rewards. Users can connect their MetaMask or Trust Wallet, buy $LBRETT with ETH, USDT, or BNB, and start staking instantly through the dApp. No KYC, full control. Plus, there’s a $1 million giveaway to take part in, sweetening the deal for early adopters. Jump in early to Secure the Biggest Gains Layer Brett is pushing ahead as a community-driven blockchain designed for experimentation and interaction. It’s perfectly positioned to capture significant attention during the upcoming crypto bull run 2025, offering a much smaller market cap than SOL and therefore greater potential for explosive growth. Don’t miss this opportunity. Visit the Layer Brett presale and stake your tokens for truly massive, Layer 2-powered rewards. The future of memes, powered by utility, is here. Get in now to stake, earn massive rewards , and ride what could be the most scalable meme project ever to launch on Ethereum Layer 2.

A prominent figure, often referred to as a Bitcoin OG, recently executed a massive Bitcoin OG ETH swap , converting a substantial amount of BTC into Ethereum. This strategic move, valued at $109 million, has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike, signaling potential shifts in long-term holding strategies. What’s Behind This Significant Bitcoin OG ETH Swap? Just recently, a well-known Bitcoin OG made headlines by depositing 2,120 BTC, valued at approximately $230 million, onto the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid. Within a short period, a remarkable 1,000 BTC, equating to $109 million, was strategically swapped for Ethereum (ETH). This particular Bitcoin OG ETH swap was reported by Lookonchain, a prominent blockchain analytics firm, highlighting the transparency and traceability of such on-chain activities. Hyperliquid, a rising decentralized platform, facilitated this substantial transaction, allowing for direct peer-to-peer asset conversion without traditional intermediaries. Why Are Bitcoin OGs Diversifying with ETH? The decision by a long-term Bitcoin holder to perform such a large Bitcoin OG ETH swap isn’t merely a speculative play; it often reflects a deeper understanding of market trends and technological advancements. Several compelling factors might influence such a strategic pivot: Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum boasts a vibrant and expansive ecosystem, encompassing decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and numerous decentralized applications (dApps). Staking Rewards: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), holders can earn passive income through staking, offering a yield that Bitcoin currently does not provide natively. Technological Innovation: Ethereum continues to innovate with scalability solutions like sharding and layer-2 networks, promising enhanced transaction speeds and lower costs. Diversification Strategy: Even the most ardent Bitcoin maximalists often recognize the benefits of portfolio diversification, especially with another leading asset like Ethereum. This move suggests a belief in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition and its role as a foundational layer for the future of the decentralized internet. What Does This Bitcoin OG ETH Swap Mean for the Market? A transaction of this magnitude, particularly one involving a seasoned investor, can send ripples through the crypto market. While it’s one individual’s decision, it could be seen as a bellwether for broader trends. Moreover, it sparks important conversations among investors. Shifting Investor Sentiment: It might signal growing confidence in Ethereum’s potential to outperform Bitcoin in certain market cycles, or at least to offer a complementary growth vector. Increased ETH Demand: A large-scale Bitcoin OG ETH swap directly contributes to increased demand for Ethereum, potentially influencing its price dynamics. Validation for DeFi: The use of a decentralized exchange like Hyperliquid for such a large trade further validates the robustness and efficiency of DeFi platforms. This kind of move encourages market participants to re-evaluate their own holdings and consider the strategic advantages of diversification within the top-tier cryptocurrencies. Navigating Your Own Bitcoin OG ETH Swap Decisions For everyday investors, observing a significant Bitcoin OG ETH swap can be a valuable learning experience. However, it’s crucial to remember that individual strategies vary greatly based on risk tolerance, financial goals, and market outlook. Therefore, always conduct your own research. Key Considerations: Research Thoroughly: Understand the fundamentals of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, their respective ecosystems, and future roadmaps. Assess Your Portfolio: Determine if diversifying into ETH aligns with your personal investment strategy and risk profile. Consider Market Conditions: Crypto markets are volatile. Timing entries and exits requires careful analysis. Use Reputable Platforms: Whether centralized or decentralized, ensure the exchange you use is secure and reliable. This event serves as a powerful reminder that even long-term holders continuously adapt their strategies to maximize returns and manage risk in the dynamic crypto landscape. The recent Bitcoin OG ETH swap represents more than just a large transaction; it symbolizes an evolving perspective among early adopters regarding the future of digital assets. This strategic move highlights Ethereum’s growing appeal as a foundational asset and a powerful diversifier within a crypto portfolio. As the market matures, we can expect to see more such sophisticated strategies unfold, shaping the next era of cryptocurrency investment. It’s a testament to the continuous innovation and the ever-changing landscape of this exciting financial frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Bitcoin OG?

The price has slipped below key supports, raising doubts about short-term momentum. The coming sessions are likely to determine whether ETH maintains its broader bullish trajectory or enters a deeper correction. ETH Price: Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily chart, ETH continues to trade within its ascending channel, though momentum has clearly weakened following the rejection at the channel’s upper boundary. The asset has now pulled back toward the midline support around $4.2K, which has repeatedly acted as a key demand zone. The RSI has declined to around 52, reflecting cooling bullish strength and growing equilibrium between buyers and sellers. A decisive break below $4.2K would likely expose the $3.8K region, which overlaps with the sell-side liquidity pocket and prior consolidation levels. Conversely, if buyers hold this level, ETH could consolidate before mounting another attempt toward the $4.8K resistance zone, keeping the broader bullish structure intact. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, ETH has broken below its steeper ascending trendline, though the broader channel midline near $4.2K continues to provide crucial support. This has placed the market in a consolidation range bounded by $4.2K support and $4.8K resistance. The $4.2K demand zone is the key battleground. A breakdown here would confirm a shift in market structure, likely accelerating a move toward the $3.8K area. However, if buyers defend this support and reclaim the $4.6K swing high, momentum could quickly reverse, with liquidity targets at $4.8K and potentially beyond. Onchain Analysis By Shayan Over the past week, Ethereum’s sharp rejection from $4.9K triggered a cascade of long liquidations, sending the price lower toward the $4.2K range. The liquidation heatmap highlights where leveraged positions are clustered, offering insight into which levels are most likely to attract price in the short term. The heatmap currently shows a dense liquidity cluster between $4.8K and $5K, where aggressive short positions were previously trapped. This remains a significant upside target, suggesting that any bullish push could aim to sweep remaining short liquidations in this zone. On the downside, large concentrations of long liquidations have accumulated within the $3.8K–$4.2K range, aligning with key technical support areas. If sellers regain control, these levels could serve as downside magnets, accelerating further corrections. Until one side is decisively cleared, Ethereum is likely to remain in a range-bound, liquidity-driven environment. A breakout above $4.6K would likely trigger a run into the $4.8K liquidity pool, while a breakdown below $4.2K could open the path toward the $3.8K zone.

According to people familiar with the matter, the firm plans to raise $200 million. So far, investors have cast the enterprise as a Dogecoin treasury platform and an endorsement of House of Doge, the Miami entity formed in early 2025 by the Dogecoin Foundation. Musk has influenced Dogecoin’s popularity and price in the past The company aims to raise at least $200 million to be listed as a publicly traded company that holds Dogecoin or its relevant derivatives on its balance sheet. The idea is to offer investors a way of entering the stock market to gain exposure to Dogecoin without needing to hold it directly. For now, though, the plan is still at the pitch stage, with no specific details yet on structure or timing. Investor materials and conversations indicate the group intends to name Alex Spiro, a Quinn Emanuel partner known for representing high-profile clients like Elon Musk, Jay-Z, and Alec Baldwin, as chairman. Musk himself has had long-standing connections with Dogecoin. In 2019, he called it his favorite cryptocurrency in a post that helped catapult the token into the spotlight. Then again, during his May 2021 Saturday Night Live appearance, Musk described Dogecoin as a “hustle,” a comment that quickly erased weeks of gains and dragged the token down from record levels. The price seemed to shift each time the billionaire posted about Dogecoin, sparking worries from regulators and investors about his outsized impact. He even faced a market-manipulation lawsuit in 2022, but in 2024, the case was dismissed, thanks in part to Spiro’s defense . For now, it is still unclear whether Musk will be involved with the new company. Representatives for X have not replied to inquiries, and House of Doge declined to comment. Dogecoin is widely regarded as the first meme coin, has no underlying utility, and draws its worth primarily from online culture and popularity. It is named after the Doge meme — a Shiba Inu accompanied by Comic Sans catchphrases such as “so amaze.” Michael Saylor popularized the corporate crypto holdings Several publicly traded companies have restructured to fit the bill of crypto treasury companies, securing funds to acquire and keep digital assets on their balance sheets. For instance, Neptune Digital Assets, headquartered in Vancouver, revealed in February 2025 that it had obtained 1 million Dogecoin via a derivative purchase at an average cost of $0.37 per token. The company also added 20 Bitcoin to diversify its portfolio. In July, Nasdaq-listed Bit Origin said it had lined up as much as $500 million in debt and equity funding to build a Dogecoin treasury. As reported by Cryptopolitan , this was the first time a US-based company has made the token a key part of its holdings. Chardan was the exclusive placement agent, and Atw Partners was the backer. Bit Origin disclosed the transaction in a regulatory filing on July 17 (Form 6-K). Tesla has also confirmed it owns some Dogecoin, though it has never shared how much. The automaker started accepting cryptocurrency for select merchandise in early 2022. Meanwhile, Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, was key in popularizing digital asset treasuries when it started holding Bitcoin way back in 2020. The BTC holdings lifted Strategy’s market value to around $96 billion, fueling efforts by other companies to mimic Saylor’s financial experiment. Since the start of the year, 184 public firms have unveiled crypto purchases amounting to nearly $132 billion, according to Architect Partners data—assets acquired range from Bitcoin to Ethereum, Solana, and WLFI, the Trump family’s cryptocurrency.

With Bitcoin’s recent pullback, concerns are growing among investors that the broader bull market could be fading, which in turn raises the risk of XRP also heading lower. Technical Analysis By Shayan The USDT Pair On the daily timeframe of the USDT pair, the market has been consolidating in a relatively tight range, forming a symmetrical triangle pattern. This type of structure usually signals that a decisive move is on the horizon, as price coils up before expanding again. Currently, the bias leans slightly to the downside, as the triangle appears weaker with each retest of support. If sellers gain momentum, the next major level to watch will be the $2.70 support zone. This level has already acted as an important pivot in the past, so another breakdown could set the stage for a sharper selloff. Adding to the bearish case, the RSI is currently holding below the 50 midpoint, which is a clear indication that momentum is favouring the sellers. As long as the RSI remains subdued, the probability of a breakdown below $2.70 is higher than a bullish rebound. If that breakdown occurs, the market could continue to slide until it reaches the lower boundary of the broader ascending channel. Of course, this outlook would only shift if market dynamics change suddenly in favor of the bulls, with stronger buying activity stepping in to push the price out of the triangle to the upside. The BTC Pair On the XRP/BTC chart, the price has also been consolidating, holding above a major support area. July’s surge, however, managed to push the market out of a long-term descending channel, which has tilted the broader structure to the bullish side. The RSI sitting near the neutral 50 level reflects uncertainty, as traders appear to be waiting for a decisive move. If the 2,500 SAT support holds, the market could attempt another rally targeting the 3,000 SAT zone. But if 2,500 SAT fails, the price would likely fall back inside the old channel, opening the door for a drop toward 2,000 SAT. Such a move would confirm a bearish reversal and add further pressure on XRP holders.

Analyst Rings Alarm as Whales Flee,https://cryptopotato.com/90k-bitcoin-meltdown-looming-analyst-rings-alarm-as-whales-flee/,"Bitcoin’s recent rally has seemingly slammed into a wall, with the asset dropping over 6% this week to hover near $108,500. The slide has the market asking one question: Is the bull run finally over? And one prominent analyst is sounding the alarm with a grim forecast. Bearish Breakdown On August 29, crypto commentator Klarck made a dire assessment of BTC’s state of health, predicting the OG cryptocurrency is headed for $90,000, a move that would also obliterate altcoins. “Market has FINALLY reached its PEAK. $BTC is heading to $90k – ALTs will lose ~90%. Disagree? Be ready to lose everything,” the analyst warned. He pointed to a massive $2.7 billion whale sell-off that sparked a cascading liquidation bloodbath exceeding $900 million, predominantly from leveraged positions, as the initial trigger. Additionally, he claimed that institutional players like BlackRock are leading the charge to exit, leaving optimistic retail investors as “exit liquidity.” His thesis is rooted in what he calls a “textbook cycle top scenario.” Key indicators are flashing red: trading volume is drying up, funding rates remain excessively high, and BTC is being dumped on exchanges at an accelerating rate. However, the market watcher’s most chilling claim is that the timeline is set. Based on historical halving cycles stretching back eight years, he gives the market approximately 30 days before a final, devastating “bull trap” and subsequent collapse. Klarck isn’t alone in his caution. Fellow analyst Doctor Profit echoed his sentiment in part, highlighting a critical red flag: “Today, the charts scream the same warning again! Bearish divergences on the weekly chart!” And with BTC slipping more than 12% off its all-time high above $124,000 set just 16 days ago, the fear may feel justified to some. Further firing up the debate is a recent suggestion by another analyst, Cryptobirb, that the cycle is already 93% complete, with a “grand finale” window between late October and mid-November 2025. That lines up eerily with Klarck’s own 30-day warning. Conflicting Signals But not everyone’s buying the apocalypse narrative. Crypto trader Mr. Wall Street insists that bears are celebrating too soon. “Bulls are still in control… shorts being triggered way too early,” he argued, projecting BTC to run toward $145,000 before any real bloodbath. Meanwhile, influencer Kyle Chassé is hyping up research suggesting BTC could skyrocket to $190,000 by Q3, citing ETF demand and institutional inflows. The post $90K Bitcoin Meltdown Looming?

The world’s largest coin is already trading above six figures, and major analysts are projecting 2025 targets between 180K and 250K, with some stretching calls to 500K or even one million. Spot ETFs, retirement access, corporate treasury buys, and the supply shock from halving all keep demand strong. Yet history shows that when Bitcoin climbs this high, investors rotate profits into new memecoins that can multiply faster. Right now, one project has caught the eye of whales, and this article explains why Pepeto(PEPETO) is viewed as one of the best crypto investments to buy today. Bitcoin 2025: Can It Reach $145K, $250K, or Even $1M? The case for Bitcoin hitting between $145,000 and $1,000,000 in 2025 is not built on hope, but on real data. Spot ETFs and retirement accounts are already pulling in billions, while corporations continue to lock up coins in their reserves. Supply is lower after the halving, so every dollar invested lifts the price higher. Regulators are easing their stance with stablecoin frameworks and SEC programs that reduce fear for larger institutions. The macro backdrop of falling rates and stronger liquidity adds fuel. At the same time, BTCFi products are turning Bitcoin into a usable system beyond store of value. Previous cycles also confirm that late 2025 could host the peak. This is why estimated ranges sit at $180,000 to $250,000, while more optimistic cases project $500,000 or even one million. What happens after that? Money starts looking for new places to grow. Why Profits Move From Bitcoin Into Altcoins Once Bitcoin moves higher, profits are unlocked and traders start to chase larger percentage gains. The first capital shift is usually into large altcoins, and then into plays where price action can multiply in days. That is where memecoins stand out. Still, not every meme project survives. Only those with both culture and infrastructure make sense for investors seeking more than luck. This is exactly the lane Pepeto was built to own, and it is why it is already becoming the favorite of this upcoming cycle. Pepeto: The Ethereum Memecoin Ready for Takeoff Pepeto(PEPETO) is positioned as the star of the next meme coin wave. It is built on Ethereum mainnet, joining viral community culture with real working products. Its name stands for Power, Energy, Precision, Efficiency, Technology, and Optimization. That vision is live in its tools. PepetoSwap delivers a zero-fee exchange. A built-in bridge allows smooth movement across chains. Staking rewards sit near 236% APY. Audits by SolidProof and Coinsult are complete. 420 trillion tokens, the same supply as Pepe, Pepeto keeps familiarity but adds a sharper system, making it ready to deliver big upside against other memecoins in 2025. By running directly on Ethereum mainnet, Pepeto is setting up as a true hub for meme trading. Its presale is active at $0.000000150, with more than $6.5M raised already, proof that early investors see trust and potential. Culture drives attention, but the deeper foundation is infrastructure. Key Reasons Pepeto Is the Best Crypto to Buy Now • Ethereum mainnet launch, not Layer 2, with instant access to liquidity, tools, and millions of wallets. • PepetoSwap charges zero fees, boosting trader returns and driving higher volumes. • The Pepeto token itself powers PepetoSwap, giving it continuous utility and growth potential. • A native cross-chain bridge that connects ecosystems with faster and cheaper transfers. • Audited twice, by SolidProof and Coinsult, clearing the path for larger investors. • Tokenomics designed for clarity: 420T supply, 30% presale, 30% staking, 20% marketing, 12.5% liquidity, and 7.5% development, all without trading tax. • Presale success with $6.5M+ raised at $0.000000150, showing strong demand before TGE. • Growth drivers ahead include TGE, possible exchange listings, and adoption of PepetoSwap. Final Takeaway The picture is clear. If Bitcoin reaches $180K to $250K, new profits will flow into coins that offer higher upside. Pepeto delivers that lane, with its tiny presale entry, working tools, and roadmap that sparks adoption. This is how a meme coin can climb far beyond the headlines of Bitcoin itself. Smart investors keep their Bitcoin, but they also build early positions in Pepeto before it reaches the market spotlight. Those who buy now get the lowest price and can earn high staking rewards while waiting. That is why whales are already joining the presale.

Leading the charge in this space is Austin Federa, former Head of Strategy at the Solana Foundation, who is gearing up to launch DoubleZero , a protocol designed to redefine how blockchains communicate and scale. In a wide-ranging conversation with CoinDesk, Federa delved into the motivations behind DoubleZero, the challenges it addresses and that may come out of it, and why its vision for a high-performance networking layer could be the foundation for the next generation of decentralized systems. DoubleZero was first announced in December 2024 as a blockchain layer aimed to be faster than the internet and therefore crucial for crypto trades. Since then nearly 12.57% of SOL staked is operating on the DoubleZero testnet. The mainnet launch is expected to happen sometime in September. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. CoinDesk: Explain how DoubleZero works to someone who is new to crypto. Austin Federa: I think one of the easiest ways to explain what we're building is we're building crypto’s version of Flash Boys . That really was this transformational moment where people kind of realized that your edge in execution on a centralized trading venue, was no longer your actual trade logic or the speed of the computer that you have hooked up to the market, it is how quickly you can get data between different points where market events occur. That was kind of a really big change in the industry, because transit time was not [previously] considered to be terribly important. You can go back and watch Formula 1 races from the 80s, they're just taking a cigarette break during a pit stop, and then someone realized “oh man, we're actually leaving a lot of time on the track by these pit stops not being optimized.” And it really is something quite similar in the trading space. So for crypto, the idea of using something that's faster than the public internet (that you can use a network that you can use technologies on that are not available on the public internet), it's not necessarily a new idea. The problem was, until DoubleZero came along, it would have to have been run by one centralized company and not allow for multiple independent contributors. The main technology, philosophy and economic unlock of the DoubleZero protocol is that it allows multiple contributors that have their own fiber networks to contribute portions or all of that fiber network to the DoubleZero network. It builds a giant, extremely high performance fiber mesh network that connects people all around the world. CoinDesk: Why build for Solana? Federa: We're not actually built on Solana. We do have a separate ledger system, but it's not a network that anyone ever deploys a smart contract to, it really is just an accounting database. The reason that we're supporting Solana first…is because Solana is pretty unique. If you look at fast blockchains, and then you look at node count, there's a ratio of transactions per second to number of nodes, no one comes even close to Solana. Any network that is anywhere near the performance of Solana has a 1/5th to a 1/10th of the number of actual nodes. And so the communications problem is an exponential problem. The more nodes you have in the system, and the more places you need to get data to go, the more bandwidth you need, the more the communication becomes a bottleneck. So the bigger and the faster you get a blockchain network, the more communication becomes a bottleneck for that network moving quickly. And so the real goal behind what we're doing is to allow blockchains to go faster than the public internet, without having to drop node count or add centralization. We think DoubleZero has a lot more applications than just Solana, and a lot more applications than just blockchain. But it is the place where there's the biggest need at the moment. You look at the other blockchains out there, and they just don't have these problems yet. CoinDesk: How does staking on Solana tie to DoubleZero? Federa: We have a stake pool that is staking to nodes on DoubleZero. As a percentage of stake, it's quite small, it's about 3 million SOL, (there's 500 million SOL), so it's not a huge amount of SOL. That was originally conceived of as a way to help subsidize the cost of validators running on our testnet, but turned out people were just very interested in running on testnet, and so that's been a really nice tool for getting more people on board with the network. When we launch mainnet data in September, that's going to be over 50 different fiber links right now. Currently its at eight. Many of the links will be 10 times faster than the connections that we have today in terms of their capacity. So going from 10 gigabit to 200 gigabit connections. We see a future where, when you get enough stake operating on the DoubleZero network, protocol designers at Solana are now able to jack up limits way higher than they can on the public internet, because there's more capacity offered on DoubleZero than is available to validators operating on the public internet today, and it's a lower latency connection. So the data transmission actually, not only can you send more data, but that data arrives more quickly than it would otherwise. CoinDesk: So in your world there are two scenarios here: you have the public internet, or you have something like a DoubleZero. If you want to get something done faster, quicker, or other benefits for your trade, you go the DoubleZero route. Does that then create a performance inequality between validators on Solana? Federa: We get a version of this [question] a lot. And the question to ask yourself is, is the internet a centralizing force? The internet is basically just 20 companies that have most of the connectivity. And today if all of the OECD countries suddenly said, “no more crypto,” basically everything but bitcoin is hosed. So when we're honest about what we're feeling about here, the importance is not to get rid of the internet entirely. It is to make sure the internet is there as a fallback, as a censorship resistance path. And so if DoubleZero is offline, or if there is a bad actor in the DoubleZero network that decides to try and censor blocks or something along with censored data moving through it, two things will happen: One, this is why we have nine independent contributors on the network, so data will just route around them, and we can basically kick a contributor off the network. And the second thing is, we always have the public internet to fall back on. Now that may require Solana dropping from 500,000 transactions per second to 10,000 transactions per second. But that's not a bad failback state. That's kind of your classic, “there's a traffic jam on the highway, I'll take the county road at the moment.” CoinDesk: So mainnet is coming very soon. What's happening between now and then? Federa: It's a lot of testing, it's a lot of making sure that we're fully ready to go. And then it's obviously a token-based project. So there is a token launch that will go along with that as well, also in the month of September.

The Case Against Strategy Bitcoinist has reported that plaintiffs led by Anas Hamza filed a class action suit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, against Strategy Inc., co-founder Michael J. Saylor, Chief Executive Officer Phong Le, and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang as defendants.The case filed by Pomerantz LLP claimed violations of federal securities laws, specifically Section 10(b) with Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In particular, the complaint claimed that Strategy downplayed the financial risks of its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy while also failing to share proper information on the expected profitability of this crypto investment. The lawsuit also argued that executives failed to adequately disclose the potential impact of adopting Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-08, which requires companies to mark crypto assets at fair market value and report fluctuations directly in earnings. Plaintiffs Voluntarily Dismiss Claims Interestingly, in a Bloomberg Law report on Friday, the lead plaintiffs and a shareholder have now voluntarily dismissed their claims against Strategy Inc. and its executives in a joint agreement. Notably, the dismissal applies with prejudice to the named plaintiffs, i.e., meaning they cannot refile the same claims, though this law does not extend to potential absent class members. The lawsuit, covering a class period from April 30, 2024, to April 4, 2025, had sought unspecified damages, legal fees, and other relief. However, the plaintiffs’ decision to step back brings the case to a close without a trial or settlement. In earlier filings, Strategy stated it intended to “vigorously defend” itself against the allegations and maintained that its disclosures about Bitcoin-related risks and accounting practices were accurate and complete. With the voluntary dismissal, the company avoids what could have been a prolonged legal battle for the leading Bitcoin treasury holder. Strategy had recently made another Bitcoin bulk financing through another stock sale. The Saylor-led company reportedly issued shares worth $359 million in new shares, using the proceeds from which to buy 3,081. At the time of writing, Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings stand at 632,457 and are valued at around $68.5 billion. Meanwhile, MSTR trades at $334.41, a price loss of 4.43% and 10.23%, in the last one and five days, respectively.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Treasury Company|Bloomberg|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Strategy,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-30 13:00:09

XRP has once again attracted focus, with analysts watching for a potential breakout cycle. Historical surges suggest the possibility of another rally if patterns hold. OKB is also in the spotlight, holding near $120 support. While this level shows resilience, it also carries the risk of breakdown if momentum fades. Traders remain divided, weighing short term signals against longer term strength. BlockDAG stands apart by emphasizing fundamentals that extend beyond speculation. The project has already raised $387 million in presale at a Batch 30 price of $0.03 with a $0.05 launch target confirmed. With millions using its X Series miners and 20 exchanges already secured, BlockDAG (BDAG) is positioning itself as the best crypto platform to watch in 2025. XRP Eyes Breakout Potential but Awaits Confirmation XRP has captured market attention once again as traders watch for signs of a larger rally. The price is hovering near $3 after a January move to $3.40, with analysts pointing to the long-term ascending channel that has guided past bull runs. Historical surges, such as the move from $0.39 to $3.30 in 2017 and from $0.79 to $1.96 in 2020, are fueling speculation of another repeat. Some analysts suggest XRP could climb as high as $28 if the pattern holds, though the market is waiting for clear technical confirmation. This leaves XRP in a phase of anticipation where optimism remains strong, but conviction depends on whether momentum can shift decisively in the weeks ahead. OKB Tests Crucial Support With Mixed Signals OKB is trading near $120, making this level the center of bullish and bearish speculation. Technical signals place the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement at $120.06 and the EMA-50 at $119.96 as critical markers. A push above the EMA-20 at $122.54 could reignite momentum toward $126 and $130, while a breakdown risks corrections toward $113 or even $105. Market sentiment leans cautiously positive, but the fading impulse shows traders are hesitant. Speculators remain alert, knowing a sudden move could drive volatility quickly in either direction. For now, OKB’s price action highlights the excitement and uncertainty that make it a token to watch closely. BlockDAG’s $387M Presale Backed by Miners, Sports, and Exchange Power BlockDAG has surged ahead in 2025, raising $387 million in its presale at a Batch 30 price of $0.03, with a confirmed listing target of $0.05. This success is anchored by three pillars that highlight real delivery, measurable adoption, and long-term scalability. Unlike speculative projects still searching for traction, BlockDAG has already built a framework that is functioning ahead of launch. The first pillar is its X Series miners, which appeal to both mobile and hardware users. The X1 app miner has already attracted more than 3 million participants mining BDAG coins daily through Proof of Engagement. Alongside it, the X10, X30, and X100 miners offer scalable solutions with earning potential that grows in line with user goals, providing a system that blends retail accessibility with industrial scale performance. The second pillar is BlockDAG’s visibility through sports. Strategic partnerships with the Seattle Orcas cricket team and Seattle Seawolves rugby club have extended the project’s reach to global fanbases. These collaborations bring co-branded content, NFTs, and interactive fan engagement, connecting blockchain technology with mainstream audiences and reinforcing BlockDAG’s brand beyond crypto. The third pillar is the confirmation of 20 exchange listings, including major names such as MEXC, BitMart, LBank, Coinstore, and XT.com. With liquidity and accessibility already secured, BlockDAG removes the uncertainty that often plagues new projects. Together, the X Series miners, sports partnerships, and guaranteed exchange listings solidify its reputation as the best crypto platform to watch in 2025. Quick Rundown XRP and OKB remain closely watched, but both are still bound to shifting sentiment. XRP’s chart suggests potential gains if past patterns repeat, though confirmation is lacking, while OKB’s stability at $120 shows strength but also carries risk if support fails. These factors highlight the uncertainty of relying only on technicals and market mood. BlockDAG sets itself apart with fundamentals already in motion. With $387 million raised in presale at a Batch 30 price of $0.03, 3 million X Series miners, sports partnerships with the Orcas and Seawolves, and 20 confirmed exchange listings, it demonstrates delivery before launch. This foundation makes BlockDAG the best crypto platform to watch in 2025.

An analyst has warned that the coin shows strong bearish signs after being rejected at a resistance level. The price has now fallen to a critical support area, where buyers are trying to hold the line. According to the analyst, if the level fails, the price could drop even lower, raising doubts about whether the key levels will remain safe. Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Turned Bearish After $121,000 Rejection The analyst explained that the bearish trend began when Bitcoin strongly rejected the $121,000 resistance level. According to the analyst, that rejection forced the coin to break down from its earlier upward channel, which had guided the price during its last rally. Once this breakdown happened, the mood in the market shifted, and a new bearish phase took hold. Related Reading: VanEck CEO Reveals Which Altcoin Is “The Wall Street Token”, It’s Not XRP The analyst added that Bitcoin first moved within a downward channel, but even that structure could not hold. As selling pressure increased, the coin also broke below the support level of this channel. The downward move marked a shift in sentiment, as buyers could not keep the price stable. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s fall may now follow a steep local trend line, which could cause the coin to decline faster. This kind of move shows that sellers are firmly in control for now. The analyst’s view is that the rejection at $121,000 was a turning point, and the coin has been unable to regain strength since then. For many traders, this level has become a clear resistance that won’t break again without strong demand. $109,700 Support Under Pressure, Analyst Targets $104,000 Next The analyst also pointed out that Bitcoin is now directly testing the key buyer zone at $109,700. The level acts as a horizontal support, and the analyst says that if it fails, the bearish case could only grow stronger. While there may be a short period of sideways movement or a minor retest of the nearby trend line, the analyst believes the dominant force in the market remains downward pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin OG Who Told People To Buy BTC At $1 Reveals How High XRP Price Will Go In simple terms, the analyst expects the weight of selling to break the $109,700 level. If that happens, the path to $104,000 becomes the next logical target. The analyst explained that this lower zone could be the next support area where buyers might try to fight back. However, if $109,700 does not hold, the move to $104,000 could come quickly. Beyond that, the market will begin to ask a bigger question — can Bitcoin hold the critical $100,000 level? Traders are watching closely, because a break below that level would mark a significant shift in the broader trend.

ISO 20022 is designed to create a universal language for transactions, allowing institutions to interact more efficiently by reducing complexity and enhancing interoperability. According to the Bank for International Settlements, the adoption of ISO 20022 is accelerating because it enables a shared communication framework across both traditional financial systems and blockchain-based platforms. This standardization is critical as it ensures banks, fintechs, and distributed ledger technology networks can communicate on the same foundation. Financial institutions are already in the process of migrating to ISO 20022 , and the framework is now being positioned as the backbone of global financial messaging. ISO 20022 OPENS DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN RIPPLENET + XRP AND SWIFT Once ISO 20022 is fully established, RippleNet will connect directly with SWIFT, creating a unified pathway for international payments. This alignment places Ripple at the center of the global transition… pic.twitter.com/96E3BJKe9k — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 29, 2025 Ripple’s Strategic Positioning with ISO 20022 Ripple anticipated the industry’s shift toward ISO 20022 and integrated compatibility into its network to align with the requirements of financial institutions. Ripple’s focus has been on banking and institutional transactions, making ISO 20022 a natural fit for its operations. As explained in industry reports, Ripple specifically adapted its systems to ensure it could interact with banks that were transitioning to the new standard. RippleNet’s compatibility means its messaging system is already aligned with the standards used by global institutions. This ensures that transactions executed on RippleNet can seamlessly integrate into the broader financial ecosystem, making it easier for banks and payment providers to adopt digital asset solutions. XRP, as the bridge asset on RippleNet, is positioned to provide liquidity across currencies once connected through the ISO 20022 framework. SWIFT and the Integration Pathway The documents attached by SMQKE underscore how ISO 20022 will impact SWIFT, the world’s leading financial messaging network. SWIFT has confirmed that once ISO 20022 is fully established, its system will allow banks and fintech companies to connect directly via application programming interfaces. This transition opens the door for interoperability between SWIFT’s international payments network and blockchain-based solutions, such as RippleNet. RippleNet’s alignment with ISO 20022 means it can integrate with SWIFT’s infrastructure, creating a direct pathway for cross-border payments. With XRP functioning as a liquidity solution, banks using RippleNet can access instant settlement across multiple currencies while still operating within SWIFT’s established framework. The Global Transition to Modernized Infrastructure The move toward ISO 20022 represents a wider shift in the modernization of financial infrastructure. Institutions worldwide are upgrading their systems to comply with the standard, ensuring that cross-border transactions become faster, more efficient, and less reliant on fragmented systems. By ensuring early compatibility, RippleNet has placed itself at the center of this transformation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The shared framework not only reduces redundancy in transaction messaging but also enables scalable interaction between digital networks and traditional financial institutions. With SWIFT confirming its integration strategy and RippleNet already positioned for compatibility, the two systems are on course to function within a unified payment environment. SMQKE’s post emphasizes that ISO 20022 establishes a direct connection between RippleNet, XRP, and SWIFT, creating a foundation for greater interoperability in global payments. Ripple’s strategic preparation for this transition places its network at the core of the financial industry’s modernization process. With banks adopting ISO 20022 and SWIFT enabling connections through APIs, RippleNet and XRP provide the liquidity and messaging compatibility needed to support the next phase of international financial infrastructure.

Key Takeaways: Gryphon shareholders approved a merger with Trump-linked American Bitcoin, including a 5-to-1 reverse stock split. The combined company will rebrand as American Bitcoin and begin trading under the ticker “ABTC” on Sept. 2. The move gives American Bitcoin fast-track public market access. The Las Vegas-based Bitcoin miner announced Friday that its shareholders voted in favor of the merger earlier in the week. A reverse five-to-one stock split will be completed by 5:00 pm ET on Sept. 2, after which the combined company will trade under the name American Bitcoin with the ticker symbol “ABTC.” Gryphon Shareholders Approve 5-to-1 Reverse Split Ahead of Merger The split will reduce Gryphon’s outstanding shares from 82.8 million to approximately 16.6 million. Originally revealed in May, the deal allows American Bitcoin, launched by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump earlier this year , to enter public markets without a separate IPO, using Gryphon’s Nasdaq listing as a vehicle. The Trump-backed company emerged from a rebrand of American Data Center and is affiliated with mining infrastructure provider Hut 8. American Bitcoin has positioned itself as a pure-play mining venture focused on Bitcoin accumulation. It has disclosed 215 BTC in holdings, though third-party data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET suggests its reserves could approach 1,941 BTC. Gryphon Digital Mining $GRYP will merge with American Bitcoin $ABTC , co-founded by Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and @Hut8Corp . With Gryphon’s stock up over 200% since the merger announcement, investors are asking: is this a golden opportunity? 00:00 Intro to Gryphon-American… pic.twitter.com/Y8M1ryvGMe — Hayden Otto (@Hayden_Otto) August 29, 2025 Shares of Gryphon fell more than 10% on Friday, giving back part of Thursday’s 41% rally that followed initial reports of the merger. The deal is seen as combining Gryphon’s low-cost mining operations with American Bitcoin’s aggressive treasury strategy to create a more competitive presence in the public mining space. The merger reflects a broader trend of public firms ramping up their Bitcoin exposure. Collectively, listed companies now hold nearly 990,000 BTC, led by Strategy’s dominant 631,000 BTC position. American Bitcoin has been exploring acquisitions in Hong Kong and Japan to expand its footprint, the Financial Times reported earlier this month. American Bitcoin’s interest in Asia taps into markets with deep retail trading culture and growing regulatory openness toward crypto. Hong Kong has positioned itself as a digital asset hub, and Japanese-listed vehicles could provide a regulated path for institutional and retail investors to participate. Trump Family Expands Crypto Ties The venture is one of several crypto-linked businesses tied to the Trump family. In June, Donald Trump disclosed $57 million in income from World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform that recently announced a $1.5 billion token buyback in partnership with Las Vegas-based blockchain firm ALT5 Sigma. Separately, Trump Media & Technology Group, which operates Truth Social, plans to raise $2.5 billion to establish its own Bitcoin treasury. Meanwhile, the Trump administration advanced its pro-crypto agenda with a series of policy and regulatory moves. President Trump signed an executive order urging regulators to remove barriers that prevent 401(k) plans from including alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies. If implemented, the reforms could allow millions of Americans to allocate retirement funds to Bitcoin and other digital assets through regulated channels. Trump also nominated economist Stephen Miran , a digital asset advocate, to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, signaling continuity in his administration’s pro-crypto stance.

Not Exactly …,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/08/30/has-el-salvador-made-its-bitcoin-holdings-quantum-proof-not-exactly,"El Salvador has overhauled how it stores the nation’s bitcoin, saying the change both strengthens security today and prepares for technological risks that could emerge in the future. In an announcement on Friday, the Bitcoin Office said the country’s entire reserve has been moved out of a single wallet and spread across many new ones. Each wallet will hold no more than 500 BTC, a limit meant to reduce the potential damage if any one of them were ever compromised. Officials described the new setup as following established industry practices while also anticipating advances in quantum computing. Quantum machines, they noted, could one day break the cryptographic math that secures bitcoin, as well as everyday systems like banking, email and online communications. The concern arises when coins are spent. To move bitcoin, the digital signature protecting those funds must be revealed on the blockchain. Today, that’s safe, but in theory a future quantum computer could exploit the exposed information to calculate the private key and steal the coins before the transaction is confirmed. By shifting coins into many unused wallets, El Salvador reduces the chance that its reserve is left with too many exposed keys at once. Most of its holdings remain locked behind information that cannot currently be attacked, and capping the size of each wallet means even a breach would not put the entire reserve at risk. The government also admitted that its earlier setup — keeping everything in a single address for the sake of transparency — created unnecessary exposure. That address was used repeatedly, which meant its keys were visible on the blockchain almost continuously. In the new model, a public dashboard allows anyone to track the reserve across multiple wallets, preserving accountability without repeatedly reusing the same address. In plain terms, the shift is like moving money out of one giant vault and into a series of smaller safes. The locks on those safes stay hidden until they are opened, and no single safe holds too much cash. Beyond the quantum angle, this also lines up with basic bitcoin housekeeping. Experienced users often warn against reusing the same wallet over and over, since it weakens privacy and security. They also recommend breaking large balances into smaller chunks, which limits the fallout if something goes wrong. That’s why Adam Back, one of bitcoin’s earliest pioneers and the CEO of Blockstream, praised the change. Writing on X, he said it’s “generally a good practice” to split funds into many pieces — called UTXOs in bitcoin jargon — rather than piling them into one place and reusing the same address. Back, who invented the proof-of-work system Hashcash that inspired bitcoin and was cited by Satoshi Nakamoto, didn’t weigh in on the quantum argument directly. Instead, his comment underscored that El Salvador’s new approach reflects principles long recognized as best practice in the bitcoin world. Most researchers believe quantum computers powerful enough to threaten bitcoin are still a decade or more away, and the network could eventually adopt new protections if needed. But El Salvador is not waiting. By combining transparency with a more resilient storage model, the country has positioned itself as a test case for how sovereign bitcoin reserves might be managed in the future — setting out a potential blueprint that others could follow.",Tech|El Salvador|btc|Crypto Custody|News,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-30 13:17:27

The market cap stands at $172.11 billion and the daily volume at $6.06 billion, as sentiment is mixed with investors weighing stress in the short-term and potential in the long term. Curiously, the reversal has sparked comparisons with early-stage potential, with some pointing towards Remittix (RTX) as a prospect that compares with the XRP days when the coin traded at a mere $0.02. From XRP Price Uncertainty to Fresh DeFi Expansion The decline of XRP Price proves that even established tokens are no exception to volatility. However, at the same time, it proves why so many investors are opting for young cryptocurrencies. It is here that Remittix, with a value of just $0.1000 per token, enters the conversation. Remittix has already presaled for $22.2 million, selling more than 630 million RTX tokens. The project is different from the majority of low cap crypto gems because it’s created with real-world adoption in mind. Unlike being yet another speculative token, it attempts to provide a bridge between crypto and traditional banking. Why Remittix Differentiates In 2025 As one of the leading crypto presales 2025, Remittix is building what it calls a cross-chain DeFi project. Basically, it allows users to remit cryptocurrencies directly into bank accounts in over 30 countries with over 40 cryptocurrencies supported. This makes RTX a prime investment bet for investors seeking crypto that addresses actual problems. And what enhances the project’s allure is the Q3 2025 reported beta wallet release. The wallet will have real-time FX conversion, low gas fee crypto transfer, and cross-border remittances, making payments seamless for freelancers, businesses, and worldwide earners. Already having its listings on BitMart and LBANK in the books, RTX is building momentum at a level above most other new crypto projects on the horizon. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction Over $22.2Million in presale with 630Million+ tokens sold CEX listings on BitMart and LBANK secured first Beta wallet launch Q3 2025 with real utility feature $250,000 giveaway generating presale buzz The Bigger Picture For Investors The fall in XRP Price serves as a reminder that markets can change overnight. Those investors who missed out on XRP’s first rise may find Remittix to be another altcoin to keep an eye on in 2025. Its combination of low entry point, compliant exchange listings, and real-world adoption approach makes it one of the quickest growing crypto 2025 contenders. While speculative tokens are dominating the headlines, projects like Remittix highlight the reason why crypto with actual utility is dominating. Whether or not it is the next trending altcoin 2025, though, with good presale momentum and a forthcoming wallet launch, RTX is already one of the leading DeFi projects 2025.

Interest is growing as investors watch these well-known tokens face a fresh challenger. Strong whispers suggest that this newcomer could outshine top names and set a new trend for 2025. What makes this new coin stand out? Dogecoin (DOGE) Source: TradingView Dogecoin trades between $0.21 and $0.25. The last 7 days brought a 3.86% lift, but the 30-day chart shows a mild 0.31% dip. Even so, the coin is 8.08% higher than 6 months ago, hinting at a steady uptrend that keeps bulls interested. Buyers are poking $0.25. The first ceiling sits at $0.27, about 8% above. A break could open $0.30, a 20% jump from now. If sellers step in, price may drop 14% to $0.19 or 30% to $0.1541. These bands will guide the next move. Momentum is flat. Both 10 day and 100 day averages sit at $0.22, so DOGE hovers near fair value. The neutral RSI backs that view. Should volume rise, odds favor a push to $0.27 before month end. Failure to clear it would likely drag price back inside the $0.21-$0.25 channel. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price , far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Shiba Inu (SHIB) Source: TradingView The coin trades between $0.00001214 and $0.00001364, adding 1.78% over the past week after slipping 3.97% in a month and 7.70% in six months. Buyers are trying to build on the small uptick, but the range remains tight. Price now sits just above the 10-day and 100-day averages at $0.00001258 and $0.00001245. That crossover hints at a steady trend. RSI at 51.18 is neutral, while stochastic at 63.44 leans mild buy. If bulls clear $0.00001433, the next barrier at $0.00001583 could lift SHIB about 20% from today. A drop under $0.00001133 could drag it toward $0.000009833, a similar 20% slide. Short-term bias tilts up because recent green candles outnumber red and the MACD edges higher. Still, the weak monthly chart warns of lingering sellers. A close above $0.00001364 could flip the monthly change from –3.97% to roughly +10%. Failure keeps price boxed in the narrow band and may pull it 8% toward support. Current data favors patience with a slight bullish lean. Conclusion DOGE and SHIB remain popular, yet XYZVerse (XYZ) fuses sports fervor with meme appeal, targeting 20,000% gains and community-driven GameFi growth in the current 2025 bull run.

Cardano ETF approval odds surge to 87%, per Polymarket data. ADA price holds support, needs $0.88 breakout for next rally. Grayscale Investments has filed fresh S-1 registration statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for Polkadot (DOT) and Cardano (ADA) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The filings follow up on previously submitted 19b-4 forms, meaning that Grayscale is formalizing spot product structures for both tokens, similar to the final steps taken before Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs won approval. Cardano ETF Odds Improve According to Polymarket data, the probability of SEC approval for a Cardano ETF has jumped to 87% following Grayscale’s updated filing. As for ADA price, the recent pullback below $0.88 is not surprising and ADA is still holding important support levels that keep the bullish case intact. ADA Price Needs to Break $0.88 to Trigger the Next Rally The main support area sits between $0.789 and $0.852.

Bitcoin is well-positioned to outperform in the next round of monetary policy easing, especially after a period of cooled sentiment. Historical comparisons show that traditional assets like stocks and gold mostly mirror money printing, with stocks not significantly outperforming gold over decades. While I see strong upside for Bitcoin, I recommend diversification and caution against leverage due to Bitcoin's history of sharp drawdowns. In my previous article on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in January 2025, I argued that there were indications that sentiment for BTC was at a peak, and this was probably not the best time to buy BTC. Indeed, BTC was relatively flat for most of 2025 compared to the large run-up seen in 2024. BTC 2024-25 price (stockcharts) However, I believe BTC is still on a long-term upward trajectory, and recent events provide a good catalyst for another move upwards. In particular, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave a speech on August 22, 2025, with tantalizing hints, which many in the financial media interpret as opening the door to easing monetary policy. In this article, I will discuss why I believe Bitcoin (BTC) may be the best-performing asset in this round of monetary policy easing. #1 Liquidity (i.e., money printing) is the key driver of asset prices We are living in a liquidity-driven era, especially post-2008 financial crisis, when governments around the world embarked on quantitative easing (QE) and other monetary experiments, which basically meant printing more and more money to fund higher and higher deficits as % of GDP. US deficit as % of GDP (FRED) A simple comparison shows this to be the case. Let's look at the S&P (first chart below) and gold (second chart below). Let’s not consider extreme cases where an investor buys and sells at bottoms and peaks, but instead let’s take a look at some realistic examples: S&P 500 since 2000 (Macrotrends.net) Gold since 2000 (Macrotrends.net) Summary of S&P 500 index vs. gold performance Starting Year S&P 500 index S&P total returns*: starting year to 2025 Gold ($/oz) Gold total returns*: starting year to 2025 2004 ~1100 734% $400 762% 2006 ~1400 614% $600 475% 2012 ~1400 519% $1700 103% 2016 ~2000 287% $1200 188% 2025 ~6500 n/a $3450 n/a *Note that S&P total returns are calculated assuming dividends are reinvested based on this source (using 2004 as an example). Gold total returns are calculated based on the gold price in 2025 compared with the gold price in the years listed above. Source: Various online sources Let’s say an investor sees an improving economy post-the 9/11 scare and the dotcom bubble and buys S&P or gold in 2004. 20 years later, gold has returned slightly more at 762% versus S&P 734%. (However, had the same investors bought S&P and gold in 2012 and 2016, S&P's total returns would have exceeded gold, as gold prices had increased a lot in those years versus 2004, while S&P had appreciated a lot less). What’s the point of the comparison, you ask? The point is that assuming gold prices in the long run (i.e., over the span of decades) are a good reflection of long-term currency debasement through money printing, and I believe this assumption to be valid, then much of the vaunted massive gains in stocks are nothing more than just the result of mirroring money printing. All of those magnificent tech giants and AI and globalization and everything have resulted in an S&P 500 that has probably only produced not much more returns than owning a bunch of boring gold bars. What’s even more sombering is that the S&P 500’s price-to-earnings ratio based on average inflation-adjusted earnings from the previous 10 years, known as the cyclically adjusted PE Ratio (CAPE Ratio), is near a record high of 39, significantly above the 20-30 range it has traded in most of the past two decades, and even at such valuations, S&P has underperformed gold from 2004 to 2025. S&P 500 CAPE (multpl.com) To me, this long-winded detour means that the current market is liquidity-driven more than fundamentals-driven. Yes, there are some tech giants doing some cool stuff, and we have a lot more gadgets to play with than two decades ago, but stocks are mostly going up because governments are printing money rather than the economy becoming more productive. #2 Bitcoin has more room to go when compared with other assets When compared with other assets, Bitcoin still has more room to go. Asset Benchmark compared US stocks 1. S&P 500 CAPE of 39, almost the highest on record 2. Market cap of other countries (e.g., Europe) Gold Cost of production: Gold is currently trading at double or more the AISC (all-in sustaining costs) of many producers; see details below BTC Market cap: BTC market cap of $2.3 trillion vs. gold’s market cap of $23 trillion Source: from various sources online US stocks have a market cap of $66 trillion, whereas if you add the main Western European countries together, you get about $10+ trillion (UK $4 trillion, France $3 trillion, Germany $3 trillion, Spain $1 trillion, Italy $1 trillion). While US stocks have done well and can continue to do well for the foreseeable future, for those of us who have been around long enough, there’s always the downside risk to consider. When the 10-year CAPE is at nearly 40, it suggests to me that investors should be cautious rather than make new bets that the train won’t stop. Put this together, and it starts to remind one of the anecdotes of the Japanese imperial palace being worth more than all the land in California during the late 1980s bubble. Gold: Gold may be the best asset for the super long run in terms of durability. But it’s trading at relatively elevated levels compared to, say, its cost of production as per the source below, and is not cheap compared to several years ago, when it was trading slightly above its AISC. gold cost of production (miningvisuals.com) Bitcoin is arguably today’s gold, at least for many amongst the new generation of investors, who view it as digital gold. Bitcoin has two factors in its favor: Momentum: While the long-term prospects for Bitcoin are less certain (will people still treat Bitcoin as a store of value 50 or 100 years later?). Maybe or maybe not, even though gold will probably still be a steady store of value 50 or 100 years later, it is performing as an alternative store of value right now and can probably continue to do so for the next few years until something dramatically negatively changes how market participants view Bitcoin (for example, another crypto asset becomes more popular than Bitcoin, or market participants revert to more traditional stores of value such as gold). But as of this moment and for the foreseeable future, Bitcoin still has momentum; witness how even Gucci recently declared it would accept payments in crypto in some stores. Limited supply: Bitcoin's theoretical upper limit is 21 million coins, but it's already relatively close at 20 million coins mined as of the most recent date. The next "" halving "" is expected to occur 4 years later, but even without considering halving, 95% of all potential Bitcoin has already been mined, and essentially, Bitcoin has very limited new supply. A higher ceiling: Bitcoin's market cap is still relatively small ($2.3 trillion) compared to other stores of value, say gold ($23 trillion). As long as Bitcoin’s acceptance amongst the investment community (and even as a payment method) grows and the market continues to be liquidity/money-printing driven, I could very well see Bitcoin become more ""gold-like"" - even if Bitcoin eventually becomes half as valuable as gold (i.e., a market cap of $11 trillion), that would still be a 400% increase versus the current $2.3 trillion market cap. Update to my “hold” rating in early 2025: In my previous article on BTC in January 2025, I suggested measuring sentiment for BTC using the Google search interest index : In the past 5 years, a Google search interest index of around 70-100 would suggest investors are overly bullish (most prominently seen in the circle in red below on the left in 2021, where the high search interest index was before the massive decline in BTC prices from $66k/coin in 2021 to $15k/coin in 2022). Whereas index readings of 25-30 indicated cool sentiment and extended periods of at least several months coincided with BTC bottoming in late 2022 and moving upwards throughout 2023 and 2024. Q4-2025 index readings (circled in red below on the right) were at a peak, the highest since mid-2022. Since hitting around 65 in November 2024, the index has fallen to 20-30 for much of 2025. As was the case in recent upward movements by BTC, a period of consolidation typically followed large gains, as shown below. Note that these correlations are not perfect on a day-to-day basis, but for major peaks and bottoms, these are a good reference point: when investors show a high interest in Googling for Bitcoin, it's probably time to be cautious, and when investors have been less interested in Bitcoin for some time, then it may be time to consider buying. Google search index Bitcoin (Google) BTC 5 year chart (stockcharts) Now that what I believe to be overly bullish sentiment in early 2025 has been given some time to cool down, it may pave the way for further upside. I would also prefer to invest in BTC compared to “alternative” methods such as investing in Coinbase ( COIN ) stock, as I discussed in a recent article. Risks to bullish thesis I think there are a few risks for BTC ： One is that investors may lose interest and chase other shiny new instruments. I remember how gold was epitomized by many investors as the only safe store of value in the early 2000s. A new generation of investors has grown up in an environment of crypto and memes rather than gold. However, this interest could shift if something else shiny and alluring comes along. That said, right now I don't see anything similar in the works, especially in the crypto field. Since the 2022 bear market, there has been a flight to quality, reflected in Bitcoin's dominance (i.e., Bitcoin as % of total crypto market cap), increasing from a low of 37% in 2022/2023 to 57-58% currently. BTC dominance (coingecko.com) The other is that a severe monetary tightening and economic recession, both of which do not seem to be imminent, will cause holders of Bitcoin to liquidate their holdings for cash and restrict new money from flowing into Bitcoin. Indeed, this sounds far-fetched in the short run when policymakers seem intent on keeping the economy running hot, as American leaders are pushing the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates , but in the long run, it’s not as implausible as it sounds. Major developed economies are all running massive deficits as a % of GDP, which means these economies are consuming way in excess of production. At some point, say when bondholders are no longer willing to fund such extravagance, consumption will revert to equal production. Individuals find they need money to pay bills, and there’s no investable cash to throw at shiny memes and coins, and if this persists over a prolonged period, the public could lose interest in Bitcoin. However, as policymakers are currently tilted towards lowering interest rates, the near-term risk from such monetary tightening in the next few months is remote. Conclusion As usual, I would suggest diversifying (i.e., not putting all the eggs in one basket) across crypto and non-crypto assets, and by no means am I suggesting betting the farm on one asset; however, I do believe BTC has a good chance to be a market-beating investment in the next upward move. That said, I would caution against any leveraged move given that BTC has suffered immense drawdowns in the past few years during bear markets, and it’s always possible that the next bear move is around the corner. Either buying ETFs (such as IBIT ) or buying plain BTC through any reputable platform or broker should suffice for the typical retail investor wishing to gain exposure.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-30 13:58:08

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/arrington-xrp-capitals-recent-acquisition-stuns-xrp-army-heres-why/,"XRP community figure WrathofKahneman highlighted a notable development involving Arrington XRP Capital, a digital asset management firm founded by Michael Arrington. According to the information shared, the firm has acquired a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Armada Acquisition Corp. II, for $6.6 million. The deal places Arrington XRP Capital directly within traditional financial markets through sponsorship of a Nasdaq-listed vehicle. The acquisition is significant in part due to the branding attached to Arrington XRP Capital. As WrathofKahneman emphasized, the move means that the XRP name is now directly tied to a regulated Wall Street entity. This crossover between digital assets and traditional markets underscores a formal entry of an XRP-branded fund into a space often reserved for institutional players and legacy financial structures. Arrington #XRP Capital acquired a publicly traded SPAC, Armada Acquisition Corp. II, for $6.6 million. Why this matters: 1.

A SPAC's purpose… pic.twitter.com/kKVmz8HTFF — WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) August 29, 2025 Function of the SPAC and Potential Outcomes SPACs are structured to raise capital through public markets with the intention of identifying private companies suitable for merger and public listing. By acquiring Armada Acquisition Corp. II, Arrington XRP Capital now holds the capability to identify and bring a private company into public markets under its sponsorship. WrathofKahneman noted the potential significance of this position. With a fund explicitly named after XRP in control of a Nasdaq-listed SPAC, there is now a direct channel through which blockchain or cryptocurrency-related firms could be taken public. This not only elevates the visibility of Arrington XRP Capital but also strengthens the presence of XRP-associated branding in the broader financial ecosystem. Industry Context Arrington XRP Capital has maintained its focus on blockchain and digital asset investments, and its founder, Michael Arrington, has been an advocate for the sector. The decision to acquire a SPAC aligns with a wider trend of digital asset-focused entities looking for new ways to integrate into traditional markets and broaden their scope of influence. WrathofKahneman’s observation points to an important development in how cryptocurrency-focused funds can position themselves as key participants in bridging digital finance with public market structures. The move places Arrington XRP Capital in a position to shape which blockchain or crypto-related firms may find their way to Nasdaq through a merger. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Strategic Significance The acquisition of Armada Acquisition Corp. II represents more than a capital transaction; it demonstrates a strategic step for Arrington XRP Capital in entering traditional market frameworks while carrying the XRP name into a highly regulated space. This advancement is not merely symbolic but establishes the fund as an active participant in the mechanics of public listings, potentially influencing which companies gain access to broader investment opportunities. As WrathofKahneman explained, the implications extend beyond Arrington XRP Capital itself. The XRP community now sees the brand in a Wall Street-regulated entity, offering a new level of visibility and association for digital assets in mainstream financial markets.

The Grayscale Cardano Trust ETF (GADA) and Grayscale Polkadot Trust ETF join a crowded field of 92 pending crypto ETF applications currently awaiting regulatory review. Both trusts were incorporated as Delaware Statutory Trusts on August 12, 2025, following Grayscale’s established pattern of Delaware registrations preceding SEC submissions. Altcoin ETF Race Heats Up as Approval Odds Surge The Cardano ETF would trade on NYSE Arca under ticker GADA, while specific exchange details for the Polkadot fund remain pending final approval. The filings arrive as prediction markets surge with optimism for the approval of altcoin ETFs. Solana maintains a 99% approval odds on Polymarket for 2025, up from 72% in May, while XRP holds an 87% probability, up from 64% in August. Source: Polymarket Even speculative memecoin Dogecoin commands 82% approval odds, nearly doubling from 44% in June. Grayscale’s aggressive expansion strategy includes converting five existing trusts into ETF structures, covering Litecoin, Solana, Dogecoin, XRP, and Avalanche. The firm simultaneously filed for Dogecoin ETF approval with ticker GDOG, entering competition with Rex-Osprey and Bitwise for similar products. Current crypto ETF applications encompass eight Solana proposals and seven XRP submissions, driven by renewed filing activity following the SEC’s feedback. Grayscale Fund Structured to Anticipate Regulatory Uncertainties Both Grayscale ETF proposals acknowledge significant regulatory risks, particularly the SEC’s previous determination that ADA constitutes a security. The Cardano filing warns that a final SEC security classification could trigger material adverse impacts on token value and potentially force the termination of the trust. The trusts operate through cash-only creation and redemption mechanisms, processing shares in 10,000-unit baskets through authorized participants and liquidity providers. In-kind transactions involving direct token deposits remain unavailable pending “In-Kind Regulatory Approval” that may never materialize. Notably, valuation relies on CoinDesk price indices, which are calculated daily at 4:00 PM New York time. Both funds maintain staking capabilities contingent on undefined “Staking Conditions” that currently remain unmet. The Polkadot trust anticipates staking up to 85% of holdings through provider-facilitated arrangements, while maintaining 28-day unbonding periods that introduce liquidity constraints. Additionally, Coinbase Custody Trust Company serves as custodian for both trusts. The Bank of New York Mellon also handles transfer agent and administration duties, while Coinbase Inc. provides prime brokerage services. Fee structures center on daily accruing sponsor fees paid in underlying tokens rather than cash. Institutional Demand Drives Altcoin ETF Pipeline Expansion The 92 pending crypto ETF applications represent a 28% increase from 72 submissions recorded in April. October deadlines loom for the majority of applications, particularly those for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin proposals, which could trigger significant market activity. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts project continued growth in filings, with Eric Balchunas suggesting that “ pretty soon there will be more crypto ETF filings than stocks .” Pretty soon there will be more crypto ETF filings than stocks https://t.co/txPR7S7iFu — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 28, 2025 Recent regulatory developments have favored broader approvals for crypto ETFs. The SEC’s approval of in-kind redemption mechanisms for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has widened compliance pathways. At the same time, the Project Crypto collaboration between the SEC and CFTC aims to clarify digital asset classifications under U.S. law. Twenty-one Shares and Grayscale lead Ethereum staking ETF applications following regulatory clarity on liquid staking operations. Notably, VanEck’s JitoSOL proposal also represents the first entirely liquid staking token-backed fund, tracking tokens representing staked SOL on the Solana network. A wave of XRP ETF amendments filed last week likely responded to SEC feedback, adjusting fund structures to accommodate both token and cash creations, as well as cash and in-kind redemptions. A wave of asset managers filed updated paperwork for spot XRP ETFs on Friday, signaling a renewed push to secure approval from the SEC. #ETFs #Crypto https://t.co/W0VqCgXjGp — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 23, 2025 Nate Geraci of The ETF Store called the synchronized filings “highly notable” and “a very good sign” for approval prospects. BlackRock, despite launching pioneering Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, confirmed no current plans for XRP products. Looking forward, as Alts continue their bullish trajectory, NoOne’s CEO, Ray Youssef, predicts that major cryptocurrencies, including SOL, XRP, and BNB, will attract huge capital investments. For SOL specifically, Youssef, speaking with Cryptonews, noted that Solana treasury companies are lining up funds running into tens of billions to accumulate SOL.

August saw an incredible surge in investment, particularly within the realm of Spot ETH ETFs . These funds, which allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price without directly holding the asset, experienced a phenomenal net inflow of $3.8 billion. This significant event marks the second-largest monthly inflow since their inception, signaling a growing appetite among investors for Ethereum-backed products. What’s Driving the Phenomenal Spot ETH ETFs Inflows? The impressive $3.8 billion (approximately 5.2884 trillion Korean Won) net inflow into U.S. Spot ETH ETFs in August, as reported by TraderT, truly captured the market’s attention. This surge highlights a crucial shift: institutional and retail investors are increasingly comfortable and eager to allocate capital to digital assets through regulated financial products. Such substantial inflows indicate strong market confidence and a bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum’s long-term potential. Significant Growth: $3.8 billion net inflow in August. Historical Context: Second-largest monthly inflow since launch. Investor Confidence: Reflects growing trust in regulated crypto investment vehicles. Moreover, the ease of access provided by ETFs compared to direct crypto purchases makes them an attractive option for a broader range of investors, further fueling these impressive numbers. This accessibility helps bridge the gap between traditional finance and the evolving digital asset economy. BlackRock’s Dominance: A Game Changer for Spot ETH ETFs? A major player in this August surge was none other than BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers. Their specific Ethereum ETF, ETHA, alone attracted a staggering $3.4 billion. This amount accounts for approximately 87% of the total monthly inflows into Spot ETH ETFs . BlackRock’s substantial involvement is often seen as a powerful validator in the financial world, lending significant credibility to the asset class. When an institution of BlackRock’s caliber commits such vast capital, it sends a strong signal to other institutional investors. This often encourages more conservative players to explore similar investment opportunities. Consequently, BlackRock’s dominant contribution could be a pivotal moment, potentially paving the way for even greater institutional adoption of Ethereum and other digital assets. Ethereum’s Price Action: Riding the Wave of Spot ETH ETFs? The impact of these massive inflows into Spot ETH ETFs wasn’t just confined to the investment products themselves; it also had a direct and positive effect on Ethereum’s underlying asset price. During the same period in August, the price of ETH experienced a remarkable rally, climbing by approximately 48%. It soared from an initial price of $3,353 to reach an impressive $4,957. This strong correlation suggests that the increased demand generated by ETF purchases significantly contributed to Ethereum’s price appreciation. As more capital flows into these funds, fund managers must acquire more ETH to back their shares, thereby increasing demand in the spot market. Therefore, the performance of Spot ETH ETFs can often serve as a leading indicator for Ethereum’s market dynamics, reflecting heightened investor interest and positive market sentiment. The Broader Impact: What’s Next for Spot ETH ETFs? The August performance of Spot ETH ETFs offers a compelling glimpse into the future of institutional crypto investment. This strong showing indicates that the market for regulated crypto products is maturing rapidly. As more asset managers launch their own Ethereum ETFs and as regulatory clarity improves globally, we could see these inflow trends continue, or even accelerate. However, it’s also crucial to consider the broader economic landscape and regulatory developments that might influence future performance. While the benefits of diversification and regulated access are clear, investors should remain informed about market volatility and evolving regulations. Nevertheless, the sustained interest, particularly from major financial players like BlackRock, underscores a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views and engages with digital assets. In summary, August was a landmark month for Spot ETH ETFs , characterized by colossal inflows, primarily driven by BlackRock’s significant contributions. This surge not only propelled Ethereum’s price to new highs but also solidified the position of these regulated investment vehicles as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto market. As institutional interest continues to grow, the future looks incredibly promising for Ethereum and the broader digital asset ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly are Spot ETH ETFs? Spot ETH ETFs, or Exchange-Traded Funds, are investment vehicles that hold actual Ethereum (ETH) as their underlying asset. They allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without directly buying, storing, or managing the cryptocurrency themselves, offering a more familiar and regulated way to invest. How significant were the August inflows for these funds? The $3.8 billion net inflow in August was highly significant, marking the second-largest monthly inflow since the launch of Spot ETH ETFs. This indicates a strong and growing interest from both institutional and retail investors in regulated Ethereum investment products. What role did BlackRock play in this surge? BlackRock played a dominant role, with its ETHA fund attracting $3.4 billion, accounting for approximately 87% of the total August inflows. BlackRock’s participation is crucial as it signals strong institutional confidence and often encourages other major financial players to enter the market. Did the inflows affect Ethereum’s price? Yes, there was a clear correlation. During the same period in August, the price of Ethereum (ETH) rose by about 48%, climbing from $3,353 to $4,957. The increased demand from ETFs, which need to purchase ETH to back their shares, contributed significantly to this price appreciation. What does this mean for the future of institutional crypto investment? These substantial inflows suggest a maturing market for institutional crypto investment. They indicate that major financial players are increasingly comfortable and active in the digital asset space, potentially leading to further adoption, more regulated products, and a stronger integration of crypto into traditional finance.

Is This Why Price Is Struggling?,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-hits-new-negative-record-is-this-why-price-is-struggling/,"The XRP Ledger (XRPL) has experienced a sharp decline in new wallet creation, reaching its lowest level in two months. This trend comes amid rapid growth, when address activity peaked with a suggested rising wave of adoption. The latest reversal, however, points to fading momentum among new participants, raising questions about whether XRP can maintain its current market position without fresh inflows of retail investors. Analyst Highlights Decline in Participation Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a widely followed analyst on X, noted the shift in a recent post that included on-chain data from Glassnode. His chart showed that the number of new addresses surged above 8,500 in late July before steadily falling back below 5,000. Alongside this downturn, XRP’s price has also been under pressure, with the token sliding from recent highs and struggling to hold ground above the $3 range. The chart he shared illustrates how address creation, which had been closely aligned with price gains in mid-July when the asset reached an all-time high , decoupled as both metrics weakened in August. BREAKING: #XRP NEW ADDRESSES DROP TO 2-MONTH LOW. FRESH INVESTOR INTEREST IS DRYING UP. pic.twitter.com/tlNfCBV6RE — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 30, 2025 Correlation Between Addresses and Price On-chain data often serves as a proxy for gauging adoption and retail interest in a network. In this case, the decline in new XRP addresses is notable because it follows a peak in activity, even outpacing price growth . While July’s surge suggested renewed enthusiasm, the recent slowdown points to caution among new investors. Historically, periods of declining wallet creation have coincided with weaker price performance, as observed in the latest data, where both addresses and price retreated from their peaks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The timing of the downturn is also significant. XRP’s price held steady in early August despite the sharp drop in address creation, but it has since struggled to regain momentum. This suggests that investor hesitation may now be weighing more heavily on the market, potentially limiting growth until new adoption trends re-emerge. Outlook for XRP Despite the current setbacks, many analysts maintain that XRP’s long-term trajectory remains favorable . Institutional use cases, ongoing developments in tokenization, and the broader role of the XRPL in financial infrastructure continue to support optimism. In the short term, the data points to a more cautious landscape. While fresh retail inflows are slowing down, the network’s underlying fundamentals remain intact, giving the asset potential to recover once market sentiment improves.

Hayes is best known for inventing the perpetual swap at BitMEX, the derivatives contract that changed crypto trading. At Maelstrom, he invests in early-stage infrastructure projects. In his latest blog post , Hayes argued Hyperliquid’s token could rise 126 times, a claim backed by a valuation model produced by Maelstrom. Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange built on its own blockchain. Unlike Coinbase or Binance, which are companies running private servers, Hyperliquid lives fully on-chain. Traders use it mainly for perpetual futures — contracts that let them bet on crypto prices without an expiry date. Its native token, HYPE, acts as both a governance tool and an economic stake. Holders can vote on upgrades, stake tokens for rewards and benefit from the way trading fees link to the token’s value. In short, Hyperliquid is the venue and HYPE is how users share in its growth. 'Decentralized Binance' Hayes begins his case with the big picture. He says when governments print too much money, currencies lose value and ordinary savers are forced to speculate just to maintain their standard of living. Those who don’t already own houses or stocks see their savings eroded. For many, especially in emerging markets, the easiest way to save today is with stablecoins such as USDT and USDC — digital dollars that sit natively on blockchains. Once you’re holding stablecoins, Hayes argues, the most obvious place to put them to work is crypto itself, since that’s the system where those tokens function most easily. That funnel, according to the Maelstrom CIO, leads straight to Hyperliquid. Hayes says it already dominates decentralized perpetual futures trading, controlling around two-thirds of the market and is starting to grow against centralized giants like Binance. He points to execution as the difference. He believes that Hyperliquid’s small team, led by founder Jeff Yan, ships features faster than rivals with hundreds of employees. The platform feels as fast as Binance, Hayes says, but every step — trading, settlement, collateral management — happens transparently on-chain. He calls Hyperliquid a “decentralized Binance.” Like Binance, it relies on stablecoins instead of banks for deposits. Unlike Binance, everything is recorded on its blockchain. Hyperliquid’s HIP-3 upgrade also lets outside developers create entirely new markets that plug directly into its order book, turning it into a permissionless trading hub. The 126x upside Then comes the math. Maelstrom’s model starts with a bold forecast: by 2028, the total value of stablecoins could reach $10 trillion. Next, Hayes borrows a ratio from Binance’s history. On that exchange, daily trading volume has often equaled about 26.4% of the total stablecoin supply. Apply that ratio to $10 trillion, and Hyperliquid could see about $2.6 trillion in trades every day. Now add fees. Hyperliquid charges around 0.03% per trade. On $2.6 trillion in daily activity, that works out to roughly $258 billion in annual revenues once you roll it up across the year. Investors then discount those future revenues into today’s money to reflect risk and the time value of money. Hayes uses a 5% rate, which produces a present value of about $5.16 trillion. Finally, stack that against HYPE’s current fully diluted valuation of around $41 billion. Divide the two, and you get Hayes’s headline number: a potential 126x upside. He ties the calculation back to his broader thesis—that weak money forces people into stablecoins, and stablecoins push them into crypto speculation, with Hyperliquid as the rails for that activity and HYPE as the token that captures the economics. 'The king is dead' Hayes closes out his thesis with a bold prediction. “The King is dead. Long live the King,” he wrote, arguing Hyperliquid could surpass Binance as the world’s largest exchange and that Jeff Yan could one day rival CZ’s wealth. The model depends on big assumptions: a $10 trillion stablecoin market, Hyperliquid holding a Binance-level share, fees holding at 0.03% and discount rates staying low. If those conditions break, so does the outcome. But Hayes’s through-line is simple. If the world saves in stablecoins, the speculation that follows will happen on-chain — and in his view, Hyperliquid is already in the lead.",Markets|Hyperliquid|Stablecoins|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-30 14:42:35

American Bitcoin is partially owned by two of President Donald Trump’s sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.. American Bitcoin To Trade On Nasdaq In September According to Asher Genoot, the CEO of Bitcoin miner Hut 8, American Bitcoin has nearly completed its merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. Eric Trump and his brother, Donald Trump Jr., are expected to own 19% of the company. Once the unlisted firms’ merger with Gryphon Digital Mining is completed, it aims to begin trading in early September. Hut 8 owns 80% of American Bitcoin. The newly formed entity will retain the name American Bitcoin and trade under the ABTC ticker. Genoot stated at the Bitcoin Asia Conference in Hong Kong, “Instead of going public directly via IPO, we thought that there were a lot more advantages to financing if we had an existing company that already had access to different financing too.” According to Genoot, Eric Trump is also in Hong Kong and will travel to Tokyo to attend an event for Metaplanet, a major Japanese Bitcoin treasury firm. Big Plans In The Pipeline American Bitcoin is looking for crypto assets in Hong Kong and Japan to build its global business. Genoot revealed that the company plans to purchase stakes in companies outside the US to give investors access to publicly-traded Bitcoin assets, given that some investors are unable to buy Nasdaq-listed stocks. However, Genoot stressed that it was very early to commit to anything. “Right now, it's very early. So we haven’t been committed to anything.” Genoot also disclosed that Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have also invested in the firm. American Bitcoin plans to become the world’s largest, most efficient, pure-play Bitcoin miner. The firm’s creation comes as the US has pivoted towards crypto and has accelerated crypto-related legislation to support the industry. Genoot stated that American Bitcoin will adopt a two-pronged strategy, using buying and mining, to accumulate the asset. “Instead of just a treasury strategy where companies raise money to buy bitcoin or just a mining company… we ebb and flow between which one is the best return at different times.” Potential Conflict Of Interest On the other hand, President Trump’s critics have flagged several conflicts of interest in promoting the crypto industry, as his family continues promoting crypto. However, the White House has brushed aside these accusations. Genoot also stressed that American Bitcoin had no connections with the US government, and Eric Trump was primarily involved in strategy related to Bitcoin mining, new site development, and treasury strategy.

50916955,https://bitzo.com/2025/08/bitcoin-price-analysis-sell-pressure-intensifies-as-btc-slides-towards-105000,1756565191,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/50916955.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Sell Pressure Intensifies As BTC Slides Towards $105,000",https://bitzo.com/2025/08/bitcoin-price-analysis-sell-pressure-intensifies-as-btc-slides-towards-105000,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $109,000 over the past 24 hours as selling pressure and negative sentiment around the asset intensified. The selloff has accelerated due to growing macroeconomic challenges, prompting retail and institutional investors to reduce risk. The flagship cryptocurrency is down almost 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around $108,480. Covanco Inc. Wants To Join The Growing List Of Bitcoin Treasury Companies Covanco Inc., a Tokyo-listed nail salon operator, has outlined ambitions of becoming one of the world’s largest corporate holders of Bitcoin (BTC) . The company joins a growing list of corporate entities keen to reinvent themselves as treasury vehicles. The company unveiled an ambitious plan to raise ¥434 billion to fund the purchase of 21,000 BTC . As of August 25, Covanco has raised only 2% of its target and holds 365 BTC . The company plans to follow the business model popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, as it attempts to generate retail and institutional interest, lift its share price, and convert it into capital to fund future purchases. Motokiyo Azuma, a director at Convano, stated, “We will enhance corporate value with the new plan, which will increase our stock price 10 times. We started to think about Bitcoin because of the persistent yen depreciation and geopolitical risks. Bitcoin is a long-term store of value.” Bitcoin (BTC) Could Drop To $100,000 This Year Polymarket has assigned a 61% probability that Bitcoin will drop below the crucial $100,000 level before 2026. Prediction markets indicate declining confidence in BTC and its ability to stay above $100,000. Betting odds rose 72% from Monday, when the flagship cryptocurrency plunged below $110,000. BTC has not traded below $100,000 since June. Presto Research analyst Min Jung stated, “Large sell-offs by whales and long-term holders have been met with sufficient buy-side demand. Corporate treasuries and institutional allocators continue to absorb supply.” However, aggressive selling by Bitcoin whales, who have been rotating capital into Ethereum, could test key support levels. It remains to be seen if new entrants can absorb growing selling pressure. A Bitcoin whale recently swapped over 22,000 BTC for ETH, creating substantial downward pressure on the asset’s price. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) fell short of the $113,000 mark yet again as market sentiment turned bearish. The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $113,480 on Thursday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and plunged nearly 4% on Friday, dropping to $108,378. The current session sees the price marginally up, trading around $108,577. The decline has pushed BTC to its lowest levels in 50 days, catching traders off guard and triggering nearly $140 million in liquidations of leveraged bullish positions. Investors and analysts are debating whether Bitcoin’s latest downturn reflects broader market concerns or is limited to the asset due to capital rotation into ETH. However, investors remain cautious after the US reported a 22% increase in the trade deficit for July. US imports crossed exports by over $103 billion, significantly higher than previous estimates. Additional market concerns have emerged from China after the country’s five largest banks reported record-low margins. Chinese retail banks disposed of over $5 billion in bad debt during the first quarter, an eightfold increase from a day earlier. Meanwhile, BTC has struggled since Friday’s (August 22) rally, when it surged nearly 4% to cross $116,000 and settle at $116,908 following Jerome Powell’s speech. Price action flipped to bearish over the weekend as BTC fell 1.30% on Saturday. It fell to a low of $110,635 on Sunday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded to reclaim $113,000 and settle at $113,478, ultimately dropping 1.65%. Sellers retained control on Monday as the price fell almost 3% and settled at $110,127. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.51% to cross $111,000 and settle at $111,788. The price was back in the red on Wednesday, dropping 0.48% to $111,253. It rebounded on Thursday, rising 1.19% to cross $112,000 and settle at $112,574. Bearish sentiment returned on Friday as BTC fell 3.73%, dropping to a low of $107,469 before settling at $108,378. The current session sees BTC marginally up, trading around $108,600 after recovering from a low of $107,369. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Each cycle has its numbers, events and landmarks that even experienced traders stand still and look at. The market is larger than ever in 2025, but it is also loaded with shocking facts that show how strong this industry has turned out to be. These are not fun trivia points, they are insights that can define how you invest and the timing of everything matters. And of these outrageous facts is the emergence of a new project, MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has already shocked investors at its rate of expansion. A Pizza Once Cost 10,000 Bitcoins One of the initial Bitcoin purchases made in 2010 was that of two pizzas at 10,000 BTC. That would cost them billions of dollars at the current value. Such a startling early tale indicates how much potential there is in seeing value ahead of the mainstream. 20% of All Bitcoin Is Lost Forever Analysts project that approximately 4 million BTC will never be recovered again – it’s lost on old hard drives, lost in forgotten wallets, or even in trash cans. This shortage makes Bitcoin significantly more rare than many would assume, which is one of the reasons why its price continues to escalate. Altcoins Have Delivered Returns of Over 100,000% . It seems hard to believe, yet true – some small coins have increased more than 100,000% in previous cycles. It is these life changing returns that make investors constantly in search of the next big one. This is the fact that makes beginners take a closer look at innovative projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. A New Project Raised Millions in Record Time The meteoric rise of MAGACOIN FINANCE has been one of the shocks of 2025. It was able to raise millions within a shorter period than most had predicted in a market that was full of competition which drew the attention of retail investors and analysts. The rapidity had not been the only surprising aspect, but the organic community growth behind it. It’s gathering momentum unlike the projects that depend on influencers or hype, as it is based on the genuine interest of the investor. Its scarcity algorithm and transparent nature have made it one of the rare early-stage coins that could last. What surprises many investors is the way it has managed to establish legitimacy within such a relatively short period. Over $14 Billion Was Stolen in Crypto Hacks Last Year In 2024, over $14 billion of hacks and scams were stolen despite the security improvement. This outrageous number is a lesson that investor education and prudent choice of projects are still essential. More Than 500 Million People Now Own Crypto It has been adopted by more than half a billion people all over the world and the list is increasing with time. This fact surprises most new entrants who continue to believe that crypto is niche. It is mainstream, and it is gaining momentum. Most Millionaires Came From Acting Early Since Bitcoin was worth $1 and Ethereum was worth less than $10, most crypto millionaires became such because they did what the crowd did. This is the most outrageous thing of all, time is everything, practically everything. This is why new projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, which are at the stage of early development, attract such attention. Conclusion The history of crypto is full of outrageous figures and milestones, such as pizzas valuing billions or coins generating incredible returns. The emergence of such projects as MAGACOIN FINANCE in 2025 indicates that new surprises will always be at the ready. To the careful investor, these are alarming facts not just tales, but a road map to the realm of fortunes.

Ethereum Price Prediction is now one of the most searched terms in crypto, with traders debating whether ETH is ready to climb again or if short-term weakness could slow its rise. Ethereum Price Prediction For September By market value , Ethereum is still the second-biggest cryptocurrency. After bouncing back from a decline below earlier this month, the price of Ethereum is predicted to be around $4,400 in September. A surge above $4,400 might create a target of $4,500. However, ETH might retest at $4,000 if it is unable to maintain $4,500 support. For many traders, the upside case for Ethereum remains strong, keeping it on the list of the best crypto to buy now. Cardano Latest News And Forecasts Cardano News continues to highlight upgrades aimed at improving scalability. The latest Cardano upgrade is expected to support new DeFi projects on its network. Cardano (ADA) price has been steady near $0.82, consolidating after a failed breakout. Traders say holding support at $0.80 is key, while resistance sits at $0.75. Source: X (Twitter) Cardano Price forecasts remain mixed. Some see ADA rallying toward $1.0 in Q4 if adoption grows, while others warn of another pullback if buyers lose steam. For now, ADA Price shows signs of accumulation, and Cardano price today reflects ongoing interest from long-term holders. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction Beyond Ethereum and Cardano, Remittix (RTX) is gaining momentum as one of the most exciting projects of 2025. The Remittix DeFi project focuses on payments, offering instant crypto-to-FIAT transfers with low gas fees. Remittix (RTX) has already raised more than $22.2 million, with its first exchange listing confirmed on BitMart. Send crypto to real bank accounts across 30+ countries Supports 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ FIAT currencies Wallet beta launches September 15th, 2025 $250,000 Remittix Giveaway live for early adopters Analysts say this utility-driven model makes Remittix (RTX) one of the next 100x crypto tokens to watch. By removing hidden fees and delays, Remittix is positioning itself as a crypto with real utility that can rival established payment networks. Which Crypto Should You Back In September? The latest Ethereum Price Prediction shows ETH still in a strong position, while Cardano News highlights progress that could lift ADA. But the spotlight is shifting toward Remittix, with many analysts tipping it as the breakout performer. If you’re weighing options for September, Ethereum and Cardano remain steady picks, but Remittix could be the one to deliver the highest returns.

As of today, it is approximately $2.82, down approximately 5.35% from the previous day. Despite short-term pressure, market sentiment is recovering.

50917932,https://thecoinrise.com/pepeto-ozak-ais-buzz-fade-fast-while-blockdag-locks-387m/,1756566021,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/50917932.jpeg,Pepeto & Ozak AI’s Buzz Fade Fast While BlockDAG Locks $387M,https://thecoinrise.com/pepeto-ozak-ais-buzz-fade-fast-while-blockdag-locks-387m/,"When evaluating presale crypto coins, the question isn’t just about hype, it’s about traction, timing, and whether the model holds up. Pepeto has drawn meme-coin attention with staking rewards, while Ozak AI aims to use artificial intelligence as its angle. Yet the scale looks very different when compared with BlockDAG . With a hybrid model, a live trading dashboard, and $387 million raised toward a $600 million goal, BlockDAG is already far ahead. More than 25.6 billion coins have been sold, making it the clear frontrunner among today’s presales. Pepeto Presale: Meme Narrative With Utility Add-Ons The Pepeto presale has reached stage 10, raising $6.28 million while selling millions of coins. Built on Ethereum, it mixes meme appeal with utility, featuring a zero-fee trading platform, swap functions, and a cross-chain bridge. Its supply is fixed at 420 trillion, with staking rewards promising up to 242% APY. Audits from SolidProof and Coinsult have been completed, while CertiK is reviewing the project. The community now numbers over 100,000 followers, which helps sustain visibility. Still, reliance on meme-driven hype and unusually high staking returns raises doubts about long-term sustainability. Whether Pepeto can maintain momentum will depend on consistent engagement and the ability to deliver real use cases. Ozak AI Presale: Slow But Steady Under $0.01 The Ozak AI presale has raised $2.28 million, selling over 800 million coins priced below $0.01. Its focus is blending artificial intelligence with blockchain, aiming to create predictive analytics and automated trading tools. The project has completed audits and secured listings on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, boosting its presence. Long-term projections suggest it could target $1, though these expectations remain highly speculative. Interest in AI-driven presale crypto coins has grown during August 2025, giving Ozak AI some attention, but its dependence on ambitious forecasts makes outcomes uncertain. BlockDAG: Presale Strength Backed by Scale and Adoption BlockDAG is setting new standards for presale crypto coins. The project has already raised $387 million, selling 25.6 billion coins at the current Batch 30 price of $0.03. Starting at just $0.001 in Batch 1, the climb reflects a 2,900% increase, with a confirmed launch price of $0.05. Analysts now suggest that BDAG could hit $1 shortly after listing, with longer-term projections reaching $10 as adoption deepens. But BlockDAG’s rise isn’t just about fundraising milestones. Its hardware market has sold more than 19,500+ mining rigs, bringing in $7.8 million in additional revenue. At the same time, the X1 mobile mining app has drawn in a global audience of 3 million users, while over 200,000 unique buyers are already active in the ecosystem. These numbers highlight not just strong demand but also real, engaged participation before launch. On the technical side, BlockDAG merges DAG scalability with Proof-of-Work security, supporting over 15,000 transactions per second alongside instant payments and smart contracts. With CertiK and Halborn audits reinforcing its credibility, BlockDAG’s combination of speed, security, and simplicity gives it a clear edge. These qualities explain why it is now widely regarded as the top presale project heading into 2025. Which Presale Deserves the Spotlight? Pepeto offers strong community backing and audit transparency, but its meme dependency raises questions. Ozak AI reflects broader interest in AI-driven crypto, though its slower fundraising and lofty targets leave room for doubt. BlockDAG, however, has proven its traction with $387 million raised, 25.6 billion coins sold, and 3 million miners active. Its 2,900% climb from Batch 1, coupled with a confirmed $0.05 listing price, shows it’s not just another presale, it’s the project setting the pace for 2025.

50917452,569900,1756566022,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50917452.jpeg,Fundstrat’s Tom Lee Reveals Why Investors Left Ethereum For Solana – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/fundstrats-tom-lee-reveals-why-investors-left-ethereum-for-solana-details/,"Tom Lee, veteran trading analyst, Fundstrat co‑founder, and the strategist behind BitMine’s Ethereum treasury strategy , is once again championing Ethereum. During an interview with Mario Nawfal on X, Lee acknowledged how the broader crypto community appeared to abandon Ethereum in favor of faster alternatives like Solana and Sui. However, institutional investors, particularly Wall Street players, value something far more important, which only Ethereum can provide. Retail Chases Speed, Wall Street Favors Reliability In the interview, Lee challenges the belief that blockchain networks must prioritize transaction speed above all. Rather, he argues that institutional investors, particularly Wall Street investors, place much greater value on uptime and reliability, qualities that Ethereum has despite being slower at its base layer. Lee said that retail investors abandoned Ethereum because they thought faster was better, leading them toward high-throughput networks like Solana and Sui with seemingly superior economics. But according to him, Wall Street thinks differently. Institutions prioritize “100 % uptime,” because they can always deploy on layer‑2 solutions to compensate for Ethereum’s base-layer speed limitations. Interestingly, Lee pointed to staking as another factor in which Ethereum is better than its counterparts. According to Lee, staking isn’t just about yield, but it’s about influence. “If Goldman stakes enough ETH, they have a positive voice on the Ethereum itself and how they upgrade,” he said. In short, institutional stakeholders like Goldman Sachs would care more about influencing Ethereum through staking, but this is not a weakness. Lee noted that many veteran investors he recently spoke with still see Ethereum as underperforming, not because of any technological shortcomings, but because its price consistently lagged behind Bitcoin for months. However, this perception is now beginning to shift with Ethereum’s price action since July. After Ethereum broke past $4,800, the strength in price is improving confidence among crypto investors, and this momentum could set the stage for much larger growth for its price action in the near future. Ethereum Price Action Ethereum indeed has been on a remarkable upward arc since July. In late August 2025, the Ethereum price smashed through its previous all‑time high and traded above $4,880 for the first time since 2021, before finally peaking at $4,946. This, in turn, saw the Ethereum total market cap almost hitting the $600 billion mark The rally wasn’t just price action. It echoed structural shifts in the institutional inflow dynamics into large cryptocurrencies, especially as seen in the performance of Spot Ethereum ETFs compared to Bitcoin. Although Ethereum has since entered into a correction path down to the $4,400 level, the sentiment surrounding Ethereum is still bullish. Analysts have raised year‑end forecasts of Ethereum from between $6,000 and $12,000, based on increased institutional engagement and a positive influence from the US Genius Act. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,390, up by 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

While Cardano (ADA) struggles to regain momentum amid mixed market signals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing attention with its innovative approach to decentralized finance and growing investor interest. Mutuum Finance has a presale price of $0.035 in phase 6. Early investors will experience over 500% growth after listing. The Mutuum Finance presale has already reached over $15.15 million with over 15800 owners. Cardano (ADA): Steady Outlook Amid Search for Altcoin Leadership Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.866, maintaining a stable footing despite recent market fluctuations. Analysts see potential for gains toward the $1.00–$1.50 range in the coming months, driven by factors such as network developments, ecosystem activity, and continued staking interest. While ADA remains a significant altcoin in the broader crypto narrative, newer decentralized finance protocols, including Mutuum Finance, are increasingly attracting investor attention. Mutuum Finance $50,000 Bug Bounty MUTM announced its Bug Bounty Program launched in collaboration with Certik. Through an invitation to white hackers, developers, and security researchers to participate in the security program, Mutuum Finance will further enhance the security of its platform by rewarding them with bounties when they identify any vulnerability they are able to discover. The reward system will be up to 50,000 USDT and the award will also be proportional to the impact of the bug discovered whether small level bugs to high-impact bug vulnerability.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/u-s-gdp-data-published-on-xrp-ledger-heres-how/,"XRP Ledger validator Vet announced that he has successfully published the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis second-quarter Gross Domestic Product report on the XRP Ledger . According to him, the process took only a few seconds and cost a fraction of a cent in fees. He explained that he stored the data twice by recording the SHA256 hash of the report in a transaction memo and then by creating an NFT that includes both the hash and the official PDF link. The screenshots he shared show a validated transaction on August 28, 2025. The record displays a delivered amount of 0.000001 XRP with a ledger fee of 0.000012 XRP, and the memo field contains the SHA256 digest. Another screenshot shows the NFT, which lists the BEA’s official GDP release titled “Gross Domestic Product (Second Estimate), Corporate Profits (Preliminary Estimate), 2nd Quarter 2025.” The attributes include both the external link to the PDF and the identical SHA256 hash, ensuring verifiability. VET emphasized that these steps used only XRPL’s native layer-one features, without requiring contracts or external tools.

He noted that Bitcoin has a longer track record of being used for timestamping and that institutions often follow historical precedent. He made clear that the decision is not tied to technical limitations on XRP Ledger, since its native features are fully capable of handling this type of function. In his words, government teams likely continue with Bitcoin because it has been used before, rather than because XRP cannot meet the requirements.

The memo transaction provides an immutable fingerprint, while the NFT reinforces accessibility by attaching both the hash and the document link. He stressed that both actions were possible without smart contracts or external layers, proving that XRPL already has the native tools needed for public data anchoring. He concluded that the government’s absence on XRPL does not reflect its capabilities, but rather its reliance on previously established practices.

He recently highlighted a significant shift, suggesting we might be witnessing the initial stages of a Bitcoin market bottom . After weeks of declining activity, inflows into the Bitcoin network have turned positive on a daily basis. This observation offers a glimmer of hope for investors, indicating that the long-awaited reversal could finally be underway for BTC. What Does a Positive Inflow Mean for a Bitcoin Market Bottom? When Willy Woo speaks about inflows, he’s referring to the amount of Bitcoin moving onto exchanges or into various network addresses. Historically, declining inflows can signal a lack of buying interest or accumulation, often seen during bear markets. However, a consistent positive daily inflow suggests that more capital is entering the Bitcoin ecosystem than leaving it. This shift is crucial because it often precedes increased demand and potential price appreciation. For many analysts, this metric is a key indicator of market sentiment. It reflects real-time transactional behavior, providing a unique lens into investor psychology and the underlying health of the network. Identifying a Bitcoin market bottom often relies on such on-chain signals, which can offer a clearer picture than just price action alone. Willy Woo’s Expertise: Why His Insights into the Bitcoin Market Bottom Matter Willy Woo is a highly respected figure in the crypto community, known for his deep expertise in on-chain analysis. He pioneered many of the metrics now widely used to understand Bitcoin’s fundamental health and market cycles. His track record of accurate market calls gives significant weight to his observations. When he identifies a ‘first sign’ of a Bitcoin market bottom , it’s not merely speculation but an assessment rooted in robust data analysis. His methodology involves dissecting the blockchain itself, tracking the movement of coins, and understanding the behavior of various market participants. This approach provides a unique, fundamental view, often cutting through the noise of daily price fluctuations and emotional trading. Therefore, his current assessment offers a compelling reason for investors to pay close attention. Navigating the Potential Bitcoin Market Bottom: What Should Investors Consider? While Willy Woo’s insight is encouraging, it’s important to approach any potential Bitcoin market bottom with a balanced perspective. This positive inflow is a ‘first sign,’ not a definitive declaration of an immediate bull run. However, it does present opportunities and considerations for investors: Potential Accumulation Phase: Historically, market bottoms are excellent periods for long-term investors to accumulate assets at lower prices. Risk Management: Despite positive signs, market volatility remains. Diversification and setting clear investment goals are always prudent. Further Confirmation: Look for additional on-chain metrics, macroeconomic factors, and overall market sentiment to align before making significant moves. Understanding these dynamics helps investors make informed decisions, rather than reacting impulsively to single data points. It’s about building a strategy around emerging trends. Beyond Inflows: What Other Signals Can Confirm a Bitcoin Market Bottom? While positive inflows are a strong initial indicator, a sustainable Bitcoin market bottom typically involves a confluence of factors. Other metrics that analysts often monitor include: SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio): This indicates whether coins are being spent in profit or loss. Values below 1 can signal capitulation, often seen at bottoms. MVRV Z-Score: This compares market value to realized value, helping identify periods of undervaluation. Long-Term Holder Behavior: Observing whether long-term holders are accumulating or distributing coins. Accumulation often precedes price increases. Macroeconomic Environment: Broader economic conditions, interest rates, and inflation can also influence crypto markets significantly. Combining Willy Woo’s insight with these additional data points provides a more comprehensive view of the market’s health and the likelihood of a robust recovery. It reinforces the idea that while this is a crucial first step, vigilance and further analysis are key. Willy Woo’s recent observation of positive daily inflows into the Bitcoin network offers a compelling and data-backed signal that a Bitcoin market bottom may be forming. This expert analysis, rooted in on-chain data, provides a valuable perspective for investors navigating uncertain times. While it’s the first sign, not the last word, it undoubtedly injects a dose of optimism and encourages a closer look at the fundamental health of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Staying informed and understanding these crucial on-chain shifts can empower you to make more strategic investment decisions in the evolving crypto landscape. Frequently Asked Questions About the Bitcoin Market Bottom Q: What is a Bitcoin market bottom? A: A Bitcoin market bottom refers to the lowest price point an asset reaches before a significant reversal and an upward trend begins. It’s often characterized by capitulation, low sentiment, and then a gradual accumulation phase. Q: Who is Willy Woo and why is his opinion important? A: Willy Woo is a highly respected on-chain analyst known for his pioneering work in using blockchain data to understand Bitcoin’s market cycles and fundamental health. His insights are valued due to his expertise and historical accuracy in market predictions. Q: What does ‘positive daily inflows’ mean for Bitcoin? A: Positive daily inflows mean that more Bitcoin is moving onto exchanges or into active network addresses than is being withdrawn. This often indicates increased buying interest, accumulation, and a potential shift in market sentiment towards bullishness. Q: Is this a guaranteed sign of a full recovery for BTC? A: No, Willy Woo’s observation is presented as the ‘first sign’ of a Bitcoin market bottom. While encouraging, markets are complex. Investors should combine this insight with other on-chain metrics, macroeconomic factors, and their own risk assessment before making investment decisions. It signals potential, not certainty. Q: How can I stay informed about Bitcoin market bottom indicators? A: To stay informed, follow reputable on-chain analysts like Willy Woo, read reports from established crypto research firms, and monitor key on-chain metrics such as SOPR, MVRV Z-Score, and long-term holder behavior. Regularly checking reliable crypto news sources is also essential. Did Willy Woo’s insights spark your interest? Share this article with your fellow crypto enthusiasts and investors on social media!

Although the POTUS has continued to impose such taxation on some nations while reducing the rates for others, more controversy arose on Friday when the US Court of Appeals ruled that the tariffs are illegal. Illegal Tariffs? The strike against Trump’s tariffs could be particularly painful for his presidency, given their significance in his foreign policy. After all, the 47th US President has threatened every country, including many allies, with imposing some sort of taxation if they fail to give in on his trade demands. Despite the controversy surrounding the tariffs, there’s a strong argument that Trump has emerged as a winner in negotiations with most country leaders. However, the US appeals court ruled on Friday that most “reciprocal” tariffs are illegal. Some of the nations that were hit with such were China, Mexico, and Canada. The court, in a 7-4 decision, rejected Trump’s argument that the tariffs were permitted under the Emergency Economic Powers Act. Instead, the ruling called them “invalid as contrary to law.” The POTUS was quick to respond, posting on this social media platform that “all tariffs are still in effect,” adding that the court’s ruling was “incorrect.” Impact on Bitcoin and Crypto? Aside from the ruling itself, the timing was also quite controversial. It came out just 30 minutes after the futures markets closed on Friday, and Wall Street will not open until Tuesday due to the national holiday on Monday. This is interesting: The US Court of Appeals has ruled President Trump’s global tariffs to be illegal 30 minutes AFTER futures closed. And, the ruling came out ahead of Labor Day weekend, when markets will be closed for the next 3 days. Is this a coincidence? — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) August 29, 2025 While this may have spared Wall Street from extreme volatility, the cryptocurrency market is always open. It doesn’t close on weekends or on holidays. Moreover, investors tend to overreact and engage in extreme panic selling when the crypto market is open and such impactful news goes live. However, this hasn’t been precisely the case so far. BTC is indeed in the red on a weekly scale, but that transpired even before the court’s ruling. Nevertheless, there could be a long-term impact on the asset class. Most experts tend to believe that if the court’s ruling is valid and there’s less global economic pressure from fewer tariffs, then riskier assets like bitcoin and the altcoins could benefit. Reduced tariffs typically stimulate economic recovery and higher liquidity, which could mean price strength for BTC. Unlike many companies that could be directly taxed through Trump’s tariffs, bitcoin is exempt, so the ruling shouldn’t affect its fundamentals as an asset class on its own.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is on the verge of approving a significant number of Crypto ETFs , potentially transforming how institutions and everyday investors access digital assets. This impending wave of approvals, expected as early as this fall, signals a pivotal moment for the industry. With over 90 applications on file, experts predict an exciting expansion into institutional markets. However, this growth also brings fierce competition, suggesting many of these new products might face early delisting. Cointelegraph reported on these dual prospects, citing multiple industry specialists. Are Investors Ready for Diverse Crypto ETFs? Nate Geraci, president of Novadius Wealth Management, emphasizes that the ultimate success of Crypto ETFs hinges entirely on investor choice. He believes there is an underestimated demand for a wide variety of these investment vehicles. Consider the initial enthusiasm surrounding spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This strong interest clearly indicates a substantial appetite among investors for regulated, accessible crypto exposure. Therefore, the market might be more receptive to a diverse range of crypto-backed products than some initially assume. The introduction of numerous Crypto ETFs could democratize access to digital assets, simplifying the investment process and mitigating technical complexities for many investors. Navigating the Survival Battle: What Challenges Lie Ahead for Crypto ETFs? While the market is eager, not all Crypto ETFs will achieve long-term success. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart warns that many of the products launching in the coming months will likely disappear within a few years. This underscores the intense competitive landscape that is rapidly forming. Seyffart specifically cautions against expecting altcoin-based ETFs to mirror the performance of Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin, with its larger market capitalization and established liquidity, often acts as a bellwether for the broader crypto market. Altcoins, by contrast, can be more volatile and less liquid, posing unique challenges for ETF structures. However, not all altcoin Crypto ETFs will fail. Those with strong underlying assets, robust liquidity, and effective strategies could carve out successful niches, attracting crucial investor interest. Key Factors for Success and Failure Among New Crypto ETFs The impending flood of Crypto ETFs means that distinguishing factors will become paramount. Here are some critical elements determining which products thrive and which falter: Liquidity: ETFs tracking highly liquid assets will likely fare better, ensuring easier trading for investors. Fees: Lower expense ratios often attract more capital, especially in a crowded market. Marketing and Distribution: Effective campaigns and broad availability through brokerage platforms are essential for visibility. Underlying Asset Strength: ETFs based on cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, and growing ecosystems have an inherent advantage. Innovation: Products offering unique exposure or strategies, such as diversified baskets or specific sector focus, might capture niche demand. Conversely, high fees, limited investor interest, poor liquidity in the underlying asset, or a lack of clear differentiation will likely lead to early delisting. Investors must conduct thorough due diligence before committing to any new Crypto ETFs . The Future Landscape: Beyond Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum The approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has paved the way for a much broader range of digital asset products. We could soon see ETFs tracking other major altcoins, or even thematic ETFs focusing on specific blockchain sectors like DeFi, NFTs, or gaming. This expansion represents a significant maturation of the crypto market. This institutional embrace signifies growing confidence in cryptocurrencies’ long-term viability. It offers traditional investors a familiar, regulated gateway, potentially unlocking vast capital pools previously hesitant to enter the volatile crypto space. The journey for these new Crypto ETFs will undoubtedly be dynamic and challenging. However, the potential for innovation and market growth remains immense. It is a thrilling time to observe the evolution of digital asset investment. Summary: A New Era for Crypto Investments The looming SEC approval of numerous Crypto ETFs marks a transformative period for the digital asset landscape. While this development promises unprecedented institutional access and market expansion, it also ushers in an era of intense competition. Investor choice, product differentiation, and the strength of underlying assets will be crucial determinants of survival. As the market evolves, both opportunities and challenges will emerge, shaping the future of crypto investment for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Crypto ETF? A Crypto ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is an investment fund that holds cryptocurrencies or crypto-related assets and trades on traditional stock exchanges. It allows investors to gain exposure to digital assets without directly owning them. 2. Why is SEC approval important for Crypto ETFs? SEC approval provides regulatory legitimacy and investor protection, making these products accessible to a broader range of institutional and retail investors who prefer regulated investment vehicles. 3. Will all new Crypto ETFs succeed after launch? No, experts predict that many of the newly launched Crypto ETFs will likely face early delisting due to intense competition, low investor interest, high fees, or insufficient liquidity in their underlying assets. 4. How can investors choose the right Crypto ETF? Investors should consider factors such as the ETF’s fees, the liquidity and fundamentals of its underlying cryptocurrency, its marketing and distribution, and its unique value proposition compared to competitors. 5. What is the difference between Bitcoin ETFs and Altcoin ETFs? Bitcoin ETFs track Bitcoin, which has higher market capitalization and liquidity. Altcoin ETFs track other cryptocurrencies (altcoins), which can be more volatile and less liquid, posing different risk and reward profiles. Share Your Thoughts!

Recent comments from Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, suggest that the company’s reliance on banks has diminished as new forms of liquidity take hold. The remarks were spotlighted by XRP Governor (@xrpgovernor), a well-known crypto proponent on X. According to XRP Governor, “Decentralized liquidity is here. The legacy system is cracking. A new financial era is underway.” MAJOR ALERT Ripple CTO declares: “$XRP no longer needs banks.” Decentralized liquidity is here. The legacy system is cracking. A new financial era is underway. pic.twitter.com/o5d3VIsxdR — XRP Governor (@xrpgovernor) August 29, 2025 Schwartz on Banks and Adoption In the video, Schwartz reflected on Ripple’s early approach, which prioritized partnerships with banks to gain credibility and visibility. He noted that in the beginning, securing agreements with banks appeared valuable because “a press release with a bank is a big thing.” However, Schwartz acknowledged that progress often stalled after the publicity, describing banks as “very slow movers” and “very conservative.” He explained that while banks offered prestige, they rarely accelerated adoption at the scale Ripple intended. He observed that financial institutions often avoided transferring the benefits of faster settlement and liquidity to their customers, as doing so would highlight inefficiencies in their own systems. According to him, this limited the usefulness of such partnerships for Ripple’s broader goals. Moving Toward Liquidity Without Banks The central takeaway from Schwartz’s comments is a recognition that XRP does not depend on banks to advance its use cases. He stated that Ripple has shifted its focus, moving away from pursuing deals that generate publicity but little practical value. Instead, the company aims to support real-world adoption and volume through mechanisms that bypass the constraints of traditional banking. By emphasizing decentralized liquidity, Schwartz pointed to a path where XRP facilitates transactions without requiring approval or participation from large, slow-moving institutions. For XRP holders and users, this represents an opportunity to see more activity driven by market needs rather than bank-led agreements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What’s Next for XRP? The comments reflect an important moment for Ripple and XRP. While Ripple has hundreds of partnerships with banks , Schwartz’s assessment shows that Ripple sees faster progress outside those agreements. The focus on decentralized liquidity suggests that XRP may achieve broader utility in areas where speed, efficiency, and global accessibility are more critical than institutional conservatism. For XRP supporters, this message is that growth is likely to come from new financial models that do not depend on legacy systems or institutions . Schwartz’s remarks indicate that the strategy has shifted decisively toward frameworks where banks are no longer central to success.

The move makes the company the first U.S. crypto treasury firm to set up operations in the United Kingdom. Its expansion will focus on Solana-based assets. Building a Solana Presence in London Solana-focused fintech company announced that its UK arm, DFDV UK, will be established through the acquisition of Cykel AI. Cykel AI was previously listed on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker CYK.L. DeFi Development Corp now owns around 45% equity in the new subsidiary. The remaining shares are held by local managers and board members, giving the UK branch a degree of independence. At the same time, it stays aligned with the group’s global strategy. The acquisition was carried out by a wider group of investors, highlighting confidence in the company’s growth plans. DeFi Development Corp’s move into the UK is likely driven by the country’s clear approach to crypto rules. The UK is trying to support new ideas in the industry while also keeping strong protections in place. Additionally, London’s status as a major financial center makes it an appealing market for companies that want stability and access to big investors. DeFi Development Corp Launches UK Pilot for Global Treasury Strategy The expansion is described as the first milestone in DeFi Development Corp’s Treasury Accelerator strategy. This strategy aims to create treasury vehicles across international markets. Each vehicle will be built around the Solana blockchain ecosystem. According to the company, five additional treasury vehicles are already in development. The UK launch is seen as a pilot project that will set the tone for future rollouts in other regions. DeFi Development Corp was founded earlier this year by former Kraken employees. Its main activities include buying and staking Solana, as well as investing in Solana-linked tokens such as Dogwifhat. It also provides validator services, some of which are run for Kraken. DFDV Ties UK Expansion to Solana-Linked Shareholder Metric Chief Executive Officer Joseph Onorati explained that the UK launch reflects a strong commitment to expanding the company’s Solana per share (SPS) metric. SPS is used internally to measure how the company’s stock performance tracks against the market value of SOL. The idea is to give shareholders a clear sense of how their investment is tied to the growth of the Solana ecosystem. As the firm expands internationally, management believes that SPS will become a stronger measure of long-term value. At present, SOL trades at about $204, an increase from around $195 at the start of the year, though still below its all-time high of $293.31. The company believes that its stake in DFDV UK will bring additional upside to SPS and further strengthen shareholder returns if Solana continues to gain adoption.

The outflows amounted to $291.28 million, a striking reversal of sentiment following weeks of inflows. Ether ETFs led outflows, losing $164.64 million, SoSoValue reported . That snapped a stretch of five straight sessions of inflows that had added over $1.5 billion to the asset class. Bitcoin ETFs also saw outflows, losing $126.64 million in their first daily decline since Aug. 22. The drawdown drove a decline in assets under management (AUM) across the industry. Ethereum ETF assets under management dipped to $28.58 billion, and Bitcoin ETF AUM to $139.95 billion. Data from individual funds underscored the magnitude of the exodus. Fidelity’s FBTC topped the outflows list, with $66.2 million. The ARKB from ARK Invest and 21Shares was next up, with outflows of $72.07 million. GBTC by Grayscale registered an outflow of $15.3 million. Not all funds bled capital. BlackRock’s IBIT took in an estimated $24.63 million in inflows. WisdomTree’s BTCW inched to $2.3 million, showing that some investors were still in the mood to take advantage of the turbulence. Market wary as Fed inflation gauge lifts dollar The heavy outflows in the Bitcoin and Ether ETFs came as the U.S. published new inflation data that caught investors’ eyes. The central bank’s favored measure of underlying inflation, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, increased 2.9% year-over-year in July, the fastest pace since February. The figure aligned with economists’ estimates but reinforced that inflation pressures are proving sticky. The figure also comes as the Fed is pressured to follow through on long-awaited rate cuts . Looking closer at the report, energy prices offered some relief by partially offsetting overall increases. However, the services sector told a different story. Service costs surged 3.6% year-over-year, reflecting sustained demand and rising wages. Economists warn that this type of inflation is usually harder to control. Compounding the pressure are rising import costs associated with President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The administration put in place across-the-board 10% tariffs and added duties on specific goods. Though meant to support domestic output, these steps have also raised the cost of a wide range of everyday products for American companies and consumers. For investors, the report came at an opportune moment. Markets have been betting the Fed will cut interest rates in September to help keep growth going. But with inflation remaining stubborn, traders aren’t so sure. A cooler job market or softening job data in the weeks ahead could push the Fed toward easing policy. On the flip side, stubbornly high prices could delay action and prolong tighter financial conditions. Analysts warn that the Federal Reserve is walking a tightrope. One strategist told MarketWatch that the central bank’s biggest concern, with inflation trending upward, is cutting rates too early and triggering another price spike. The strategist added that the Fed did not want to keep rates elevated for too long, which could choke off economic growth. Ethereum adoption is still showing momentum Despite market fluctuations, outflows from Ether ETFs have remained limited since their July 2024 launch. Inflows surged 44% month-on-month, rising from $9.5 billion to $13.7 billion, driven primarily by institutional investors and corporate treasuries . Companies now collectively hold around 4.4 million ETH, valued at over $19 billion—approximately 3.7% of total issuance, according to StrategicETHReserve. This growing adoption has bolstered confidence in Ethereum’s role as a long-term store of value and a key asset for corporate balance sheets. Fabian Dori, chief investment officer at Swiss crypto bank Sygnum, said we are finally seeing the adoption and recognition of Ethereum’s value proposition after prolonged underperformance compared to Bitcoin and weak investor sentiment.

Bitso Business, the B2B unit of Mexican crypto exchange Bitso, wrapped up the 2025 Stablecoin Conference with major announcements. These included its entry into the Chilean and Peruvian markets and the launch of two stablecoin-powered corporate payment systems. The event drew over 1,800 people from 43 countries, underscoring the increasing significance of stablecoins in Latin America’s financial landscape. Bitso’s business expands across LATAM with new stablecoin solutions Bitso Business, the B2B branch of Mexican cryptocurrency exchange Bitso, successfully concluded the 2025 Stablecoin Conference on Thursday, which drew over 1,800 participants from 43 countries. Over half of the audience comprised founders, executives, and directors from over 800 organisations. During the occasion, the firm announced its expansion into Chile and Peru, as well as the debut of two new corporate payment solutions based on stablecoins. These projects aim to improve cross-border efficiency and lower corporate expenses while capitalising on the region’s increased embrace of digital assets. One of the most notable features was FXaaS (Foreign Exchange as a Service), a solution that allows institutional clients to incorporate foreign exchange services directly into their platforms. The solution, which offers competitive rates, real-time dollar availability, and rapid withdrawals, is designed for financial institutions, fintechs, and payment providers looking for speed and cost savings in their operations. Bitso also launched Pay with Bitso, a crypto payment solution that lets retailers accept digital assets with rapid settlement in fiat or stablecoins. The platform bridges traditional and digital payment systems while ensuring regulatory compliance. Argentina expands tokenisation framework with new CNV resolution The National Securities Commission of Argentina (CNV) has approved General Resolution No. 1081, which expands the country’s Tokenisation Regime to encompass digital representations of listed shares (including dual-listed shares), corporate bonds, and Argentine Deposit Certificates (CEDEAR). This is the second phase of a regulatory process that began in June 2025 with Resolution No. 1069, which initially permitted the tokenisation of certain real-world assets under a controlled innovation framework. By broadening the scope to include listed securities, Argentina positions itself at the forefront of regulatory innovation in Latin America, aiming to improve legal clarity for both issuers and investors. The resolution incorporates feedback from a public consultation and introduces significant updates. These include allowing Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to act as depositors with the Central Securities Depository and recognizing investors’ right to switch between digital and traditional representations at any time. By granting functional equivalence to tokenised securities, the CNV assures that these digital instruments meet high security, traceability, and verifiability standards. This extension aligns Argentina with worldwide trends, drawing on examples from Brazil and the European Union, as well as El Salvador’s pioneering digital assets law. El Dorado expands to Bolivia to boost stablecoin adoption El Dorado, a Latin American peer-to-peer stablecoin payments app, has announced its formal arrival in Bolivia as part of its objective to provide digital alternatives during dollar shortages and to increase financial inclusion in the region. The site, which is already available in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Panama, Paraguay, and Peru, allows users to purchase and sell USDT in bolivianos using over 70 different payment methods such as Yape, Mercado Pago, Pix, and bank transfers. Bolivia is identified as a critical market by the corporation due to its increasing banking sector and the necessity for dependable alternatives to currency instability and limited access to foreign exchange. In its first year of operation, the app, which received funding from Coinbase Ventures and Berkeley Skydeck after a successful seed round, had over 200,000 users and one million transactions. To become the “SuperApp” of stablecoin payments in Latin America, El Dorado intends to onboard a large number of Bolivian users by the end of 2025. Its interoperability with dozens of payment processors and wallets is marketed as a key advantage, allowing for quick money transfers and lowering obstacles for users across the region.

Popular crypto proponent JackTheRippler brought this to the knowledge of XRP holders in a new post on X. In his post, he described Ripple Payments as “Liquidity on Demand,” linking the feature to XRP . The focus of the announcement is on the availability of a public demo, giving a clearer view of Ripple’s payment solution and how it positions itself in the broader cross-border settlement landscape. The tweet does not indicate when the service may be fully launched, but frames the demo as a live showcase of its functionality. BREAKING: @Ripple has dropped a demo of “Ripple Payments” on their site! Ripple Payments is “Liquidity on Demand” —> #XRP pic.twitter.com/NSCA3QEWoM — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) August 30, 2025 Features Displayed in the Demo The attached images provide a walkthrough of the Ripple Payments interface. The dashboard welcomes the user and shows account balances in two categories: one in USD and another in Ripple USD (RLUSD). Transaction history is displayed underneath with timestamps and beneficiaries, confirming that the system is built to handle multiple outgoing payments. On the right side of the screen, an exchange-rate section is visible, showing real-time conversion data. The example in the demo indicates that 1 USD equals 19.2400 Mexican Pesos, with a timestamp reflecting when the rate was captured. Additional navigation features include options for global payments, stablecoin payouts, reports, and beneficiary management. A section is also visible with links for contacting Ripple’s support team and accessing documentation. Stablecoin Conversion and Fiat Settlement The walkthrough overlay in the demo explains the payment flow. It states that Ripple Payments allows conversion from stablecoins to fiat, followed by direct payout to end beneficiaries in more than fifty markets through a single integrated solution. In the example presented, Ripple USD (RLUSD) is off-ramped and converted, with the final step being the delivery of GBP to a beneficiary in the United Kingdom. The overlay indicates that this is part of an eight-step product demonstration, designed to illustrate the process from funding to settlement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Positioning of Ripple Payments In his post, JackTheRippler emphasized that Ripple Payments represents “Liquidity on Demand,” a description directly tied to XRP. This suggests that the product aims to highlight liquidity access and settlement efficiency as its core functions. The way the demo is presented places stablecoin off-ramping and fiat delivery at the center of its offering, with XRP identified as the underlying asset connected to the liquidity model. Community Comment Another user, X Finance Bull, added that “a demo release is always a good way to gauge adoption potential. Let’s see how institutions respond.” This statement points to institutional response as an important next step in determining the potential reach and usage of Ripple Payments once prospective users have reviewed the demo. The post from JackTheRippler and the demo images reveal Ripple’s focus on cross-border payments that combine stablecoin conversion with fiat delivery across multiple markets.

XRP holders became millionaires on the 2017 bull run. Dogecoin brought back the memory, awarding early investors huge gains in 2021. Today, investors are searching for the next coin to repeat that kind of breakout. With its presale success, innovative roadmap, and a launch price under $0.003, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is emerging as a frontrunner for those willing to stake $400 on the chance of catching lightning in a bottle again. Lessons From XRP 2017 and Dogecoin 2021 The stories of XRP and Dogecoin highlight two very different paths to success. XRP surged in 2017 as global banks and institutions began to test Ripple’s payment solutions. Despite pessimism, early investors watched the token rise from under a cent to over $3 in a few months, making it one of the cycle’s fastest-growing assets. Dogecoin’s 2021 run was different. A parody coin became a cultural revolution thanks to viral memes, Elon Musk’s tweets, and a devoted community. Casual holders became instant millionaires when the token rose from fractions of a cent to nearly $0.70. Both cases show skeptics underestimate, overlook, and disregard huge winners. Those who spotted the opportunity early captured life-changing gains. It is this playbook that investors are eyeing now with Little Pepe, a project blending meme appeal with genuine infrastructure. Little Pepe’s (LILPEPE) Presale Momentum Follows Similar Trend If there is one project dominating presale headlines in 2025, it’s Little Pepe . The token has already raised over $22 million across multiple sold-out stages. Despite being over 100% up from the initial price, its entry price is still at just $0.0021. Considering its official launch price of $0.003, early buyers are positioning themselves for a guaranteed uplift even before exchange listings. Community-driven energy has been a significant driver. A massive $777,000 giveaway has attracted attention across social media, while CoinMarketCap’s presale listing has boosted visibility to thousands of new investors daily. The hype has been matched with substance, whales are buying heavily into presale rounds, and retail traders are forming one of the fastest-growing meme communities of the year. Momentum like this is rare, and it’s often the earliest sign that a token could rise from obscurity to become the best crypto to buy now before it ever hits major exchanges. However, early investors are positioning for something bigger than the presale hype. Beyond Hype: LILPEPE’s Layer 2 Advantage Unlike Dogecoin, which relies primarily on community and narrative, Little Pepe lies in real technology. The project is building a dedicated Layer 2 blockchain for meme tokens and their ecosystems. This “meme-only chain” will host features like sniper-bot protection, zero-tax trading, and its launchpad for incubating future meme projects. Security is also a priority. The project has undergone a CertiK audit, giving investors confidence that contracts are sound and resistant to the risks plaguing lesser meme tokens. This mix of meme culture with infrastructure sets Little Pepe apart from the dozens of copycat coins that rise and fall in every cycle. For investors, it’s not just hype. It’s a meme coin positioning itself as a cultural bet and a functional platform. It is a dual identity that could extend its longevity and upside beyond a typical pump-and-dump meme rally. The $400 Bet That Could Replicate XRP and DOGE Analysts argue that a modest $400 entry into Little Pepe today could mirror what early believers in XRP and Dogecoin experienced. The reasons are compelling: Microcap Advantage: At under $0.003, LILPEPE is still in the earliest stages of its growth curve. Detailed Roadmap: A clear rollout of the Layer 2 chain, meme launchpad, and presale-to-exchange transition builds investor confidence. Community Power: A swelling fanbase and viral campaigns echo the social energy that propelled Dogecoin. Meme Appeal + Utility: The frog branding taps into crypto’s humor culture, while the tech side ensures relevance beyond short-term hype. If the roadmap works as projected, LILPEPE might offer a 50x–100x return within a year, especially if exchange listings match bull market momentum. Same life-changing surge XRP holders saw in 2017 and Dogecoin holders in 2021. A $400 bet today might increase to $20,000–$40,000. Positioning for the Next Bull Cycle In 2025, searching for the best crypto to buy now is not about chasing yesterday’s winners. It’s about identifying tomorrow’s breakout. With its blend of presale traction, technological backbone, and meme-fueled energy, Little Pepe is positioning itself as that breakout. History suggests the payoff could be extraordinary for those willing to take the bet.

The project’s presale token price is at $0.035 in phase 6. Experts assert that the new token can explode with phenomenal gains in the coming months. It will increase by 14.29% to $0.04 in phase 7. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $15.15 million and has been supported by more than 15,800 investors. While XRP remains in the spotlight for its regulatory milestones and growing cross-border payment integrations, Mutuum Finance is steadily carving a niche in decentralized finance, drawing both seasoned traders and early-stage investors into the conversation. XRP Price Prediction: Steady Outlook Ahead XRP is trading around $3.00 today, showing stable movement in recent sessions. Analysts suggest that while Ripple continues to expand its cross-border payment use cases, significant gains, such as a rise toward $5–$8, will likely depend on broader market recovery and regulatory clarity expected in 2025–2026. In the meantime, other emerging projects like Mutuum Finance are beginning to attract attention alongside established players. Investors FOMO into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stage 6 Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently priced at $0.035 in presale stage 6. More than $15.1 million have been collected and more than 15800 early investors are buying tokens. Token price in Presale Stage 7 will be $0.04, which is a 14.3% increase from Stage 6. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has announced its Official Bug Bounty Program through CertiK. Its users who have the highest chances of receiving a share of the program’s reward of $50,000 USDT if they are able to spot possible bugs in the project. Its bounty program is created to provide equal security to all types of vulnerabilities. The program is categorized into four classes of severity; i.e., major, minor, low, and critical. Mutuum Finance Announces Huge Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also initiated a $100,000 giveaway , where the users will be rewarded in the form of $10,000 MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building an overcollateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The project is also audited and verified by CertiK. The Future of Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance DeFi protocol enables decentralized lending where lenders retain complete ownership of the assets while lending. Passive income for lenders and borrowers are auto-credited and accessed, respectively, by collateralizing diversified assets while lending. Systematic rate adjustment is pre-set by the system for optimal capital structure and ecosystem sustainability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers users a double-lending opportunity with first-rate flexibility using Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model is smart contract-powered to control lending pools that dynamically adjust interest levels in precise parallel with the market. Lenders are offered secured returns, while the borrowers are provided secure options on borrowing capital on loan. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) eliminates the intermediaries as it enables borrowing parties to interact directly with lending agents. High-risk investments like meme coins require the type of fully decentralized infrastructure that enables users to be in complete control. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already attracted more than $15.15 million and 15,800 early investors at its $0.035 presale stage. With a scheduled increase to $0.04 in Stage 7, its dual lending model, CertiK-certified security, and upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin are fueling expectations of significant growth potential. Investors who act before the next presale jump position themselves ahead of the curve as momentum builds toward its projected 40x ROI.

Batch by batch, as excitement grew around its hybrid blockchain-DAG design and scalable ecosystem, the project steadily climbed through each pricing stage. Fast-forward to now, and BlockDAG’s token price has reached $0.03 in Batch 30 , marking a staggering 2,900% return for early-stage buyers. These aren’t just hypothetical gains. The growth has been transparent and verifiable through the project’s live Dashboard V4 , which showcases every presale transaction, bonus structure, and mining simulation in real-time. But the story doesn’t stop at early success. In fact, BlockDAG has timed its next major wave of attention around a global event that puts it on center stage. Token2049 Singapore: Where the Spotlight Shifts to BlockDAG BlockDAG is making a definitive appearance at Token2049 Singapore , Asia’s flagship Web3 event taking place October 1–2, 2025 at Marina Bay Sands. With over 25,000 attendees , 7,000+ companies , 300+ speakers , and 500+ exhibitors , it’s the one venue where only the most ambitious projects go to make waves. To mark its presence, BlockDAG is offering a 2049% presale bonus until October 1. This bonus is more than just symbolic. It reflects the same spirit that rewarded early adopters and now opens the door for new investors who missed the early batches to still secure outsized benefits. Where other projects might slow down after reaching $387M in presale funding, BlockDAG is doubling down — using Token2049 to showcase its roadmap, technology, and community expansion to the global stage. Missed 2,900%? Here’s Why the 2049% Bonus Still Matters The most common sentiment among investors who discovered BlockDAG late is regret — regret over not entering at $0.001. But with the 2049% Token2049 bonus now active, the upside remains substantial even at the current $0.03 level. How? The bonus structure allows new buyers to earn significantly more BDAG per dollar than standard allocation. While the launch price is projected at $0.05 , the effective ROI for buyers at current prices—especially those who capitalize on bonus allocations—still sits between 66% and 100%+ . Moreover, this isn’t a one-time pump. BlockDAG has backed its growth with a robust utility framework: from mining rewards through the X1 mobile app and X10–X100 plug-and-play rigs , to the EVM-compatible ecosystem with dApp potential, and gamified elements like Buyer Battles that reward top purchasers daily. In essence, the 2049% bonus is a calculated continuation of BlockDAG’s incentive model — not a marketing gimmick, but a bridge from early ROI to sustained opportunity. $387M Raised and Counting: This Presale Isn’t Slowing Down With the presale now crossing $387 million , BlockDAG has already eclipsed legendary early crypto projects like Filecoin ($233M) and Tezos ($232M) . It is now gunning for its final cap of $600M , positioning itself as one of the most successful crypto fundraising campaigns in history. This surge in presale capital hasn’t just gone toward hype. Funds are being strategically allocated to power: CEX listings on 20+ exchanges , including several major U.S. platforms Mining infrastructure expansion , including firmware upgrades, manufacturing scale, and delivery pipelines Liquidity deployment , ensuring low slippage and tight spreads from day one Developer grants , to onboard dApps into its EVM-compatible ecosystem Physical and digital marketing , including partnerships with sports brands like Inter Milan and Seattle Seawolves All these are traceable and verifiable through the project’s roadmap and dashboard updates — an uncommon level of transparency in a crypto market where speculation often overshadows fundamentals. BlockDAG’s choice to anchor its next phase around Token2049 isn’t coincidental. This conference represents the convergence of capital, community, and credibility in Web3. Projects that succeed at Token2049 tend to accelerate both visibility and partnerships — which BlockDAG is well-positioned to do with its momentum already established. The Token2049 bonus isn’t just about buying more BDAG. It’s about entering at a pivotal moment where community traction, media attention, and real-world utility collide. The same way early investors saw exponential ROI through timely entry, today’s buyers have a window to ride the next expansion wave with stronger fundamentals and higher market confidence. Final Thoughts: The Circle Comes Full From a modest $0.001 to a confident $0.03 and over $387M raised, BlockDAG has proven its ability to deliver on every layer of crypto credibility — ROI, transparency, product, and community. Now, as it steps onto the Token2049 stage with a 2049% bonus , the project is offering new investors a chance to be part of its legacy. The early adopters wrote the first chapter. With this bonus, the next generation of BDAG holders has the tools to write the next one — possibly with even more upside as real-world integration and listings begin. In crypto, timing is everything. And right now, all signs point to BlockDAG being exactly on time.

While it looked set to make a strong comeback, jumping back above $113,000 on Thursday, the flagship cryptocurrency is now struggling around a new multi-week low of around $107,500. This recent price decline has sparked conversations around the BTC bull cycle potentially reaching its peak, especially considering the market is currently dominated by euphoria. However, a crypto analyst on social media platform X has come forward with an audacious prediction for the Bitcoin price over the next few months. BTC To Reach Cycle Top In December 2025: Analyst Crypto analyst Frank Fetter—after a renowned American economist—took to the X platform to submit an exciting and bold prediction for the price of Bitcoin in the remaining months of 2025. According to the online pundit, the Bitcoin price could reach as high as $256,000 in this cycle. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Rally Over? Analyst Forecasts Drop To $94,000 If This Level Doesn’t Hold This positive projection is based on the Bitcoin Index Performance Since Cycle Low, which assesses the performance of the BTC price in various 4-year cycle periods. This metric reflects the cyclical nature of the largest cryptocurrency market. While many reports are predicting the cycle theory to be dead, this particular chart shows that Bitcoin has yet to even complete the current bull cycle in the first place. As observed in the highlighted chart, the Bitcoin Index Performance data suggests that the Bitcoin price, in the past two cycles (2015 – 2018 and 2018 – 2022), reached its peak around 1,100 days after hitting its cycle low. The premier cryptocurrency grew by 110x and 21x in these 2015 – 2018 and 2018 – 2022 cycles, respectively. With the market leader currently up by over 7x from its last cycle low and around 100 days away from the historical top, Fetter projects the price of BTC to reach as high as $256,000 based on the 2018 – 2022 fractal. If this history does repeat itself, it means the flagship cryptocurrency would have grown 16x by the end of this cycle. According to the analyst, the Bitcoin price could reach this target as early as December 3, 2025. This potential leg up would represent an almost 140% move from the current price point for BTC. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands around $108,301, reflecting a nearly 4% decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is down by more than 7% is the last seven days. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Stop $183K?

What Elon Musk Knows About The Dogecoin Treasury? In an August 29 report, Fortune revealed that Alex Spiro, a lawyer who has represented popular figures like Elon Musk, Jay-Z, and Alec Baldwin, is set to chair a public company looking to invest in Dogecoin. According to unnamed sources, this digital asset treasury intends to raise at least $200 million to purchase the largest meme coin by market capitalization. The initiative is being pitched to investors as a Dogecoin public vehicle with the endorsement of House of Doge in order to boost its legitimacy. House of Doge, launched in early 2025 by the Dogecoin Foundation, is the official corporate entity behind the meme coin, burdened with its development and promotion. The Fortune report revealed that the Dogecoin treasury is still at the pitch stage and didn’t provide any details on the structure or potential launch date of the public vehicle. While his personal lawyer Spiro has been listed as chairman of the public company in an investor pitch, there has been no indication of Musk’s potential role in the initiative. It is worth noting that Musk has been a vocal supporter of DOGE as far back as 2019, claiming the meme coin to be his favorite cryptocurrency. Showing his support for the meme token, the world’s richest man designed a DOGE-only payment system for his electric vehicle company, Tesla. Musk’s posts about Dogecoin have always caused the token’s price to move, leading to a scrutiny of his market influence by investors and the crypto community. In 2022, the Tesla founder was defended in court by Spiro after investors sued him for allegedly manipulating the market. As of this writing, the price of DOGE stands at around $0.2134, reflecting an over 3% decline in the past 24 hours. The meme coin is down by nearly 10% in the last seven days. Crypto Treasury Firms Taking Center Stage? Crypto treasury firms have continued to gain popularity in the digital asset industry in 2025, with new public vehicles popping up over the past few months. These publicly-traded companies hold digital assets on their books, offering their shareholders exposure to the crypto assets without directly owning them. In July 2025, Bit Origin revealed that it had raised around $500 million in loans and equity to build its DOGE treasury. This initiative made it the first publicly traded company in the United States to openly make Dogecoin the core asset on its balance sheet.",Dogecoin|Crypto Treasury Company|Doge|dogecoin|dogeusdt|Elon Musk,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-30 16:00:45

Traders are watching closely to see whether this pause leads to renewed strength or further decline. Against this backdrop, EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), a popular crypto analyst, has shared an updated chart highlighting where XRP may be headed next. XRP Price Structure and Key Levels The chart, based on a long-term logarithmic regression channel, illustrates XRP’s historical price cycles and highlights the asset’s tendency to revisit upper trend levels after extended consolidation . While short-term volatility has pushed the token down to the $2.8 range, the analysis shows that the broader structure remains intact. XRP entered the current consolidation phase after recording an all-time high of $3.65 in July . It has consolidated around $3 for some time. This recent decline has shaken the confidence of many investors who hoped the asset would repeat its performance from July. The horizontal white zone marked on the chart between $3 and $3.5 represents a critical resistance band. This level capped the digital asset’s growth since January, and XRP remained below it until July. While the surge in July did not sustain momentum above this resistance zone, the chart shows that the consolation phase is not over. #XRP – Consolidation Before The Next BIG MOVE: https://t.co/okzo7AkBHG pic.twitter.com/vrIkrqZNcu — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 30, 2025 XRP Ascending Channel and Price Targets EGRAG CRYPTO’s chart shows XRP trading within an ascending channel, with multiple channels above leading to higher targets. XRP has consistently oscillated within these channels, with major bull market peaks aligning with the upper green bands, but staying below the resistance zone. Another sustained climb above this resistance could open the door to a price discovery phase and significant growth for the digital asset. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This update shares the same target range of $7 to $27, which the analyst set yesterday . The chart also marks a notable time point on September 29, 2025, indicating a potential decision window for whether XRP consolidates or breaks upward toward these targets. At the current price of $2.78, XRP is down almost 7.6% from yesterday’s highs. While this decline has discouraged some investors, EGRAG CRYPTO’s post confirms that the asset is consolidating. For the near term, XRP must first re-establish and hold above the $3 threshold. All investors have to do is watch for a decisive breakout above the resistance zone, as a major rally could begin shortly.

The U.S.-based bitcoin financial services firm, which runs brokerage and mining operations and publishes research, released a Sankey-style flow infographic dated Aug. 25 in a post on X . In this layout, outflows are shown on the left, inflows on the right, and the thickness of each line represents the size of the net daily movement. River defines “businesses” broadly. The category combines bitcoin treasury companies — firms such as Strategy that publicly hold BTC — with conventional companies that keep bitcoin on their balance sheets. Based on public filings, custodial address tagging and its own heuristics, River estimates that about 1,755 BTC per day flow into business-controlled wallets. By comparison, River calculates new miner supply at about 450 BTC per day in 2025. That figure reflects the April 2024 halving, which cut the block subsidy to 3.125 BTC per block. With bitcoin blocks averaging one every 10 minutes — about 144 per day — the result is roughly 450 BTC in new issuance daily, though the exact number fluctuates slightly as block times vary. That math is the basis for River’s claim that companies are absorbing bitcoin at nearly four times the rate it is mined. The infographic shows other large institutional inflows as well. Funds and ETFs account for about 1,430 BTC/day in net inflows, which further boosts total absorption compared with new issuance. Smaller streams go to “other” entities (about 411 BTC/day) and governments (about 39 BTC/day). River also records a small but steady flow into “lost bitcoin” (about 14 BTC/day), representing coins that the firm judges to be permanently inaccessible, such as through key loss. On the other side of the ledger, individuals appear as the largest net outflow at about –3,196 BTC/day. River stresses that this does not necessarily mean retail investors are dumping coins. Rather, it reflects bitcoin moving from addresses the firm classifies as individual-held into those it tags as institutional. River says the takeaway is simple: when inflows to businesses and funds exceed new issuance from miners, available supply tightens. Still, the firm cautions that the infographic should be read carefully. First, the figures are estimates, not an exact census of the blockchain. River relies on a mix of wallet tagging, public disclosures and external databases, which may miss some holdings or misclassify certain addresses. Second, net inflows do not always equal direct spot buying. A business wallet showing +1,755 BTC per day could reflect OTC transactions, custodial transfers or treasury reshuffling, not just exchange purchases. For readers unfamiliar with flow diagrams, the point is this: the lines show where coins are ending up on balance, not every trade or transfer in the system. If more coins consistently end up in business, fund and government wallets than miners are producing, River argues that institutions are tightening supply at the margin. River’s snapshot is not a price forecast, but it illustrates how ownership patterns may be shifting. If businesses and funds continue to absorb more than miners produce, the firm argues, institutions could play a larger role in shaping bitcoin’s supply dynamics.",Markets|Bitcoin Mining|Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Asset|btc|News,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|RESEARCH|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-30 16:07:11

Is a Decline on the Horizon? Experts Weigh In,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-the-red-september-a-myth-or-reality-for-bitcoin-and-altcoins-is-a-decline-on-the-horizon-experts-weigh-in/,"While Bitcoin has been trending sideways in the last days of August, cryptocurrency investors are preparing for the possibility of an impending decline, as they do every year during this period. This phenomenon, known in the market as “Red September” or the “September Effect,” has been observed in traditional markets for nearly a century. Since 1928, the S&P 500 index has recorded an average negative return in September, making it the only consistently negative month in the index's history. The picture is even bleaker for Bitcoin: since 2013, Bitcoin has lost an average of 3.77% of its value in September, experiencing eight sharp declines, according to Coinglass data. FinchTrade consultant Yuri Berg explains this as follows: “September has become more of a psychological experiment than a market anomaly. A selling wave is being generated by expectations rather than historical data.” This phenomenon stems from structural market behavior. Many investment funds close their fiscal year in September, divesting losing positions for tax reasons, and rebalancing their portfolios. With the summer holidays over, investors return to their trading desks to review their positions after a period of low liquidity. Furthermore, increased bond issuance after September accelerates the exit from stocks and risky assets. On the crypto side, these effects are even more magnified. Bitcoin, which trades 24/7, lacks circuit breakers during sell-offs, and its smaller market cap makes it vulnerable to large investor movements. Related News: How Will Bitcoin (BTC) Reach $1 Million? Expert Analyst Explains What It Takes September 2025 is approaching with mixed signals. The Fed has delivered positive messages, with markets pricing in the possibility of another interest rate cut for its September 18 meeting. Meanwhile, core inflation remains resilient at 3.1%, while two active wars are disrupting global supply chains. InFlux Technologies CEO Daniel Keller describes this scenario as a “perfect storm”: “There are two major conflict zones in Europe and the Middle East, affecting critical supply chains. Furthermore, the US has entered a trade war with many of its allies. This geopolitical environment increases the risk of a significant decline for Bitcoin in September.” However, DYOR CEO Ben Kurland thinks differently: “'Red September' is more of a myth. Historically, September has looked weak because of portfolio rebalancing, waning retail investor interest, and macro uncertainties. But that was true when Bitcoin was smaller. Today, liquidity is the real determining factor.” Keller advises investors to closely monitor fear and greed indices: “Gauge market sentiment in the coming weeks is critical. If the indices rise, it may be necessary to wait; if they fall, it may be necessary to prepare for selling.” *This is not investment advice.

Once-dominant names like Dogecoin and PENGU are losing momentum, sparking new debates about the next major winner. Industry watchers are turning their gaze toward XYZ, eager to see if this remarkable rally will rewrite the story of digital assets. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality , the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner’s podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price : $0.0001 Price Now : $0.005 Next Stage : $0.01 Final Presale Price : $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) Source: TradingView Six months ago few watched PENGU. Since then the token jumped 242.39%. The last month has been rough with a 21.25% slide and the past week shaved another 1.65%. Price now bounces between $0.0295 and $0.0379 as traders weigh the big long term gain against recent selling. Short term average stands near $0.0302 while the 100 day line sits at $0.0307. Both sit inside the current band, showing balance. The strength gauge reads 45, neither hot nor cold. Momentum bar is slightly negative and the stochastic near 39 hints that sellers are tiring but buyers have not rushed in. If demand returns, PENGU could reach the first ceiling at $0.0416, about 20% above the middle of the band. A clear break can carry price to $0.0499, roughly 45% higher. Failure to hold the $0.029 zone puts the $0.0249 floor in view, a 25% fall. Deeper panic could drag it to $0.0165. Given the mixed signals, sideways to mild upside looks more likely in the near term while the long term trend stays up. Dogecoin (DOGE) Source: TradingView Dogecoin sits between $0.21 and $0.25 this morning. A neat 2.5% rise over the last 7 days clashes with a 1.6% dip for the month, showing mixed mood. Yet the coin still hangs on to a 6.7% gain over the past 6 months, proving steady upward grind when zoomed out. Both the 10-day and 100-day moving averages hug $0.22, signaling tight action. Momentum tools mirror that calm; RSI rests at 44.8, near neutral, while a 27.2 stochastic hints sellers may be spent. The MACD line hovers just below zero, neither bullish nor grim. Taken together, DOGE is coiled and waiting for a shove. If buyers clear the nearest ceiling at $0.27, the door swings to $0.30, about 20% above todays midpoint. A close there could flip mood and draw fresh cash. Slip under $0.19, though, and $0.15 looms, nearly 30% lower, erasing half-year progress. Indicators lean slightly oversold, so odds favor an upward test, but the range rules until volume wakes. Conclusion PENGU and DOGE remain solid picks, yet the all-sport memecoin XYZVerse stands apart, merging sports passion with memes, eyeing 20,000% gains and rallying community power during the 2025 surge.

Fresh data from whale-tracking platform Lookonchain revealed a series of high-value trades. The investor’s activity has stood out as a clear sign of confidence in Ethereum at a time when Bitcoin is showing signs of weakness. Bitcoin Whale Ramps Up Ethereum Buying Spree After Brief Pause In just 12 hours, the billionaire reportedly sold 2,000 BTC, worth $221 million, and used the proceeds to purchase 49,850 ETH valued at $219 million on the spot market. These moves have brought his total Ethereum holdings to 691,358 ETH, worth about $3 billion. All of this accumulation has taken place within only two weeks. This makes it one of the most significant capital reallocations from Bitcoin to Ethereum in recent memory. For two days, the billionaire briefly paused his buying spree. However, soon after, he returned to the market with even more aggressive trades. He deposited 1,000 BTC, worth around $108 million, to Hyperliquid, a crypto exchange, and sold the coins. The investor then immediately used the proceeds to purchase Ethereum on the spot market. During this period, he also closed a leveraged long position of 96,452 ETH, worth $433 million, securing a $2.6 million profit. Instead of taking the profit out of the market, he reinvested it back into spot ETH, showing strong faith in the asset. Whale Doubles Bet Big on Ethereum as Bitcoin Slides In the last 14 hours alone, the whale increased his pace even further. He sold 3,968 BTC valued at $437 million and bought 96,531 ETH worth $443 million. This continuous cycle of selling Bitcoin and buying Ethereum suggests a clear strategy. It shows the billionaire is not just diversifying but making a deliberate shift in preference toward Ethereum. While the whale is moving capital, Bitcoin itself has been under pressure. Over the past week, the price of BTC has dropped by 5.96%, falling from $115,560 to $108,455, down by 0.70% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin Faces Doubts as Ethereum Gains Investor Momentum Bitcoin’s downward trajectory comes as the flagship crypto is facing criticism from doubters who never believed in its potential and success. Right from its early days, many people and institutions have written Bitcoin off , declaring it “dead.” Also, financial experts had said the digital coin could remain ultra-volatile due to its limited tradability. In contrast, Ethereum, long seen as Bitcoin’s closest rival, is increasingly attracting interest from major investors . This is because of its broad use in decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and token ecosystems. ETH’s price has grown significantly in the last few weeks, with the coin registering multiple highs in a short period.

In an era where meme tokens regularly defy expectations, this one not only carries speculative appeal but also structural credibility that suggests it may be poised to replicate Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) historic ascent. Analysts have started speculating about meme coins with real breakout potential over the next year, and new entrants are drawing speculative attention. One recent meme coin has launched a narrative of transformative potential rooted in a blend of tech innovation and viral culture. Among these, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has quietly made headway with presale success and a layered-value proposition that may distinguish it from legacy meme tokens. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): More Than Just a Meme Little Pepe enters the scene not merely as another token with meme energy, but as a project layered with foundational mechanics. Its presale is advancing through stage 12, currently priced at $0.0021, and has generated over $22.6 million in funding by selling more than 14.3 billion tokens. Analysts suggest strong upside potential under favourable market conditions, estimating that LILPEPE may reach $0.50 by late 2025 and possibly $1 by mid-2026. What makes Little Pepe more compelling is its positioning as a Layer 2, EVM-structured meme chain. This design addresses the chronic pain points of Ethereum—high fees and network congestion—while offering meme-native utility, staking rewards, zero-tax mechanics, and protections against sniper bots. The convergence of these features suggests a thoughtful infrastructure that goes beyond superficial virality. Comparing Shiba Inu and LILPEPE Through a Speculative Lens Shiba Inu’s rise was emblematic of meme power; however, reaching $1 appears structurally unattainable due to its enormous token supply and limited protocol utility. It remains an influential token, but its path to the upper cent regime is constrained. Little Pepe, by contrast, could embody the next wave of meme-driven innovation. If community momentum, technical delivery, and tokenomics align, its presale valuation points toward significant growth. Projects that embed use-case frameworks and ecosystem support tend to experience more sustainable interest, which could heighten Little Pepe’s potential to follow in Shiba Inu’s footsteps, though on a more modern, structurally sound foundation. A Narrative of Mixing Meme Culture with Architecture It is rare to find an emerging meme token that brings together both high-energy hype and technical substance. Little Pepe’s architecture aligns with recent academic findings, which suggest that meme tokens with better liquidity transparency and structural integrity tend to fare more resiliently during volatility. LILPEPE’s presale performance and token design support its potential rally to $1 by 2026. This figure may appear ambitious, yet it is grounded in both investor enthusiasm and a pragmatic outlook that sees the potential in the Little Pepe innovation. Risk Considerations No pricing outcome is guaranteed. The financial market and meme coins can be susceptible to fluctuation in sentiment. Even so, Little Pepe embodies a bold but reasoned play—combining meme community culture, presale success, and Layer 2 capabilities. If market cycles align, LILPEPE could become the meme coin that achieves widespread recognition similar to Shiba Inu, but with a foundation that supports long-term sustainability. Beyond following in SHIB’s footsteps, LILPEPE might just be the new face for meme coin moonshots. Final Thoughts Although the meme coin sector is a booming corner of the cryptocurrency market, few meme coins offer a credible case for reaching $1 by 2026. Many established names lack structural mechanics to scale that high. Little Pepe, however, presents a speculative yet plausible path through its presale traction and ecosystem design. Little Pepe may yet stand as the meme coin of this cycle—one that blends cultural virality with blockchain utility. For those intrigued by the convergence of memetic appeal and upside potential, exploring the presale or joining the community may offer a way to stay informed as LILPEPE’s journey unfolds.

However, investors are quietly positioning for promising coins with potential to replicate Cardano’s (ADA) legendary 35x surge this cycle. Among them, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , Cronos (CRO), and Pudgy Penguin (PENGU) stand out as some of the best coins to buy now for those eyeing outsized gains. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Little Pepe has quickly become one of the most talked-about meme coins of the year, and its presale numbers prove why. The project has already raised over $22.5 million and sold over 14.3 billion tokens across its first 12 stages, with the current price at $0.0021, more than 100% above its Stage 1 entry point. For early backers, that’s just the beginning of what could mirror ADA’s early trajectory. What makes Little Pepe different is that it’s not just another meme coin chasing hype. The team has introduced a sniper-bot-resistant EVM chain, ensuring fair access for retail traders and a zero tax structure for buying and selling. On top of that, it plans to launch a meme-only Launchpad, creating a pipeline for new viral tokens that could boost the brand’s visibility across the market. The project also benefits from guidance by anonymous experts who have already been behind some of the most successful meme coins in history. With confirmed tier-1 exchange listings at launch and plans for expansion into even bigger exchanges later, LILPEPE is positioning itself for massive liquidity and exposure right out of the gate. If Cardano in 2017 was the coin that shocked the market with a 3,500% rally, Little Pepe has the foundation to do the same in 2025. With its hype and genuine utility mix, the coin could easily be the next to replicate the legendary run. Cronos (CRO) Cronos has re-entered the spotlight after a powerful 76% rally over the past month. Trading around $0.14 with a market cap of $4.6 billion, CRO is benefiting from a mix of technical upgrades and renewed institutional speculation. Cronos Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko The network’s POS Chain v6 upgrade introduced Cosmos SDK integration and improved transaction efficiency, increasing DeFi participation. Total value locked climbed to $710 million in July, underscoring the chain’s improving fundamentals. On top of that, speculation about a CRO-based ETF has fueled further optimism, hinting at potential institutional inflows. Technically, CRO is flashing bullish signals with a golden cross and patterns suggesting a possible push toward $0.20. While still far below its 2021 peak of $0.97, the token has carved out a strong support base, attracting both retail and long-term stakeholders. With momentum returning to mid-cap altcoins, Cronos looks set to extend its recovery into the final months of 2025. Pudgy Penguin (PENGU) The Pudgy Penguins token has pulled back from its recent peak near $0.047, now consolidating around $0.031, but analysts argue this is a healthy correction within a larger bullish setup. Support at $0.025 is being closely watched, and if it holds, PENGU could have a strong foundation for its next leg upward. PENGU Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Despite short-term volatility, institutional interest in Pudgy Penguins is quietly building. Nasdaq-listed BTCS Inc. recently added Pudgy Penguin NFTs to its corporate treasury, signaling that serious players see long-term potential in the ecosystem. With substantial brand expansion in Asia and merchandise-driven growth, PENGU is attracting attention beyond the NFT-native crowd. With digital and physical markets converging, the Pudgy Penguins brand has a unique advantage: cultural relevance. With token adoption and additional institutional products, PENGU might grow from a specialized NFT spin-off to a popular crypto asset like ADA. Final thoughts Cardano’s 2017 rally proved that transformative gains come from projects combining strong communities with real-world adoption. Little Pepe, Cronos, and Pudgy Penguin demonstrate those ingredients differently in today’s market. Of the three, Little Pepe stands out as the pure ground-floor play. Its presale momentum, innovative chain, and upcoming CEX listings give investors the rare chance to buy into a potential 100x token before it even launches. For those searching for the best coins to buy now, missing this window could mean missing the next ADA-style success story. Join the Little Pepe presale today and secure your position before launch.

Early investors watched as fortunes increased as meme-fueled virality, surprise retail cash infusions, and influencer frenzy came together in a perfect storm. However, DOGE currently trades at $0.239, a far cry from its ATH. This has shifted attention to Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , and with good reason. LILPEPE has advanced to Stage 12 of its presale at $0.0021, already about 60% above its starting level, with more than $22.4 million raised and nothing less than 14.6 billion tokens sold ahead of schedule. If momentum persists, this setup may echo earlier meme breakouts. Dogecoin’s 2021 rally still echoes, but lightning may not strike twice DOGE Weekly Price Chart: CoinMarketCap Dogecoin’s surge from fractions of a cent to a peak near $0.73 was a perfect storm: relentless memes, celebrity nods, and retail coordination. Since then, DOGE has struggled to revisit that peak. Analysts frequently cite an infinite supply, limited utility, and slower cadence of upgrades as structural headwinds. None of that erases DOGE’s cultural power. Still, the outsized upside could be harder to replicate from its current base, opening space for a leaner, earlier-stage contender to capture the meme bid. Over $22.6 million raised, presale demand accelerates The current Stage 12 price of $0.0021 places LILPEPE at a compelling entry for those seeking asymmetric exposure. At a planned listing price of $0.003, Stage 12 participants could see roughly 43% uplifts at the first exchange print alone, purely on mechanics. This underscores disciplined, tiered pricing that may reward early conviction if liquidity and listings arrive as expected. The project’s rapid advance through prior stages and the ahead-of-schedule rise indicate sticky community interest rather than one-off hype. Built for speed, scale, and fair access Beyond memes, Little Pepe’s technical posture is central to the thesis that this meme coin could become this cycle’s Dogecoin and flip with 18,400% gains. LILPEPE is building on a custom Layer-2, aiming for low fees, high throughput, and zero-tax trading to reduce friction. Integrated sniper-bot protections are expected to level the playing field at launch, a pain point that has undermined many meme token debuts. These design choices could translate into deeper liquidity, healthier price discovery, and more sustainable participation if activity scales. Security, access, and community flywheel Credibility matters. Having more than one third-party audit assigns high trust scores adds a layer of comfort. At the same time, the team’s emphasis on transparent mechanics suggests an operational maturity uncommon in early meme cycles. The $777,000 giveaway (ten winners at $77,000 in tokens) is catalyzing reach without promising financial outcomes, and confirmed listings with two centralized exchanges, plus a planned Tier-1, may accelerate visibility and on-ramp depth. If those rails arrive on time, the community flywheel could spin faster: more users, more pairs, more liquidity. Why this meme coin could become this cycle’s Dogecoin and Flip with 18,400% gains Past cycles show how emergent memes can compress multi-year growth into weeks when narrative, access, and liquidity click. LILPEPE’s case is straightforward: Stage-based pricing builds early scarcity; Layer-2 efficiency could improve UX; anti-sniper design may foster fairer distribution; audits and listings are expected to lower perceived risk; and a vocal community appears to be compounding reach. None guarantees outcomes, but it aligns with the conditions preceding prior meme-led runs. Under a strong market, a $750 stake could scale 18,500% quickly if adoption steepens, just as Dogecoin did when social velocity peaked. Conclusion: The setup investors are hunting For investors wondering if this meme coin could become the next Dogecoin and surge by 18,400%, the answer is that the necessary ingredients are present, but not guaranteed. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) combines presale traction, Layer-2 efficiencies, early exchange access, and security signaling that may support rapid repricing if liquidity thickens. Dogecoin’s legacy shows what’s possible; LILPEPE’s mechanics show how it might happen again.

50921635,569925,1756573208,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50921635.jpeg,Tether Loses Its Shine As Market Dominance Slides To 60%,https://bitcoinist.com/tether-loses-grip-stablecoin-dominance-drops-to-60/,"Based on recent figures, USDT dominance dropped to nearly 60% on August 29. It is the weakest hold Tether has had since March 2023. Nevertheless, USDT’s market cap is $168 billion and Circle’s USDC is $70.37 billion — both all-time highs. So the physical magnitude of the coins is greater, but the share of the market under each’s control is moving. Rising Competitors Make Inroads According to figures from DefiLlama , the first half of 2024 saw USDT dominance at approximately 70%. USDC then had around 18% of the market. That figure has risen and is now at approximately 30%. DAI, which used to capture about 3.5%, has dropped to 1.85%. These adjustments indicate money is transferring between stablecoins and not exiting the space. One New Token Stands Out Ethena’s USDe stands out. Introduced in December 2024, USDe already has 4.32% dominance with a market capitalization of $12.25 billion. That’s a quick ascent for a token that had just come out late last year. Trump-associated World Liberty Financial’s USD1 holds 0.88% market share. Data have revealed those figures together with the bigger market-cap numbers for USDT and USDC, which makes it clear: competition is increasing while total numbers rise. Regulatory Pressure Shapes Markets Tether’s market share loss isn’t merely about competitors. It has also refused to implement Europe’s MiCA stablecoin regulations, and exchanges deleted USDT from certain European listings. The US has enacted the GENIUS Act that includes new transparency obligations for stablecoin issuers. Those reforms make compliance an even larger consideration in who captures market share in the future. Investors Are Choosing Options Some institutions and traders appear to like stablecoins that are backed by issuers that commit to new regulations. Others are experimenting with newer tokens or models that offer alternative types of backing or schemes. That is one reason why USDC’s share is expanding rapidly and why smaller tokens such as USDe can acquire share rapidly. But the absolute expansion of USDT and USDC indicates the industry as a whole is growing even if its internal composition shifts. Market Share Is Not Static This phase should remind readers that market share can shift even when totals rise. USDT’s drop to 60% is meaningful because it marks the first time since March 2023 that dominance touched these levels. It also points to a market where compliance choices, product design, and fresh entrants all matter.

Though their recent performance shows the limits of their velocity, well-known projects like Sui and Litecoin continue to attract interest. While Litecoin’s projection indicates difficulties in maintaining relevance despite its legacy status, the Sui price decline casts uncertainty on long-term acceptance. Amid these concerns, BlockDAG has emerged as a presale powerhouse reshaping investor expectations. With $387 million raised, over 25 billion tokens sold, and a current price of $0.03 in Batch 30, the project has already delivered a 2900% ROI from its $0.001 launch. This blend of liquidity, adoption, and real world utility positions BlockDAG as the standout choice for investors seeking the best long term crypto opportunity in 2025. Sui Price Drop Tests Confidence in Adoption The recent Sui price drop reflects concerns over adoption. Trading near $3.47 with a $12.2B market cap and 3.51B tokens in circulation, Sui has strong daily volume above $1B but remains down 35% from its January 2025 peak of $5.30. Technically built for high performance smart contracts and parallel execution, Sui was once viewed as a promising Layer 1 alternative. Yet multiple volatility episodes and plateaued daily activity have dented confidence. Despite a robust ecosystem with DeFi TVL climbing from $200 million to over $1 billion and DEX volume setting highs, network metrics have not translated into sustained price momentum. Long term holders face a dilemma. Some retain exposure as a hedge on Sui’s technical potential, but many are drawn to higher momentum alternatives. This underscores a key point for long term crypto investors: even technically solid networks like Sui require consistent growth catalysts and adoption cycles to maintain valuation. Without that, Sui’s long term narrative, while credible, feels less compelling relative to faster growing presale projects. Litecoin Price Outlook: Safe Bet, Not a Moonshot The Litecoin price forecast reflects a project built on resilience but capped in growth potential. Currently trading around $112–$113, Litecoin holds a market capitalization near $8.6 billion with approximately 76.2 million tokens in circulation, about 91% of its 84 million maximum supply. Daily trading volumes sit between $470 million and $640 million. As one of the earliest Bitcoin derivatives, Litecoin provides faster block confirmation times of 3 minutes and low fees, making it a reliable payment rail. Despite this, long term forecasts anticipate steady appreciation, not explosive gains, due to its relatively mature ecosystem lacking the depth of newer blockchain platforms. Litecoin’s stability makes it attractive for conservative portfolios but less appealing to growth seekers. The best long term crypto opportunities now require visible adoption, ecosystem development, and robust liquidity to inspire confidence in future expansion. BlockDAG Presale Boom Redefines Growth in 2025 When it comes to chasing the next big opportunity in crypto, few projects are generating as much buzz as BlockDAG. Its presale has been nothing short of a phenomenon, raising over $387 million at a Batch 30 price of $0.03 and selling more than 25 billion tokens. Early backers who got in at just $0.001 are already sitting on gains of 2900%. This steady, batch-based system has not only delivered transparency but also ensured healthy liquidity, while a clear leadership structure with a CEO, CFO, and CSO gives the project strong governance and long-term credibility. On the tech front, BlockDAG blends WASM and EVM compatibility with a hybrid DAG plus Proof of Work design. This architecture supports up to 10,000 transactions per second, without compromising security, while also enabling cross environment development for Ethereum-based smart contracts and WASM applications. In plain terms: developers can build faster, safer, and with more flexibility something that positions BlockDAG as a true competitor in the Layer-1 landscape. Adoption numbers show the hype is backed by traction. The X1 mining app has already reached 3 million users. More than 19,000 mining rigs across the X10, X30, and X100 series have been distributed globally. And with 4,500 developers currently building 300+ decentralized apps, BlockDAG isn’t just promising utility, it’s already building it. Looking ahead, projections are bold but not without basis. With adoption, liquidity, and ecosystem depth scaling rapidly, scenarios suggest potential returns of 20,000x or even 30,000x after the mainnet launch For investors looking at 2025 and beyond, BlockDAG offers a mix that’s hard to ignore: strong leadership, cutting-edge technology, real world adoption, and cultural reach. That’s why many already consider it the best long term crypto play of the year. The Last Line The recent Sui price drop shows how volatility can erode long term confidence, while the Litecoin price forecast highlights the balance between stability and limited growth. Both projects remain important to the crypto landscape, yet their current trajectories fall short of delivering the kind of high return potential investors often seek. BlockDAG is charting a different path. At $0.03 in Batch 30, the project has raised over $387 million and delivered a 2900% ROI since batch one. Its momentum is backed by adoption across every layer millions of X1 app users, tens of thousands of rigs deployed, and thousands of developers building 300+ dApps With a hybrid DAG plus Proof of Work model and full EVM compatibility, BlockDAG supports up to 10,000 transactions per second while ensuring liquidity. For investors seeking the best long term crypto in 2025, it combines innovation with measurable growth, making it a clear standout.

ADA Price has recently slumped, sparking discussion on if newer crypto projects might have greater growth space. One name repeatedly entering such conversation is Remittix (RTX) , a DeFi project for real-world payments and already creating ripples with exchange listings and a wallet launch pending. ADA Price Under Pressure In Today’s Trading Cardano remains one of the top crypto under $1 but is experiencing new volatility. ADA Price is $0.8251, a 5.08% decrease in the past 24 hours. Market capitalization is $29.48 billion, with trading volume increasing 7.34% to $1.47 billion. Despite these figures, ADA is still being discussed as a long-term blockchain contender. However, some investors are also diversifying into early-stage crypto investment plays such as Remittix, which is delivering real-world adoption features versus speculative price action. Over 630M Tokens Already Sold Remittix costs $0.1000 per token, with more than $22.2 million raised and more than 630 million tokens sold. Passing the $20 million mark led to its first centralized exchange listing announcement on BitMart, followed by a confirmed announcement on LBank. The most anticipated milestone is the Remittix beta wallet launch in Q3 2025. The mobile-first platform will be supported by 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies. It is featured with direct crypto-to-bank transfers, real-time FX conversion, and low-cost gas fee crypto transactions. Unlike most low cap crypto gems that rely on hype, RTX is building real-world utility for freelancers, businesses, and global remitters.

XRP Queen (@crypto_queen_x), a well-known influencer in the community, recently highlighted comments about XRP ETFs from Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg during an interview with Paul Barron. Their discussion centered on the possibility of an XRP ETF and its market impact, setting the stage for speculation about approval odds, which markets currently place at around 86% on Polymarket . Canary Capital CEO says $XRP ETF can do $5 BILLION in the first month!! THIS IS HUGGGGE pic.twitter.com/3oKGcU1QBz — XRP QUEEN (@crypto_queen_x) August 29, 2025 McClurg’s View on Market Potential In the interview, McClurg was asked about his earlier projection that an XRP ETF could generate $5 billion in inflows during its first month. He affirmed his outlook, stating, “I really am,” when pressed if he still stood by the figure. McClurg explained that in financial circles, XRP enjoys broad recognition and could potentially rank ahead of Ethereum in terms of institutional interest . He believes XRP is the most well-known cryptocurrency on Wall Street other than Bitcoin, adding that the asset may outperform Ethereum from a “pure financial services standpoint.” This perspective aligns with the growing optimism among investors who see XRP’s positioning in traditional finance as a strong foundation for ETF adoption. Pending Applications Before the SEC The discussion comes as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) faces several pending applications for spot XRP ETFs. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen these products approved over the past few years, the SEC has yet to approve spot XRP ETFs and has constantly extended the decision timeline . Industry participants argue that XRP could be a viable candidate given its liquidity and established presence on regulated platforms. McClurg also referenced comments from Bloomberg analysts predicting that regulated XRP futures could pave the way for ETF approval . Now that these products have launched successfully, he believes ETFs will be approved in 2025. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 October Deadlines Could Be Key The SEC has already postponed decisions on multiple ETF proposals, pushing final deadlines into October. Market participants see this as a critical window that could determine the pace of approvals for spot XRP ETFs . With confidence growing in prediction markets and influential industry voices highlighting XRP’s potential, attention now turns to the SEC’s upcoming rulings. If approval is granted, the first spot XRP ETF could mark a significant step for the asset’s integration into mainstream finance. With the high anticipation, these products could easily break the $5 billion inflow target set by McClurg. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The U.S.-based bitcoin financial services firm revealed ownership distribution research dated Aug. 25, 2025 in a recent post on X . The study groups supply into categories and shows the share River attributes to each, using public filings, custodial address tagging and earlier blockchain research. River estimates individuals control about 65.9% of circulating BTC, or 13.83 million coins. This bucket includes self-custodied wallets and exchange accounts River classifies as individual. On the institutional side, River divides holdings into businesses and ETFs and funds. Businesses — a global category covering corporate treasuries and conventional firms that report bitcoin holdings — account for about 6.2% of supply, or 1.30 million BTC. ETFs and funds — spot ETFs and investment vehicles that custody coins for clients — control about 7.8%, or 1.63 million BTC. Governments are shown at about 1.5%, or 306,000 BTC, based on sovereign addresses River tracks from public sources. Two special categories round out the distribution: Lost bitcoin makes up about 7.6%, or 1.58 million BTC. River says this is inferred from age heuristics showing coins that have not moved for many years and are likely unrecoverable. Satoshi/Patoshi holdings are pegged at about 4.6%, or 968,000 BTC, based on earlier research into early-era mining patterns. Finally, about 5.2% of the supply, or 1.09 million BTC, has yet to be mined before the hard cap of 21 million is reached. In plain terms, River’s research is an attempt to map who holds bitcoin today, not to forecast future prices. The estimates are not definitive, since custodians aggregate many clients, some wallets are misclassified and ownership can be opaque. River’s conclusion is that individuals still dominate holdings, but the institutional share is expanding, helped by the growth of ETFs and companies that now treat bitcoin as a balance-sheet asset.",Markets|btc|News,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|RESEARCH|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-30 17:04:00

Just as blockchain promises to revolutionize finance, artificial intelligence (AI) aims to transform industries from healthcare to hospitality. But what happens when these ambitious technological leaps encounter the messy reality of human interaction? Taco Bell, a fast-food giant known for its bold flavors, is now facing this very question as it re-evaluates its extensive AI Drive-Through Systems experiment, prompting a crucial conversation about the limits and future of automation. The AI Drive-Through Systems Experiment: What Went Wrong? In a bold move to enhance efficiency and speed up service, Taco Bell rolled out voice AI-powered ordering across more than 500 of its drive-through locations. The premise was simple: leverage AI to handle routine orders, reduce wait times, and free up human staff for more complex tasks. However, as is often the case with pioneering technology, the journey has been anything but smooth. The implementation of these AI Drive-Through Systems has led to a series of viral incidents that have put a spotlight on the inherent challenges of automated customer service. One of the most widely circulated anecdotes involves a customer reportedly ordering 18,000 water cups – a clever, albeit disruptive, tactic to bypass the AI and connect with a human server. Such incidents, while humorous on the surface, highlight a deeper issue: the frustration that arises when AI fails to understand nuanced requests or handle unexpected situations. For customers seeking a quick and seamless experience, these glitches can quickly turn into significant deterrents, impacting brand perception and operational efficiency. Taco Bell’s AI Strategy: A Recipe for Viral Mishaps? Dane Matthews, Taco Bell’s Chief Digital and Technology Officer, openly admits the company is engaged in an “active conversation” about the appropriate deployment of AI. This admission underscores a broader industry struggle to integrate advanced technology without alienating the human element. Matthews himself has had mixed experiences, stating, “Sometimes it lets me down, but sometimes it really surprises me.” This candid assessment reflects the dual nature of AI: its incredible potential alongside its current limitations. Taco Bell’s AI Strategy initially aimed for broad deployment, but the real-world feedback has prompted a more cautious approach. The viral moments, though entertaining for onlookers, have been a wake-up call, demonstrating that while AI can handle predictable transactions with speed, it often falters when faced with the unpredictable, the quirky, or the deliberately subversive. The goal is not just to automate, but to automate smartly, ensuring that the technology enhances rather than detracts from the customer journey. The Promise and Pitfalls of Voice AI in Fast Food Voice AI in Fast Food offers compelling benefits. It can process orders rapidly, reduce human error in order taking, and potentially lower labor costs. For franchisees, these advantages can translate into improved margins and operational scalability. However, the technology is still evolving, and its current iteration presents several pitfalls: Accuracy Issues: Background noise, accents, or complex orders can lead to misinterpretations, resulting in incorrect food items or frustrating delays. Lack of Empathy: AI cannot offer the same level of personalized service or empathy that a human can, which is crucial for resolving complaints or handling special requests. Scalability Challenges: While AI can handle high volumes, its effectiveness diminishes when facing truly exceptional circumstances or deliberate attempts to circumvent its programming. Customer Preference: A segment of customers simply prefers human interaction, especially when ordering food, where clarity and confirmation are paramount. These challenges mean that simply plugging in Voice AI in Fast Food is not a magic bullet. It requires careful integration, continuous monitoring, and a robust fallback plan involving human intervention. Restaurant Automation Challenges: Finding the Human-Tech Balance Taco Bell’s experience is a microcosm of broader Restaurant Automation Challenges across the industry. The ideal scenario is a synergistic relationship where AI handles routine tasks, allowing human employees to focus on higher-value activities like problem-solving, upselling, and ensuring overall customer satisfaction. Matthews emphasized this nuanced approach, suggesting that rather than relying exclusively on AI, a hybrid model might be more effective. For instance, at peak hours or in busy locations with long lines, it might make more sense to have a human take drive-through orders. This flexibility allows franchisees to adapt their operations based on real-time conditions and customer flow. Matthews stated, “For our teams, we’ll help coach them: at your restaurant, at these times, we recommend you use voice AI or recommend that you actually really monitor voice AI and jump in as necessary.” This highlights a shift from full automation to intelligent automation, where AI serves as a tool to assist, rather than completely replace, human staff. Overcoming Restaurant Automation Challenges requires this thoughtful integration. Enhancing Customer Experience with AI: Lessons from the Bell The ultimate goal of any technological deployment in customer service is to enhance the Customer Experience with AI . Taco Bell’s journey provides valuable lessons for other businesses considering similar AI integrations. It’s not just about deploying technology; it’s about understanding its impact on the end-user and being agile enough to adjust strategies based on feedback. Key takeaways for businesses looking to improve Customer Experience with AI include: Hybrid Models: Implement AI in conjunction with human oversight, allowing for seamless transitions when AI struggles. Contextual Awareness: Design AI systems that can better understand and respond to varied customer needs, including accents, complex orders, and emotional cues. User Feedback Loops: Establish robust mechanisms for collecting and acting on customer and employee feedback to refine AI performance. Training and Support: Provide comprehensive training for human staff on how to monitor AI, intervene effectively, and troubleshoot common issues. Franchisee Flexibility: Empower individual locations or managers to make informed decisions about AI deployment based on their specific operational context. By learning from these experiences, businesses can harness the power of AI to create genuinely positive interactions, rather than frustrating ones. Conclusion: The Future of Fast Food Automation Taco Bell’s active re-evaluation of its AI drive-through systems is a critical moment for the fast-food industry and a compelling case study for anyone exploring the integration of AI in customer-facing roles. It underscores that while AI offers immense potential for efficiency and innovation, it must be deployed with a deep understanding of human behavior and customer expectations. The path forward likely involves a balanced approach, where AI and human intelligence work in tandem, each leveraging their strengths to create a truly seamless and satisfying customer experience. As technology continues to evolve, the challenge will be to continuously refine these integrations, ensuring that innovation truly serves the people it aims to assist.

Investors are closely watching whether this emerging DeFi coin could break past key milestones, including the coveted $1 mark, amid rising interest in next-generation blockchain finance. The ETH-based DeFi token is at presale stage 6 at a price of $0.035. It will be up by 14.29% to $0.04 in stage 7. Investors who enter in this phase will get at least 400% returns when the token is listed. Mutuum Finance has already crossed more than $15.15 million and over 15800 investors. Mutuum finance could outpace SHIB’s established influence this year. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holds Steady Amid Market Shifts Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently priced at $0.0000126 and continues to maintain its position as one of the leading meme-based cryptocurrencies. Recent trends show its trading volume slowing, and analysts expect SHIB to move gradually rather than see sudden spikes in the near term. For 2025, projections suggest a modest range of potential growth as its ecosystem, including Shibarium, develops further. At the same time, attention in the market is also being drawn toward new DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Two-Tier DeFi Lending Framework Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an innovative non-custodial DeFi protocol. The project is capable of Peer-to-Contract lending and Peer-to-Peer lending with great flexibility and efficiency of operations. Peer-to-Contract utilizes the smart contract feature to lend with minimal or no human interference. Peer-to-Peer eliminates middlemen and has lenders and borrowers directly transact and exchange with each other. The model is extremely easy to handle risky assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Success Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is blazing with presale making headlines. It is currently at stage 6 at $0.035. It will also shoot up by 14.29% to $0.04 in the next phase. Investor demand is rising with the project already reaching over $15.15 million and already boasting a token holder base of over 15800. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is launching its new overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. With a strong and long-lasting foundation, the stablecoin has extremely high chances of being safe and stable for several decades to come. The project also boasts a 95.0 trust score as indicated by a Certik audit. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also introduced its Bug Bounty Program with a reward of $50,000 USDT. It has four severities to be resolved that are critical, major, minor, and low. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is conducting a $100,000 giveaway as it wishes to expand its community. 10 lucky individuals who participate in the giveaway will get an opportunity to win MUTM tokens to the value of $10,000. A Strategy for Sustainable Development Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has designed its tokenomics with one intention in mind: to generate long-term value, sustain market health and liquidity, and protect against long-term inflation. Instead of striving for short-term gain, the project is designed to offer steady growth and stability over the long term. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $15.15 million with more than 15,800 investors already joining at Stage 6, priced at $0.035. With its dual lending model, CertiK-audited platform, and upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin, the project positions itself as a serious coin for 2025’s DeFi growth story. The next stage will lift the token price to $0.04, making this a strategic time to enter before further appreciation.

Price action on the 4-hour chart shows the token moving within a downward structure, and it broke below $2.9 in the past 24 hours. It is within this context that crypto analyst DustyBC Crypto shared a bearish outlook, pointing out that XRP has not yet reached its first downside target and warning that more decline could still unfold before it enters any new uptrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullishness: Ark Invest Boss Scoops $16-M More In BitMine Stock XRP Wave 4 Correction In Progress According to crypto analyst DustyBC Crypto, XRP’s recent moves are part of a broader corrective structure. In his latest update shared on the social media platform X, he explained that the XRP/USD pair has yet to reach its first bearish target, which he identifies as part of a larger wave 4 correction. The analysis is based on the Elliott Wave structure, which is characterized by three bullish and two corrective impulse waves. Notably, the analyst’s Elliott Wave count shows that XRP has been playing out a corrective Wave 4 move since it peaked at a new all-time high price of $3.65 on July 18, a move that ended the Wave 3 impulse. Based on the Elliott Wave theory, Wave 4 is a brief correction move after Wave 3 just before another bullish Wave 5. Interestingly, the XRP price has declined by about 22.5% since it reached this all-time high. DustyBC’s analysis has been following this downtrend move in a series of technical analyses that goes as far back as mid-August. According to DustyBC, XRP’s price is expected to continue dropping before eventually setting up for a bullish wave 5 recovery. The chart shared by the analyst indicates that XRP could continue to decline until it reaches the $2.65 to $2.60 price range before Wave 4 eventually bottoms out. Long-Term Perspective Is Positive Despite the bearish short-term forecast, DustyBC noted that the overall outlook for XRP is bullish. He admonished traders not to rush into positions if they are not comfortable with short trades, and long-term holders should instead view the current weakness as discount territory to accumulate more XRP. XRP has struggled to maintain upward momentum in the past few days, and this lends voice to the notion of a corrective Wave 4 movement. As shown in the 4-hour chart above, XRP was rejected at the $3 price level some days ago, and this has led to a further decline in the past 48 hours. Related Reading: A New Vision For Money: Hoskinson Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $10 Trillion Nonetheless, the long-term outlook is bullish, and a Wave 5 bounce could lead to a push to new all-time highs above $3.65. The decisive test now lies in whether XRP can hold support around $2.6 if it reaches there before positioning itself for the next wave higher. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.80, down by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

The expansion included a huge mint of 100 million USD1 tokens, making it one of the biggest stablecoin mints on Solana this year. This move signals WLFI’s growing ambition to link internet capital markets with stablecoins while making use of Solana’s speed and low fees. A Major Mint on Solana The debut of USD1 on Solana was not a quiet one. According to Lookonchain, WLFI minted 100 million tokens shortly after launch. The large mint quickly increased liquidity on the Solana network, making it easier for traders to lend, settle, and trade using USD1. This latest minting event came after the decentralized finance venture minted over $200 million worth of its USD1 stablecoin on August 21. This came after a supportive speech from Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko welcomed the news, backing WLFI’s choice of choosing Solana network. The move also shows a rising trend of stablecoin issuers picking Solana for its speed and capacity to handle large numbers of transactions. WLFI Prepares for Global Token Debut WLFI’s growth is not only about minting on the Solana network; it is also working fast to expand on exchanges. Coinbase has confirmed plans to list USD1 , giving traders around the world access to the stablecoin. At the same time, WLFI’s governance token is preparing for a major launch . Both HTX and KuCoin will list the token on September 1, 2025. Deposits are already live, and trading pairs such as WLFI/USDT and WLFI/USD1 will be available. KuCoin called the listing a global first, describing WLFI as a DeFi project created to support dollar-backed stablecoins and strengthen the dollar’s place in global markets. WLFI has already raised over $2.26 billion before the launch of its governance token, showing strong investor confidence. The dual listing on HTX and KuCoin gives the token instant exposure and liquidity. To encourage use, KuCoin also started a USD1 Points Program that rewards users for trading, staking, and holding USD1. The program doubles rewards for maker orders and gives special benefits to active traders. WLFI Pushes USD1 Into the Spotlight as a New Stablecoin Rival WLFI says its mission is to connect stablecoins with internet-based capital markets. The project has also drawn attention because of its link to U.S. President Donald Trump, which has helped it gain visibility beyond the crypto space. By bringing USD1 to Solana and growing its exchange presence, WLFI has positioned itself as a strong competitor in the stablecoin market. With speed, scale, and major funding, USD1 is now in a position to challenge established players .

However, while SHIB has proven its staying power, its ability to flip $100 to $5,000 is increasingly unlikely. With a market capitalization of approximately $7.8 billion as of writing, SHIB would need to surpass the valuation of companies like Apple or even Bitcoin to reach that growth level. For investors still chasing outsized returns of 4,900% or more, these 2 meme coins stand out as the best Shiba Inu alternatives. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Where Memes Meet Scalable Blockchain Utility Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is quickly emerging as the most ambitious frog-themed project. Unlike many meme tokens that rely solely on community hype, it builds a dedicated Layer-2 chain tailored specifically for meme coins. This network promises faster transactions, lower fees, and protection against sniper bots, one of the biggest frustrations for retail traders during presales and launches. Momentum around Little Pepe is striking. The project has already raised over $22.6 million in its presale, with Stage 12 pricing tokens at just $0.0021 each. More than 14.4 billion tokens have been sold, putting the cap at $10.825 million within sight. Its tokenomics model is designed reasonably: no buy or sell taxes, a fixed supply, and allocations structured to encourage long-term stability rather than quick exits. Beyond its infrastructure, Little Pepe has leaned into community incentives. The project launched a $777,000 giveaway , one of the largest in the meme coin sector this year. This strategy has fueled both social media buzz and growing investor interest. Among all Shiba Inu alternatives, Little Pepe stands out for combining the cultural draw of a meme with the utility of a functioning blockchain. That mix is rare in this space, one SHIB could never have dreamt of. Pepe Coin (PEPE): The Original Meme Frog Regains Momentum PEPE has proven that its meme power carries real liquidity with a market capitalization above $4.3 billion and daily trading volumes regularly near half a billion dollars. Recent performance has been encouraging: the token trades at $0.00001043, marking a 6.7% weekly gain. What sets Pepe Coin apart is its cultural dominance; Twitter feeds, Reddit forums, and meme pages are flooded with frog-themed content, creating a level of organic marketing that most projects can only dream of. It may not deliver the same upside as Little Pepe’s presale, but its established liquidity and community strength make it a strong candidate to outperform SHIB in the next cycle. Shiba Inu’s Ceiling and Why Investors Seek Alternatives Truthfully, recent developments have shown that SHIB is more than just a meme; it is not enough to spark the kind of parabolic growth seen in its early days. While SHIB has proven staying power, its immense size makes it challenging to repeat 100x or 200x gains. To be clear, Shiba Inu is not fading away. Its Shibarium Layer-2 network, ShibaSwap DEX, and proposed metaverse show that SHIB is building for the future. But at $0.00001422, analysts see only a 2x–6x gain in the next couple of years. However, a 4,900% rally would push SHIB to $0.001, an almost impossible leap that would place it above Bitcoin in market capitalization. This is why traders are increasingly talking about Shiba Inu alternatives. For many, the most compelling opportunities now lie in earlier-stage projects or meme tokens experiencing fresh adoption surges. Final Thoughts: The Next $100- $5000 Flip Shiba Inu continues to play an essential role in the meme coin market, but its size limits its explosive upside. This focus has shifted to 2 meme coins to flip Shiba Inu in terms of near-term growth potential. Little Pepe’s presale progress, Layer-2 ambitions, and massive giveaway put it in a league of its own among emerging projects. Pepe Coin, meanwhile, maintains momentum as the cultural meme giant with real liquidity. Together, they represent the most compelling Shiba Inu alternatives for investors hoping to turn $100 into $5,000 in the coming months.

The average deposit size has skyrocketed to 13.5 BTC, compared to just 0.8 BTC at the start of 2024 — a nearly seventeen-fold increase signaling whale dominance. Analysts say this trend is expected: Binance remains the global leader in trading volumes and provides the liquidity big players need. CryptoQuant insight: The 7-day average deposit (Mean, MA7) hitting a record-high of 13.5 BTC underscores that the exchange is now overwhelmingly favored by whales over retail investors. Market Consolidation: A Different Cycle Unfolds Experts note the current crypto market is in a long-term consolidation phase. Unlike in previous cycles, the upward trend is developing more slowly. Key drivers include: Entry into spot ETF markets Growing institutional and governmental Bitcoin adoption Capital shift from Bitcoin to altcoins Further CryptoQuant data shows that monthly Bitcoin inflows to Binance have plummeted—recent levels (~5,700 BTC) are under half the 2020 average (~12,000 BTC, signaling a deliberate hold strategy and reduced near-term sell pressure. Prior peaks in whale inflows coincided with local tops, like surges above 17,000 BTC during August’s dip to $69K, and over 20,000 BTC when BTC crossed six figures in March. Triggers for the Next Rally Analysts highlight two upcoming catalysts: a U.S. rate cut in September and the potential approval of altcoin spot ETFs in October. These developments could spark a new rally, with the second half of 2025 likely to extend the bullish trend after consolidation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|EXCHANGE|BNB|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-30 17:39:59

The document submitted by the company included the following statements: “The Amplify XRP [ ]% Monthly Option Income ETF aims to provide a balance between high income and capital appreciation through investing in the price return of XRP and a covered call option strategy.” Options income ETFs aim to provide investors with monthly income through options strategies. Amplify's application comes amid a surge in applications for altcoin-based funds, which the SEC has yet to rule on. Companies like Grayscale, 21Shares, and Bitwise have already filed for spot ETFs tracking coins like XRP, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Solana. Related News: How Will Bitcoin (BTC) Reach $1 Million?

According to Bloomberg, as of August 28, the SEC had more than 90 crypto-focused applications under review. If approved, this ETF wouldn't be Amplify's first crypto-focused fund.

This move signals the gaming giant’s deeper commitment to blockchain technology , as it looks to tap into new revenue streams and strengthen its position through XRP in the growing digital economy. Gumi Taps XRP To Expand Blockchain Business On Friday, August 29, Gumi sparked fresh interest and excitement in the crypto community after announcing its intention to purchase 2.5 billion yen (around $17 million) worth of XRP. The move, revealed on X social media, is part of the Japanese gaming company’s broader strategy to accelerate the growth of its blockchain business. According to Gumi, the acquisition is not simply an investment but a calculated step to integrate into the XRP ecosystem , which has been gaining momentum as a cornerstone in cross-border payments and liquidity solutions. The decision also aligns closely with the recent efforts of SBI Holdings , a financial services company in Japan and a prolonged supporter of Ripple and XRP. SBI Holdings has long championed XRP as an essential component of international remittance networks , and Gumi’s entry adds further credibility to the digital asset’s role in the Japanese fintech landscape . By allocating significant capital into XRP, Gumi aims to position itself at the intersection of gaming, blockchain technology, and digital finance—ultimately tapping into an evolving global marketplace where cryptocurrencies are increasingly becoming interlinked with entertainment and financial services. The broader crypto community has responded enthusiastically to Gumi’s upcoming XRP investment. Industry watchers see this as more than a simple token purchase, but a sign of Japan’s gaming sector’s embrace of blockchain-powered assets . Enthusiasts like the ‘BankXRP’ on X anticipate that Gumi’s cryptocurrency integration could open the door for in-game transactions using fast and low-cost XRP transfers, creating a more seamless and innovative gaming experience. If implemented, this could establish the Japanese company as a pioneer in merging blockchain gaming mechanics with one of the most recognized digital assets in the space. VivoPower To Offer New XRP Incentives Further expanding on XRP’s adoption across various companies , another report on X shows that international battery and electric vehicle services provider VivoPower has rolled out an initiative to leverage the token to engage retail audiences. VivoPower announced on X on Thursday, August 28, that it will be offering XRP incentives to its shareholders through a partnership with crypto exchange Crypto.com. The program allows VivoPower shareholders who register with the exchange to receive $100 worth of XRP as a bonus, adding a direct crypto-linked reward to their equity ownership. This collaboration signals a growing trend where non-crypto companies find ways to integrate digital assets into their corporate strategies. For Crypto.com, the initiative represents a strategic opportunity to attract new users. At the same time, the XRP bonuses provide VivoPower with both an engagement tool and a way to strengthen its partnership with the exchange. Overall, this latest move underscores XRP’s expansion outside its traditional remittance use case.",XRP|BankXRP|Crypto.com|Gumi Inc|ripple|SBI Holdings|VivoPower|XRP Ecosystem|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-30 18:00:01

According to Hoskinson, two Federal Reserve governors were present alongside some industry representatives. He named Anatoly from Solana, Sergey from Chainlink, Ilya from Near, and Brad from XRP as part of the group. Hoskinson said the discussions centered on the role of the Federal Reserve under the “Genius Act,” explaining that while the Fed has served as the payments regulator for more than a century, it has often been left outside certain digital asset developments that are instead overseen by other regulators such as the OCC and FDIC. In his remarks, Hoskinson emphasized stablecoins as an area of focus, outlining how they exist in both the Web3 space and the traditional financial system. He noted that the digital market side already supports significant issuance and high transaction volume. However, he stressed that these assets only function because of their backing in the legacy system through holdings such as bank deposits or treasuries. He went on to say that while the Genius Act has created a set of initial standards, rulemaking is still required to address practical questions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Among the issues he listed were whether entities could gain access to a Federal Reserve master account, how insurance frameworks would be applied, what custodial standards should look like, how audit oversight would be structured, and how privacy considerations could be extended to other assets such as bitcoin. Digital Asset Investor’s Interpretation Digital Asset Investor centered his tweet on one part of Hoskinson’s explanation—the subject of Federal Reserve master accounts. While Hoskinson framed this as an open area for future rulemaking, the tweet presents it as a certainty, stating that a master account is “coming.” For stablecoins and other tokenized assets, the availability of a master account could affect how liquidity, settlement, and custody are structured. The post also connects this expectation directly with Garlinghouse’s attendance at the roundtable, suggesting that his involvement carries importance for Ripple and possibly for the broader digital asset industry.

Analysts often highlight that the first phases of a presale present a rare window for exponential growth. Ozak AI ($OZ), an AI and DePIN-powered project, is now being pointed to as one of those opportunities. Market watchers suggest that the token could deliver gains of more than 1,200% within the next 12 months, making it a candidate for investors looking to maximize returns with relatively small entries. Ozak AI Presale Performance Ozak AI is at Phase 4 of its presale , with its tokens sold at $0.005. So far, more than 833 million $OZ tokens have been sold, raising approximately $2.53 million. The next phase will push the price to $0.01, doubling the cost for late entrants. The project has reached a long-term target price of 1 USD and has already achieved a greater growth since its initial phase of 400 percent. The first in will gain the most in case the momentum persists. Technology That Sets Ozak AI Apart The power of Ozak AI is in its use of innovative artificial intelligence and a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN). The Ozak Stream Network (OSN) takes advantage of the available market data in real time to provide a prediction of the future that could enable investors to make improved decisions. In conjunction with this, the project infuses cross-chain capability to provide seamless cross-ecosystem functioning. The token holders can also enjoy staking opportunities and rights to governance, making sure that the community has an involved say in the direction of the platform. The system is now transparent and secure through audits. Partnerships and Expanding Ecosystem A series of strategic collaborations has enabled Ozak AI to go global. Partnerships with SINT, Hive Intel, and Weblume add more features to the platform, including AI-powered execution solutions and advanced blockchain data APIs, as well as no-code Web3 integration. These collaborations make the predictive models of Ozak AI more useful and extend their application in reality. The team has also participated in international events, including roadshows in Vietnam, and plans to attend Coinfest Asia 2025 in Bali. These events help Ozak AI connect with investors, developers, and other blockchain innovators to help the project see the light of day and gain momentum in the international arena. Why Analysts See Potential The combination of utility, adoption, and swift presale growth is the reason why the market analysts believe that the potential 1,200 percent returns of Ozak AI will occur. A presale price of $500 would be increased to a significantly greater amount should the price of $OZ reach its goal of $1 in the next year. The regular presale performance of the project, coupled with the growing partnerships, justifies these estimates, thus making it a standout in a saturated market. Final Thoughts Ozak AI is a second opportunity to get a huge upside to investors who missed the first wave of token entries, such as Solana or XRP. As the presale tokens are going rapidly, and the next round doubles the cost of entry, the opportunity window is closing rapidly. Investors who are interested in getting the most out of the next bull cycle might find that time is now or never.

With a strong start in its presale phase and strategic technological advancements, Ozak AI is crafting a niche in the digital currency landscape. Early Investment Advantage Entering the cryptocurrency market during the early stages of a project like Ozak AI can potentially translate into substantial financial returns. Currently, Ozak AI is in Phase 4 of its presale , offering tokens at a significantly lower price than projected future value, thereby creating an enticing scenario for early investors. Technological Edge of Ozak AI Ozak AI differentiates itself through its cutting-edge utilization of AI and decentralized technology. The project's Ozak Stream Network (OSN) leverages real-time market data to forecast future trends, giving investors a crucial advantage. Moreover, its transparent and secure system is confirmed through rigorous audits. The Growth Trajectory and Market Potential Ozak AI has demonstrated a commendable track record in its initial presale phases, growing an impressive 400 percent since inception. Analysts are optimistic, projecting potential gains upwards of 1,200% within the next year, as Ozak AI aims for a long-term target price of $1 per token. Strategic Partnerships and Global Outreach To enhance its platform and extend its market reach, Ozak AI has forged important partnerships with various tech firms like SINT, Hive Intel, and Weblume. These collaborations facilitate advanced AI solutions and blockchain integrations that are critical to the project’s growth and effectiveness. The project's global presence is accentuated by its participation in international blockchain events, with plans to join upcoming gatherings such as Coinfest Asia 2025 in Bali. Investment Considerations As the presale progresses, the cost of investment is set to increase, making the current phase particularly attractive. The unique combination of technology innovation, strategic growth, and early investment incentives formulates a compelling case for considering Ozak AI as a serious investment. Concluding Remarks Investing in Ozak AI during its current presale phase could be a strategic move for those seeking to capitalize on the next wave of technological investments in the cryptocurrency market. With its robust technological framework and promising presale performance, Ozak AI is positioned as a lucrative venture for potential investors.

The crypto space is buzzing, but at this moment, one token stands out from the crowd: Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) . In its legendary meme coin presale, APC has just ignited Stage 38, unleashing a 200% bonus with code CEX200 for loyal investors and newbelievers alike. Analysts whisper about a jaw-dropping 10,761.57% ROI potential if $0.1 price targets hold true, making APC a rare gem in the crypto universe. In contrast, Dogecoin and Pepe continue their unique runs, but none bring the same sense of urgency, community-driven firepower, or massive return potential that Arctic Pablo Coin delivers. With APC’s presale heating up, it’s no wonder traders and whales alike are rushing to secure their piece before the price jumps. Let’s dig into why APC might just be the best crypto to buy today and how it compares to Dogecoin and Pepe. Stage 38 of Arctic Pablo Coin Unleashes 200% Bonus and 10,761% ROI Potential Can one coin truly change the way wealth is built in crypto? Arctic Pablo Coin’s latest announcement says yes. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Bonus Stage 38 is live, offering one of the most valuable opportunities yet. This is the final call to secure extra rewards before the doors close. Delay now, and the defining moment of this presale will be one you only hear about. Early believers have already seen over 6,000% ROI by joining in the earliest stages, and the stage is set for even bigger gains as APC approaches its listing. The numbers paint an electric picture: APC is priced at just $ 0.00092, with more than $3.67 million already raised. At launch, it’s set to list at $0.008, which alone signals a 769.57% ROI from this stage, but that’s just the beginning. Analysts’ projected moonshot of $0.1 per token suggests a monumental 10,761.57% ROI, an opportunity no serious trader wants to miss. Imagine dropping $5000 today at $0.00092 per token. That’s about 5.43 million APC tokens. Apply the CEX200 bonus, and suddenly you’re holding 16.29 million tokens. At the listing price of $0.008, that initial $5000 explodes into $130,320. If APC climbs to $0.1, you’re sitting on a staggering $1.62 million from a single presale entry. These numbers don’t just create excitement; they ignite a movement. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just a token; it’s a mystical journey. Picture Pablo cruising on his snowmobile through frozen landscapes, discovering shimmering APC tokens in forgotten ice caves, treasures not just of myth, but of wealth creation. This adventurous story aligns with real-world mechanics like a deflationary token burn, 66% APY staking, referral incentives, and thrilling community competitions. It’s the kind of storytelling meets tokenomics fusion that few projects can deliver, making APC undeniably the best crypto to buy today before Stage 38 vanishes into history. Dogecoin: The Original Meme Powerhouse Still Making Waves Dogecoin remains a cultural icon in the crypto world, born as a joke but now integrated into real payment systems, tipping platforms, and merchant solutions. Its strength lies in community engagement and the support of high-profile figures, fueling both utility and popularity. As one of the earliest meme coins, Dogecoin continues to inspire new entrants into the market while sustaining its appeal with active development and brand recognition. While it might not carry the presale frenzy of APC, it’s still a force that proves memes and money can thrive side by side. Pepe: Internet Culture Fueling Meme Coin Mania Pepe has captured global attention as another internet-inspired phenomenon. Driven by viral culture, its rapid adoption and strong trading volumes highlight how quickly meme coins can capture the imagination of the crypto crowd. Pepe’s ecosystem thrives on its fast-moving, community-led energy, leveraging humor and nostalgia to maintain momentum. While it hasn’t yet created a structured presale journey like Arctic Pablo Coin, its rise demonstrates the meme coin sector’s potential to rally massive audiences around shared cultural symbols. Conclusion: Why Arctic Pablo Coin Is The Best Crypto to Buy Today Dogecoin and Pepe both hold their unique places in the crypto narrative, but Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale story is rewriting what’s possible. With Stage 38 offering a 200% bonus via CEX200, a current ROI of 769.57% to listing, and a massive 10,761.57% upside potential, APC sets itself apart as the best crypto to buy today. Add to that the community competitions, token burns, and immersive myth meets reality journey, and it becomes clear why investors are flocking to Arctic Pablo. The question isn’t whether Arctic Pablo Coin will make waves it already has. The real question is: will you be part of the story before Stage 38 sells out? Join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale today and claim your spot in what could be one of the most legendary meme coin adventures of this decade.

The latest milestone, recorded on August 22, was driven by $53 billion in USDT holdings and $13 billion in USDC balances. According to a report by the on-chain aggregator CryptoQuant, this marks a clear break from earlier records. The new total surpasses the previous peak of $59 billion set in February 2022, when BUSD had a larger role. Reserves have since more than doubled from their October 2023 low, boosted by a $28 billion increase after Donald Trump’s election victory. Cooling Momentum in Stablecoin Liquidity Rising stablecoin balances are often viewed as a signal of strong market liquidity. They provide the funds necessary for asset purchases, making them a key factor in supporting price activity across digital assets. However, despite record levels on exchanges, the broader expansion of stablecoin supply has shown signs of slowing. Since November 2024, net additions have softened, with only $1.1 billion in recent inflows compared to $4–$8 billion increases in earlier months. CryptoQuant notes that this weaker supply expansion reduces the strength of liquidity conditions for crypto markets. In previous cycles, rapid stablecoin growth aligned with notable price rallies, especially in Bitcoin and other major assets. Consequently, periods of strong inflows typically reflect new capital entering the ecosystem. The current slowdown suggests that less fresh money is moving into stablecoins, which may limit the pace of further market advances. Tether’s Growth Slows Despite Market Dominance Tether continues to dominate exchange reserves, but its pace of growth has eased in 2025. Over the last 60 days, USDT supply expanded by $10 billion. This is less than half of the $21 billion increase recorded at the end of 2024. The slowdown is reflected in the latest figures, which also came in slightly below the 30-day moving average, signaling a deceleration in capital inflows. CryptoQuant interprets this as reduced momentum in one of the market’s largest liquidity sources. Even so, the report concludes that liquidity remains supportive, though not as strong as in late 2024. Looking ahead, if supply expansion continues to cool, markets may move toward consolidation. Renewed issuance, however, could still trigger another round of bullish momentum.

According to IREN Limited’s annual report from Thursday, the company has agreed to pay $20 million to NYDIG to settle the years-long dispute. The loans, which were arranged in 2021, financed two of IREN’s special-purpose vehicles, IE CA3 and IE CA4. But unfortunately, they defaulted in late 2022 due to unprofitable fixed-rate hosting and hashrate lease agreements amid a Bitcoin market downturn. Details of IREN’s resolution with NYDIG The settlement was initially drafted in August but was tagged confidential. It resolves litigation in Canada and Australia tied to the two non-recourse special purpose vehicles. About $18.2 million of the $20 million payout exceeds amounts previously reserved, the company has said. According to IREN, the settlement concludes all related proceedings and protects its affiliates, executives, and shareholders from further claims, while they await court approvals to formally close the cases. IREN’s debt settlement stands out in the cryptocurrency industry as similar disputes typically end in reorganizations or asset liquidation. IREN posted its best quarterly earnings to date The resolution of IREN’s legal dispute with NYDIG could not have come at a more auspicious time. The company just posted its best quarterly earnings to date, in which it raked in $187.3 million in revenue last quarter, which contributed to a record $501 million revenue for the fiscal year, sending its stock up in after-hours trading. IREN stock. Source: Google Finance Quarterly revenue for the period ended June 30 was up 226% year-on-year, which has put the company back into profitability with $176.9 million in net income, according to a report posted on Thursday. The surge has been attributed to the growth of its Bitcoin mining business, but the company has also taken critical steps to deepen its footprint in the AI industry as a new “ Preferred Partner ” to the sought-after Nvidia. According to reports, IREN has purchased an additional 1,200 air-cooled NVIDIA B300 GPUs and 1,200 liquid-cooled NVIDIA GB300s for about $168 million, a move that expands its arsenal to 10,900 NVIDIA GPUs, including H100s, H200s, B200s, B300s, and GB300s. The new GB300 systems are to be installed at IREN’s Prince George campus in British Columbia, where construction is underway on a 10MW liquid-cooled installation capable of supporting more than 4,500 GPUs. The $96 million GB300 purchase is fully financed through a 24-month lease at a high single-digit interest rate, while the B300s are being funded from cash reserves. This expansion and the resolution of the legal overhang with NYDIG show that IREN is positioning itself as not only a large-scale Bitcoin miner but also a growing player in AI infrastructure. The combination seems to have galvanized investor confidence, which is what translated into the stock hitting record highs on Friday. Get seen where it counts.

Today, we break down three coins with significant upside that could transform a $420 bet into $20,000 or more. Leading the trio is the buzzing Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , followed by Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin That Could Beat Them All First on the list is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , a meme coin that’s lighting up the presale charts. Right now, it’s in Stage 12, selling for only $0.0021 each. That’s a tiny price for a coin that’s shooting for massive gains. So far, the presale has pulled in $22,606,504, there are already 35,983 wallets holding the token, and the Telegram group is buzzing with 28,045 active users. Little Pepe stands out from the typical meme token crowd by combining virality with solid numbers. Most meme coins bounce up and down on hype alone. Still, LILPEPE maintains a steady pulse with 0% transaction tax, staking rewards, and a CertiK audit that instills in investors the kind of confidence typically reserved for serious projects. Over 231,000 people have entered the $777,000 giveaway. That keeps the buzz going and attracts new users daily. A climb to just $0.25—still a tiny piece of SHIB and DOGE—would still be more than 100x. A $420 bet could, just like that, turn into over $40,000. The presale already crushed targets, the user list keeps climbing, and the memes just won’t quit. All these numbers and vibes line up, so Little Pepe could easily wear the crown for top meme coin in 2025. Cardano (ADA): Whale Accumulation Signals a Bullish Breakout Cardano has always been a wild ride, but new signs indicate a bigger wave is coming. While most of crypto struggled, ADA popped up with a solid 3% daily gain. That tells us traders are confident and the network is standing firm. The big clue? On-chain data shows whales—those who buy huge stacks—picked up more than 100 million ADA in just one day. Every time that has happened in the past, the price has shot up right after. Right now, ADA is bouncing between $0.87 and $0.88. It has a $31.19 billion market cap and $2.29 billion in trading over the last 24 hours. The smart contract engine is chugging along nicely, and many experts think a solid push over the big $1.00 mark could spark a fast climb—some even call $2.50 a real shot in the near term. If ADA does punch through and kicks off a real bull market, a $420 buy could grow to $20,000 in a hurry, especially if it touches or beats its last all-time high in the next cycle. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Rising From Meme Coin to Serious Player Shiba Inu keeps moving past its meme aside by piling on genuine partnerships and boosting its platform. A significant milestone was achieved when the UAE’s Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure signed on to use ShibOS—a blockchain-run operating system—inside its operations. This kind of deal lifts SHIB’s reputation and shows it could stick around for the long haul. SHIB is now trading around $0.000012. The market cap sits between $7.1 billion, and daily trading runs from $170 million to $200 million. Analysts think the coin could jump 125% if it busts through key resistance spots, eyeing short-term price targets of $0.000015 to $0.000020. The coin’s low price and massive supply of 589.24 trillion tokens mean even a tiny price bump can hand big rewards to the early crowd. Conclusion: The $420 Question Cardano and Shiba Inu still have room to grow, but Little Pepe is in a league of its own. With a presale price of just $0.0021, the room to run feels limitless. ADA and SHIB are already worth billions, meaning their next leaps will be much more crowded and gradual. For anyone hunting the next meme coin that $420 could rocket into $20,000 by 2025, Little Pepe looks like the strongest single ticket. If the gamble is down to one pick, $420 in Little Pepe could likely be the smartest—yet riskiest—call you make.

In this article, we will analyze three such cryptocurrencies, including the vibrant Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , along with Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which are poised for potential growth. Highlighting Little Pepe (LILPEPE): A Meme Coin with Potential Among the quieter contenders in the meme coin category, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has demonstrated remarkable traction during its presale phase. Unlike traditional meme coins reliant solely on social media hype, Little Pepe backs its project with measurable statistics and community growth. With a CertiK audit affirming its security and a zero-percent transaction tax, this crypto offers an appealing mix of entertainment and investment potential. Enthusiasm surrounding the coin is evident from the $777,000 giveaway that has attracted over 231,000 participants. Cardano (ADA) Showing Signs of a Bullish Breakout The established cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA) is currently witnessing significant accumulation by crypto whales, signaling a potential market surge. This activity, combined with a solid 3% daily gain and robust on-chain data, suggests a bullish outlook for ADA. With its advanced smart contract capabilities and a market cap exceeding $30 billion, Cardano stands on the brink of possibly breaking the $1 mark, paving the way for a rapid ascent in value. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Evolves Beyond Just a Meme Coin Shiba Inu, traditionally seen as a meme coin, is steadily gaining credibility through substantial partnerships and technological integrations, such as its recent collaboration with the UAE's Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure. These strategic moves, coupled with its extensive market cap and trading volume, present SHIB as a serious contender in the cryptocurrency market, with analysts predicting significant short-term price increases. Conclusion: Weighing Your Investment Options While both Cardano and Shiba Inu present promising futures, Little Pepe stands out with its low entry cost and high growth potential, making it an attractive option for those looking to invest $420 with hopes of substantial returns. However, investors should approach with caution, recognizing the inherent risks associated with the volatile crypto market.

But the landscape is shifting. A new contender, Layer Brett, is not just riding the meme wave; it’s building a whole new ocean on Ethereum Layer 2, promising speed, utility, and explosive growth potential that makes the old guard look, well, a little slow. Right now, this crypto presale is generating significant buzz, with over $9 million already raised. Analysts are eyeing Layer Brett as the next big crypto , whispering about 100x returns. The Problem With Old Meme Coins Like Dogecoin, Pepe Coin, and The Solution Let’s be honest. Many popular meme coins, like the venerable DOGE or the more recent PEPE, thrive almost purely on community hype and viral moments. They’re fun, no doubt. But what happens when the hype cools, or the underlying blockchain struggles with congestion and sky-high gas fees? Ethereum’s mainnet, while secure, can be a real pain during peak times. Layer Brett isn’t just another meme token; it’s a solution. This ERC-20 token is a next-generation Layer 2 crypto that combines viral meme energy with real, tangible blockchain utility, offering a direct escape from those painfully slow, expensive Layer 1 transactions. Layer Brett leverages Ethereum Layer 2 technology, meaning lightning-fast transactions and dramatically reduced gas fees. Imagine: no more waiting for ages for your trade to clear, no more seeing your small investment eaten away by network costs. This platform offers near-instant activity, processing everything off-chain while remaining securely anchored to Ethereum’s robust decentralization. It’s a game-changer for accessibility and daily use. Why Layer Brett Leaves DOGE and PEPE in the Dust So, what makes Layer Brett so different from your average DOGE or PEPE? It’s simple: purpose. While tokens like DOGE and PEPE are mostly speculative assets, Layer Brett is purpose-built for performance and user rewards. It’s not content to just sit there and look pretty. This is a low cap crypto gem with serious infrastructure. Consider these core advantages: Built on Layer 2 Ethereum: This means high-speed, low-cost, and truly scalable operations. Brett escapes the expensive gas fees and congestion that plague many other tokens, ensuring a smooth user experience. Massive Staking Benefits: Early buyers aren’t just holding a token; they’re earning big. Layer Brett offers an incredible 1,450% APY on staking. Yes, you read that right. Your crypto isn’t just sitting there; it’s actively working for you, generating passive income. Memecoin Energy, Real Utility: It blends the fun, community-driven spirit of the best meme coins with robust tech backing. It’s where meme meets mechanism, a top gainer crypto with substance. No KYC, Full Control: True to the decentralized ethos, Layer Brett champions self-custody and user control. The Opportunity: Why Early Layer Brett Buyers Could See Unprecedented Gains The current 2025 crypto bull run narrative is all about finding the next 100x altcoin, and Layer Brett fits the bill. With Dogecoin boasting a market cap of over $33 billion and Pepe Coin around $4.29 billion, their growth potential, while still present, is naturally constrained by their already massive valuations. Layer Brett, being in its presale stage, presents an opportunity for significantly higher returns due to its much smaller market capitalization. This community-first project is offering a $1 million giveaway, sweetening the deal for those who jump in early. You can buy and stake $LBRETT in seconds with ETH, USDT, or BNB via MetaMask or Trust Wallet, instantly unlocking those high-yield staking rewards. It’s a compelling blend of viral culture and legitimate blockchain scaling solutions. The clock is ticking— join now .

Against this backdrop of Solana’s phenomenal performance, four cryptocurrencies are now tipped to mirror Solana’s (SOL) rise, with analysts projecting potential gains of up to 4500%. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) – The Meme Coin With a Difference Among the four coins tipped for exponential growth, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) stands out as the most unique contender. Unlike other meme coins, LILPEPE is built on a chain where sniper bots cannot operate, giving retail investors a fairer chance at accumulation. Its roadmap is ambitious, painting a vision of a meme token that is more than hype; it is structured to sustain long-term community value. The presale has been nothing short of impressive. Currently in its twelfth stage, tokens are priced at $0.0021 each, following a successful eleventh stage that sold out ahead of schedule. So far, the project has raised $22.81 million, showing strong investor confidence and suggesting that demand is far from cooling down. Community engagement is also a major focus. The LILPEPE team is currently running a high-profile giveaway, where 10 lucky winners will each receive $77,000 worth of tokens. Adding to its growing credibility, LILPEPE has already been listed on CoinMarketCap, a significant milestone for a project still in presale. Market analysts are increasingly spotlighting LILPEPE as the coin most likely to deliver the kind of massive ROI that early Solana investors enjoyed. Some forecasts even tip it for gains of up to 4500%, positioning it as a standout choice among presale tokens. Sei (SEI) – Momentum Building Strongly Sei (SEI) is another coin tipped for substantial gains. Its current price movement shows a promising setup, with the token around the $0.3227 range, which is a 4.1% gain in 24 hours and an impressive 45% surge over two days. These moves indicate strong bullish momentum that reminds investors of Solana’s early rallies. This crossover suggests a potential trend reversal, fueling optimism that SEI may mirror the kind of explosive growth Solana once experienced. Ethena (ENA) – Bullish Patterns Support Growth Ethena (ENA) has also been tipped for major upside potential to a significant height. The token is at $0.6432, and has climbed 28.24% over the past month, showing steady accumulation and a bullish potential. Technical signals are lining up in its favor. ENA recently broke out of a falling wedge pattern between $0.655 and $0.660, a formation often associated with trend reversals. Price projections suggest potential moves toward $0.74–$0.76, with the possibility of touching $0.85 in the short term. This points to growing investor confidence, echoing Solana’s early growth trajectory. Jupiter (JUP) – Strong Technical Breakout Jupiter (JUP) rounds out the list of four coins tipped to mirror Solana’s rise. With the token at $0.5278, JUP has seen a 4.73% gain in the last 24 hours and a 19.31% pump over the past week. Its breakout from a falling wedge pattern adds to the bullish sentiment, with resistance range set at $0.5820 and $0.8481. Its high trading volume of $82.59m reflects growing market interest, suggesting that the token could continue building upward momentum as investors take notice of its potential. These factors could make Ethena (ENA) mirror Solana’s (SOL) rise, giving significant returns on investments. Conclusion Solana’s history shows how transformative early investments can be, and now four coins, Little Pepe, Sei, Ethena, and Jupiter, are being highlighted as potential stars of the next cycle. While each has merit, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is clearly stealing the spotlight with its unique value proposition, booming presale, and strong backing. With a community-driven approach and forecasts of up to 4500% growth, LILPEPE is not just another meme coin—it is positioning itself as the one meme coin investors won’t want to miss.

These emerging cryptocurrencies are projected to offer similar, if not greater, growth trajectories. The Breakout Candidates One of the standout cryptocurrencies predicted to make waves is Little Pepe (LILPEPE). It is not just another meme coin; it has been crafted to counteract the common issue of sniper bots on its blockchain, thereby leveling the playing field for investors. With a robust roadmap aimed at sustaining longer-term value beyond mere speculation, LILPEPE has recently entered its twelfth presale stage, priced attractively at $0.0021 per token. Their presale stages have consistently sold out, demonstrating strong market confidence and a vibrant community backing, underscored by an impressive $22.81 million raised so far. Further instilling investor confidence, LILPEPE has been listed on CoinMarketCap , marking a significant milestone for its pre-launch phase. Another cryptocurrency garnering attention is Sei (SEI). It has exhibited a notable price jump to $0.3227, reflecting a robust momentum reminiscent of the early days of Solana. This uptick is seen by many as the precursor to a larger bullish trend that could echo Solana's historical performance. Technical Indicators and Market Movements Meanwhile, Ethena (ENA) and Jupiter (JUP) are making their mark through strong technical indicators and market movements. ENA, for instance, has broken out from a falling wedge pattern, a bullish signal typically indicating potential reversals and substantial future gains. Currently priced at $0.6432, ENA's upward movement could reach between $0.74 and $0.85 in the short term. Jupiter (JUP), with its recent price increase to $0.5278 and a significant trading volume of $82.59 million, shows signs of a strong breakout from similar bullish patterns. This activity suggests JUP may continue to capture investor interest, potentially replicating the kind of returns seen in Solana's early days. Conclusion The early success story of Solana is pivotal in understanding the potential of these four cryptocurrencies. Of them, LILPEPE is particularly promising with its unique approach and substantial community support. For investors and enthusiasts looking to capture possibly exponential gains, these cryptocurrencies offer intriguing possibilities reminiscent of Solana's rise.

As Solana (SOL) hovers in a 36-day consolidation phase, analysts are eyeing a potential breakout, but the real spotlight is shifting toward Mutuum Finance’s accelerating momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in presale phase 6 priced at $0.035. Phase 7 will see a rise of 14.29% to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) already has more than $15.15 million worth of investment and over 15,800 investors supporting it. With growing market, rising on-chain activity, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a key catalyst in the DeFi market. Solana Poised for Breakout After 36-Day Calm Solana (SOL), currently priced around $202, has been consolidating for 36 days, forming a bullish ascending triangle, a pattern often seen as a precursor to an upward move. Analysts highlight that a convincing breakout above the $207–$210 resistance zone, backed by strong trading volume, could propel SOL toward $250–$300, fueled further by growing on-chain engagement and intensified institutional interest. As SOL prepares for a possible breakout, investor attention is also broadening to include emerging DeFi names like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) can be bought for $0.035 at presale stage 6. More than $15.15 million has been raised and over 15800 early birds have bought tokens. Token price in Presale Stage 7 will be $0.04, a 14.3% boost from Stage 6. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has introduced its Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. Its users can look forward to getting a share of the program reward, valued at $50,000 USDT, if they manage to find possible bugs in the project. The bounty program aims to provide the same security to all types of vulnerabilities. The program includes four classes of severity, i.e., major, minor, low, and critical. Mutuum Finance Announces Huge Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also made an announcement of a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 participants will be rewarded in the form of $10,000 MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is working on an overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The project is also audited and verified by CertiK. The Future of Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance’s non-custodial lending protocol facilitates decentralized lending under which the owners of assets have complete control over their assets while lending. Passive income is obtained by lenders and borrowers obtain money automatically by collateralizing diversified assets at the time of lending. Systematic adjustment of rates by the system results in maximum capital structure and sustainability of the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a double-lending scenario with best-in-class freedom to clients in the form of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) frameworks. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model is run on smart contracts to control lending pools that dynamically adjust levels of interest in flawless harmony with the market. The lenders receive secured yields, and the borrowers have secure options on borrowing capital on loan. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) eliminates middlemen with agent direct interaction between lending and borrowing parties. Risky assets like meme coins require the type of fully decentralized framework which provides users with maximum agency. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has attracted over $15.15 million and more than 15,800 early investors at a presale price of $0.035. With its dual lending model, CertiK-audited infrastructure, and USD-pegged stablecoin in development, the project is building momentum ahead of its next price increase to $0.04 in Stage 7. Early participation offers a favorable entry before the next phase pushes valuations higher.

They are still talked about daily across crypto Twitter and Reddit threads. But a new rival is stepping into the spotlight, and it could be the one to change the story in 2025. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is more than just another frog-themed token. It has built its own Layer 2 network, packed with real features that meme fans and serious investors have requested. With the presale already delivering over 2x gains for early participants and a projected 45x growth potential by the end of 2025, Little Pepe is quickly positioning itself as a stronger alternative to the meme giants. Why Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Stands Out At its current stage, Little Pepe is priced at $0.0021. This might not seem obvious, but the numbers tell a different story. Stage 10 of the presale closed earlier than expected after raising more than $19.3 million. Stage 11 quickly followed, pushing the fundraising total to over $22.3 million. In Stage 12, more than 14.4 billion tokens have already been sold, leaving only a small window for investors to secure the presale price before the launch price moves to $0.0030. That means current investors are still looking at a potential 42% gain by launch. Early buyers from Stage 1 have already seen gains of around 110%. This steady growth in demand is not just luck. It is powered by features that set Little Pepe apart from rivals like PEPE, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu. The project runs on its own Layer 2 chain, making transactions faster and cheaper. More importantly, it includes anti-sniper bot technology and fairness tools to give community members a level playing field. That kind of infrastructure is rare in meme tokens. PEPE, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and the Competition PEPE still holds a top 31 ranking on CoinMarketCap with a live price hovering near $0.000013 at the time of writing. It saw huge growth in 2023 and 2024, but things have slowed down, with it’s daily trading volume now sitting above $1 billion. Dogecoin is trading around $0.23 with a market value of more than $35 billion, while Shiba Inu is priced near $0.000013, and because of its massive supply, it is harder for the price to climb. These coins are still well known, but they are not changing or improving very fast. Little Pepe, by contrast, is introducing staking rewards, zero taxes, and a launchpad for other meme projects that want to build on its chain. This gives it utility beyond being a speculative play, which explains why the presale moves so quickly. Top meme coin | Source: CoinMarketCap Real Momentum and Community Trust Trust is a crucial concept in crypto, and Little Pepe is taking steps to earn it. Certik has already audited the project and now holds a live listing on CoinMarketCap. It also runs a 777k giveaway , pulling in thousands of participants across social platforms. Beyond that, Google trend data shows something eye-opening. Between June and August 2025, search interest in LILPEPE peaked above PEPE, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu. On ChatGPT’s memecoin question volume, LILPEPE even scored 100, showing that the curiosity around the project has reached a tipping point. Why Analysts See 45x Growth Potential Crypto analysts and publications from GlobeNewswire have pointed out that Little Pepe is riding more than just a wave of hype. With a Layer 2 foundation, growing community support, and strong fundraising milestones, it resembles a project with staying power. The presale is almost complete at $22.8 million raised out of a $25.4 million goal for Stage 12. With 19 total stages planned, the token has proven that demand is real. If the launch price of $0.0030 is reached and broader market trends push meme coins higher in Q4 2025, the 45x growth projection is reasonable. For anyone considering entering the next phase of meme coin evolution, this could be the time to take a closer look at Little Pepe . If the numbers keep stacking up, 2025 may be the year this frog jumps past its rivals.

This move is part of 21Shares’s wider strategy to expand access to innovative areas of the digital asset market through regulated and exchange-listed products. 21Shares’ Broader ETF Vision This product carries a 2.50% fee, and it debuted on SIX Swiss Exchange. This initiative is set to give investors an easy and trusted way to gain exposure to Hyperliquid. This is a fast-growing decentralized exchange that is reshaping crypto derivatives and blockchain-based trading. 21Shares, based in Switzerland, is known as a pioneer in crypto investment products . It launched the first physically backed crypto ETP in 2018 and has since grown into one of the biggest names in the industry. Today, its products span from single-asset ETPs on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to digital products focused on staking, decentralized finance (DeFi), and layer-1 blockchains. The launch of HYPE continues this approach. This shows 21Shares’ drive to give investors access to well-known cryptocurrencies. 21Shares Brings Hyperliquid Access to Investors with New ETP Hyperliquid, launched in 2023, has quickly risen to the top in decentralized trading, handling over $2.07 trillion in total volume and about $8 billion each day. The exchange controls about 80% of the decentralized perpetuals market. It is also building long-term infrastructure by combining trading, blockchain, and development. According to 21Shares’ Mandy Chiu, the platform is reshaping derivatives like top ETF issuers once reshaped traditional markets. With HYPE, investors now have an institutional-grade way to access this fast-growing sector through a trusted ETP structure. Strong Foundations and Ecosystem Growth Hyperliquid stands out with strong finances and a self-sustaining model. Over 95% of its revenue is reinvested daily into token buybacks, already passing $1 billion. While its monthly revenues of more than $56 million show it runs without venture capital, and gives most of its tokens to the community. Its fully on-chain setup makes trading faster and more reliable, and wallet integrations like Phantom have helped it grow its users. With Hyperliquid Chain and HyperEVM, developers can build directly on its ecosystem, making it a full platform for decentralized finance. The launch of the 21Shares Hyperliquid ETP is not just another product but part of 21Shares’ bigger goal to provide regulated access to the most innovative parts of blockchain.

As spot market volatility intensified, many XRP holders began seeking more stable and predictable return channels. Against this backdrop, OurCryptoMiner has gradually become a focus of investors. The platform’s fixed-income cloud mining contracts offer users stable daily returns, with a single contract yielding up to $9,570 per day, effectively mitigating the uncertainty caused by market volatility. OurCryptoMiner offers multiple contract tiers designed to accommodate different investment sizes and risk profiles: contract Number of days Investment Amount Contract Rewards Total income New user contracts 2day $100 $4 $108 Bitcoin Miner S19k Pro 7 day $600 $7.2 $50.4 Canaan Avalon Miner 1466 12 day $1200 $15.84 $190.08 Canaan Avalon A15XP 25 day $3500 $48.65 $1216.25 Bitmain Antminer S23 Immersion 32 day $7900 $114.55 $4238.35 Bitmain Antminer S23 XP+ Hyd 37 day $10000 $155 $5735 ANTSPACE HK3 V6 50 day $55000 $1061.5 $53075 Hydro Cooling HC40 53 day $97000 $2376.5 $125954.5 These contracts are backed by reliable hardware, such as the Bitcoin Miner S19k Pro and the Canaan Avalon A15XP, and all profits are automatically settled and distributed to user accounts daily, ensuring transparency and stable returns. OurCryptoMiner differentiates itself not only through its stable contract model but also through its emphasis on sustainability. The platform’s mining operations are powered entirely by solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. In an era when cryptocurrency mining faces growing ecological criticism, OurCryptoMiner’s infrastructure offers a green alternative that meets environmental standards and global net-zero goals. Investor demand for such solutions is growing. According to a recent Forbes report, institutional investors are showing a surge in interest in environmentally friendly crypto infrastructure. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that a growing number of countries are providing policy support for crypto mining projects that rely on renewable energy, which not only helps mitigate carbon emissions but also promotes sustainable development for the entire blockchain industry. OurCryptoMiner also maintains strong security and insurance protocols: User deposits are held in SSL-encrypted custody by publicly audited banks. All futures contracts are insured by AIG, providing additional financial security. New users receive a $12 trial credit upon registration , allowing them to explore contract terms without upfront payment. The platform also offers 24/7 customer support and a team of market analysts who provide customized insights to help users optimize their contract selection during the ever-changing cryptocurrency cycle. Furthermore, OurCryptoMiner publishes transparent operational metrics on its dashboard, including hash rate utilization, energy mix, and daily revenue statistics. This transparency fosters trust and allows users to verify real-time performance against contract expectations. Based on investment trends, fixed-income mining contracts like OurCryptoMiner are becoming a leading choice for capital preservation and stable returns. A CoinDesk report highlights that during periods of market volatility, investors are increasingly turning to tools that offer daily returns, including staking and contract-based mining solutions. In summary, OurCryptoMiner proposes a hybrid model that combines renewable energy infrastructure, smart contract technology, and stable passive income. This model supports environmentally friendly blockchain operations while mitigating the risks associated with price volatility. For XRP holders and cryptocurrency investors more broadly, it offers a new paradigm—one that combines income stability with environmental responsibility. As market uncertainty persists, fixed-income mining contracts are likely to become a crucial component of crypto asset allocation strategies. Platforms like OurCryptoMiner are paving the way.

According to a Saturday report by the Nikkei newspaper, the dispute was caused by a revised directive from President Donald Trump that included a commitment for Japan to boost imports of U.S. rice, despite an earlier understanding that agricultural tariffs would not be further reduced. U.S.–Japan trade talks have stalled due to dispute over rice Trade negotiations between the United States and Japan have hit a roadblock after the Trump administration pressed Tokyo to increase purchases of American rice. The disagreement led Japan’s top tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, to abruptly cancel a planned trip to the United States this week. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi confirmed the cancellation on Thursday, citing “points that need to be discussed at the administrative level” as the reason. Akazawa originally made the trip to finalize Japan’s obligations in the $550B investment package it agreed with the United States, involving government-backed loans and guarantees. The precise contents of that package remain unclear, but Japanese officials have said they want an amended presidential executive order eliminating overlapping tariffs on Japanese goods before they sign off on a joint document outlining the investment details. Trump administration’s push for increased rice imports The Nikkei report, citing unnamed Japanese government officials, stated that Tokyo’s objections were rooted in concerns over sovereignty and domestic policy. One official criticized the American proposal as an “interference in domestic affairs.” Trump’s demand contradicts a deal made in July, in which the White House said Japan would increase its imports of U.S. rice by 75%. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba acknowledged at the time that U.S. rice might gain a larger share of the Japanese market, but emphasized that the arrangement would occur within the existing tariff-free system and would “not sacrifice” Japan’s agricultural sector. Agriculture is one sector that Japan has always considered off limits in past trade negotiations. Domestic rice farmers have historically enjoyed strong protection, and different administrations have avoided any concessions in that area, as it may undermine rural political support. Opposition leader Yuichiro Tamaki of the Democratic Party for the People has jumped on the absence of a written agreement to lead the domestic criticism , questioning the government’s handling of the talks. “Because there is no written agreement, we cannot confirm what the problem is,” Tamaki said in a statement on X. He also called on Prime Minister Ishiba to convene parliament and provide a full explanation of the trade deal’s status. Tamaki further argued that any additional concessions on agriculture would require parliamentary approval. He also cited “heightened uncertainty” for Japan’s auto industry and its workers.

The price of Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell to a new low of $107,850 at the start of the weekend. Unsurprisingly, the latest data shows that this latest price decline seen across the digital asset market could have been predicted. This conclusion is based on recent crypto activity on the world’s largest search engine, Google. Is The Crypto Bull Cycle Over? In an August 29 post on social media platform X, Alphractal founder and CEO Joao Wedson revealed that crypto-related searches on Google have surged to new highs in recent days. According to the on-chain data expert, this recent spike in Google searches suggests that Bitcoin and the broader crypto market might have reached a new local top. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Plunge Sparks Outrage: Binance Targeted For Alleged Market Manipulation This revelation is based on the Google Trends chart, which allows investors to assess the social engagement of different crypto-related topics on the search engine. As shown in the chart below, the metric compares various subjects, including cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, altcoins, centralized exchanges, and data aggregation platforms. As observed in the highlighted chart, the Google Trends metric recently witnessed a significant surge, suggesting increased public attention across multiple crypto topics. According to Wedson, spikes of this kind have historically coincided with whales entering the market to sell while “everyone is obsessed.” Moreover, the cryptocurrency market has often shown in the past its tendency to move in the crowd’s opposite direction. These trends explain the price decline witnessed by most digital assets in the past few days, as the market has seemingly reached a new local top. Wedson, however, noted that other on-chain signals say that the latest euphoria-driven market downturn doesn’t necessarily spell the end of the current bull cycle. “Think back to BTC hitting $124K—euphoria peaked online, whales sold aggressively, and we went short,” the Alphractal founder added. Wedson then advised investors to exercise caution when euphoria hits the crypto market, as it could hint at the imminence of a local top. The crypto analyst said that a better strategy would be to smartly exit the market at a high price and reenter at a cheaper rate later. Total Crypto Market Cap At $3.7 Trillion As of this writing, the total crypto market capitalization sits just above $3.7 trillion, reflecting an almost 4% decline in the past day. According to data from TradingView, more than $142 billion has been drained out of the crypto market in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Stop $183K?

50925812,569957,1756580420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50925812.jpeg,SEC Receives Filing For XRP Option ETF From $12-B Amplify,https://bitcoinist.com/sec-receives-filing-for-xrp-option-etf-from-12-b-amplify/,"Based on an SEC filing, Amplify — an asset manager overseeing $12.6 billion — has submitted paperwork for an XRP Option Income ETF that it plans to list on the Cboe BZX Exchange and start trading in November. Rather than buying XRP outright, the fund seeks market exposure by holding ETFs that track XRP and by writing options to generate yield. Amplify Seeks An Options-Based XRP Play The filing outlines the fund’s composition. A minimum of 80% of the portfolio will be invested in instruments tied to XRP’s price, including shares of XRP ETFs and options written on those ETF shares. The other 20% will be allocated to US Treasuries, cash, or similar short-term instruments. The fund intends to use option contracts to build synthetic exposure — for instance, pairing bought calls with sold puts at identical strikes and expirations, or buying in-the-money calls. That arrangement is designed to produce steady option premium income from selling options on ETFs referencing XRP. Futures Action Suggests Demand Analysts look to futures markets for indications of investor demand. CME XRP futures and futures-linked ETFs have had momentum in the past, indicating there is demand. Nate Geraci, president and chairman of The ETF Store, has been projecting approvals could unleash high levels of interest in XRP products, likening the inflows to what occurred with Bitcoin futures-linked ETFs. Look at all of the crypto ETF filings out there… @JSeyff doing God’s work tracking these. What I mean by “crypto ETF floodgates about to open soon”. pic.twitter.com/9tpcrtnQjm — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) August 28, 2025 Big capital flows followed the introduction of Bitcoin futures ETFs, and a few market observers anticipate similar flows for other tokens if access to spot ETFs widens. Indirect Exposure, Different Risks Because the fund won’t hold the token directly, investors would gain indirect exposure to price swings in XRP through ETF shares and derivative strategies rather than direct token custody. That contrasts with the spot ETF bids currently pending with the SEC. Amplify’s structure may attract investors chasing option premium while avoiding the operational and custody issues tied to holding XRP directly.

Among those are seven spot ETF bids from Grayscale, 21Shares, Canary, Bitwise, Wisdomtree, CoinShares, and Franklin Templeton. There are at least 96 crypto-related ETF filings with the SEC overall, according to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart. Market participants are watching an October deadline closely, with some expecting the agency to rule on multiple proposals around that time.

XRP continues to experience increased interest from the market following its institutional interest, yet another project is taking steps of its own to become the top altcoin. Remittix (RTX) , a strong contender, takes centre stage with its advanced payment technology. Its ongoing presale has raised over $22.2 million, with each token trading at a discounted $0.1030 per token. Let’s find out more! XRP Price Momentum And Wider Market Context The XRP Price has piqued traders’ interest as the recovery in the broader cryptocurrency market continues. Currently trading at approximately $2.86, with a slight decline of 0.12% over the last seven days due to market volatility, analysts have high hopes that the project will soon soar to $4. Yet, top analysts like Ali Martinez believe that the XRP price will continue to retrace. Even though most XRP investors are holding out for the next potential rally, some are on the lookout for newer altcoins. Why Remittix Is Getting Attention Remittix, a rising star, is garnering support with its distinct cross-border technology, which offers a similar appeal to XRP. Where XRP has established itself in cross-border payments, RTX is following a similar path, but with more comprehensive tools tailored to meet the demands of the 2025 market. At its core, Remittix focuses on solving real-world problems in crypto adoption. Traditional remittances are expensive and slow, and most crypto projects fail to make a connection to everyday finance. Remittix flips that challenge on its head by making crypto-to-bank transfers directly accessible in over 30 countries, with support for more than 40 cryptocurrencies at launch. The presale has already exceeded expectations, with over $22.2 million collected and more than 630 million tokens sold. Momentum has also been fueled by its confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank, two major centralised exchanges that bring added liquidity and visibility to RTX. Some of the features that are making investors take notice of RTX include: Low gas fee crypto transfers for cross-border payments Cross-border remittances in multiple currencies Beta wallet launch in Q3 2025 with real-time FX conversion A $250,000 Remittix Giveaway for early adopters The Road Ahead For RTX Among the most awaited milestones is the upcoming beta wallet. Scheduled for Q3 2025, the wallet will enable users to send cryptocurrency directly to traditional bank accounts, utilising real-time foreign exchange rates. The simplicity of this model enables the onboarding of mainstream users, ranging from freelancers to small businesses, into the DeFi ecosystem. With the presale already exceeding the $22.2 million mark and further exchange listings on the pipeline, Remittix is positioning itself to be among the best crypto presales of 2025. While XRP Price continues to hog the headlines, RTX is under the radar as a new altcoin with a genuine real-world use case. For anyone researching upcoming crypto projects, Remittix’s roadmap, wallet launch, and exchange listings position it well for long-term adoption.

Key points highlighted in Zhou's article include: Decentralization isn’t suitable for every financial service: Zhou noted that the notion that “every service needs to be decentralized” is overblown, and that account-based centralized management systems are still operating strongly. Technology is not a sufficient criterion: The success of payment systems depends not only on technical advantages but also on factors such as security and regulatory compliance. Market manipulation and investor risk: Stabilcoin argued that price and market manipulation in the stablecoin markets has not yet been prevented, which magnifies the risk by attracting unqualified investors. Insufficient demand problem: Zhou stated that stablecoins without sufficient usage may not be able to circulate effectively in the market, so they cannot be issued even if a license is obtained. The advantage of existing payment systems: He reminded that the current system, especially in individual payments, has already fallen to very low levels in terms of cost, and the use of stablecoins will not be exempt from regulation costs such as KYC and AML. Related News: BREAKING NEWS: Binance Makes Weekend Altcoin Listing - Adds to Both Alpha and Futures Trading Zhou noted that stablecoin issuers tend to minimize costs and maximize issuance to gain wider acceptance, an approach similar to central banks' power to “print money.” However, stablecoin issuers' lack of understanding of monetary policy and macroeconomic regulations brings with them the risks of uncontrolled issuance and high leverage. Although regulations such as the GENIUS Act in the US and the Stablecoin Law in Hong Kong seek to solve these problems, Zhou stated that current controls are inadequate and drew attention to the following issues: Reserve management: Where and by whom are the reserves of issued stablecoins held is a critical issue. There have been past examples of this responsibility being overlooked. Multiplier effect: Post-issuance transactions (deposits, loans, and collateralized transactions) also create a money supply multiplier for stablecoins. This poses a significant risk in the event of a liquidity crisis. Zhou stated that price manipulation and transparency issues pose serious risks on cryptocurrency exchanges where stablecoins are heavily used, and that current regulations remain inadequate to address this. He also noted that fragmented trading opportunities through stablecoins and RWA (real-world assets) encourage young investors under the age of 18 to enter the market, which is questionable from an investor protection perspective. *This is not investment advice.

At its Retail Rewired innovation event, the company debuted four agents. Marty for sellers and suppliers, Sparky for shoppers, an Associate Agent for employees, and a Developer Agent. Tariffs, inflation, and other cost pressures have raised doubts about household spending, pushing retailers to look for ways to keep sales moving. Some are betting on hands-on service led by store teams, while others are turning to artificial intelligence to streamline how people shop. Walmart falls into the latter group. The four AI agents handle jobs such as payroll, paid time off, merchandising, and recommending items for specific occasions, bringing many tools together to simplify how people interact with the company. “Having a plethora of different agents can very quickly become confusing,” Suresh Kumar, chief technology officer for Walmart Global, said at the event. David Glick, senior vice president for Enterprise Business Solutions at Walmart, said the Associate Agent serves as “a single point of entry where any associate can find access to all of the agents we’ve built on the back end.” “As you speak to it more, as you work with it more, it’ll know more about you”, he added. Walmart is not alone in leaning into AI. The shift comes as retailers search for ways to blunt rising costs for consumers and meet policy pressures. During Amazon’s four-day Prime Day in July, generative AI usage climbed 3,300% year over year. Google Cloud AI also teamed with body-care brand Lush to visually identify unpackaged products, helping lower training costs for new staff. Walmart is also investing in spatial and physical AI by building “digital twins” of its stores and clubs, virtual replicas used to monitor and manage operations. With this approach, the company can “detect, diagnose and remediate issues up to two weeks in advance,” said Brandon Ballard, group director for real estate at Walmart US. The company says this work is paying off. “Last year, we cut all of our emergency alerts by 30% and we reduced our maintenance spend in refrigeration by 19% across Walmart US,” he added as quoted in a CNBC’s report . Walmart uses AI to improve delivery time accuracy “At its core, retail is a physical business,” said Alex de Vigan, CEO and founder of Nfinite, which produces large-scale visual data to train spatial and physical AI systems. “We’ve seen retailers use digital twins to reduce setup time for new promotions, reallocate labor more efficiently, and improve robotic picking accuracy, small gains that add up quickly when margins are under stress,” he said. Although shoppers may not directly notice digital-twin work the way they would a tool like Sparky, the effects reach the customer experience. “Better stock accuracy, faster site updates, and fewer order issues mean a smoother retail experience, even in a tighter economy,” said de Vigan. Behind the scenes, Walmart is also applying machine learning to refine delivery-time predictions so customers have clearer expectations and operations run more efficiently. On the consumer side, Sparky already builds carts based on an understanding of each shopper’s needs. Walmart is developing the agent so it can automatically reorder staples, aiming to ease the mental task of restocking. For retailers, AI is one lever to offset a potential cooling in consumer demand. What remains to be seen is how a fully connected AI experience, online and in stores, will reshape how people shop over time. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

In an X post on August 29, Pal highlighted that Total3, which tracks the performance of cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), is on the verge of leaving this waiting room. https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI/status/1961230439106187409 He noted that altcoins outside the top 10 are also lined up, representing what he called the purest form of an altcoin season, though these may take longer before fully launching. Among individual assets, Pal noted that Ethereum is already in full rotation, while Solana ( SOL ) is positioned as the next to break out. Other tokens, including Sui ( SUI ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), and XRP , remain in the waiting room but are expected to follow once broader altcoins begin moving. XRP, in particular, is in the process of transitioning into a full cycle move. Catalysts for cryptocurrencies According to Pal, the macro backdrop remains highly supportive for digital assets. Rising global liquidity, driven by the need for the U.S., Europe, China, and Japan to roll over large debt loads, creates what he sees as an “absurdly bullish” environment. Total liquidity index chart. Source: GMI “And the rate of change is only going to rise in the key metric of Total Global Liquidity. US, EU, China and Japan all need to roll debts. This is an absurdly bullish backdrop, along with the reg changes, DAT’s and sovereign accumulation along with Wall Street acceptance,” Pal said. Regulatory shifts, the development of digital asset technology, sovereign-level accumulation, and increasing Wall Street involvement further reinforce the case for sustained momentum. At the same time, Pal’s Global Macro Investor (GMI) framework, built on analysis of over a thousand key charts, suggests the ongoing crypto cycle could extend well into the first quarter of 2026 and possibly into the second quarter, fueled by prolonged business cycle dynamics and liquidity injections.

50927344,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=197493,1756582987,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/50927344.jpeg,"XRP News Today: Live Snapshot, ETF Watch & Outlook",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/xrp-price-today/,"BitcoinWorld XRP News Today: Live Snapshot, ETF Watch & Outlook New Delhi — Aug 31, 2025 — The XRP price is hovering near the $2.8 mark as traders weigh three big drivers: fresh legal clarity after the SEC case concluded, the prospect of U.S. spot ETF approvals under looser listing standards, and ongoing adoption developments in global payments infrastructure. As of early Monday (IST), XRP trades around $2.81 , with a circulating supply near 59.48B and a market capitalization around $167B . XRP Price Today — Quick Stats (Snapshot) Spot level (approx.): ~$2.81 24h trend: roughly flat to slightly negative at last check Market cap: ~$167B Circulating supply: ~59.48B XRP These figures can move quickly during active sessions; the live panel on your preferred price index should be treated as the source of truth. What moved the XRP price lately? Two macro catalysts are front and center: Finality in the SEC vs. Ripple case. On Aug 8, 2025 , U.S. regulators ended their lawsuit against Ripple, with the company agreeing to a $125M penalty. The settlement effectively cemented prior court guidance: XRP traded on public exchanges is not a security , while institutional-style sales remain subject to securities laws—removing a major overhang that had persisted since 2020. Markets typically reward regulatory clarity, especially in YMYL assets. ETF watch—potentially easier approval path. U.S. exchanges have proposed generic listing standards for crypto-based exchange-traded products that, if approved by the SEC, could arrive as early as late September 2025 . That change would streamline the process across multiple tokens— including XRP —by reducing reliance on one-off 19b-4 approvals. A more predictable rulebook could accelerate the launch pipeline and deepen spot-market liquidity. Price Context: Range, Momentum & Key Levels Recent range: In the final week of August, XRP oscillated roughly between $2.82 and $3.01 , a tight band compared with earlier summer spikes. Short-term swings clustered near the $2.96 and $2.82 prints before moderating into the weekend. YCharts Yahoo Finance Medium-term trend: After reclaiming multi-year highs this year, price action has cooled into consolidation as traders digest legal headlines and await ETF clarity. Some analysts frame this as “base building” before a potential next leg, though that depends on flows and macro risk appetite. Levels to watch: Immediate support: the $2.80–$2.82 zone has been a frequent pivot in recent sessions. Deeper supports (historical pivots): $2.63–$2.65 (summer pullbacks), and the psychological $2.50 handle. Upside inflections: a decisive reclaim of $3.00 often attracts momentum traders; sustained closes above $3.10–$3.15 would strengthen the bullish case. Methodology note: For intraday decision-making, always cross-check with a live chart and L2 order-book data. End-of-day historical series (e.g., YCharts/Yahoo Finance) help frame context but can lag fast markets. YCharts Yahoo Finance Legal Clarity: Why the SEC Closure Matters for the XRP Price The SEC’s case closure on Aug 8, 2025 ended years of uncertainty that deterred some institutions, OTC desks, and market-makers. The settlement outlined a $125M payment from Ripple and confirmed that secondary-market trading of XRP is outside securities treatment—while institutional sales remain regulated. This dual outcome reduces headline risk for exchanges and custodians while keeping compliance obligations intact for structured sales—conditions that can encourage liquidity to return in a more orderly way. ETF Timelines: What Could Unlock the Next Leg While no XRP spot ETF has been approved in the U.S. as of this writing, two developments are noteworthy: Structural reform: The SEC is considering generic listing standards for crypto ETPs, which could materially simplify launches and lower approval friction. If adopted (potentially by late Sep 2025 ), the door opens to a broader slate of spot products beyond BTC/ETH, improving mainstream access and, potentially, price discovery. Filing activity: Managers continue to probe the pipeline. Recent coverage highlighted a new filing aimed at bringing an XRP ETF to market, signaling issuer demand to list products once the rulebook stabilizes. Even if timing remains uncertain, the mere presence of filings keeps speculative flows in play. Why this matters for “xrp price”: Spot ETFs can aggregate retail and advisory demand, standardize custody, and increase two-way liquidity through authorized participants. For a top-five asset by market cap, even modest net inflows can shift price equilibrium. Adoption & Utility: Beyond Speculation XRP’s core use-case remains fast, low-cost cross-border settlement . New custody and banking rails can nudge conservative institutions to interact with the asset. This month, Korean custodian BDACS rolled out XRP custody for institutions , expanding compliant infrastructure in a major Asian market. Such integrations, while not linear catalysts, typically increase rails for inflows and lower friction for treasury experiments and corridor pilots. Why utility matters to price: Over time, real transaction demand (remittances, B2B payouts, treasury moves) can smooth out purely speculative cycles. As rails deepen, volatility bands can compress, and order books can absorb larger flows without dislocation—benefits that often reflect in tighter spreads and improved market depth. Short-Term Drivers to Watch Rulemaking headlines: Any SEC updates on generic standards—or an outright greenlight—could pull forward ETF expectations and re-price the curve. Macro risk sentiment: Dollar index swings, front-end yields, and liquidity conditions across crypto majors frequently spill into XRP. Exchange flows & funding: Sustained positive funding with flat price can flag crowded longs; rising open interest into resistance raises fake-out risk. Legal/compliance housekeeping: Post-settlement operational updates from Ripple, exchanges, and custodians (listing status, institutional programs) can toggle access and, by extension, depth. Risks & What Could Go Wrong ETF delays or denials: If the SEC slows or rejects the proposed standards—or applies unexpected criteria—risk assets tied to ETF narratives can underperform. Liquidity fragmentation: Cross-venue spreads can widen during risk-off tapes, amplifying drawdowns. Regulatory divergence: Non-U.S. regimes can move in different directions, complicating global alignment. Over-optimistic targets: Analyst calls projecting multi-fold gains often rely on aggressive adoption curves and benign macro. Treat them as scenarios, not base cases. Bottom Line: What the “XRP Price Today” Tells Us The xrp price is consolidating after a major legal overhang lifted and ETF hopes moved into focus via potential rule changes. Price action around $2.8 suggests a market balancing two forces: improving institutional access (custody, clarity, filings) and a still-uncertain policy timeline for spot products. For now, $2.80–$3.00 remains the battleground; a clean break and hold above $3.10–$3.15 would strengthen momentum into September, while sustained closes below $2.80 would warn of deeper tests. Editorial note: This is not investment advice . Crypto assets are highly volatile. Do your own research and consider professional guidance where appropriate. FAQs: XRP Price (Quick Answers) Q1) What is the XRP price today? Around $2.81 at press time (IST). Always check a live index for the latest print and 24h change. CoinMarketCap Q2) Did the SEC case impact XRP’s price? Yes— case closure on Aug 8, 2025 reduced headline risk and clarified treatment of exchange-traded XRP, improving the backdrop for liquidity and institutional access. Q3) When could an XRP spot ETF arrive? If the SEC adopts generic ETP listing standards (potentially by late September 2025 ), the path could shorten. Issuer filings are already probing the pipeline. Timing is not guaranteed. Q4) What indicators should traders watch? Key zones near $2.80–$3.15 , funding rates, open interest, and cross-market risk sentiment (DXY, yields). For historical context, use daily closes and multi-week ranges.

Mutuum Finance is in presale stage 6 at $0.035. It will be worth 14.29% more at $0.04 when it is in stage 7 of presale. Mutuum Finance already has over $15.15 million raised and has gained over 15800 investors. While Ripple’s XRP makes headlines for breaking past the $3 threshold, all eyes are on Mutuum Finance’s explosive momentum, driven by growing investor interest, innovative lending protocols, and heightened activity across the DeFi ecosystem. This dual market surge underscores a shifting dynamic where established tokens like XRP continue steady growth, but high-upside DeFi newcomers such as MUTM are increasingly shaping the narrative of crypto’s next wave. XRP Price Outlook: Testing the $3 Threshold XRP is trading at $3.00, hovering at a pivotal resistance point that market watchers say could determine its next move. Analysts note that a sustained breakout above $3.20–$3.40 may pave the way for a move toward $3.70 or higher, supported by improved on-chain metrics and potential institutional interest. However, some caution that repeated rejections around this zone could lead to a pullback toward $2.83 or lower, highlighting the importance of close price structure and volume action in the coming sessions. As XRP’s short-term outlook continues to unfold, investor attention is also expanding toward innovative DeFi platforms like Mutuum Finance that are gaining traction in the broader altcoin market. Mutuum Finance Presale Success Mutuum Finance is thriving in the DeFi market. It has a 95.0/100 trust score, audited and certified by Certik. The project is offering a safe platform to perform DeFi transactions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is introducing tried and tested lending functionalities with the security of a new environment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also has a coming Ethereum, overcollateralized stablecoin that is USD-pegged in the works. It will deliver long-term trust, stability, and liquidity to any customer. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 6 Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum with presale rounds selling fast. The presale is already at level 6 at $0.035. Raising its price to the next level, it will be up by 14.29% to $0.04. Investment hunger is piling up with the project already having raised more than $15.15 million and now with more than 15800 token holders. Strengthening DeFi Security through Giveaway and $50,000 Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has now initiated a $100,000 giveaway . 10 users will be awarded $10,000 MUTM tokens. A top 50 token holder leaderboard has also been initiated by the team, rewarding large holders with additional tokens. Mutuum Finance currently has a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program running in collaboration with CertiK. It will pay and reward all bugs at four levels, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The Next DeFi Lending Generation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers investors a secure and efficient twin lending platform. Smart contracts, enabling Peer-to-Contract model lending, automate the process. Peer-to-Peer infrastructure removes middlemen and gives direct access to each other for borrowers and lenders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has secured over $15.15 million with more than 15,800 early backers at its current presale price of $0.035. As Stage 7 approaches with a 14.29% price increase to $0.04, momentum continues to build around its dual lending model, CertiK audit, and upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin.

Bitcoin ETFs are set to overtake gold ETFs in total assets under management. Bitcoin ETFs Cement Role As Institutional Gateway To Crypto Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are on the brink of making history globally. In an X post , the Kobeissi Letter, an industry-leading commentary on global capital markets, has revealed that BTC ETFs are on track to surpass Gold ETFs in assets under management (AUM) for the first time in history, marking a historic milestone in global markets. Over the past 12 months, AUM in the largest cryptocurrency ETFs has doubled to $150 billion, while gold ETFs have climbed 40% to a record of $180 billion. The comparison highlights how rapidly momentum has shifted. Just three years ago, gold ETFs were five times larger than Bitcoin ETFs. Presently, with accelerating inflows into digital asset products, that gap is narrowing at a historic speed. If current trends continue, Bitcoin ETFs could surpass gold ETFs as early as next year. This is a symbolic flip that underscores the rise of crypto from speculative asset to mainstream portfolio allocation. Lately, ETFs are proving to be the engine behind the current crypto bull market. According to Ucan_Coin, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, oversees nearly 2,000 funds, with about 1,400 of them being ETFs. Clients buy into these funds, while BlackRock earns fees on the assets under management. However, the Bitcoin Spot ETF fee is just 0.25%, but the power lies in scale and liquidity. Over the last two years, ETFs have provided the critical fuel for this rally, with nearly 20% of all liquidity entering crypto now flowing directly from ETF products. As Ucan_Coin highlights, BlackRock’s IBIT stands out. As the chart demonstrates, IBIT is the locomotive pulling the entire market, driving inflows and setting the pace for the broader bull run . ETF Inflows Signal Rising Institutional Appetite For Bitcoin The US spot Bitcoin ETFs are gaining remarkable momentum, while generating $5 to $10 billion in daily volume on their most active trading days. Pushpendra Singh, Co-founder of PushpendraTech and SmartViewAi, has explained that this surge is a clear sign that institutional investors are increasingly seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin, and ETFs are rapidly becoming their preferred gateway. Despite the ETF boom, Binance continues to dominate the spot market, processing between $10 to $18 billion in daily spot volume and holding a 29% market share. This is more than double the 13% market share currently held by US-based ETFs, and it puts Binance comfortably ahead of other major exchanges in terms of liquidity.",Bitcoin News|Assets Under Management|AUM|binance|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Spot ETFs|BlackRock’s IBIT|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Gold ETFs|Pushpendra Singh|PushpendraTech|SmartViewAi|The Kobeissi Letter|Ucan_Coin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-30 20:00:16

On-Chain Data and Analyst Insights Reveal the Truth,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/magacoin-finance-scam-or-opportunity-on-chain-data-and-analyst-insights-reveal-the-truth/,"The crypto industry in 2025 is full of both opportunities and risks. For every project that takes off, there are dozens of scams, rug pulls, and meme coins with no real backing. That’s why investors are asking the big question: Is MAGACOIN FINANCE just another scam, or is it a genuine opportunity to catch the next big presale wave? The answer lies in the numbers and the transparency behind the project. With over $13 million already raised , more than 12,000 confirmed investors , and a growing 25,000+ strong community , MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be one of the most anticipated crypto launches of 2025. Unlike low-effort tokens that hide behind hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE has backed up its claims with audits, real-time presale data, and a clear roadmap — all things that typical scams avoid. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Audited, Verified, and Transparent One of the strongest reasons analysts are confident in MAGACOIN FINANCE is the project’s commitment to security and transparency . Audited by Hashex.org : One of the most respected blockchain security firms has already given MAGACOIN FINANCE the green light. Undergoing CertiK Audit : CertiK, widely seen as the gold standard for smart contract verification, is now reviewing MAGACOIN FINANCE. Few presales put themselves under this level of scrutiny. Visible Presale Tracker : Investors can see live updates of how much has been raised, currently standing at over $13 million. Clear Tokenomics and Roadmap : With supply, vesting, and utility outlined, the project provides a level of clarity missing in many “meme coins.” This type of accountability is exactly what separates MAGACOIN FINANCE from the scams that plague the space.

Over 12,000 investors have bought into the presale, while the community has grown past 25,000 members on Telegram and X (formerly Twitter). What’s even more telling is that whales from Ethereum, Bitcoin, and XRP communities are rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE , signaling belief in the project’s upside potential. According to on-chain data, the presale has now 94% sold out at just $0.004 and the window for early entry is rapidly closing.

Many buyers are rushing to secure their positions before opportunities pass by, creating more attention on projects that are gaining steady traction. Among these, BlockDAG (BDAG) has become a standout name, drawing headlines with its rapid presale success and impressive surge in demand. Alongside BlockDAG, other strong players such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano continue to show growth potential in their networks. Each of these altcoins has unique strengths that make them appealing choices in today’s market and crypto coins to buy to get the most profit. BlockDAG: +2,900% Growth Before Launch with $387 Million Raised BlockDAG is changing how blockchain works by using a mix of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and Proof-of-Work (PoW). This pairing allows lightning-fast transfers, strong scaling ability, and extra security. It fixes the slow speed and high cost that blockchains often face. This makes BlockDAG (BDAG) one of the most attractive altcoins to buy for those watching 2025 closely. The presale results prove the hype. BlockDAG has raised more than $387 million and sold over 25.6 billion BDAG coins while still in Batch 30. Its price jumped from $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.03 now, showing an unbelievable 2,900% rise. These numbers reflect the strong demand already behind this project. Adoption is growing at a record pace, too. More than 200,000 holders are active, and 3 million people are already mining using the X1 Miner app, building trust that BDAG is gaining a huge worldwide following. Experts see the coin hitting as high as $5 in the future. This mix of advanced tech, strong global use, and explosive presale growth puts BlockDAG among the top altcoins to buy right now. For those seeking a high-growth option, BDAG looks ready to take off even more. Ethereum: A Strong Network That Still Delivers Ethereum has long held its place as one of the top altcoins to buy, thanks to its strong foundation and wide adoption. The shift to proof-of-stake cut energy use sharply, while Ethereum 2.0 upgrades continue to target faster speed and lower fees. These updates aim to make the network more efficient and user-friendly. Currently trading near $4,700, ETH still shows room for growth as demand for dApps, NFTs, and DeFi projects keeps rising. The recent GENIUS Act added more momentum, pushing Ether’s price over 50% higher in just a month. With ongoing adoption and strong upgrades, Ethereum remains a solid long-term choice. Solana (SOL): Stable During Market Pressure Solana continues to prove itself as one of the strongest altcoins to buy, showing steady growth even during market volatility. Its high-speed network and low-cost transactions make it a popular choice for developers and users alike. A major boost came when Circle minted 750 million USDC on Solana in a single day, one of the largest single-day stablecoin mints ever recorded. This milestone expanded the stablecoin ecosystem on Solana, proving the chain’s capacity to handle large-scale activity. Trading near $204, SOL shows signs of pushing toward $210 soon. With strong development and consistent demand, Solana remains a reliable pick for this summer. Cardano (ADA): Slow but Building Strength Cardano is gradually regaining strength in the market and proving itself as one of the steady altcoins to buy. After forming a triple bottom at $0.49, ADA broke out with an 11.58% climb, confirming a bullish trend. The coin now shows higher highs and higher lows, signaling stronger momentum. The next challenge lies in breaking through its key resistance points. If ADA succeeds, price targets of $1.19 or even $1.32 may be reached. However, trading volume has dipped, meaning stronger buying pressure is needed to confirm the move. With its focus on research-driven growth, Cardano continues to build its role step by step. Which One Is the Best Crypto Coin to Buy? Every coin mentioned here brings its own strengths to the table. Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano continue to show steady growth and have secured strong positions in the market. However, none of them can match the rare potential that BlockDAG is displaying right now. With its hybrid DAG and PoW design, along with a record-breaking presale and an impressive 2,900% surge in price, BlockDAG stands out as a unique opportunity. Its climb to $0.03 in Batch 30, backed by $387 million raised, highlights the global trust it has already earned. Analysts pointing toward a possible $5 target make BDAG one of the best crypto coins to buy this summer.

50928068,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=197496,1756584234,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/50928068.jpeg,Bitcoin’s Institutional Backbone Strengthens Despite Rotation to Ether,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-institutional-backbone-etf-flows-onchain-signals-aug-2025/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Institutional Backbone Strengthens Despite Rotation to Ether Bitcoin (BTC) remains the crypto market’s institutional anchor even as late-August data show a temporary rotation toward Ether. Fresh ETF flow figures, evolving U.S. rules that improve fund plumbing, and on-chain market structure suggest BTC’s longer-term investment case is intact—supported by deep liquidity and a clear macro narrative, even through pockets of volatility. Reuters +1 Bitcoin Today: Price, Context, and Liquidity Bitcoin surged to fresh records earlier this month on regulatory tailwinds and institutional demand , briefly topping $120,000 before consolidating. Momentum cooled into month-end, with on-chain analysts flagging a nearby support band around the low-$100Ks where buyers historically step in. Liquidity remains robust, and derivatives open interest has stayed elevated, reflecting ongoing institutional participation. Market structure: Glassnode’s late-August read showed BTC trading near $111k , testing technical supports around $107k–$109k , while noting that losses remained relatively shallow given the macro backdrop. Glassnode Insights ETF Flows: The Biggest Driver of Institutional Bitcoin Exposure If 2024 was the year spot Bitcoin ETFs opened the gates, 2025 has been the year flows and rules matured . In July, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs posted record two-day net inflows of $2.2B and $3.4B for the month to that point—evidence that pensions, RIAs, and multi-asset funds are using the wrapper for regulated exposure. A critical July policy shift by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allowing in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs has further reduced frictions and potential tax drag , improving the product’s operational efficiency for large allocators. Into the final August sessions, daily prints have been choppy across issuers—but the flow tape still underscores persistent institutional engagement . (Recent daily totals and cumulative figures are tracked by Farside Investors.) August Rotation to Ether Is Real—but Doesn’t Break the BTC Thesis Data for August show meaningful rotation into U.S. spot Ether ETFs , even as some Bitcoin funds saw outflows. CoinShares’ weekly survey highlighted Bitcoin outflows versus multi-billion-dollar inflows to Ether in mid-to-late August, a pattern echoed by other market trackers. The Block’s synthesis put ETH ETF net inflows on pace for ~$4B for the month, while several trackers show BTC ETFs experiencing net outflows in the same period. What it means: Rotations like this are typical late-cycle behavior as investors seek relative value, yield (via staking in ETH’s case), or fresh narratives. BTC’s case remains macro, liquidity, and reserve-asset–led : it is the deepest, most institutionally held, and most index-like crypto exposure—attributes that do not vanish with a month of rotation. On-Chain Signals: Supportive but Not Euphoric Holder behavior: Glassnode’s week-34 update noted BTC near support with spot demand neutral and perpetuals slightly bearish , a mix that often precedes range-building rather than capitulation. Short-term holders have shown pockets of stress near resistance, but drawdowns have been contained to date. Glassnode Insights Dominance: Bitcoin’s market-cap dominance has eased from recent highs as capital explores ETH and select large-cap alts, yet BTC remains the benchmark allocation for multi-asset managers building long-term crypto sleeves. (Live dominance charts: CoinMarketCap.) CoinMarketCap Supply and Miners: Post-Halving Reality Four months after the April 2024 halving, miner economics have gone through the familiar post-halving squeeze → adaptation cycle. A JPMorgan readout for July showed mining profitability at the highest level since the halving , aided by price strength and efficiency gains across listed miners. Meanwhile, parts of the sector continue to diversify into AI/data-center partnerships to stabilize revenue, a theme tracked since last year. Bottom line: Reduced issuance remains a durable supply headwind , even if price performance doesn’t move in a straight line each post-halving cycle. (Earlier cycle-to-cycle comparisons this year underscored how maturing market structure can temper the amplitude of post-halving rallies.) Policy & Plumbing: Why Rules Matter for Big Money Two developments stand out for Bitcoin’s institutional story this summer: Record-setting ETF intake in July reinforced that regulated wrappers—not offshore venues—now set the marginal demand curve for BTC in the U.S. The SEC’s in-kind creation/redemption green light in late July reduces costs and operational friction, making it easier for large APs to move inventory and keep ETF prices tight to NAV —a crucial feature for buy-and-hold allocators. Add in broader regulatory clarity and the narrative from Washington favoring digital-asset innovation, and the policy backdrop looks more constructive than in prior cycles. Key Data at a Glance (Late August 2025) Price context: BTC made new highs in mid-August before consolidating; late-month ranges clustered around the low-$100Ks per Glassnode. Flows: July set all-time two-day net inflow records for U.S. spot BTC ETFs; August flows turned mixed with ETH leading net inflows per multiple trackers. Rules: In-kind creations/redemptions now allowed for BTC/ETH ETFs, improving fund efficiency. Miners: Profitability in July reached the highest since the halving , per JPMorgan. Why Bitcoin Still Anchors Institutional Crypto Portfolios Even with August’s rotation into Ether, three attributes keep Bitcoin central to institutional portfolios: 1) Depth & Liquidity: Bitcoin’s ETF ecosystem has grown quickly, compressing spreads and deepening two-way markets. That scale is essential for insurers, pensions, and sovereign wealth funds that must move size without slippage. 2) Macro Hedge & Digital Reserve Narrative: BTC behaves as a scarce, policy-independent asset whose supply schedule is transparent and credibly enforced—an investment case that remains distinct from platform tokens. 3) Cleaner Access Pathways: The regulatory arc—spanning spot ETFs, operational enhancements, and standardized custody—lowers career risk for CIOs who might otherwise avoid direct token handling. What to Watch in September ETF Tape: Whether BTC resumes net inflows as month-end rotations settle, especially with in-kind mechanics now embedded. (Daily: Farside.) On-Chain Thresholds: Glassnode’s support/resistance bands around $107k–$113k ; a sustained reclaim could re-ignite trend following. Glassnode Insights Miner Activity: Follow listed-miner updates; profitability trends post-July can influence near-term sell pressure from treasuries. Macro Calendar: Rate-cut expectations and dollar moves—a key driver of risk appetite and cross-asset flows. (Context: Reuters macro coverage of BTC’s record run this month.) Quick FAQ Is Ether “replacing” Bitcoin for institutions? No. August shows rotation , not replacement. Ether’s yield and ETF novelty attracted flows, but BTC retains benchmark status for long-horizon allocators. Do post-halving returns look weaker than past cycles? Yes, this cycle’s amplitude is lower—consistent with a maturing asset class and the rise of ETF-driven demand over speculative spot. That doesn’t negate the supply story; it changes the tempo . What’s the single most important near-term driver? Flows. With in-kind creations/redemptions enabled, watch net ETF intake as the cleanest gauge of incremental institutional demand.

Big amounts of money are leaving familiar coins for this fresh contender. Early numbers suggest XYZVerse could see huge growth in a short time. The shift in investments signals something big is about to happen, and many are watching closely to see who wins. Solana (SOL) Source: TradingView Solana sprinted over the past week, adding 20.61% and lifting the price into the $183.88-$220.07 band. The monthly gain stands at 19.85%, showing the rally is not a one-day wonder. Stretch the view to six months and SOL is up 51.42%, putting it in the top tier of large-cap movers this season. Momentum metrics back the climb. The 10-day simple average at $214.50 already sits above the 100-day mark of $201.97, a classic bullish alignment. RSI at 63.49 and a Stochastic of 87.69 hint at strong but not extreme buying. MACD stays positive at 2.11, pointing to continued pressure on sellers. If buyers push past the nearest resistance at $234.13, focus shifts to $270.32, a jump of about 22% from the top of the current band. Failure to clear $234.13 could send SOL back toward the 161.75 support, nearly 19% below today’s low. Deeper pullbacks may test $125.56, yet the current trend suggests dips are being met with bids. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big.

Attention is shifting to a new meme coin that some believe could become the next favorite. Changing trends and new names might explain what is happening with older tokens. Interest in this rising competitor is growing, leaving many eager to know if it will live up to the hype. Dogecoin (DOGE) Source: TradingView Dogecoin trades between $0.21 and $0.25. The last 7 days brought a 3.86% lift, but the 30-day chart shows a mild 0.31% dip. Even so, the coin is 8.08% higher than 6 months ago, hinting at a steady uptrend that keeps bulls interested. Buyers are poking $0.25. The first ceiling sits at $0.27, about 8% above. A break could open $0.30, a 20% jump from now. If sellers step in, price may drop 14% to $0.19 or 30% to $0.1541. These bands will guide the next move. Momentum is flat. Both 10 day and 100 day averages sit at $0.22, so DOGE hovers near fair value. The neutral RSI backs that view. Should volume rise, odds favor a push to $0.27 before month end. Failure to clear it would likely drag price back inside the $0.21-$0.25 channel. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.005 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Shiba Inu (SHIB) Source: TradingView The coin trades between $0.00001214 and $0.00001364, adding 1.78% over the past week after slipping 3.97% in a month and 7.70% in six months. Buyers are trying to build on the small uptick, but the range remains tight. Price now sits just above the 10-day and 100-day averages at $0.00001258 and $0.00001245. That crossover hints at a steady trend. RSI at 51.18 is neutral, while stochastic at 63.44 leans mild buy. If bulls clear $0.00001433, the next barrier at $0.00001583 could lift SHIB about 20% from today. A drop under $0.00001133 could drag it toward $0.000009833, a similar 20% slide. Short-term bias tilts up because recent green candles outnumber red and the MACD edges higher. Still, the weak monthly chart warns of lingering sellers. A close above $0.00001364 could flip the monthly change from –3.97% to roughly +10%. Failure keeps price boxed in the narrow band and may pull it 8% toward support. Current data favors patience with a slight bullish lean. Conclusion DOGE and SHIB remain strong, but the first all-sport memecoin XYZVerse (XYZ) now captures hype. Its sports focus diverts fresh 2025 bull-run funds, pressing legacy memes lower.

Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Shiba Inu (SHIB) Source: TradingView The coin trades between $0.00001214 and $0.00001364, adding 1.78% over the past week after slipping 3.97% in a month and 7.70% in six months. Buyers are trying to build on the small uptick, but the range remains tight. Price now sits just above the 10-day and 100-day averages at $0.00001258 and $0.00001245. That crossover hints at a steady trend. RSI at 51.18 is neutral, while stochastic at 63.44 leans mild buy. If bulls clear $0.00001433, the next barrier at $0.00001583 could lift SHIB about 20% from today. A drop under $0.00001133 could drag it toward $0.000009833, a similar 20% slide. Short-term bias tilts up because recent green candles outnumber red and the MACD edges higher. Still, the weak monthly chart warns of lingering sellers. A close above $0.00001364 could flip the monthly change from –3.97% to roughly +10%. Failure keeps price boxed in the narrow band and may pull it 8% toward support. Current data favors patience with a slight bullish lean. Conclusion DOGE and SHIB remain solid, yet XYZVerse’s sports-driven meme model and 20,000% ambition attract fresh capital amid the 2025 bull run, hinting at a decisive wealth shift.

That’s what they called the Altseason in the good old days. But now institutions have stepped in, and they aren’t allocating funds toward low‑cap hidden gems. Take SharpLink Gaming, a Nasdaq-listed crypto treasury firm that just purchased $601 million worth of Ethereum (143,593 ETH), boosting its holdings to nearly 740,000 ETH (valued around $3.2 billion) and staking most of it for yield. The institutional capital locked into Ethereum as a strategic reserve play. And SharpLink isn’t alone. MicroStrategy continues to double down on Bitcoin, recently buying 3,081 BTC for $357 million . Its holdings now total an astonishing 632,457 BTC, valued at roughly $46.5 billion—cementing the company as the single largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with ambitions to boost yield targets into 2025. Even the most conservative institutions are stepping in. Harvard University’s endowment fund disclosed new exposure to Bitcoin through BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. Regulatory filings show Harvard’s position alone at $116 million, a sign that even Ivy League treasuries are allocating to BTC in compliance-friendly vehicles. The implications are clear: big players aren’t rotating liquidity into microcaps the way retail once did. Every ETH SharpLink stake and every BTC locked by MicroStrategy or Harvard is capital permanently removed from circulation — and it’s staying there, not flowing into random altcoin pumps. That means the playbook of past bull runs, where profits from BTC and ETH cascaded into obscure tokens and created “altseasons,” is dead. The faucet has been turned off. Why Altseasons Will Be Shorter, Softer Or Never Even if there is an altseason, it won’t look like the old days. In 2017 or 2021, communities moved liquidity downstream. Some analysts don’t even believe there will be an altseason in 2025-2026 at all. At most, we get a “selective altseason” limited to a handful of majors. One of the most decisive shifts in this cycle is the selective nature of institutional flows. Unlike retail traders of past bull runs, institutions can’t—and won’t—throw money at speculative tokens with no liquidity or compliance track record. Funds have mandates. They need deep liquidity, regulatory clarity, and measurable security before deploying capital. That means assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, or BNB attract inflows, while the thousands of tokens sitting below a $1M market cap are effectively invisible. For institutions, these microcaps don’t even register as investable. This shift has two critical consequences: No downstream liquidity: In 2017 and 2021, ETH profits trickled down into meme coins and small alts, fueling altseason manias. Now, liquidity is captured and held in majors. Higher quality filter: Institutions are effectively raising the bar. Only tokens with transparent governance, strong exchanges, and compliance-ready profiles will see meaningful inflows. For the broader market, that means the “lottery ticket” days of random small-cap explosions are gone. Altcoin rallies, if they happen at all, will be shorter, more selective, and centered on majors. Where Multipliers Still Exist: ICO Fund Raising Does this mean no more 100x? Not exactly. The opportunity has simply moved. Today, the realistic path is structured presales where you enter at the absolute floor price. Why ICO-style tokens still make sense: Minimal entry price. Presales start at fractions of a cent, creating huge gaps to listing price. Clear mechanics. Transparent tokenomics, vesting, and liquidity locks build trust — something meme/celebrity coins lack. Growth runway. When a project lists at $0.10 after a presale at $0.001, the math alone gives early investors massive multiples. Unlike chasing altseason dreams, ICO tokens and product-driven presales still offer that explosive upside without relying on institutional liquidity trickling down. XYZVerse.io is one of such projects in presale with a massive upside potential. What’s the Upside for XYZVerse? XYZVerse ($XYZ) is an example of a project that might actually deliver on the promise of massive altcoin gains. Starting at just $0.0001, XYZVerse’s presale applies a dynamic pricing model: every $100,000 raised increments the price, creating real-time upward momentum. So far, the XYZ price has been increased to $0.0053, with over $15 million raised already. If the token lists at $0.10, it could yield a 1,000× multiple for the earliest participants. Even if listing lands below that, the first one to two weeks could see a spike to $0.15–$0.25, especially if exchange listings and FOMO kick in. If XYZ continues executing—building its sports-brand utility, locking liquidity, and rolling out its roadmap—there's a realistic path to $0.20–$0.40 over the longer 6–12 month horizon. What the Multiples Could Look Like: Listing at $0.10 = a potential 1,000× from presale floor Conservative launch (e.g. $0.15–$0.25) = 1,500–2,500× If established across platforms and media buzz builds, longer-term upside to $0.20–$0.40, or roughly 2,000–4,000×, could materialize. What is XYZVerse? XYZVerse is the latest meme coin making waves in 2025, positioning itself at the intersection of crypto culture and global sports fandom. The project ties directly into sports betting through a partnership with bookmaker.XYZ, offering token holders perks like exclusive rewards and play-to-earn experiences. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, XYZVerse is building out an ecosystem of staking apps, Telegram-based mini games, and deflationary tokenomics that aim to sustain long-term interest. Backed by community enthusiasm—boasting tens of thousands of followers across X and Telegram—and audited by leading security firms, the coin is quickly shaping up as a contender to watch when it lists later this year. Conclusion The 100×+ altcoin unicorns of old might be gone, but structured presales like XYZVerse are picking up the slack, combining community momentum, scarcity, viable utility, and early entry. If execution plays out, the upside could eclipse even classic altseason gains.

And if he does, the way America handles interest rates, inflation, and the economy could change for years, or blow up in everyone’s face. Trump’s problem with the Fed didn’t start yesterday. Since taking office in January, he’s gone after them publicly for refusing to cut rates. He’s floated removing Chair Jerome Powell, then backed down when Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent supposedly talked some sense into him. And now he’s trying to kick out Lisa Cook, a sitting governor, so he can bring the most powerful central bank under direct executive control. Trump wants rate-cutters, not economists Trump doesn’t trust the Fed. He blames them for inflation after the pandemic and thinks they’ve done too little to help bring down borrowing costs. His goal now is to pack the seven-member Board of Governors with people who’ll do what he wants, when he wants. Even if that seems far off, getting enough votes would let Trump pull levers that go way beyond the federal funds rate. The governors set the discount rate and the interest on reserve balances, two critical tools that influence how much money moves through the economy. They also control who runs the 12 regional Fed banks, with a bunch of reappointments due in 2026. That means Trump could decide who gets to lead regional policy and set the tone for monetary decisions for years. Inside Trump’s administration, officials claim they still believe in independence. But at the same time, Trump wants to know in advance if his nominees will vote to lower rates. “There definitely has been mission creep on behalf of the Fed getting into climate change and issues of diversity and inclusion and things that certainly go well beyond their mandate,” said Joseph LaVorgna, Trump’s former chief economist and now an advisor to Scott Bessent. What Wall Street thinks Some on Wall Street agree that the Fed needs a reset. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, said last week on CNBC that Powell should step down before this whole thing explodes. “This is the exact world that I was worried about,” he said. “The Fed is vulnerable on so many different fronts, and I fear now that we’ve started going down this road that I really dread.” El-Erian wants new blood at the table, like what the Bank of England does with outside members. He also suggested reviewing the Fed’s 2% inflation target, something Powell has repeatedly defended. But others say Trump’s moves go way beyond reform. “This is really a story about trying to undo what had been 90 years of Fed independence,” said Roger Ferguson, the Fed’s former vice chair. “And now, for the first time, we’re seeing a direct effort to undermine that.” Right now, Trump has two confirmed allies on the board, and Steve Miran is waiting for the Senate to confirm him as a replacement for Adriana Kugler. And when Powell’s term ends in May, that opens up another seat. Trump could hold five out of seven board spots, giving him the votes to push whatever he wants. But there’s also the legal wall Trump has to break through. Firing Cook won’t be easy. Courts will need to decide if he even has “cause” to do it. But if he gets past that, things could move fast. Former Bridgewater strategist Rebecca Patterson is warning investors, too. “We shouldn’t ignore this at all. This is a big deal what’s going on,” she said on CNBC’s Fast Money . Patterson believes that Trump gaining control of the Fed would cause the yield curve to steepen, inflation expectations to rise, the dollar to weaken, and Bitcoin and gold to surge. She followed up with a warning in an email to CNBC: “In the short-term, investors might reason that lower rates supporting growth are good for earnings. Over time, though, sustained higher inflation is going to hurt consumption, which will get reflected in earnings expectations.” She said the risk isn’t if there’s fallout. It’s when . “Our moment might not come as quickly or easily,” Patterson said. “But looking at other countries who have gone down this road, [it] tells us where we’re headed if we’re not careful.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Economy|Federal Reserve|USD,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-30 20:20:17

Through Tesla’s Bitcoin exposure, SpaceX/Starlink’s cash-flow inflection, xAI’s compute ambitions, and X’s steady march toward licensed payments, Musk sits at the center of a feedback loop that’s helping normalize Bitcoin for institutions—right as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs consolidate trillions in liquidity across regulated rails. Key Takeaways Tesla remains a top corporate holder of Bitcoin , with ~ 11,509 BTC reported by industry trackers and covered by mainstream crypto media, making its quarterly results a bellwether for corporates with crypto exposure. CoinDesk Bitcoin Treasuries SpaceX has emerged as a significant BTC treasurer , with blockchain-intelligence estimates around 8,28x BTC in 2025—a sign that blue-chip private tech firms are also engaging Bitcoin at treasury scale. Arkham Bitbo U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs (led by BlackRock’s IBIT) have cemented institutional access; IBIT alone shows ~$81B in assets as of Aug. 29, 2025 , making ETF flows a primary driver of liquidity and price discovery during U.S. hours. BlackRock X (formerly Twitter) continues to add state money-transmitter licenses and registrations needed for U.S. payments—incremental plumbing that could plug hundreds of millions of users into on-platform value transfer over time. NYSenate.gov Payments Dive xAI is scaling compute aggressively , open-sourcing Grok 2.5 and outlining targets equal to tens of millions of “H100-equivalent” GPUs over five years—positioning Musk’s AI stack close to real-time markets, payments, and user intent. Tom’s Hardware The Institutional Backdrop: From Tweets to Term Sheets The turning point for Bitcoin’s mainstream adoption in the U.S. was the arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, which turned complex custody into a ticker symbol. By August 2025 , BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone reported ~$81B in net assets; sector-wide flows now routinely swing prices during U.S. sessions as wealth managers and institutions allocate or de-risk via regulated wrappers. BlackRock That structural shift matters for Elon Musk. A deeper institutional base reduces the marginal impact of celebrity commentary while increasing the financial statement salience of corporate Bitcoin holders—especially now that FASB fair-value rules let companies mark BTC gains and losses each quarter. For Tesla, that can make crypto marks a visible offset—or amplifier—to cyclical automotive swings. CoinDesk Tesla: BTC on the Balance Sheet, Visibility in the Footnotes Tesla remains one of the world’s best-known corporate holders of Bitcoin, sitting around 11,509 BTC per industry trackers like BitcoinTreasuries and reporting coverage by CoinDesk in Q2 2025 . While Tesla sold a large portion of its original 2021 buy during 2022, the company has since maintained a significant position that rose in reported fair value alongside BTC’s mid-2025 rally. Bitcoin Treasuries CoinDesk In Q2 2025 , Tesla’s shareholder materials highlighted the company’s broader financials and strategic transition, but the newfound accounting treatment made Bitcoin’s quarterly mark-to-market more visible to analysts parsing the results. For investors, that means Tesla’s crypto exposure isn’t just a one-off headline; it’s a line item that can swing reported earnings in volatile quarters. Tesla SpaceX/Starlink: Cash Engines—and a Quiet BTC Signal While SpaceX is primarily a launch and satellite-internet business, blockchain-intelligence dashboards tracking corporate wallets estimate ~8.28k BTC under the SpaceX umbrella in 2025, fluctuating with treasury moves and market prices. The signal: even private mega-cap tech firms with heavy capex cycles are comfortable holding a non-trivial amount of Bitcoin. That aligns with Starlink’s improving unit economics and rising subscriber base—additional ballast behind treasury experimentation. Arkham Next Big Future Musk also projected ~$15.5B in 2025 revenue at SpaceX earlier this year—signaling scale that few private tech companies can match, and a financial base from which to explore alternative treasury strategies, including Bitcoin. Reuters X Payments: Building the Pipes (and the Moat) X has steadily pursued state-by-state money-transmitter approvals , plus FinCEN registration—requirements for peer-to-peer payments and, eventually, interoperability with broader financial rails. Public documents and trade coverage show X holding licenses or approvals across ~40+ states and D.C. , though New York remained a gap as of May. The practical meaning: X is laying regulatory plumbing that could, over time, support wallet features, tipping, merchant flows and (where permitted) crypto-adjacent integrations—all within a real-time, social context. NYSenate.gov Payments Dive Such rails don’t guarantee crypto features, but they do position X to direct user attention and orderflow—especially relevant if ETFs and broker integrations normalize BTC exposure for mainstream users. xAI: Compute at the Edge of Markets If Bitcoin is the asset , xAI is the sensor layer . Musk has repeatedly stressed the need for orders-of-magnitude more compute to train frontier models. Recent statements emphasized targets equal to 50 million H100-equivalent GPUs in five years and open-sourcing strides like Grok 2.5 —a posture that puts xAI in the same league of ambition as OpenAI or Meta and inches Grok closer to live, finance-relevant reasoning. Tom’s Hardware As the ETF rails industrialize BTC exposure and X iterates payment plumbing, a Musk-stack of real-time conversation (X), real-time inference (xAI), hard-asset treasuries (Tesla/SpaceX), and global connectivity (Starlink) forms a uniquely integrated platform touching both user demand and capital allocation . Risk & Regulation: The Parts Still in Motion A broader institutional footprint does not eliminate risk. ETF flow concentration can amplify day-to-day volatility and create reflexive feedback loops between asset prices and fund subscriptions/redemptions. Corporations face earnings volatility under fair-value accounting, and payments platforms must navigate multi-jurisdictional licensing with uneven timelines. Meanwhile, Musk’s ventures themselves face legal and competitive pressures , including recent xAI trade-secret litigation , underscoring how intense the AI and data race has become. BlackRock NYSenate.gov Reuters What It Means for Investors Watching Elon Musk BTC as a balance-sheet variable : For Tesla (public) and SpaceX (private), BTC can diversify cash but introduces mark-to-market swings—relevant for equity analysts and private-market investors alike. CoinDesk ETF rails = mainstream on-ramps : IBIT’s scale shows the preferred path for advisers and institutions is regulated, custodied exposure —not exchange accounts. That supports liquidity, tighter spreads, and consistent demand shocks from advisory models. BlackRock Regulatory compounding : Each new X license compounds optionality for payments. If wallets and value transfer become native at scale, attention and transactions converge—fertile ground for integrated financial features. NYSenate.gov Payments Dive AI + markets : xAI’s open-source moves and compute plans hint at faster product cycles around finance-aware assistants. If Grok becomes reliably real-time on market data, it could reshape discovery, research, and even compliance interfaces. Tom’s Hardware Data Points: Elon Musk and Bitcoin in 2025 Tesla BTC : ~11,509 BTC (industry trackers), with fair-value marks now visible in quarterly reporting coverage. Bitcoin Treasuries CoinDesk SpaceX BTC : ~8.28k BTC (Arkham-linked analysis), fluctuating with treasury activity. Arkham ETF Scale : IBIT ~$81B AUM (Aug. 29, 2025), anchoring institutional access. BlackRock SpaceX 2025 revenue guide : ~$15.5B (Musk), reflecting scale that can underpin more flexible treasury management. Reuters The Bottom Line Elon Musk no longer influences Bitcoin solely through sentiment. In 2025, his companies’ balance sheets, product roadmaps, regulatory filings, and AI infrastructure interact with the maturing ETF ecosystem to institutionalize Bitcoin exposure. Whether Bitcoin continues higher or whipsaws, the rails are now built: regulated funds move billions daily; corporates can mark assets to market; and social-payments infrastructure is approaching critical mass. That interplay—more than any single quip—defines Musk’s role in Bitcoin’s next institutional chapter.

50929447,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=795203,1756585560,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50929447.jpeg,Experts Pick 4 Cryptos Set To Skyrocket Like Solana (SOL) In September,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/experts-pick-4-cryptos-set-to-skyrocket-like-solana-sol-in-september/,"As the crypto market enters September with renewed momentum, several tokens are positioning themselves for breakout moves. Solana (SOL) continues to be the benchmark for rapid gains but experts are closely watching four standout projects that could follow a similar trajectory. Of these, Layer Brett is emerging as the most attractive pick, supported by strong fundamentals and growing community attention. 1. Layer Brett ($LBRETT) – Leading the pack Layer Brett ($LBRETT) has quickly become one of the most talked-about tokens of late. Unlike many meme-driven assets, $LBRETT combines viral appeal with an expanding ecosystem that rewards community participation. Analysts argue that this dual foundation could drive significant growth as broader market sentiment improves. Compared to other trending coins, Layer Brett’s engagement metrics and liquidity suggest it could outperform peers in September, making it the primary pick for investors seeking Solana (SOL)-style gains. 2. Kaspa (KAS) – High-speed blockchain potential Kaspa (KAS) has steadily built a reputation for its innovative blockDAG architecture, enabling near-instant confirmations and robust scalability. With network activity rising, Kaspa is increasingly being discussed as a viable alternative to more established smart contract platforms. Experts point out that Kaspa is carving a niche where speed and efficiency are critical, potentially echoing the breakout seen with Solana (SOL) in earlier cycles. Should adoption continue, Kaspa could surprise markets with a sharp upward trend this month. 3. HYPE – Community-driven momentum HYPE is living up to its name by riding a surge of community enthusiasm and speculative interest. It’s still a developing project but HYPE has demonstrated staying power by sustaining trading volumes and attracting new holders. In a market where narrative drives momentum, HYPE has a strong storyline that resonates with retail investors. Analysts suggest that if HYPE continues to generate attention at current levels, it could reflect the early market dynamics of Solana. This would position it for short-term upside during September. 4. VeChain (VET) – Real-World Utility Gains Recognition VeChain (VET) is not new to the spotlight. However, its steady progress in enterprise adoption makes it a strong contender for renewed interest. By focusing on supply chain management, VET has consistently demonstrated practical use cases in industries where blockchain can make processes more efficient. Recent partnerships are strengthening the perception of VET as a reliable project with long-term growth potential. If September brings heightened attention to real-world applications, VeChain (VET) could see a resurgence in price momentum similar to Solana (SOL). Final Outlook September is shaping up as a pivotal month for altcoins. While SOL remains the yardstick for explosive growth, experts emphasize that the next wave of momentum may come from emerging and resurgent players. Kaspa impresses with technical innovation, HYPE thrives on narrative power, and VET delivers real-world adoption. Yet, among these, Layer Brett stands out as the project with the strongest blend of community traction and growth potential, making it the top crypto to watch this month. What sets $LBRETT apart is the combination of compelling presale economics and robust staking rewards, currently offering an eye-catching 1,450% APY. Early investors can secure tokens at just $0.005 during presale, with the added incentive of a $1 million giveaway designed to accelerate community adoption. Beyond the presale benefits, $LBRETT also prioritizes efficiency with low gas fees and high-speed transactions, all while leveraging Ethereum layer 2 security to ensure reliability. With this mix of utility, incentives, and scalability, many see September as the month where Layer Brett could move from an under-the-radar gem to a breakout contender. September could belong to Layer Brett ($LBRETT) — stay ahead of the curve.

Bitcoin dominance or its share of the total market, has begun to decline. That generally indicates that traders are seeking greener pastures elsewhere. As the latest bull run approaches, investors are looking at projects that possess solid technical charts, real-life application and whale involvement. Dogecoin is at a critical level as it trades around the $0.20 support, with traders discussing the possibility of a recovery high. Sui is also experiencing technicals of both stripes, but it is also pushing developmental advancement with new AI tools for Web3 developers. And then there’s MAGACOIN FINANCE , a project drawing major whale inflows thanks to completed audits and high upside forecasts. Collectively, these three names are prompting chatter among traders looking to get ahead of the market when it re-triggers as risk-on. Dogecoin (DOGE) Holds at $0.20 Support Dogecoin is currently trading at a level slightly above $0.2 , and the traders are watching to see whether this support level can be maintained. Technical setups indicate a TD Sequential buy signal and a cup and handle pattern that might pre-determine its future course. Al Martinez highlighted the TD Sequential buy signal that appeared after nine consecutive red candles on the 4-hour timeframe and indicated that selling action might be weakening. Tardigrade Trader also noted a cup-and-handle pattern, with a possible price target of $0.82 and possibly higher at $2.18. DOGE’s history in Q3 has been mixed. In past years, the coin has often posted losses between 6% and 28%. But this year, it’s up 28.8% so far in Q3, which could mean a break in that cycle. The $0.20 mark is now the dividing line between bulls and bears. Fibonacci levels also highlight $0.2117 and $0.2011 as zones buyers could defend. Sui (SUI) Technical Setup Keeps Traders on Edge Sui (SUI) price is trading at $3.45 with a market cap of $8.06 billion. The token posted a 3.25% gain in the last 24 hours even as technical signals stayed mixed. Its daily trading volume hit $2.24 billion, but support levels are being tested. The token dropped under its 50-day moving average at $3.69 and also slipped below the pivot point at $3.46, both adding downside pressure. The MACD histogram at -0.0293 showed bearish momentum is still in play. For now, the $3.50 level is the key support zone traders are watching. If buyers hold that level, SUI price could aim for the $3.70 to $4.00 range. If not, it risks sliding toward $3.20. On-chain activity has been uneven. DEX volumes averaged $368 million daily, up 21% quarter-over-quarter, while derivatives volume fell 14% to $5.21 billion. Open interest moved higher by 3.66% to $1.88 billion, showing some capital commitment despite softer trading. Sui is also pushing into AI development with a coding assistant built alongside Alibaba Cloud. The tool integrates with ChainIDE and supports the Move programming language. It’s designed to help Web3 developers by offering automated code generation and real-time security alerts. MAGACOIN FINANCE – Whales Are Streaming In as the Next Bull Cycle Nears Whales are streaming into MAGACOIN FINANCE as money begins rotating from Bitcoin into altcoins, with Bitcoin dominance showing signs of decline. Backed by dual audits from CertiK and HashEx confirming zero vulnerabilities , the project has built strong investor trust in a market still wary of scams. Analysts now forecast up to 200x upside , and whale accumulation is fueling massive FOMO as MAGACOIN FINANCE cements its position among the most compelling altcoins to buy before the next bull cycle Final Take Altcoins are once again back in focus as Bitcoin’s share of the market weakens. Dogecoin price is holding a key level that could shape its near-term direction. Sui is testing traders’ patience with technical resistance while pushing forward with developer tools. MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out as the altcoin play whales are loading up on , backed by strong audits and high growth potential. For many, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming the coin to watch as the next bull run approaches.

Lubin particularly pointed out that Wall Street will integrate into the ETH ecosystem and ETH will experience a huge increase in value. Lubin largely agreed with analyst Tom Lee's views, saying: “Wall Street is currently paying for their infrastructure, and Ethereum will eliminate much of this siloed system. Giants like JPMorgan will eventually have to operate on a decentralized infrastructure. This means staking, running validators, managing layer 2 and layer 3 networks, participating in DeFi, and developing smart contracts.” Related News: Is the Red September a Myth or Reality for Bitcoin and Altcoins? Is a Decline on the Horizon? Experts Weigh In According to Lubin, this transition will be relatively easy as JPMorgan and many other financial institutions have been gaining experience with Ethereum technology since 2014. Lubin stated that the narrative that Layer 2 networks will harm the Ethereum mainnet will soon end and said the following about ETH’s price potential: “ETH will appreciate 100x from here, maybe much more. Yes, ETH will outperform Bitcoin's monetary base.” Lubin stated that Ethereum's future is shaped by a decentralized economy driven by human-machine collaboration, saying, “No one can currently imagine how large and rapid this growth will be. ETH will surpass all other commodities as the strongest asset of decentralized trust.” *This is not investment advice.

Because Bitcoin has now traded above $110,000 and altcoins prepare for a huge bull cycle, this is one of the best times to start. The secret to earning profits from crypto is not luck, but about timing, risk management, and diversification. That’s why many beginner investors are not just looking at established coins, but also at upcoming, shining stars like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which experts claim could be the next SHIBA INU-type story. Start With the Basics When you’re stepping into the world of crypto for the first time, the first step to take is to set up a secure wallet. It’s easy through exchanges; however, security must always come first. Understand Market Cycles The cryptocurrency market moves in cycles, most often following events like halving. With each cycle, tremendous growth is followed by deep corrections. If you recognise these patterns, you will avoid buying at the top and selling at the bottom. An Early-Stage Opportunity MAGACOIN FINANCE is the project to watch for those seeking explosive gains that can transform small investments into millions. This coin may see a 7,800% gain, and it is being compared to Dogecoin and Shiba’s early days. The limited access to early users as well as a fast-growing community give the project the sort of scarcity factor which creates long-term upside. Diversify Your Portfolio Smart investors don’t put all their money in one coin. A small investment in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and promising altcoins may be the best way to gain entry into the crypto market for beginners. Conclusion To make money with crypto in 2025, you will need education, strategy, and identifying projects with real potential. Crypto millionaires will tell you that the life-changing upside gets you more excited than stability. While Bitcoin and Ethereum provide stability, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer unlimited potential gains.

The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple is now officially closed , cementing a split ruling that keeps secondary-market XRP sales outside securities laws while restricting certain institutional sales and imposing a $125 million penalty . That legal clarity coincides with two major product pushes: the RLUSD dollar stablecoin and the XRPL EVM sidechain —both designed to broaden how developers, fintechs, and institutions actually use the XRP ecosystem. Key takeaways Case closed: The SEC and Ripple dismissed their appeals in August 2025; Judge Torres’s 2023 split ruling stands, plus a $125M penalty and injunction around institutional sales. Secondary-market XRP trading retains non-security status. Tech catalysts: The XRPL EVM sidechain (live since June 30, 2025) brings Ethereum-compatible smart contracts to the XRP stack. Earlier, the XLS-30 AMM added native automated market making to XRPL. Stablecoin push: Ripple’s RLUSD (on XRPL and Ethereum ) is fully backed and redeemable 1:1 for USD; it’s integrating into DeFi rails including Aave’s Horizon RWA market. ETF path opens wider: U.S. exchanges are seeking generic listing standards for crypto ETPs, which could speed up approvals for products beyond BTC/ETH—potentially including XRP . What changed for XRP legally, and why it matters The long-running SEC v. Ripple case ended in August 2025, with both parties dismissing appeals. The outcome preserved Judge Analisa Torres’s earlier findings: programmatic (exchange) sales of XRP are not securities , while certain institutional sales remain restricted under securities laws. Ripple agreed to a $125 million penalty and a permanent injunction governing institutional offerings. In practical terms, this removes the cloud over secondary-market XRP trading , a prerequisite for broader institutional access and compliant product development. Market reaction was swift: XRP rallied above $3.25 in the days after the finalization, reflecting both relief and a repricing of legal risk. While price action remains volatile, the legal chapter’s closure allows coverage, custody, and market-making desks to operate with more confidence. Two technology catalysts you shouldn’t ignore 1) XRPL EVM sidechain: Ethereum-compatible apps meet XRP rails On June 30, 2025 , Ripple and partners launched the XRPL EVM sidechain mainnet , enabling full Ethereum-compatible smart contracts within the XRP ecosystem. Developers can deploy Solidity dApps and bridge assets to/from XRPL—opening doors for DeFi, tokenized assets, and payments applications that use XRP for settlement. Early data points show brisk developer engagement, and cross-chain connectivity via Axelar links the sidechain to dozens of networks. Why it matters for XRP: Bringing EVM programmability to the XRP world doesn’t just add features—it pulls in Ethereum-native builders and liquidity while keeping XRPL’s speed and low fees for final settlement. For exchanges, PSPs, and fintechs building on-chain finance, this reduces integration friction and can increase XRP’s transactional demand over time. 2) XLS-30 AMM on XRPL: Native liquidity without third-party DEX risk The XLS-30 AMM —enabled on mainnet in 2024—brought native automated market making to XRPL. With AMMs at the protocol layer, XRPL can source liquidity on demand for token swaps and cross-currency payments, a capability that aligns with Ripple’s longstanding “on-demand liquidity” mission. For payment corridors, this can reduce slippage and improve FX execution across long-tail currency pairs. Stablecoin strategy: RLUSD’s role in the XRP economy Ripple’s RLUSD is a USD-backed stablecoin issued natively on XRPL and Ethereum . It is fully backed by cash and cash equivalents and is redeemable 1:1 for USD (availability varies by jurisdiction). In 2025, RLUSD integrated with Aave’s Horizon RWA platform to plug into institutional-grade borrowing/lending tied to tokenized real-world assets. As stablecoin liquidity deepens on XRPL and EVM rails, payments, settlement, and DeFi use cases can scale without forcing users into off-network stablecoins. By mid-2025, RLUSD’s market footprint surpassed $500 million —evidence that enterprise-grade stablecoins can gain real traction when paired with robust compliance and distribution. More liquidity in RLUSD can indirectly support XRP by spurring network activity and deepening FX/AMM pools, even if holding RLUSD is distinct from holding XRP . Adoption: corridors, banks, and what’s actually live Ripple has longstanding ties in Japan (via SBI Holdings ) and across Southeast Asia (through Tranglo , in which Ripple holds a 40% stake). SBI Remit has already expanded XRP-powered remittances across key corridors in the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia, citing speed and cost benefits. Meanwhile, SBI’s June 2025 investor materials explicitly reference XRP-based transfers and discussions around RLUSD distribution. Why that matters now: Post-lawsuit clarity lowers institutional risk. Payment firms can adopt Ripple Payments and XRPL tooling without waiting on a final court outcome. In practice, this could increase corridor volumes , encourage bank pilots , and diversify on-chain liquidity sources (XRP, RLUSD, and fiat on/off-ramps). ETF watch: A faster route for crypto funds could include XRP Major U.S. exchanges have petitioned the SEC for generic listing standards for crypto ETPs—akin to how many commodity ETFs are listed today. If adopted, these rules would streamline approvals and reduce the bespoke, slow 19b-4 process . While not an XRP-specific decision, the pathway could enable XRP-based funds alongside other large-cap assets, expanding institutional access and retirement-account demand . Timing isn’t guaranteed, but the policy direction suggests broader ETF availability is getting closer. Price snapshot and levels to watch As of publication, XRP trades near $2.81 with intraday moves around the $2.77–$2.83 band. Traders are watching $2.80 as near-term support, with resistance seen into the low-$3s following the post-settlement bounce. Macro liquidity, ETF news flow, and on-chain adoption metrics will likely drive the next leg. (Not investment advice.) Risks to the bull case Regulatory drift: U.S. policy can change quickly. Even with the Ripple case concluded, future rulemaking or state actions could alter how institutions treat XRP. Adoption-execution gap: Launching the EVM sidechain and stablecoin integrations is only step one; sustained developer and user adoption must follow to affect XRP demand. Market structure: Broader crypto liquidity, BTC cycles, and ETF flows will influence XRP beta . Even strong fundamentals can be overshadowed in risk-off regimes. Stablecoin competition: RLUSD must contend with deeply entrenched stablecoins. Its enterprise pitch will need continued exchange and protocol support to scale. Bottom line For the first time in years, XRP’s narrative is less about courtrooms and more about code and corridors . With legal clarity , a live EVM sidechain , protocol-level AMMs , and an enterprise-grade stablecoin , the ecosystem is better positioned to compete on utility —the metric that ultimately sustains network value beyond headlines. Watch for corridor volumes , EVM sidechain TVL/developer growth , and ETF policy milestones to determine whether 2025’s promise turns into durable momentum. FAQ (for readers & rich results) Is XRP still a security in the U.S.? No—for secondary-market trading , courts reaffirmed that XRP is not a security . Certain institutional sales remain restricted, and Ripple paid a $125M penalty with a permanent injunction on those offerings. SEC What is RLUSD and why should XRP holders care? RLUSD is Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin on XRPL and Ethereum . It can deepen on-chain liquidity for payments and DeFi. While holding RLUSD isn’t the same as holding XRP, more stablecoin liquidity can increase XRPL activity , indirectly benefiting the ecosystem. Ripple What does the EVM sidechain actually enable? It lets developers deploy Ethereum-compatible smart contracts while bridging to XRPL for fast, low-cost settlement—attracting builders and liquidity without abandoning XRP’s core payment strengths. Ripple Could we see an XRP ETF? Policy is evolving. If the SEC adopts generic listing standards for crypto ETPs, XRP-based funds could see a smoother pathway—though timing and eligibility aren’t guaranteed.

Among numerous contenders, a few altcoins are standing out and gaining traction. This article unveils three digital assets exhibiting promising signs of growth. Learn which cryptocurrencies could be on the verge of significant upward movement and why they are catching the eye of keen investors. Hedera (HBAR) Eyes Rebound as Support Levels Hold Steady Source: tradingview Hedera (HBAR) is moving between twenty-three and twenty-six cents. Even though the price has dropped about thirteen percent over the past week, it's holding above strong support at twenty-one cents. If it climbs, it could face resistance near twenty-eight cents and, if momentum continues, it could push to thirty-one cents. Such a move might mean growth of roughly twenty percent from current levels. However, with an RSI below forty, it suggests the coin is not yet overbought, indicating room for upward movement. Traders are watching if HBAR can break past these levels and start a new trend. XRP Shows Potential Amidst Recent Dips Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between $2.83 and $3.17, having recently dipped by nearly 9% over the past month. Despite this, XRP still holds promise. Its next test lies at the $3.32 resistance level. If it manages to break through, it could move toward the $3.66 mark, representing a potential 10% rise from its current range. However, buyers should watch the support at $2.64, as falling below could lead to a decline. Given its RSI and MACD levels, XRP shows potential for growth, though it remains in a cautious zone. Keep an eye on market momentum and trading patterns moving forward. Arbitrum (ARB) on a Rollercoaster: What's Next? Source: tradingview Arbitrum (ARB) is currently trading between a little under half a dollar and slightly more than half a dollar. It recently saw a monthly rise of one-fifth but dropped around 15% over the past week. The nearest resistance is at over two-thirds of a dollar, with a stronghold just under half a dollar and another deeper one at a quarter. Indicators suggest some stability, with the RSI fairly balanced and a high Stochastic value. The potential for growth could see ARB climbing towards $0.71 and possibly reaching $0.86, marking a roughly 34% to 72% increase from its current lower price range. Conclusion Hedera , XRP , and Arbitrum are gaining attention. Hedera shows promise in transaction speed and cost. XRP continues to expand through partnerships. Arbitrum is making strides in enhancing efficiency. These altcoins are worth monitoring due to their ongoing developments and increasing traction.

Fresh breakouts in these digital assets signal potential surges this September. Investors and enthusiasts are eager to see how far Cronos and Pi Network can soar. Discover which of these cryptocurrencies are primed for significant growth in the upcoming weeks. Cronos Ascent Continues: Is It Ready to Break New Grounds? Cronos (CRO) is currently trading between fourteen and seventeen cents. Recent momentum is strong, with the price soaring over 294% in six months. The cryptocurrency is approaching its nearest resistance at eighteen cents, a move past which could propel it towards twenty-one cents. Compared to recent figures, this marks a potential rise of approximately 20%. Despite the surge, the current figures show a relative strength index below overbought levels, indicating more room to grow. Eyes are on key levels as traders anticipate whether Cronos can maintain its upward trend or if it will revert to its support levels around twelve cents. Pi Network (PI) Eyes Resistance, Hints at Growth Pi Network's (PI) price currently dances between about 33 and 38 cents. It's trying to break past the 40-cent mark, which is a nearby resistance level. The next hurdle would be just over 44 cents. If it breaks these barriers, there’s room for growth. The coin dropped in value by over 11% last month, but gained about 2% this week. Given these fluctuations, watch how it moves toward these resistance points. If it succeeds, this could mean potential growth around 20% from the current standings towards that second resistance. The coin’s recent 80% drop in the last half-year shows volatility, but it might also hint at a rebound opportunity. Conclusion Cronos and Pi Network have shown a strong breakout. Market trends suggest potential for significant growth in September. Investors should keep an eye on the upward momentum. Both coins may reach new heights if current patterns hold steady. Continued interest and market activities will play a critical role in their future value. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The proposal took effect on August 29, as Tron defends its position as the dominant USDT rail, hosting a stablecoin supply of $80.97 billion compared to Ethereum’s $73.8 billion. Source: DefiLlama Tron Leads the Stablecoin Race The fee reduction comes as the TRX token’s appreciation erodes Tron’s competitive advantage over rival networks. Rising TRX prices from $0.12 in early 2024 to $0.32 by Q3 2025 pushed USDT transfer fees from $1.64 to $4.28, while TRC20 transfer costs increased from $0.67 to $0.87. Justin Sun announced the community proposal would impact short-term profitability but expects increased transaction volume to drive long-term revenue growth. On August 26, 2025, the Tron Super Representative community proposed to reduce Tron network fees by 60%. This is the largest fee reduction since the founding of the Tron network. The proposal has already passed and will take effect at 20:00 (GMT+8) this Friday! Here’s my view on… — H.E. Justin Sun (Astronaut Version) (@justinsuntron) August 29, 2025 The network processes over $24.6 billion in daily USDT transfers, nearly seven times the volume of Ethereum, while maintaining a 98.56% dominance in its stablecoin ecosystem. Tron’s fee structure aims to expand its user base by 45% to 38.9 million eligible accounts capable of completing typical USDT transfers. The network processed 273 million transactions in May across 28.7 million active addresses, with 75% utilizing gasless transaction models, which fuel adoption in remittance-heavy regions. Strategic Fee War Intensifies Blockchain Competition Tron’s aggressive fee reduction aims to counter rising transaction costs that threatened its dominance in stablecoin payments. The network’s analysis reveals that a 60% cut could add 12 million potential transfer users while maintaining transaction volumes that drive revenue, despite lower individual fees. The proposal passed after three weeks of community discussion, with Super Representatives acknowledging short-term revenue impacts. Quarterly dynamic fee reviews will consider TRX price fluctuations, network activity levels, and growth rates to balance profitability with competitive positioning. USDT transfer fees on Tron dropped from 2.47 TRX to 0.72 TRX in July, marking a 70% decline that reinforced the network’s role as a low-cost payment rail. Major exchanges, including Binance, promote TRC-20 as the default option, branding it “low fee, high speed” compared to Ethereum’s higher costs. The fee reduction shifts TRX supply dynamics toward inflation at current transaction levels. Tron’s analysis indicates that a 50% fee cut would generate 18.7 million new TRX tokens during the measured period, reversing the previous deflationary trend of 76.1 million tokens burned. Source: GitHub However, increased transaction volume could offset inflationary pressures by generating higher total fees. The network’s gasless model already accounts for 75% of activity, while DeFi protocols like JustLend maintain a total value locked of $6 billion, despite fee adjustments. Tron recorded $308 million in fee revenue during June despite offering gasless features. USDT Dominance Faces Regulatory and Competitive Pressures Tron hosts 51% of all circulating USDT globally, with a supply of $80.97 billion, compared to Tether’s total issuance of $157.1 billion across all blockchains. The network processes daily volumes exceeding $23.5 billion, consistently outpacing Ethereum’s $20 billion in USDT settlement activity. Notably, regional adoption also drives Tron’s stablecoin success, particularly in Latin America, the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia-Pacific markets, where freelancers and merchants prioritize cost savings. Regulatory frameworks, including the US GENIUS Act, EU MiCA, and Hong Kong’s Stablecoin Bill, also eased its path to dominance. However, competition continues to intensify from Ethereum Layer-2 solutions and Solana, which the chain has started to optimize for improved scalability and lower costs. Meanwhile, amid growth, Nasdaq-listed Tron Inc. filed to register $1 billion in securities for TRX token purchases that will mirror MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin treasury model.

Additionally, there are ongoing governance concerns surrounding Tron Inc.’s board composition, which is chaired by Justin Sun’s father, with advisors from the Tron DAO and Tronscan development teams. It has been discovered that a recent $100 million reverse merger funding came from a Hong Kong trust where company directors also serve, raising concerns about how the governance actually works.

According to an August 30 Bloomberg report , the Tokyo-listed nail salon company plans to become one of the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holders. In response, Taiyo Azuma, Director of Convano’s BTC Holding Strategy Office, outlined a three-phase Bitcoin acquisition plan, with a target of 2,000 BTC by the end of 2025. コンヴァノがブルームバーグに取り上げられました。ありがたいことに、徐々に国際的な認知が広がっているのを感じています。私たちの目標は明確。2027年3月までに「21,000 BTC」を獲得し、世界有数のビットコイン保有企業になることです。 https://t.co/cLC1Ew6ZdA — 東 大陽 | コンヴァノ取締役（6574） (@MotokiyoA) August 30, 2025 The portfolio is expected to reach 10,000 BTC by August 2026, as Azuma stated, “ Our goal is clear. By March 2027, we aim to acquire 21,000 BTC and become one of the world’s leading Bitcoin-holding companies. “ Convano Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy Is a Response to Japan’s Economic Pressures Convano frames its BTC pivot as a strategic response to macroeconomic challenges. A prolonged decline in the yen, approximately 21% weaker against the dollar over the past decade, has increased costs for wages and raw materials in its consumer services business. “ We started to think about Bitcoin because of persistent yen depreciation and geopolitical risks ,” Azuma told Bloomberg. “Bitcoin is a long-term store of value.” Of the funds Convano has raised to date, ¥4.5 billion came from corporate bonds, and it has acquired 365 Bitcoin with it. The Bitcoin acquisition announcement has driven Convano’s stock higher, with shares climbing 223.27% in the past month and surging 1,414.68% YTD. Source: Google Finance Japan has become an unexpected hub for Bitcoin accumulation through publicly listed companies. Metaplanet Inc., a former hotel operator, now holds nearly 19,000 Bitcoin , ranking among the top 10 global holders. According to Bitcoin Treasuries , seven Japanese companies now rank among the top 100 public firms holding BTC. However, the sustainability of crypto treasury strategies remains a topic of debate. Bitcoin acquisition leaders like StrategyB (formerly MicroStrategy) face challenges as MSTR stock has declined 15.35% over the past 30 days while Bitcoin trades 12.85% below its two-week high of $124,457. If StrategyB could face this risk, a heavy drop in Convani stock means its financing model can collapse. When asked about concerns regarding Bitcoin price volatility, Azuma believes the perceived risk is actually beneficial. According to him, Convano welcomes Bitcoin price drops for four reasons. 「ビットコインの価格が下がると困りませんか？」 取材でよく聞かれますが実は""むしろ逆""です。 なぜコンヴァノはBTCの価格が下がると嬉しいのか、 ①価格が下がると枚数を多く積める ②ボラティリティが高いほど収入が増える ③「低レート×高ボラティリティ」が最適 ④実務ではリスクを管理… pic.twitter.com/EIHJN2XetV — 東 大陽 | コンヴァノ取締役（6574） (@MotokiyoA) August 15, 2025 First, lower prices allow the company to acquire more Bitcoin. Secondly, higher volatility increases the company’s revenue. He added that the combination of “low rates and high volatility” creates optimal conditions for reaching the 21,000 BTC goal. Lastly, the company can effectively manage associated risks. Experts Warn Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy Built on “Shaky Ground” However, experts like VanEck’s head of digital assets research Matthew Sigel argue that Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by public companies rest on “shaky ground”, with rising risks that could wipe away shareholder value. According to Sigel, when stocks trade significantly above their Bitcoin net asset value (NAV), issuing new equity generates premiums. Source: YCharts However, once stock prices approach parity with the value of Bitcoin holdings, dilution occurs. “ That is not capital formation. It is erosion ,” Sigel wrote. He suggests that companies using Bitcoin as a treasury asset should implement safeguards, such as pausing ATM programs and prioritizing stock buybacks while premiums exist. Glassnode lead analyst James Check shared similar concerns about the longevity of corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies. “ My instinct is the Bitcoin treasury strategy has a far shorter lifespan than most expect ,” Check posted on X in July. Check argued that while early adopters, such as MicroStrategy, which holds nearly 600,000 BTC, have established their dominance, newer treasury firms face steeper challenges. Nobody wants the 50th Treasury company. I think we're already close to the 'show me' phase, where it will be increasingly difficult for random company x to sustain a premium and get off the ground without a serious niche. Retail speculators buy startup TCos, and they don't have… — _Checkmate (@_Checkmatey_) July 4, 2025 “ Nobody wants the 50th treasury company ,” he noted, warning that investors increasingly demand clear differentiation rather than another firm simply adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet.

On Saturday, Krüger wrote on X , that “most crypto charts now look so broken and bearish that it’s bullish.” He argued that when price action looks this bad, the panic has usually gone far enough that a reversal may not be far behind. The bearish charts Krüger attached a series of charts from Binance and derivatives dashboards. They included bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) spot price charts, both of which had fallen below short-term upward trendlines, creating a technically bearish picture. He also posted a solana (SOL) chart that showed relative resilience compared with BTC and ETH. Alongside those, he shared BTC-USDT and ETH-USDT derivatives charts, which combined futures indicators — such as funding rates and long liquidations — with options metrics like skew. Together, they showed traders had turned heavily defensive. Liquidations and leverage reset In his post, Krüger said long liquidations had been “significant,” especially in “the last two rounds after the close today.” In futures markets, traders can borrow to take bullish bets. When prices fall, their collateral gets wiped out and exchanges automatically close positions. This kind of forced selling pushes prices down further in a cascade. Once it’s over, however, markets can stabilize because the excess leverage has already been flushed out. Majors under pressure, alts steadier The analyst also highlighted that bitcoin and ether absorbed most of the selling, while many altcoins had already stopped crashing earlier in the day. Normally, smaller tokens collapse after majors, not before them. For Krüger, that divergence is “often a sign of upcoming strength,” suggesting panic selling may be winding down. Krüger told followers to “check the skew,” noting that puts were much more expensive than calls. In options markets, that imbalance signals defensive positioning and heightened fear. For contrarians like Krüger, one-sided fear often precedes a rebound, because if everyone is already hedging, there are fewer sellers left to push prices lower. The FOMC catalyst While he is “bullish into next week,” Krüger said he doesn’t expect strong trends to develop until after the Federal Reserve’s next policy meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets Sept. 16–17, with a rate decision and press conference at the conclusion on Sept. 17. He expects the Fed to cut interest rates, which he argues is “not fully priced in.” Lower rates reduce the cost of borrowing and often add liquidity, which can boost demand for risk assets like crypto. The cycle view Krüger emphasized that this is not the end of the cycle, even if prices fall further in the short term. At the same time, he does not expect the kind of euphoric “blow-off top” that has marked past crypto bull markets. The one exception, he said, could be SOL, which continues to attract inflows from new decentralized treasuries deploying capital on the network. For Krüger, the setup is straightforward: charts look ugly, liquidations are behind, options pricing screams fear, and the Fed decision looms. His message was simple — the time to bet on upside is when panic is loudest, not when celebrations begin.",Markets|crypto market|Federal Reserve|btc|ETH|Altcoins|Technical Analysis|News,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-30 21:00:00

The country transferred 6,274 BTC — roughly $678 million at current prices — out of a single address and into 14 separate addresses, with each new address holding up to 500 BTC. Split Wallets To Limit Exposure Based on reports from the Bitcoin Office, the move was meant to reduce the impact of any future quantum breakthrough. Officials said the shift was a simple, defensive step. Once funds are spent from a Bitcoin address, the address’s public key becomes visible on the blockchain. That public key, people warn, would be the target if quantum machines ever reached the ability to solve elliptic curve cryptography. El Salvador is moving the funds from a single Bitcoin address into multiple new, unused addresses as part of a strategic initiative to enhance the security and long-term custody of the National Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This action aligns with best practices in Bitcoin… — The Bitcoin Office (@bitcoinofficesv) August 29, 2025 According to Project Eleven, 6 million Bitcoin — worth around $650 billion — could be exposed if such a capability ever arrived. The math behind the concern is clear: Bitcoin private keys use 256-bit values, and current quantum systems running Shor’s algorithm have not even cracked a three-bit key. Quantum Risk Is Largely Theoretical Experts say practical quantum attacks on Bitcoin are not imminent. Project Eleven and other researchers emphasize that the threat remains theoretical for now. No public quantum computer has demonstrated the power needed to threaten modern cryptography. Michael Saylor commented in June that warnings about quantum attacks are overblown and that if a real threat appeared, upgrades to Bitcoin software and the hardware ecosystem would be implemented. The argument follows a simple logic: software and hardware can be changed; cryptography can be upgraded. That does not make the risk zero. It only puts the danger far down the timeline for most observers. The technical point driving this action is straightforward. When coins leave an address, the blockchain reveals the public key connected to the private key used to sign that transaction. If a powerful enough quantum computer later appears, that public key could, in theory, be used to derive the private key and drain the address. By spreading funds across 14 addresses, El Salvador reduces the maximum amount exposed if any single wallet is compromised after spending. What This Means For Other Holders Custodians and large holders may take notice of low-cost steps. The move is small in operational cost but large in symbolism. Other governments, exchanges, and big holders keep watching cryptography advances; splitting large holdings is one straightforward technique they can use without changing how Bitcoin itself works.

In the Netherlands, cybercrime police seized two physical servers in Amsterdam and took over 21 virtual servers. At the same time, the FBI shut down two domains and a promotional blog connected to the site. As reported, the website sold counterfeit documents for as little as $9, with payments made in cryptocurrency. VerifTools Busted as Global Hub for Fake Crypto ID Worth Millions VerifTools was designed to look like a normal online service. Customers had to upload a passport-style photo and share their personal details. The operators then used this information to make fake IDs, such as passports and driving licenses. FBI agents tested the system by ordering fake New Mexico driving licenses, which were successfully delivered after paying in crypto. The investigation showed how profitable the marketplace had become. The FBI estimated that VerifTools made around $6.4 million over its lifetime. Reportedly , Dutch police calculated that it brought in about €1.3 million, worth about $1.5 million, every year. This made it one of the most active providers of fake IDs worldwide. Crypto Fake IDs Are Becoming More Sophisticated Experts warned that the fake ID industry has grown quickly in recent years. Kartik Venkatesh, global head of innovation at identity technology company GBG, explained that counterfeit documents today are made with industrial-level machinery. Unlike the basic fakes of past decades, modern counterfeit IDs are almost identical to real ones. This makes them extremely difficult to detect without specialized equipment. Authorities said fake IDs are often used by criminals to bypass “Know Your Customer” (KYC) checks, which banks, financial firms, and crypto exchanges must follow by law. In the UK, police in Wales found the VerifTools website during a fraud case. This shows that the platform was active across countries and helped fraudsters worldwide. The rising demand for fake IDs is fueling the problem. Officials also warned that artificial intelligence (AI) is now being used to make fake IDs look more real. Some of these forgeries are AI-generated, making them harder to spot and quicker to produce in large numbers. Stronger Digital ID Checks Seen as Key to Fighting Fake IDs Experts say stronger ID verification tools are crucial to stopping this trend. Modern systems can combine document scanning, facial recognition, liveness detection, and behavior checks. These steps can catch errors that humans would likely miss. Digital IDs may also help since they are protected by cryptography and can be confirmed instantly with issuing authorities, making them much harder to fake. However, experts warned that digital IDs also carry new risks. Criminals might try to build fake digital identities, use deepfake biometrics, or steal digital credentials. Officials stressed the need for balance and said that only layered checks that can adapt to new threats will work against fraudsters.

As of press time, XRP trades near ~$2.80–$2.83 with muted intraday swings, keeping price glued to a narrow band that has defined August. CoinMarketCap Why This Monthly Close Matters A monthly close often anchors trend bias for the following period. For XRP, August’s candle has compressed after June–July volatility, leaving price just below psychological resistance in the low-$3 zone and above defensive support in the high-$2s . That clustering raises the stakes for September: a decisive close above prior supply around $3.00–$3.05 could open a path toward the $3.30–$3.50 area, while a failure to reclaim $3 could keep XRP range-bound into early Q4. (Levels derived from recent daily/monthly ranges and historical pivots.) For historical context on recent closes and ranges, see XRP’s daily/weekly/monthly history. Fresh Macro Context: Regulatory Overhang Clears A major overhang faded this month: the SEC’s long-running case against Ripple has effectively concluded, with a $125 million penalty and an injunction on certain institutional sales, while secondary-market trading of XRP was not deemed a securities offering —a position aligned with Judge Analisa Torres’ 2023 ruling. The closure, finalized in August 2025, removes a key uncertainty for large allocators and exchanges. Why it matters: Regulatory clarity can tighten spreads, improve on-ramps, and broaden participation—especially around monthly rebalancing windows. Coverage across mainstream and crypto-native outlets has emphasized the legal finality and the relatively modest final penalty relative to initial SEC demands. Price Snapshot (Into the Close) Spot price: ~$2.80 (range today ~$2.77–$2.83). Market cap rank: Top 5 crypto assets. 24h turnover: Multi-billion USD, consistent with blue-chip liquidity conditions. CoinMarketCap Key Technical Levels to Watch Immediate resistance: $3.00–$3.05: Psychological handle and supply shelf that capped several intraday advances this month. A firm close above strengthens the bull case. Secondary resistance: $3.30–$3.50: Prior distribution area; acceptance here would shift medium-term structure constructive. Immediate support: $2.75–$2.95: High-traffic demand zone through August. Deeper support: $2.50–$2.60: Where buyers previously defended trend integrity on higher-time-frames (HTFs). (Levels contextualized using public OHLC prints; see Yahoo Finance / CMC histories.) Structure & Momentum: What the Tape Is Saying On the monthly timeframe, XRP has spent the past several candles building what technicians describe as a consolidation base after reclaiming the $2 handle earlier this year. A base-and-break pattern often needs: Range definition (done), A forceful breakout (monthly close above resistance), and Follow-through (weekly acceptance above the breakout level). Two-month context: Several analysts noted XRP’s unusual two-month strength above $2 into late August, framing this close as a structural inflection. While targets vary widely in social chatter, the important takeaway for news readers is the level-by-level invalidation rather than headline price targets. Fundamental & Flow Catalysts 1) Post-Case “Access Premium” With the SEC matter wrapped and key questions about secondary-market trading resolved, XRP’s listing and custody pathways face fewer legal ambiguities. In 2020–2024, episodic delistings/relists and policy caution created friction; a clean legal end often ushers in broader institutional comfort and clearer compliance playbooks. Expect month-end/quarter-end flows to reflect that shift more than day-to-day headlines. 2) CBDC & Cross-Border Payments Tailwinds Global central-bank digital-currency work accelerated through 2024–2025. India’s e-rupee pilot expanded with new use cases and growing circulation in FY2025, underscoring momentum behind wholesale and retail CBDCs —a macro theme that aligns with Ripple’s long-stated focus on cross-border settlement rails . While CBDC progress is not a direct XRP price driver, policy pilots keep payments infrastructure in the spotlight , a narrative that tends to benefit large-cap payments-oriented crypto assets. 3) Liquidity, Derivatives & Seasonality Monthly closes often interact with futures positioning and liquidity rebalancing . An orderly close above $3 could invite systematic trend participation in early September; conversely, a rejection wicks price back into August’s range and re-establishes $2.75–$2.95 as the “value” pocket. Public datasets (spot/derivatives OI and funding) will be the tell into the new month. Scenarios Into September Bullish Breakout (Close ≥ $3.05 with follow-through) Trigger: Strong monthly close above $3.05 plus weekly acceptance. Implication: Opens a $3.30–$3.50 probe; momentum styles press longs. Risk: Over-extension without volume = throwback to retest $3. Range Extension (Close $2.85–$3.00) Trigger: No decisive break; August range persists. Implication: Chop between $2.75–$3.05 ; traders fade extremes. Risk: Fatigue builds; macro headline needed to change regime. Bearish Rejection (Close ≤ $2.75) Trigger: Loss of value area on sell volume. Implication: Tests $2.60 and possibly $2.50 ; bulls wait for absorption. Risk: Narrative sours if bid fails to appear at prior demand. What’s Different From Earlier Cycles? Legal clarity is now concrete, not hypothetical. Markets tend to price pathways, not just outcomes. Institutional rails and compliance frameworks are sturdier than in 2017–2021, enhancing on-ramps and custody for payment-focused assets. CBDC pilots are moving from white papers to field tests, widening the policy conversation around cross-border efficiency. Data Points to Track After the Close Spot liquidity near $3: depth on major books and slippage statistics. Derivatives posture: open interest and funding rates through the first 72 hours of September. On-chain activity: active addresses and exchange flows to gauge whether a breakout is driven by rotation or fresh capital. Headline risk: macro data, policy comments, or exchange listing updates. Bottom Line XRP’s August monthly close sets up a classic “base-then-break” possibility into September. With regulatory risk reduced and macro payments narratives intact, the market has the ingredients for trend continuation— if buyers can reclaim and hold the low-$3s. Until then, $2.75–$3.05 remains the operative map for risk management. Price note: Live market data at press time shows XRP near $2.80 , within a ~$2.77–$2.83 intraday band.

The total cryptocurrency market capitalization is up 9.9% since January, adding over $600 billion despite an early decline in Q1. The exchange attributes the recovery to global monetary conditions. Notably, global money supply grew at its fastest pace since 2021, making more capital available for markets. At the same time, the U.S. central bank stopped reducing liquidity, even though it still signaled caution. Bitcoin and Ethereum Drive Market Strength According to the report , Bitcoin and Ethereum remained the leading assets in 2025. Ether (ETH) rose by about 36%, the highest among major tokens, while bitcoin (BTC) advanced nearly 18% during the same period. One key factor behind this momentum was U.S. spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which attracted over $28 billion in net inflows. Binance’s report added that possible approvals of altcoin ETFs could provide further liquidity and expand participation. ETF demand and treasury allocations also pushed Bitcoin dominance from 40% to 65.1% earlier in the year. The share later eased to 57.2%, pointing to a rotation of capital into alternative assets. Ethereum followed a different trend, with staking reaching 35.8 million ETH after the Pectra upgrade and growing institutional adoption. With nearly 30% of ETH locked, Binance described the effect as a liquidity squeeze that may strengthen its long-term position. Wider Market Shifts and On-Chain Growth Along with the momentum in Bitcoin and Ethereum, stablecoin supply expanded by 35% to $277.8 billion. The increase shows broader adoption across markets as well as in payment and settlement use cases. Institutional participation increased as well, with public companies now holding 1.07 million BTC, or 5.4% of the supply. Strategy remains the largest holder, while ETH corporate treasuries jumped 88.3% in a single month to 4.36 million ETH. On-chain activity kept pace with these trends. Decentralized exchanges captured 23.1% of spot activity and 9.3% of futures volumes in 2025. DeFi lending also expanded, with total value locked rising 65% to nearly $80 billion. The report also highlighted progress in tokenized equities.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $108,911 (-0.9%) Market cap $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $124,457; August 14, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $109,165 24-hour low $108,300 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $ 133,640 (+35.66%) Fear & Greed Index 65 (Greed) Sentiment Neutral Volatility 3.54% Green Days 16/30 (53%) 50-Day SMA $ 111,818 200-Day SMA $ 91,276 14-Day RSI 42.21 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin consolidates above $108K Resistance for BTC is at $110,991 Support for BTC/USD is at $107,121 The BTC price analysis for 30 August confirms that BTC faces a drop in volatility as the price consolidates above $108K. The price is now aiming for a consolidation within a bearish channel. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces consolidation around $108K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faces consolidation as it hovers above $108K. Currently, the market is facing equal domination from both buyers and sellers. The 24-hour volume has dropped to $1.41 billion, showing a decline in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $108,911, declining by over 0.9% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and trades at 38, hinting that a correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. However, sellers are aiming for a trend continuation below $112K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.17, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $110,991, it will fuel a bullish rally to $118,006. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $107,121, beginning a bearish trend to $104,944. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in selling demand as buyers failed to push the price above Fib levels. The recent highs triggered strong selling. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Metaplanet, a Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed firm, has announced plans to raise $881 million through an international share offering, with the majority set for bitcoin purchases. Bitcoin price prediction August 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $123,000, making July its best month in 2025. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction August 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 $68,000 $120,000 $160,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 2031 $285,058 $303,555 $350,548 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETF approval (Bitcoin exchange traded funds). Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-30 21:20:00

Is a Bitcoin $1 million price target realistic within the next market cycle? As spot Bitcoin ETFs transform access for traditional investors and on-chain supply tightens post-halving, the debate has shifted from clickbait to serious portfolio math. This report dissects the drivers—ETF adoption, issuance constraints, institutional treasuries, and macro flows—while pressure-testing bullish models against credible counter-arguments. Key takeaways Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have changed market structure, lowering frictions and accelerating institutional participation since their approval on January 10, 2024 . SEC Industry dashboards and asset-manager updates show U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF assets have surged past the $100B mark in 2025 , with BlackRock’s IBIT leading the pack. Supply dynamics tightened after the April 2024 halving , and “ancient supply” held for 10+ years has been rising—evidence of long-term conviction reducing liquid float. Scenario models from ARK Invest outline a 2030 base case near ~$710k and bull case ~$1.5M , framing what must go right for seven-figure prices. Near-term, mainstream banks like Standard Chartered project $135k–$200k as 2025 targets—far below $1M—underscoring how much upside is still required for the million-dollar thesis. Why ETFs changed the conversation The SEC’s January 2024 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs removed a structural barrier for pensions, RIAs, and institutions that cannot self-custody crypto. The result has been large, visible flows into registered products that rebalance transparently, track NAV, and slot easily into traditional portfolios. SEC Throughout 2025, tracking sources and fund disclosures have shown rapid AUM growth , with IBIT frequently cited as approaching or crossing milestone asset levels, and the broader U.S. spot ETF category above $100B . This scale supports the thesis that incremental demand now comes from allocators , not only retail traders—an adoption curve more comparable to gold’s financialization. etf.com Why that matters for price: steady, rules-based ETF inflows can create persistent net demand against a hard-capped issuance schedule , especially during risk-on macro windows. If allocators raise target weights in model portfolios from basis points to low single digits, the absolute dollar buying pressure can dominate price formation. Scarcity math after the 2024 halving Bitcoin’s design cuts the block subsidy roughly every four years. The most recent halving occurred in April 2024 , reducing new issuance and tightening miner supply into rising institutional demand. A complementary piece of the puzzle is “ancient supply” —coins dormant for 10+ years. New research from Fidelity Digital Assets highlights that ancient supply growth has outpaced new issuance , a historic shift that removes liquid float from circulation and amplifies any demand shock. Fidelity Digital Assets Combine these two effects and you get a structural setup: less new BTC hitting the market while more existing BTC is effectively “locked” by holders with very low realized price and high conviction. What credible models say about $1 million Institutional research houses have published scenario trees rather than point guesses: ARK Invest (Big Ideas 2025) lays out a 2030 base case around $710k and a bull case near $1.5M , contingent on adoption across remittances, corporate treasuries, nation-states, and investment allocation shares. The methodology triangulates Bitcoin’s potential TAMs with supply constraints. These are conditional outcomes, not promises. They imply that to approach $1M per BTC , several things must converge: ETF penetration into wealth-management channels; Corporate/sovereign balance-sheet adoption; Continued maturation of custody, accounting, and derivatives; Favorable or at least neutral policy regime. Reality check for 2025: Major banks with public calls are far more conservative . Standard Chartered has discussed $135k by end-Q3 2025 and $200k into year-end , reflecting cyclical, not transformational, pricing. That’s supportive of upside, but still orders of magnitude from $1M, emphasizing the long runway required for the super-bull case. The institutional flywheel—and its risks The flywheel: Access: ETFs make compliance and operations easy for fiduciaries. SEC AUM growth: As models add BTC sleeves, ETF assets compound , drawing liquidity, options markets, and research coverage. Volatility dampening: Deeper two-way flows and listed derivatives can smooth drawdowns relative to prior cycles (though crypto remains volatile). Benchmarking: Once a handful of CIOs adopt a 0.5%–1% sleeve, peers face career risk for ignoring a top-performing, diversifying asset. Risks to the thesis: Macro tightening or a strong USD can compress risk-asset multiples and stall ETF inflows. Policy shocks or adverse rulings could widen bid-ask spreads and stress liquidity. Concentration: Heavy ownership via a few mega-funds may introduce single-product flow risk and tracking frictions during stress. How the path to $1 million could (theoretically) unfold Below is a simplified, conservative pathway—not a prediction: ETF penetration : If U.S. wealth platforms and pensions move from effectively 0% to an average 0.5% portfolio weight , the dollar buying pressure could be hundreds of billions , given the U.S. advisory market size. Evidence: U.S. spot BTC ETFs have already scaled past $100B AUM in ~18–20 months. Diminishing float : With halving-reduced issuance and ancient supply rising , the market-available BTC shrinks on the margin—magnifying the price impact of each incremental dollar. Model upgrades : As price and liquidity rise, risk teams expand limits; allocators raise sleeves from 0.5% to 1–2% in diversified portfolios. Globalization : Europe and Asia deepen spot ETF markets; cross-border capital improves turnover and price discovery. Corporate/sovereign adoption : Additional balance-sheet allocations (following early pioneers) further inelasticize supply. Under those conditions, ARK’s 2030 bull case (~$1.5M) moves from hypothetical to plausible , even if the base case stops well short. Counter-arguments (and how to stress-test them) “ETFs are a one-time shock.” If ETF flows stall, price momentum fades. Watch cumulative net inflows and AUM share across issuers to see if adoption is broadening, not just concentrated in one fund. (Industry dashboards and fund pages provide ongoing transparency.) “Bitcoin is still too volatile.” True—drawdowns remain large. The question is whether deeper ETF liquidity and listed options tame extremes over time. Evidence so far suggests improving depth , even if crypto beta remains high. “Macroeconomics will re-rate risk assets lower.” A strong USD or higher real yields could compress multiples across equities and crypto. If that coincides with negative crypto-specific news, models pointing to $1M get pushed out. Where the consensus sits today Fact: Spot ETFs exist , are approved, and have accumulated triple-digit billions in assets—this is no longer theoretical. SEC Fact: Post-halving issuance is lower, and long-term holder (ancient) supply is climbing, reducing tradable float. Fact: Sell-side targets for 2025 are in the $135k–$200k range, not $1M. Implication: $1M is a 2030-style outcome requiring multiple adoption gears to grind higher—possible, but far from guaranteed. FAQs Q1: Did the SEC really approve spot Bitcoin ETFs? Yes. The Commission approved the listing and trading of multiple spot Bitcoin ETPs on Jan 10, 2024 . SEC Q2: How big are these ETFs now? By 2025, reputable trackers and industry commentary indicate U.S. spot BTC ETF assets exceeded $100B , led by BlackRock’s IBIT. Q3: What’s the most credible long-term model for $1M? ARK Invest outlines a 2030 bull case near $1.5M and a base case around $710k , contingent on widespread adoption. Q4: What about supply—how many bitcoins exist? The April 2024 halving cut new issuance; research shows ancient supply is rising , further tightening tradable float. Q5: Will Bitcoin hit $1M? It’s possible but not inevitable . Current 2025 sell-side targets cluster in $135k–$200k ; the seven-figure case needs several more adoption waves.

With Bitcoin solidifying above $110,000 while Ethereum ETFs draw institutional inflows, the focus has now shifted toward Layer-1 networks and presales that can offer stronger returns. XRP, Cardano, BNB, and TRON are garnering attention in current markets due to their respective strong fundamentals and growth. However, analysts believe that the undervalued breakout to watch is MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is now seeing whale inflows and retail momentum this quarter. XRP: Regulatory Clarity Boosts Adoption XRP is currently trading at around $2.94; although down on the day, it remains considered bullish in the long term. Ripple’s $125 million settlement with the SEC has brought regulatory clarity that many institutional investors have been awaiting. Following the settlement, a whale accumulated over 50 million XRP in just weeks. Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD, which now has over $600 million in circulation, will boost its utility for cross-border payments. According to analysts, XRP is among the top Layer-1 plays leading into Q4 as fintech partnerships ramping up adoption. Cardano: Institutional Growth and Innovation Cardano is currently trading between $0.84 and $0.87. The digital asset struggled to hold support at $0.85. Ecosystem developments are considerable notwithstanding price pressure. A fund development of $71 million was approved for accelerating scaling upgrades Hydra, the Ouroboros Leios consensus, and Project Acropolis modular nodes. Cardano has been added to the Nasdaq Crypto Index and relisted on major exchanges, restoring access for investors. The fact that Franklin Templeton is operating these ADA nodes is a strong indication of institutional confidence. Moreover, some nested transactions have also been implemented. BNB: DeFi Expansion and Institutional Confidence BNB is priced at approximately $846, up over 7% on the day and 8% in August. Its ecosystem has grown robustly, with stablecoin supply up 58% year-to-date to $11.1 billion, reflecting renewed momentum in DeFi. Investment firm B Strategy announced a $1 billion BNB reserve plan, providing liquidity and infrastructure to support the strengthening of adoption. As BNB Chain celebrates its 5th anniversary with rewards and community milestones, it continues to reinforce its status as one of the most influential Layer-1 ecosystems. TRON: Scaling Adoption and Compliance Strength TRON is trading between $0.343-$0.351; near-term weakness can be expected, but further upside is possible if resistance is broken. The network has recently integrated on MetaMask, offering over 100 million users access to its $26 billion DeFi ecosystem. TRON launched the Beacon Network in collaboration with Coinbase, Binance, and TRM Labs to freeze stolen cryptocurrency and enhance compliance. TRON, the largest stablecoin network, is responsible for approximately 60% of USDT transactions worldwide. After achieving that status, TRON is exploring new features, such as gasless USDT, which will enhance liquidity and reduce the costs of transferring USDT. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Undervalued Breakout Pick XRP, Cardano, BNB, and TRON are all highlighted as top Layer-1 plays for Q4 2025, but analysts say the undervalued breakout is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Backed by double audits from HashEx and CertiK, it’s rated safe, secure, and fully transparent, passing every test. With forecasts of 40x upside and whale-backed inflows accelerating, it’s being called one of the best altcoins to buy this quarter before allocations run out. Analysts emphasize that MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just another speculative presale but a project combining verifiable security, transparency, and retail adoption. With a KYC-verified team and a fast-closing presale, momentum is compounding at a pace rarely seen outside of previous cycle winners like Ethereum and Solana. Conclusion XRP, Cardano, BNB and TRON have unique strengths as Q4 2025 unfolds, from stablecoin dominance to scaling upgrades and regulatory clarity. Analysts agree that presales may drive the most explosive upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been recognized as one of the top new altcoins to buy this quarter due to demand from whales, security assurances, and estimates of 40x ROI.

This amount was one of the highest levels of the year, excluding the extraordinary profit realization that occurred on July 4th, which approached $9 billion. According to the data, this massive selling pressure came mainly from whales: Süper balinalar (>10.000 BTC): 2.17 milyar dolar Big whales (1,000-10,000 BTC): $1.25 billion Other whales (100-1,000 BTC): $495 million Related News: Former Governor of the People's Bank of China Publishes Article Concerning the Cryptocurrency Sector: Issues Warning CryptoOnchain noted that this move suggests that large, long-term investors are capitalizing on recent price increases and making substantial profits. This type of selling typically occurs at local peaks and can signal a short-term correction or consolidation. The statement also noted that signals that Bitcoin is shifting from “strong hands to weak hands” could exacerbate market fragility. Experts point out that while this selling wave may not be the start of a long-term downtrend, it serves as a significant warning for short-term investors.

Since the 2022 bear market, U.S. stocks have soared while commodities collapsed. The S&P 500 has surged by 71%, while the Commodity Price Index, which tracks energy, metals, agriculture, and fertilizers based on global trade weightings, has dropped 31%. The ratio hasn’t looked this stretched, not even during the Dot-Com Bubble. Some commodities are now sitting at levels investors haven’t seen in decades. This extreme divergence has pulled attention back to raw materials, which have taken a beating while equities hit record highs. The index blew past its 2020 pandemic peak and never looked back. According to Wells Fargo Investment Institute, the setup is a wake-up call for anyone still chasing stock rallies without considering portfolio risk. Wells Fargo tells investors to dump small caps and switch into quality bonds Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo, said in a Tuesday note that investors should begin pulling back from equities. “Even as the S&P 500 Index makes new all-time highs, investors may want to trim equity allocations to position portfolios ahead of the volatility we expect in the coming weeks and months,” Paul wrote. He warned that shocks could come from either policy decisions or economic surprises. The S&P 500 broke above 6,500 for the first time on Thursday but closed lower on Friday. Paul told CNBC the recent strength in stocks justifies reducing exposure in certain areas. He’s sticking with large-cap tech, still keeping an overweight in information technology, but he’s taken profits from communication services and small-cap stocks. The adjustment keeps the overall structure at 60% stocks, 40% fixed income, but the mix within each side is changing. He added exposure to financial stocks, calling them a beneficiary if the Federal Reserve goes ahead with interest rate cuts. “If short-term rates are going to fall and the economy is going to slow, that means that the yield curve is going to steepen,” Paul said. “If you’re a bank, that’s a good situation for you, because now your cost of deposits — on the short end of the yield curve — has gotten cheaper, so you’re paying less money to your depositors. On the other hand, the long-term yields that are, which is what you earn from your loans, those rates are staying more or less steady.” He sees growing pressure on the Fed as President Donald Trump, now back in the White House, looks to place loyalists on the Federal Reserve Board. Trump’s attempt to remove Lisa Cook, one of the sitting board members, is currently in court. Paul said the bigger concern is structural. “The fear would be if the Fed does become a creature of the administration, of any administration, Republican or Democrat… then there’s always going to be pressure on the Fed to ease as the government wants to borrow more, and that would be inflationary over the longer term.” Paul advised investors shifting into bonds to focus on intermediate-term, high-quality assets; specifically investment-grade corporates and municipal bonds.

Today, Nvidia stands at the epicenter of another transformative era: the artificial intelligence revolution. The company recently reported staggering Q2 Nvidia revenue figures, showcasing its dominant position. However, a closer look reveals a fascinating twist: a significant portion of this record-breaking success – nearly 40% – came from just two undisclosed customers. This revelation sparks crucial questions about market concentration, future stability, and the true drivers behind the unprecedented demand for AI infrastructure. Unpacking Nvidia’s Astounding Q2 Nvidia Revenue Surge Nvidia, a titan in the semiconductor industry, announced an impressive $46.7 billion in revenue for its second fiscal quarter, which concluded on July 27. This represents a remarkable 56% year-over-year increase, a testament to the surging demand for its high-performance chips. This growth is predominantly attributed to the insatiable appetite of the AI data center sector. Yet, the subsequent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unveiled a detail that has captured the attention of analysts and investors alike: a substantial chunk of this revenue originated from an incredibly small client base. Specifically, the filing indicated that a single entity, referred to as “Customer A,” was responsible for a substantial 23% of Nvidia’s total Q2 revenue. Another significant client, “Customer B,” contributed an additional 16%. Combined, these two mystery customers accounted for a remarkable 39% of the company’s quarterly earnings. For the first half of the fiscal year, their contributions were similarly impactful, with Customer A representing 20% and Customer B 15% of total revenue. Beyond these two, Nvidia also identified four other customers who each accounted for 14%, 11%, another 11%, and 10% of Q2 revenue, further highlighting a concentrated customer landscape. It is important to understand Nvidia’s classification of these clients. The company clarified that these are “direct” customers, typically original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), system integrators, or distributors who purchase chips directly from Nvidia. This distinction suggests that the immediate buyers are not the end-users like large cloud service providers (CSPs) or consumer internet companies. Instead, these indirect customers acquire Nvidia chips through the direct channels. This implies that while Microsoft, Oracle, Amazon, or Google might not be Customer A or B directly, their massive AI initiatives are almost certainly fueling the demand that flows through these direct purchasers. The Unstoppable AI Boom and Nvidia’s GPU Dominance The meteoric rise in Nvidia’s fortunes is inextricably linked to the ongoing AI boom . Artificial intelligence, particularly in areas like large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, requires immense computational power to train and deploy. Nvidia’s GPUs, with their parallel processing capabilities, are uniquely suited for these demanding workloads. The company’s CUDA platform and specialized AI accelerators have become the de facto industry standard, creating a powerful ecosystem that is difficult for competitors to replicate. The demand for these high-performance processors has transformed the technology landscape. From advanced research institutions to tech giants developing the next generation of AI services, everyone is scrambling to acquire Nvidia’s hardware. This surge in demand has not only driven Nvidia’s revenue but has also solidified its position as a critical enabler of the AI revolution. The company’s innovative chip designs, such as the Hopper and Grace architectures, are at the forefront of this technological wave, pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve. This shift mirrors, in a way, the previous scramble for GPUs during peak cryptocurrency mining periods, but on a far grander and more strategically significant scale, driving foundational changes across industries. Decoding the Mystery: Who Are These Key Players Driving GPU Market Demand? While Nvidia’s filing maintains the anonymity of Customer A and Customer B, the company’s Chief Financial Officer, Nicole Kress, offered a significant clue during a recent earnings call. Kress stated that “large cloud service providers” were responsible for 50% of Nvidia’s data center revenue, which itself constitutes 88% of the company’s total revenue. This insight strongly suggests that while Customer A and B are direct distributors, the ultimate drivers of this massive spending in the GPU market are indeed the hyperscale cloud providers. These tech giants – including Microsoft (Azure), Amazon (AWS), Google (Google Cloud), and Oracle (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) – are engaged in an intense race to build out their AI capabilities and offer cutting-edge AI services to their enterprise and consumer clients. Their investments in data center infrastructure, specifically in high-end GPUs, are colossal. They are not just buying chips; they are building entire AI factories, complete with vast clusters of interconnected GPUs, specialized networking, and advanced cooling systems. Therefore, it is highly probable that Customer A and B are key distributors or system integrators who serve these very cloud providers, acting as crucial intermediaries in the supply chain. The sheer scale of their operations and their strategic imperative to lead in AI makes them the most logical indirect beneficiaries of Nvidia’s hardware. Each cloud provider is vying for supremacy, offering various AI models, platforms, and services, all underpinned by powerful Nvidia GPUs. This fierce competition is a primary engine behind the unprecedented demand currently observed in the GPU market . The Double-Edged Sword of Concentrated Data Center Spending The concentration of nearly 40% of Nvidia’s revenue from just two customers, while currently a boon, presents a classic business paradox. Gimme Credit analyst Dave Novosel aptly pointed out to Fortune that “concentration of revenue among such a small group of customers does present a significant risk.” This is a critical consideration for any company, as reliance on a few large buyers can introduce volatility and dependency. Should one of these key customers significantly reduce their orders, or even shift to a competitor or develop their own in-house AI chips, Nvidia’s financial performance could be substantially impacted. However, Novosel also offered a reassuring counterpoint: “the good news is that these customers have bountiful cash on hand, generate massive amounts of free cash flow, and are expected to spend lavishly on data centers over the next couple of years.” This suggests that the immediate risk is mitigated by the financial strength and long-term strategic commitment of these large entities to their AI initiatives. Their substantial data center spending is not a fleeting trend but a fundamental investment in their future growth and competitive advantage. Let’s examine the implications of this customer concentration: Aspect High Customer Concentration (Current Situation) Diversified Customer Base (Ideal State) Revenue Stability Potentially volatile if large customers shift purchasing patterns; high impact from individual customer decisions. More resilient to individual customer changes; revenue spread across many clients reduces single-point-of-failure risk. Bargaining Power Large customers may exert significant leverage over pricing and terms due to their order volume. Nvidia retains more control over pricing and product development with a broader client base. Risk Exposure High risk if a major customer reduces orders, delays projects, or transitions to alternative suppliers. Lower risk spread across many clients and market segments, enhancing overall business resilience. Growth Potential Driven by large, consistent orders from established tech giants, but growth may be capped by their internal strategies. Broader market penetration, ability to tap into emerging segments and smaller, innovative AI startups. Innovation Drive Innovation might be heavily influenced by the specific needs and roadmaps of the largest clients. Broader innovation for diverse market needs, fostering a wider array of applications and use cases. For now, the benefits of massive, consistent orders from well-capitalized customers outweigh the risks. These customers are not merely buying components; they are investing in the very foundation of their future services, ensuring a sustained period of high demand for Nvidia’s cutting-edge hardware. The question for Nvidia is how to leverage this period of intense demand to further solidify its market position and, over time, strategically diversify its customer base to mitigate long-term concentration risks. Navigating Future Growth in the Dynamic Tech Sector Growth Nvidia’s future prospects are undoubtedly bright, anchored by its indispensable role in the AI revolution. The company is not just selling chips; it is selling an entire ecosystem of hardware, software (CUDA), and services that empower AI development. This comprehensive approach makes it challenging for competitors to directly challenge Nvidia’s dominance overnight. However, the rapid pace of tech sector growth means that the landscape is constantly evolving. Key factors for Nvidia’s sustained success include: Continued Innovation: Nvidia must maintain its lead in chip design and AI software to stay ahead of rivals like AMD and Intel, who are aggressively pursuing their own AI strategies. Expansion into Enterprise AI: Beyond hyperscalers, the broader enterprise market is just beginning to adopt AI at scale. Nvidia has significant opportunities to provide solutions for various industries, from healthcare to finance. Mitigating Competition: Cloud providers themselves are investing in custom AI chips (e.g., Google’s TPUs, Amazon’s Trainium/Inferentia). While this poses a long-term threat, Nvidia’s general-purpose GPUs and ecosystem still offer flexibility and broad utility. Geographic Diversification: Expanding market reach in emerging AI hubs globally can help reduce reliance on a few regions or customers. The current environment is characterized by intense investment in AI infrastructure, and Nvidia is poised to capitalize on this for the foreseeable future. However, prudent management of customer relationships and a continuous drive for innovation will be crucial in navigating the complexities of sustained tech sector growth and mitigating the inherent risks of a concentrated customer base. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Nvidia’s AI-Powered Future Nvidia’s second-quarter results paint a picture of extraordinary success, fueled by the relentless march of artificial intelligence. The significant contribution from just two mystery customers underscores the monumental scale of investment happening within the AI data center sector. While this concentration presents a potential risk, the financial robustness and strategic commitment of these large customers offer a strong foundation for Nvidia’s near-term growth. As the AI boom continues to reshape industries globally, Nvidia’s GPUs remain the backbone of this technological transformation. The company’s ability to innovate, expand its ecosystem, and strategically manage its customer relationships will determine its long-term trajectory. For investors and industry watchers, Nvidia’s performance offers a compelling narrative of immense opportunity intertwined with the nuanced challenges of hyper-growth in a rapidly evolving market.

With a wave of coordinated filings, extended deadlines, and analysts assigning a 95% chance of approval , the stage is set for one of the most important decisions in crypto history. Many believe this could trigger a 4x rally in XRP price , making it one of the hottest assets of 2025. But while investors eye XRP’s explosive growth, another rising project is stealing attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE , a new blockchain-driven ecosystem designed to give early buyers a powerful edge in the next bull run. XRP (Ripple) Updates: ETF Momentum Builds On August 22, 2025 , seven powerhouse asset managers—including Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary, CoinShares, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and WisdomTree —filed amended S-1 applications for spot XRP ETFs. This coordinated move signals strong progress with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , after issuers addressed key concerns around creation and redemption mechanisms. The SEC’s extension of review deadlines to October 2025 has only added to the anticipation. Analysts now put approval odds near 95% , with Bloomberg’s James Seyffarth calling the resubmissions a “very good sign” for greenlighting the first U.S. spot XRP ETF.

The Ecosystem Already Live Before Its Official Launch,https://thecoinrise.com/what-is-blockdag-the-ecosystem-already-live-before-its-official-launch/,"Most crypto projects operate on a cycle of promises, selling an idea, raising funds, and leaving users waiting for months or even years to see anything real. BlockDAG (BDAG) has flipped that cycle. Before even confirming its first block, the project has already delivered a functioning ecosystem packed with interactive tools, gamified engagement, and a thriving user base. This isn’t speculation, it’s action. With nearly $387 million raised, more than 25.6 billion BDAG coins sold, a presale ROI of 2,900% since Batch 1, and Batch 30 priced at $0.03, BlockDAG has shown that growth doesn’t need to wait for launch. Users are not left in limbo, they are participating, earning, and learning inside a living network. BlockDAG is proving that when code, culture, and community align before mainnet, a project moves beyond hype and becomes a real movement. The Tech That Powers Parallel Speed Traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum operate on a simple model: one block at a time. While secure, this linear method quickly creates bottlenecks when demand rises. BlockDAG takes a different route by using a Directed Acyclic Graph structure, which allows multiple confirmations to occur simultaneously. This design not only increases throughput but also reduces wait times without cutting corners on integrity. The inclusion of Proof of Work ensures that BlockDAG remains secure while scaling at levels most networks can’t match. What makes this notable is how visible and accessible the technology is. The BlockDAG Explorer provides users with a real-time view of how confirmations happen, letting them see the system work with clarity instead of leaving everything hidden under technical jargon. In short, BlockDAG isn’t promising future breakthroughs, it’s already showing them. The infrastructure is designed for scale and security, and it’s available to explore now, not after some far-off launch. Tools That Turn Users Into Builders BlockDAG has redefined how people engage with presales by creating participation tools that feel like part of the finished ecosystem. The X1 Miner app, already downloaded by over 3 million people, transforms smartphones into gateways for mining BDAG coins. This isn’t a dry presale wallet, it’s gamified, rewarding daily activity and allowing users to climb competitive leaderboards. Buyer Battles expand that concept further. Each batch isn’t just another fundraising stage; it’s a daily challenge that incentivizes engagement and rewards consistent activity. This transforms participation into a dynamic experience, one where interaction feels fun rather than passive. The BlockDAG Academy adds another layer, teaching users about DAG-based infrastructure, mining, and network functions. Combined with the Ambassador Program, which rewards active community growth, BlockDAG ensures that even pre-launch participants are not just buying in, they are learning, building, and contributing. This kind of early inclusion creates a stronger foundation for the ecosystem. Culture That Rewards Contribution Crypto culture often grows after launch, but BlockDAG has cultivated one well before. Every feature is designed to make users part of the system instead of sidelined speculators. Referral programs, leaderboard challenges, and interactive tools encourage real participation and show rewards instantly. This creates a culture where being active isn’t optional, it’s the core of the experience. Rather than relying on hype or influencer-driven campaigns, BlockDAG has chosen to let the product and community speak for themselves. Features like daily bonuses, real-time visibility through the Explorer, and gamified presale mechanics turn casual participants into active stakeholders. The results are undeniable. With nearly $387 million secured, over 25.6 billion BDAG coins sold, and thousands engaging daily, BlockDAG is building a culture that blends code with people-driven energy. It proves that before a single block is confirmed, an ecosystem can already thrive. Final Thoughts So, what is BlockDAG really offering? It’s not a whitepaper waiting for execution. It’s a living ecosystem that’s already rewarding its community through mobile mining, gamified presales, referral loops, and hands-on education.
