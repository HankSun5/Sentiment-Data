A shift is happening—Ethereum and Shiba Inu holders are starting to explore something new in the form of a new meme coin.

Now, fresh changes are sweeping the markets, especially from the meme coins and some Ethereum holders are looking for new opportunities. With the recent uncertainty of Ethereum price predictions, investors are beginning to explore alternative high-growth opportunities beyond ETH. Shiba Inu is also going through a rough patch on the price charts.

Even though Ethereum and Shiba Inu are leading in the DeFi and meme coin spaces, respectively, they face tough competition from newer entries in the market. With ongoing debates about the ETH price forecast for the coming years, investors are seeking assets with greater growth potential. A notable shift is taking place—Ethereum and Shiba Inu investors are turning their attention to an emerging meme coin. Ethereum and Shiba Inu Backers Seek Out a Fresh Meme Coin Ethereum transformed the DeFi landscape through its smart contracts and dApps, elevating its ETH token to the top of the altcoin hierarchy. However, recent shifts, particularly within the meme coin sector, have prompted some Ethereum enthusiasts to explore new opportunities. With the current unpredictability of Ethereum 's price projections, investors are venturing beyond ETH in search of high-growth alternatives. Shiba Inu is also experiencing turbulence in its price trends. Despite broadening its ecosystem, Shiba Inu traders are facing challenges as the meme coin is currently experiencing a 35.8% monthly decline. To recoup their losses, many Shiba Inu investors are now scouting for new projects that might be the best coins to invest in.

With a promise of a whooping 100x returns post-listing, this token is capturing the attention of Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) investors eager for the next big breakout. As momentum builds, many believe 1Fuel is the new crypto to buy before it skyrockets. Meanwhile, fresh ADA news points to shifting investor strategies, with seasoned traders scouting for emerging opportunities. Could 1Fuel be the catalyst for a major market shake-up this February? The growing excitement suggests something huge is on the horizon. 1Fuel Crypto Revolution: Why Solana & Cardano Investors Are Excited About This New Token 1Fuel is set to redefine decentralized finance (DeFi) by addressing some of its biggest challenges with its innovative features. With seamless cross-chain transactions and cutting-edge privacy tools, 1Fuel is positioned to meet the growing demand for smarter and more efficient DeFi platforms. This isn’t just another crypto project; it’s a force driving the crypto revolution. Its innovative revenue-sharing model and staking rewards offering up to 30% APR makes 1Fuel a standout opportunity for passive long-term growth. These features, combined with the surging interest from Solana and Cardano communities, make 1Fuel a major player in the DeFi space, one that’s ready to lead the charge in the upcoming months. The 1Fuel token (OFT) presale is already turning heads, with over 174 million tokens sold and over $1.77M raised . Early investors are already enjoying 70% returns on their initial investments. As the token remains priced at an attractive $0.017, many are rushing to secure their share before the price climbs. This presale has become one of the most talked-about events in DeFi, sparking excitement among investors who see the potential for explosive growth in February. Cardano News: ADA's Market Moves Stir Investor Excitement Amid 1Fuel's Rise February is shaping up to be a great month for Cardano, as recent news highlights its strategic push to enhance ecosystem liquidity and scalability. With the integration of USDC and the rollout of other key upgrades, ADA is positioning itself as a major player in the crypto revolution. These strategic decisions are crucial as ADA's price dynamics continue to change and influence investor sentiment and market positioning. Cardano has also been making headlines with its recent market performance. As of February 2, 2025, ADA is trading at around $0.3125 , a 3.84% increase over the last 24 hours. This surge in ADA's price action has sparked mixed reactions in the crypto community, especially as the broader market witnesses serious developments from projects like 1Fuel. Solana Price Shake-Up: Why Investors Are Watching 1Fuel This February Solana’s price action has been quite a thing of interest lately. SOL price took a hit recently, dipping 7.96% in the past 24 hours to around $193.45 . While some traders see this as a warning sign, savvy investors know better—market pullbacks often set the stage for massive comebacks. With February shaping up to be a big month for crypto, SOL’s next move is one to watch out for. What’s got traders on edge? A looming short squeeze could liquidate up to $220 million in short positions, forcing the SOL price to surge. If this plays out, Solana bulls could have the last laugh. Conclusion With SOL price showing volatility and Cardano news sparking fresh investor interest, now is the perfect time to get in on 1Fuel’s presale.

Fast-forward to today, its growth has slowed, and many question whether ADA can recreate its glory days. Meanwhile, Elluminex, a new DeFi platform launching on the TON blockchain, offers a bold vision for the crypto space with its advanced features. If you’re looking for the next big opportunity, this might be it. ADA Drops Over 60% Cardano is a third-generation proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform that emphasizes scalability, interoperability, and sustainability for decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. The platform has undergone several development phases, introducing new features to enhance its functionality and performance. In 2021, Cardano's native cryptocurrency, ADA, experienced significant price appreciation, reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $3.09. However, the growth was not sustained, indicating reduced interest. As of press time, ADA is trading at $0.9648, a 68.7767% decrease from its ATH. Recent analyses suggest that ADA’s resistance at $1.09 prevents an upward breakout. Some speculators believe ADA could rally past $2 in the first quarter of 2025, provided it overcomes current resistance levels and attracts renewed interest. However, impatient holders are shifting focus to promising projects like Elluminex. Elluminex To Outperform Cardano Cardano has lagged due to its slower ecosystem development, but Elluminex delivers immediate, practical solutions for DeFi. It comprises a decentralized exchange (DEX), staking, farming, cross-chain bridging, and early token launch access—all designed to create value from day one. While Cardano focuses on building its ecosystem, Elluminex bridges the gap between over 40 blockchain networks. This cross-chain interoperability enables seamless liquidity flow and asset transfers, giving it a significant edge in attracting users from established networks like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Solana. Additionally, Elluminex is introducing advanced tools like an AI-powered portfolio tracker to simplify the DeFi experience. The goal is to make trading, staking, and portfolio management more intuitive for novice and experienced users. The ELX token is central to the platform, providing rewards for staking, liquidity, and ecosystem participation. As Elluminex gains traction, early adopters of the token will benefit from price appreciation, rewards, and exclusive access to new projects launched on TON. Elluminex currently offers a presale for ELX tokens, allowing traders to buy in at a discounted price before it launches on exchanges. This is an opportunity to secure an early position in a token with high potential.

However, as we look at the present, its momentum has slowed considerably, leaving many to wonder if ADA can ever return to its former peak. Meanwhile, Elluminex is entering the scene as a fresh DeFi platform on the TON blockchain, bringing a daring new approach with its cutting-edge features. For those seeking the next major opportunity, this could be a prime candidate. ADA Experiences Over 60% Decline Cardano is recognized as a third-generation proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform, with a focus on scalability, interoperability, and sustainability for decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Through several stages of development, the platform has introduced multiple features to boost its capabilities and performance. Back in 2021, Cardano's native coin, ADA, saw a remarkable increase in value, peaking at an all-time high (ATH) of $3.09. However, this rapid growth was not maintained, signaling waning interest. Currently, ADA is valued at $0.9648, reflecting a 68.7767% drop from its ATH. Recent studies indicate that the $1.09 resistance level is preventing ADA from breaking upward. Some analysts speculate that ADA might surpass $2 in the first quarter of 2025 if it manages to overcome current resistance barriers and regain investor interest. Nonetheless, impatient investors are turning their attention to innovative projects like Elluminex. Why Elluminex Might Surpass Cardano Cardano has fallen behind due to its slower ecosystem development, whereas Elluminex provides immediate, tangible solutions for DeFi. It includes a decentralized exchange (DEX), staking, farming, cross-chain bridging, and early access to token launches—all aimed at generating value right from the start. While Cardano is still building its ecosystem, Elluminex connects more than 40 blockchain networks. This cross-chain interoperability allows for smooth liquidity movement and asset transfers, making it appealing to users from established networks like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Solana. Moreover, Elluminex is rolling out advanced features like an AI-driven portfolio tracker to simplify the DeFi experience. The aim is to make trading, staking, and portfolio management easier for both beginners and seasoned users. The ELX token plays a critical role in the platform, offering rewards for staking, liquidity provision, and ecosystem involvement. As Elluminex gains momentum, early ELX token adopters stand to benefit from price increases, rewards, and exclusive access to new projects launching on TON. Elluminex is currently holding a presale for ELX tokens, giving traders an opportunity to purchase them at a reduced price before they hit the exchanges.

Per Energy Kyungjae , the city – in Gyeonggi Province – will launch “its own electronic virtual asset seizing system.” South Korean City to Strike Out on Its Own in Hunt for Tax Dodgers’ Crypto Crypto trading is not yet subject to taxation in South Korea. However, Seoul has given local tax bodies the right to seize crypto belonging to “habitual” or “large-scale” residents who fail to pay local levies. The South Korean city of Gwacheon. (Source: NordNordWest [edited][CC BY-SA 3.0 DE]) Until recently, Gwacheon used IT solutions operated by the wider Gyeonggi Province to identify crypto wallets belonging to tax delinquents living in the city. Tax officers used the solution to scan domestic crypto exchange wallet data. When they identified wallets belonging to Gwacheon-resident tax offenders, they could then seize coins. In some cases, residents have then followed up by settling their outstanding tax bills. In others, the province has liquidated the coins. It has then handed fiat over to the city. But Gwacheon’s move to launch its own IT solution, independent of Gyeonggi Province’s own solution, suggests smaller cities and counties could look to expand the reach of their tax evasion crackdowns. The city has a population of 85,397, per the Korea Ministry of the Interior and Safety’s 2024 statistics. South Korea's digital media landscape has expanded at a breakneck pace, but the surge in numbers masks deep structural problems, recent government data shows. https://t.co/oXai3RgUDg — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) February 3, 2025 Gwacheon Targets 361 ‘Tax Evaders’ Gwacheon said its solution would go online next month. Officials said that it would follow up with “full-scale collection procedures starting in the first half of 2025.” These have already yielded significant results. In the past five years, Gwacheon says it has seized crypto worth approximately 300 million won (just under $205,000) from tax dodgers. South Korea’s Acting President Choi Sang-mok met with local exporters and vowed support for them following Donald Trump’s announcement of tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico. https://t.co/KpR7kmkIO5 — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) February 3, 2025 Gwacheon tax officials confiscated over a third of this amount in 2024, a further sign that the city is becoming more efficient in its crypto-collection measures. The city said that it was responding to a sharp rise in crypto-related activity in Gwacheon and beyond. As such, it said, the city has noticed an increase in “cases of virtual assets being used as a means of hiding delinquents’ assets.” Gwacheon says it will focus on searching for crypto wallets belonging to “361 residents who have failed to pay more than 3 million won [just over $2,000] in local taxes.” The city said the group owes Gwacheon over $12.8 million worth of taxes. “We will ensure the tax system is fair by taking strong responses to tax delinquents. We will actively block tax evasion by seizing virtual assets.” Gwacheon Tax Division Head Kang Min-ah South Korean city authorities in places like Goyang have also begun using similar solutions to seize crypto belonging to residents with outstanding traffic fines .

Solana (SOL) has been making waves with some impressive price movements, surging by almost 50% of its value in mid January. Meanwhile, a newcomer has been racking up attention in the PayFi space as it promises to address issues in the global payments sector. This project goes by the name Remittix (RTX) , and has amassed more than $10 million in just a few weeks of presale. So why is Remittix seeing so much attention, and will Solana see more price surges this year? Solana (SOL) Prepares For Hyperledger Solang Project Solana (SOL) is trading at $228 after a 8% dip in the last week. However, Solana’s immense surge in mid January means that its net gain still stands at 20% for the month. On the horizon for Solana is the Hyperledger Solang project that has opened Solana up to Ethereum's Solidity developers, providing a new way for them to build on the platform. Technical analysis is promising for Solana, suggesting that if buyers can push the price above $260, bullish momentum may resume, potentially targeting the $300 level and beyond. However, failure to maintain current support levels could lead to further declines before any potential upward movement. Remittix Creates New Possibilities in the PayFi Space Remittix (RTX) is catching fire as investors take notice of its bold entry into the cross-border payments space. The project aims to remove the inefficiencies that plague traditional financial systems, allowing users to swap over 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT and transfer money to any global bank account. Unlike banks and outdated payment providers that stack on hidden fees, Remittix keeps it simple with flat-rate pricing, ensuring that recipients get exactly what was sent. The Remittix Pay API is of great help to businesses, simplifying crypto transactions by letting companies accept digital payments while automatically settling in FIAT. This is a powerful capability for freelancers, e-commerce merchants and international enterprises that are looking to benefit from crypto without being affected by market volatility. Another feature that sets Remittix (RTX) apart is its privacy. Every transaction is processed as a standard bank transfer, meaning the recipient has no idea the payment originally started as crypto. This level of discretion is becoming increasingly rare in financial systems, making Remittix an attractive option for users who value control over their transactions. Remittix Dominates In Presale, Surpassing $10 Million Raised The $RTX token fuels the entire ecosystem, serving as the backbone for staking, governance and platform rewards. With a hard cap of 1.5 billion tokens, scarcity is built into its framework, making early accumulation potentially lucrative. Right now, $RTX tokens are priced at $0.521 in presale and over $10 million has already been raised. Crypto analysts are eyeing massive gains, predicting an 800% jump before the presale ends and another rally post-launch. As Remittix (RTX) gains traction in the $190 trillion cross-border payments industry, it’s shaping up to be one of the biggest crypto disruptors of 2025.

Solana (SOL) is making headlines with notable price increases, having jumped nearly 50% in value around mid-January. Meanwhile, a new player is gaining traction in the PayFi arena, aiming to tackle challenges in international payments. This project, known as Remittix (RTX) , has already gathered over $10 million in just a few weeks of its presale. So, what’s driving the buzz around Remittix, and could Solana experience further price hikes this year? Solana (SOL) Gears Up For the Hyperledger Solang Initiative Solana (SOL) is currently valued at $228 following an 8% decline over the past week. Despite this setback, the significant rise seen in mid-January keeps its monthly gain at 20%. Looking ahead, Solana is set to benefit from the Hyperledger Solang project, which has opened doors for Ethereum's Solidity developers to build on its platform, offering new opportunities. Technical indicators are optimistic for Solana, indicating that if the price is pushed above $260 by buyers, it could reignite a bullish trend, potentially aiming for the $300 mark and beyond. However, failing to sustain current support levels might lead to further drops before any upward recovery. Remittix Unlocks Fresh Opportunities in the PayFi Sector Remittix (RTX) is rapidly gaining ground as investors recognize its ambitious entry into the cross-border payments domain. The project seeks to eliminate inefficiencies plaguing traditional financial routes, enabling users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT and send funds to any global bank account. In contrast to banks and outdated payment services that impose hidden charges, Remittix offers straightforward flat-rate pricing, ensuring that recipients receive the exact amount sent. The Remittix Pay API is a valuable tool for businesses, streamlining crypto transactions by allowing firms to accept digital payments with automatic FIAT settlements. This feature is incredibly beneficial for freelancers, online retailers, and international companies looking to embrace crypto without being affected by market fluctuations. Another standout aspect of Remittix (RTX) is its focus on privacy. Each transaction is processed as a regular bank transfer, so the recipient is unaware that the payment originated in cryptocurrency. This level of confidentiality is increasingly rare in financial systems, making Remittix appealing to users who prioritize control over their transactions. Remittix Takes the Lead in Presale, Exceeding $10 Million in Funds Raised The $RTX token is central to the ecosystem, acting as the foundation for staking, governance, and platform incentives. With a limited supply of 1.5 billion tokens, built-in scarcity could make early acquisition profitable. Currently, $RTX tokens are available for $0.521 during the presale, with over $10 million already secured. Crypto experts are forecasting substantial gains, anticipating an 800% increase before the presale concludes and further growth after launch. As Remittix (RTX) gains momentum in the $190 trillion cross-border payments market, it’s emerging as a potential major disruptor in the crypto world by 2025.

While Dogecoin once led the industry, newer projects like Panshibi ($SHIBI) are gaining attention. This rising token blends Asian culture, memes and technology, proving Dogecoin (DOGE) is no longer the only major player and that meme coins are evolving beyond internet jokes. Panshibi: The Meme Coin Revolution Taking Over Panshibi is quickly emerging as the next big meme coin set to dominate the scene in 2025. Combining Asia’s massive crypto community with the universal appeal of pandas, Panshibioffers a unique twist on the traditional meme coin model. Unlike Dogecoin and other meme coins, Panshibi incorporates SocialFi and AI, providing holders with interactive quests, rewards and governance rights. The $SHIBI token powers this ecosystem, offering investors high-yield staking opportunities of up to 1,200% APY and exclusive perks for early adopters. The presale is priced at just $0.004, but this won’t last long. As demand grows, the price will rise to $0.005 and continue increasing with each new stage. For those seeking the top meme coins to invest in, Panshibi is a worthy option. The presale is capped at $10 million and lasts only 60 days. During this period, the price is set to increase by 1,200%, with post-launch projections predicting a staggering 145,000% rise. Early investors will also gain access to the exclusive Bamboo Private VIP Club, unlocking additional rewards and benefits. Security and transparency are top priorities for Panshibi. The project has passed a full smart contract audit with Coinsult, ensuring investor confidence. The liquidity pool will be locked for 10 years and team tokens will remain inaccessible for 2 years, ensuring long-term stability. With time running out, now is the moment to act. Don't miss your chance to join the presale and secure your place before prices surge. Dogecoin Faces Pressure As Market Dynamics Shift Dogecoin (DOGE), once a top contender in the meme coin space, is now feeling significant pressure as newer projects like Panshibi gain traction. The Dogecoin price is now trading at $0.276 , down by 21.6% over the last week and almost 27% on the monthly trends. Analysts project that this dip could continue into the new month if the bulls don’t gain control of the Dogecoin price, with prices potentially hitting $0.25 by the end of February. The Dogecoin market is currently on a predominately bearish course, as represented by the price reading of the Fear & Greed Index. Though benefitting from various high-profile endorsements, Dogecoin finds itself taken over in popularity by the likes of newer meme coins with a utility focus, such as Panshibi. The Future Of Meme Coins: Why Panshibi Stands Out As DOGE news today highlights, the meme coin market is shifting and Dogecoin faces increasing pressure. Since the Dogecoin price has dropped to $0.276, analysts predict further declines may happen. This trend, combined with bearish sentiment, suggests Dogecoin's dominance may be slipping. Investors are now looking at newer projects like Panshibi that provide more innovative features, leaving Dogecoin (DOGE) under pressure in a changing market. Panshibi is a project with a unique combination of SocialFi, AI technology and cultural relevance.

Last week Monday, the fallout from the DeepSeek AI model launch hit the crypto market hard, sending the flagship crypto, Bitcoin, below $100,000. However, it recovered above the $100,000 mark before the week ended. The story is similar this week as markets plunged to historic depths thanks to trepidation caused by President Donald Trump’s tariff threats. Even though Bitcoin dipped as low as $91,000, it has already reclaimed the $100,000 at the time of publication. Notably, one aspect of the market that has stayed immune to this volatility is the RWA sector. The merits of tokenization are just now coming to light, and it is still a severely undervalued sector in its infancy. It also stands to gain from the regulatory clarity that the Trump administration is expected to bring to crypto as various jurisdictions have even started developing frameworks. According to data from RWA.xyz , a site that provides analytics on tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) like stablecoins, tokenized US Treasuries, bonds, cash equivalents, and other commodities (like gold, silver, and oil), the sector has been growing steadily. The total value of tokenized real-world assets (RWA) on-chain is now $17.10 billion, which reflects a 10.02% increase over the past 30 days. Holders have increased to 82,978, with a total of 112 issuers. Over the same 30-day period, the premier crypto BTC only rose about 2% while ETH fell by over 20% while enduring wide volatility swings in between. Other altcoins have suffered even more, and investor confidence dips and surges with price. The global RWA market is up and to the right According to data from RWA.xyz, the market cap of stablecoins is currently at $213.86 billion, having experienced a 4.84% increase in the last month. Meanwhile the monthly transfer volume is $3.35 trillion, down almost 28% from 30 days ago, and the number of holders has surpassed 140M. The largest issuer remains Tether, with Circle in second place and Ethena in third. Leading tokenized assets include USDT at $138.50 billion, USDC at $52.20 billion, and USYC at $1.20 billion. RWA market overview. Source: RWA.xyz The institutional funds section of the data monitors tokenized alternatives such as hedge funds, venture capital, private equity, and private credit. It holds a total value of $410.49 million, up 11.52% from 30 days ago. There are currently 8,343 asset holders and 48 monthly active addresses participating in the tokenized institutional funds market. Private credit data focuses on the tokenization of private credit loans. According to data, active and total loan values are now at $11.81 billion and $21.49 billion, respectively, with a current average APR of 10.10%. The loans now total 2,414, with a bulk of them on the Provenance and Ethereum network. Tokenized commodities include digital assets pegged to commodities like gold, silver, and oil. It has a $1.14 billion market cap, with a monthly transfer volume of over $400 million. There are also 3,630 monthly active addresses and nearly 60,000 holders now. While precious metal products are already available, agricultural and oil & gas products are expected to be included soon. RWAs as a diversification strategy While Ethereum has underperformed in the bull run, the network holds the top spot in terms of RWA tokenization activities. It currently leads with 67 RWAs valued at $3.77 billion. ZKsync Era follows with 28 RWAs valued at $1.93 billion and Arbitrum follows with 20 assets and a $75.84 billion valuation. Other networks with RWAs include Polygon and Base, both with 19 assets each. Polygon has a $181.35 million valuation, while Base lags behind with a $51.54 million. Solana, currently one of the hottest networks because it is home to the top-performing memecoins, has not done so well with RWAs. It has only three, valued at $135.47 million. More investors are increasingly looking into RWAs as a way to diversify their portfolios and interact with tokenized versions of real-world assets. RWAs cover tangible assets like real estate, commodities, and infrastructure. These assets usually have different risk profiles relative to traditional financial assets. Some RWAs can help manage risk by reducing exposure to market volatility. They are also known to have low correlation with stocks and bonds, which makes them some sort of buffer against market downturns. Tokenized versions of commodities like gold can also be used as shields against inflation and currency devaluation. Many of them also generate regular income, such as rental income from real estate or dividends from infrastructure projects.

While Dogecoin once led the industry, newer projects like Panshibi ($SHIBI) are gaining attention. This rising token blends Asian culture, memes and technology, proving Dogecoin (DOGE) is no longer the only major player and that meme coins are evolving beyond internet jokes. Panshibi: Leading the Charge in the Meme Coin Revolution Panshibi is rapidly positioning itself as the meme coin to watch in 2025. By merging Asia's vast crypto audience with the charming appeal of pandas, Panshibi presents a novel spin on the conventional meme coin framework. Unlike Dogecoin and its counterparts, Panshibi integrates SocialFi and AI to offer holders interactive missions, rewards, and governance privileges. The $SHIBI token fuels this framework, delivering high-yield staking options up to 1,200% APY and special bonuses for early supporters. The presale is set at a price of $0.004, but this rate will rise as demand increases, going up to $0.005 and beyond with each presale stage. For those on the lookout for top meme coins for investment, Panshibi stands out as a strong contender. The presale is limited to $10 million and is open for just 60 days. During this time, the price is expected to surge by 1,200%, with post-launch estimates forecasting a jaw-dropping 145,000% increase. Early backers will also have the chance to join the exclusive Bamboo Private VIP Club, unlocking further rewards and incentives. Security and transparency remain core commitments for Panshibi.

The liquidity pool will be locked for a decade, and team tokens will be inaccessible for two years, supporting long-term security. Time is of the essence; seize the opportunity to join the presale before prices escalate. Dogecoin Feels the Strain as Market Dynamics Evolve Dogecoin (DOGE), once a leading figure in the meme coin realm, now faces intense competition from newcomers like Panshibi. The Dogecoin price currently stands at $0.276 , reflecting a 21.6% drop over the past week and a nearly 27% decline over the month. Experts suggest this downward trend might persist into the next month if the bulls fail to regain control over the Dogecoin price, potentially dipping to $0.25 by the end of February. Currently, the Dogecoin market is largely bearish, as indicated by the Fear & Greed Index. Despite benefiting from several high-profile endorsements, Dogecoin is now overshadowed by newer, utility-focused meme coins like Panshibi. The Future of Meme Coins: Panshibi's Unique Edge Today's DOGE news underscores a changing meme coin landscape, with Dogecoin experiencing mounting pressure. As the Dogecoin price slips to $0.276, analysts foresee further reductions. This pattern, combined with a bearish outlook, suggests Dogecoin's supremacy may be waning. Investors are turning to newer ventures like Panshibi that offer more advanced features, placing Dogecoin (DOGE) under strain in this evolving market.

Its rapid transaction capabilities and successful presale have experts predicting a potential 100x surge, making it a standout investment amid shifting market dynamics. Dogecoin (DOGE) Catches Whales’ Attention Amid ETF Buzz In the past week, crypto whales snapped up over 560 million DOGE , hinting at renewed confidence in its future. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted this trend, pointing to the steady accumulation as a sign that big players are eyeing potential gains. This shift follows a sharp sell-off, which makes the timing interesting. On-chain data reveals long-term holders quietly adding to their positions, suggesting that sentiment might be turning bullish. Historically, these accumulation patterns often appear before major price moves, so the market is watching closely. Even more exciting is a fresh filing for a spot Dogecoin ETF. The SEC has started reviewing the proposal under its 19b-4 process, with an initial decision expected within 45 days of its publication in the Federal Register. If needed, the review could stretch to 90 days. Should the SEC give the green light, Grayscale would join other major firms offering crypto-based ETFs alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. If a spot Dogecoin ETF is approved, it would be a huge milestone. It would push DOGE into the financial mainstream and reshape how investors view meme coins. As regulatory decisions unfold, DOGE holders will watch closely, eager to see how this chapter plays out. 1Fuel (OFT) Redefines the crypto trading experience 1Fuel (OFT) is starting to turn heads, for a good reason. Unlike most projects that stick to the same old formula, 1Fuel focuses on making crypto trading simple. No more juggling different wallets for every coin. Just one place to manage everything hassle-free. Security is a guaranteed feature, but 1Fuel goes beyond the basics. It offers disposable wallets, smart encryption layers, and a privacy mixer that keeps transactions under the radar. For anyone worried about safety, it’s like having a digital vault. What’s interesting is how it blends DeFi tools with AI. Predicting market shifts, automating trades, and flagging suspicious activity are handled effortlessly. This isn’t just another wallet; it’s a full-on crypto command center. The peer-to-peer setup means traders have no middlemen, which means lower fees and faster trades. Plus, there’s the cool factor of having crypto cards, both virtual and physical, that work like regular debit and credit cards. Add staking rewards up to 30% APR, and it is easy to understand why crypto communities are abuzz. At its core, 1Fuel isn't attempting to redefine crypto trading; it is making it smarter, quicker, and safer. 1Fuel Launches Presale with $1.7 Million Raised—Is This the Next 100x Crypto? 1Fuel’s (OFT) presale is gaining serious traction. Over 170 million tokens have been sold, raising more than $1.7 million. At just $0.017 per token, OFT offers an early entry point before its anticipated 100x surge post-launch. As 1Fuel gears up for its public debut, investors see this as a rare chance to secure massive gains. Ready to get in early?

Although miners play a critical role in the growth of Bitcoin, a lot of risk and operational expenses are involved. Purchasing mining hardware and acquiring land for facilities is expensive . Miners also struggle to maintain revenue due to the volatility of Bitcoin (BTC) . Hashrate Derivative Products Gain Interest Bitcoin miners today are therefore exploring new ways to ensure that their operations remain profitable. One of these ways is through the financialization of Bitcoin mining hashrate . For this week's Forwards Market update, both USD and BTC contracts are trading in backwardation. The hashrate forward market is pricing in an average hashprice of $55.25 (0.00054 BTC) over the next six months. pic.twitter.com/rVlYs5M7G2 — Luxor Technology (@luxor) February 3, 2025 Andy Fajar Handika, CEO of Loka Mining, told Cryptonews that “hashrate derivatives” allow Bitcoin miners to hedge against fluctuations in mining revenue by locking in a fixed price for their future hashrate. “This means that miners can secure predictable cash flows regardless of Bitcoin’s price volatility or changes in network difficulty,” Fajar Handika said. How Miners Can Sell Future Hashrate For example, Loka Protocol is a platform that enables Bitcoin miners to sell their future hashrate in the form of tokenized mining contracts. Fajar Handika explained that these contracts function similarly to commodity futures in traditional markets. “Just like corn farmers hedge against crop price fluctuations, Bitcoin miners can sell hashrate contracts upfront to secure capital while investors gain exposure to mining rewards without operating hardware,” he said. Source: Loka This concept reduces risk for both parties, while making mining financing more accessible. Ryan Condron, CEO of Titan.io, told Cryptonews that hashpower marketplace Lumerin offers a decentralized ecosystem for miners to sell off their hashpower for up to 7 days in the future. Bitcoin mining hashpower can then be traded by Lumerin users on-chain. Aaron Foster, director of business development at Luxor Technology, told Cryptonews that Luxor also offers a “Non-Deliverable Forward” (NDF) product that allows miners to take a position on hashprice. “This lets miners effectively lock in 1-12 month revenue certainty for their mining operations (this product is also available to non-miners as well),” Foster said. “Miners are naturally long Bitcoin (hashprice), so taking a position and locking in a price to create revenue certainty makes sense.” Foster believes that hashrate derivatives will likely extend the lifetime of mining operations by reducing exposure to short-term downturns. Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Derivatives Critical With Rising Bitcoin Price It’s also interesting to point out that as the price of Bitcoin rises, hashrate derivatives are becoming more important. Fajar Handika explained that as more miners enter the market, the Bitcoin network faces increasing difficulty . This makes it harder for existing miners to maintain profitability. “Hashrate derivatives provide upfront liquidity that allows Bitcoin miners to buy new hardware and expand operations,” he said. Financializing hashrate may also reduce the need for miners to sell off their BTC over time. “Instead of selling mined Bitcoin at lower prices to cover operational costs, miners can use forward hashrate contracts to secure capital without giving up their BTC holdings,” Fajar Handika remarked. Echoing this, Foster noted that miners who hedge their exposure to hashprice volatility as a percentage of their operational costs will lock in longer-term profit margins before a depressed hashprice market develops. “These instruments allow miners to hedge against hashprice volatility, making mining more predictable and financing easier,” he commented. Hashrate Derivative Products Gain Traction While hashrate derivatives have been a known concept for a few years, industry experts believe that this is finally catching on for both Bitcoin miners and institutions. Speaking about the topic at The North American Blockchain Summit (NABS) in November last year, Condron stated, “This is very much the next stage in this market for evolution and maturity. The financialization of hashpower needs to be treated more as a commodity than a hobby.” Foster – who was also on the derivatives panel at NABS – further remarked that institutions want to buy hashrate to get exposure to this asset class. He explained that this is why Luxor created its NDF product. “We created that product to service the institutional side to allow them access to the product without having to go through the hurdles of setting up on the physical side,” he said. Luxor’s end of year summary report for 2024 notes that its hashrate derivative product witnessed exponential growth. The report states that last year Luxor’s hashrate derivatives were used by public and private miners, prop trading funds, financiers, market makers, hosting providers, hashrate marketplaces, and ASIC brokers. “On the business side, we onboarded 30 new clients into our markets and traded $65 million in notional USD, settling about 1.2EH per day on average,” the report states. Source: Luxor It’s further documented that interest from miners and traditional finance communities reached a record high at the end of 2024. As a result, Luxor has continued to expand its product offering by increasing its tenures to 12 months in duration. The company also recently launched hashrate exchange-traded futures. Additionally, last week Grayscale announced the launch of a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering exposure to Bitcoin mining . Known as “Grayscale Bitcoin Miners ETF” (MNRS), the fund specifically invests in companies that comprise the Indxx Bitcoin Miners Index. This is a proprietary index designed to measure the performance of global Bitcoin mining companies that generate the majority of their revenue from Bitcoin mining or mining-related hardware, software, services, and projects. Key Hurdles for Miners and Institutions While hashrate derivatives are becoming more popular, challenges may prevent some miners and institutions from using these products. Fajar Handika pointed out that this is likely due to a lack of education around these offerings. “Many miners are unfamiliar with these products and may hesitate to use them,” he said. Liquidity concerns also remain, as Fajar Handika noted that investors must be willing to buy hashrate contracts, but if demand is low, pricing may not be favorable for miners. Moreover, decentralized derivative solutions – like the product offering from Loka Protocol – are subject to smart contract risks. Yet while challenges remain, Condron believes that all miners will eventually start to sell their hashpower. “This may be to a global hashpower ‘grid’ or mining pool. Countries, banks, and large corporations will bid against each other to buy up the hashpower in order to mine blocks and process transactions on the BTC network,” he said. Condron added that while hashrate derivatives may be a “less sexy” part of the ecosystem, miners need to start hedging strategies to generate predictable revenue regardless of market volatility. “This will help stabilize the entire ecosystem as Bitcoin continues to become part of the world’s core economic architecture,” he said.

Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is the latest buzz in the crypto world, offering incredible opportunities for early investors. As meme coins continue to make waves, APC has been steadily building momentum, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts eager to discover the next big thing. With the presale underway, investors are rushing to get a piece of the action as the project’s unique features start to shine. Meanwhile, the crypto sphere is abuzz with new developments surrounding ANDY and Osaka Protocol. ANDY is forging new partnerships that could boost its presence in the space, while Osaka Protocol is steadily advancing towards its next milestones. But today, we’re diving deeper into the exciting world of Arctic Pablo Coin. This article will cover the developments and updates of all 3 coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, ANDY, and Osaka Protocol. Arctic Pablo Coin: Token Burns That Drive Value One of the standout features of Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is its innovative token burn mechanism, which is designed to enhance scarcity and value. Every week during the presale, unsold tokens are permanently burned, reducing supply and driving demand. This continuous burn process ensures that APC maintains a deflationary environment, which means that every token in circulation is worth more. Token burns help secure long-term sustainability and make APC a promising asset for those looking to maximize their investments. By reducing the supply, Arctic Pablo Coin creates a sense of rarity, which is a key ingredient for driving up value. This burn mechanism is fully recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC ), ensuring transparency and trust. As more tokens are burned, the value of each remaining token increases, which is an attractive proposition for early investors. With the added benefit of weekly burns, the scarcity of Arctic Pablo Coin will only grow, making it one of the top cryptos to join for short term value. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: Get in Before It’s Too Late Arctic Pablo Coin has reached a critical phase in its journey, having just completed the 8th stage, called Shangri-La. In less than six days, the project finished exploring all seven locations, faster than expected, and now it’s preparing for the next leg of its journey. Right now, 1 APC is priced at an unbelievably low $0.000047, with an impressive ROI of 16,936% from the 8th stage to the listing price of $0.008. Over $870,000 has already been raised, fueling excitement around this presale. As Arctic Pablo Coin continues to “travel” and enter new locations, prices are set to rise, so this is a unique opportunity to invest at a low entry price. With the presale divided into locations, Arctic Pablo Coin offers an unconventional and exciting way for investors to get involved. As the coin progresses through each new location, the price will naturally increase, making this an opportunity you don’t want to miss. The presale’s current stage—Shangri-La—is already showing massive potential, with the price set to increase soon. So, if you’re considering entering the market, now is the time to act. Don’t wait until the price rises further—join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale and get in on one of the top cryptos to join for short term growth. Latest News on ANDY: New Partnerships and Growing Influence ANDY is continuing to expand its footprint in the cryptocurrency world. Recently, the project announced a series of strategic partnerships that are set to boost its ecosystem. These alliances will introduce new use cases and increase the utility of ANDY tokens, drawing attention from both investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. As the partnerships roll out, ANDY is poised to tap into new markets, increasing its adoption and driving future growth. The momentum surrounding ANDY is undeniable, with positive sentiment building around the project’s future prospects. As more businesses and platforms integrate ANDY, its value could see significant growth, making it one of the top cryptos to join for short term investments. Keep an eye on ANDY as its influence continues to grow, and its collaborations begin to take shape. Osaka Protocol: Key Updates and Upcoming Milestones Osaka Protocol is also showing signs of significant development. The project has recently announced updates to its underlying infrastructure, enhancing its scalability and security features. These improvements are designed to make Osaka Protocol even more robust, enabling it to handle a higher volume of transactions and attracting greater attention from developers and investors. The protocol’s technical advancements position it as a strong contender in the crypto space. As Osaka Protocol moves forward, its development team remains committed to delivering cutting-edge solutions that could reshape the blockchain ecosystem. With strong technical foundations and a growing community, Osaka Protocol is poised to achieve its next milestone soon, making it another one of the top cryptos to join for short term growth. Conclusion: Why Arctic Pablo Coin is the Top Choice for Investors All three projects— Arctic Pablo Coin, ANDY, and Osaka Protocol—are showing promising potential, but Arctic Pablo Coin stands out with its innovative presale model, token burn mechanism, and increasing momentum. As APC continues to raise funds and its price steadily increases, investors have the chance to enter at a very low entry point. With over $870,000 already raised and an ROI of 16,936% expected, Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be one of the top cryptos to join for short term growth.

New Wallet Exchange Launch Looks To Skyrocket,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/what-has-solana-just-paired-up-with-htx-trying-to-new-wallet-exchange-launch-looks-to-skyrocket,"Solana saw an explosive rally to an ATH owing to the $TRUMP token, only to experience a sharp decline after the initial hype faded. Meanwhile, HTX is making big moves with AI-powered trading and global expansion plans. But amidst the noise, one project is quietly stealing the spotlight, 1Fuel (OFT) . Unlike hype-driven tokens, 1Fuel is building a solid foundation with innovative cross-chain technology, and real-world utility. Investors looking for a long-term winner are turning to 1Fuel, which has already raised over $1.7M in its presale. Let's learn more about it! Is Solana still a buy? Price surges, airdrops, and market volatility Solana (SOL) saw some significant shifts in January 2025, most notably the introduction of the $TRUMP coin on its network. This token, which had a 200 million coin initial supply at the time of President Trump's inauguration, swiftly grew to a market value of $13.5 billion, driving Solana's price to an all-time high of $294. But after President Trump failed to discuss cryptocurrency issues on his first day in office, the token's value fell. In January 2025, the Solana environment also got ready for significant airdrops. Jupiter, a decentralized exchange aggregator on Solana, declared that 700 million JUP tokens, worth $625 million, will be distributed to about 2.3 million wallet addresses as part of its ""JUPuary"" airdrop. HTX’s bold 2025 plans: What’s ahead? Formerly known as Huobi Global, HTX has set ambitious goals for 2025. During a recent livestream called ""Hello 2025,"" the exchange revealed that it plans to expand internationally, with a focus on the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Furthermore, HTX wants to incorporate AI into its cryptocurrency services by creating smart contract apps and AI-powered tools that improve user experience. Through the HTX DAO forum and governance committees, the platform also aims to improve community governance by promoting increased user involvement in decision-making. 1Fuel’s presale boom: The next big crypto wallet? The crypto market keeps moving with innovations every day, however, only a few remain to rule the world. One such project is, 1Fuel (OFT) which is here to rule due to its solid fundamentals, revolutionary offerings, and massive profits potential. It is currently in its presale stage and has already raised more than $1.5 million. The presale has advanced to stage three, with each OFT token priced at $0.017, and over half of the token supply for this round has been sold. Global traders and investors are starting to notice its innovative strategy for transforming cryptocurrency wallets. This cryptocurrency wallet's one-click cross-chain transaction is among its most important features. It allows its users to transact effortlessly across several networks without having to pay high network fees or create separate wallets, since 1Fuel handles everything, making the entire experience faster and easier. Another feature that distinguishes 1Fuel (OFT) from rivals like MetaMask and Ledger is disposable wallets. These wallets are intended to be used just once and erased after each transaction, making it more difficult to monitor a user's activities, ensuring top-notch privacy for every user. Analysts predict over 100x returns with the project's formal listing, which has got investors from all crypto projects exploring this project as their next long-term investment. Final thoughts While the crypto market remains unpredictable, 1Fuel (OFT) is proving to be more than just another trending token. With its groundbreaking features, seamless cross-chain transactions, and privacy-focused disposable wallets, it’s setting a new standard for crypto wallets. As its presale skyrockets, early investors are positioning themselves for massive gains. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this game-changing movement, secure your 1Fuel tokens now.

According to reports , the fund is backed by Yun and a Toncoin miner, though the miner’s identity and contribution remain undisclosed to the public. A Major Investment to Fuel TON’s Growth The former President postulated that TVM Ventures is focused on advancing decentralized finance (DeFi) and payment finance (PayFi) projects within the TON network. “Regarding DeFi, it will be imperative to build natively on TON, including the smart contract logic written on TVM directly,” Yun said. “PayFi is cross-chain by nature and therefore more flexible, but 100% must support the TON network.” This move follows a related move from Ian Wittkopp and Inal Kardan, two former TON Foundation members, who have unveiled a venture capital firm, TON Ventures . Investing in Early-Stage Startups Based on reports, TVM Ventures targets early-stage startups. It will invest between $500,000 and $1 million in companies valued between $5 million and $10 million. Furthermore, the firm will provide an additional $5 million in liquidity to help projects establish a solid financial foundation. It is worth mentioning that TVM Ventures has already backed four TON-based startups. These include Factorial, a modular lending platform similar to Morpho; Torch Finance, which specializes in stablecoin swaps; Fiva, a platform focused on tokenized yield like Pendle; and Memes Lab, a memepad that enables users to purchase memecoins using Telegram Stars, according to Yun. What Lies Ahead for TON and TVM Ventures According to Yun, the TON ecosystem is expected to experience tremendous growth by mid-2025. With the introduction of the tgBTC bridge and a new DeFi incentive program from the TON Foundation, he predicts an increase in adoption. Furthermore, he expects TON to capture a tremendous share of the stablecoin market over the next few years. Yun believes that the TON Foundation will become more independent in the next three to five years, forming high-impact partnerships to strengthen its ecosystem. He also sees the organization making “high-impact deals” to accelerate its growth. Yun predicted that Toncoin, valued at around $4 with a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion, could surpass $40 in the next bull cycle, representing a 900% increase. Even though Yun resigned as president of the TON Foundation last month, these recent events make it vehemently apparent that he has a clear and ambitious vision for TVM Ventures He stated, “Our focus is to build an advanced and comprehensive financial system capable of meeting the financial needs of 500 million users in the next few years.” On the other hand, inflation has caused Toncoin’s price to drop to $4.80 , marking a notable 33% decline from its highest value last November. This downturn coincides with a rise in exchange inflows, as over 240,000 TON tokens have been moved to exchanges in the past week.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $1,142. In 2031, AAVE will range between $3,073 to $3,778. Aave is a leading decentralized finance ( DeFi ) protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn their interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, will AAVE reach new heights in 2025? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $279 Market cap $4,174,111,006.49 Trading volume (24-h) $1,421,224,426.19 Circulating supply 15,057,562.92 AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $202.42 24-hour high $279.44 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.46% 50-day SMA $319.87 14-Day RSI 38.96 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 44 (Fear) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $191.86 Aave 1-day price analysis: AAVE to recover above $294? Key takeaways AAVE is up 9% in the last 24 hours. The coin is approaching its 0.382 Fibonacci level. A breakout above $294 could take the coin to $340.24. Aave 1-day price chart: AAVE is above its 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level The AAVE 1-day price chart for February 3 shows an emerging bull market. The coin rebounded above $202 and is now closing in on the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $294.16, which is acting as resistance. AAVE’s next key support lies at the 61.8% level ($228.87). AAVE is above its 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level While the price candles suggest a bullish recovery, the MACD indicator shows otherwise, with the MACD line below the signal line. Overall, indicators show mixed signals for AAVE. A break above $294.16 is needed to confirm an uptrend. Failure to maintain support at $228 may lead to the coin testing lower levels around $188. Aave 4-hour price chart: AAVE sees mild buyer interest in the short-term The AAVE 4-hour price chart analysis corroborates the mild recovery observed on the daily chart. AAVE has rebounded from the lower Bollinger Band, confirming some short-term buying interest. In the meantime, resistance lies at $287.98 and support at $226.56. AAVE sees mild buyer interest in the short-term A sustained move above $287-$290 is needed to confirm a stronger reversal to the upside. The RSI is almost in the oversold territory, suggesting that significant buying pressure could be gathering at the bottom. Similarly, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicates more inflows than outflows, supporting the current uptrend. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $295.22 SELL SMA 5 $304.00 SELL SMA 10 $319.25 SELL SMA 21 $326.28 SELL SMA 50 $319.87 SELL SMA 100 $260.96 BUY SMA 200 $191.86 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $308.17 SELL EMA 5 $304.88 SELL EMA 10 $306.76 SELL EMA 21 $312.62 SELL EMA 50 $293.70 SELL EMA 100 $251.51 BUY EMA 200 $201.89 BUY What to expect from AAVE price analysis? Overall, a bullish signal exists for AAVE in the short term, but the bears still hold some control over the market. To fully break out, AAVE must overcome resistance at $294. The risk of further downside remains if the coin drops below $228. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. Its AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE? AAVE tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Aave is Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, offering a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, ByBit, OKX, Kraken and KuCoin also support AAVE. Why is AAVE down? Aave (AAVE) is currently experiencing a recovery due to renewed buyer interest, jumping from a low of $202 to above $280. AAVE price history Will Aave reach $500? Aave (AAVE) can potentially reach $500 if it breaks through the current resistance levels and gains momentum from positive market sentiment and trends. AAVE had previously reached an ATH of $666.86; attaining $500 should be an achievable feat in the near term if market conditions align. Does Aave have a good long-term future?

Should average users find RTX more affordable and simpler than large bank offerings, XRP may lose some power. Critics point out that Ripple still has strong ties and a well-known brand, thus competing is not easy. Remittix (RTX), however, may attract those who aren't particularly crypto-savvy because of its capacity to daily handle wire fees. Should true adoption increase, this pragmatic aspect might be revolutionary, testing the ""XRP 2.0"" name. If the platform moves fast and finds credible alliances, some analysts estimate it might see 10x increase. Others, on the other hand, have a wary view since new tokens usually generate large gains but fail if the actual value does not show. Still, Remittix (RTX) emphasizes practical financial solutions, hence its supporters believe the token would distinguish it from other altcoins driven just by excitement. Whether or not Remittix (RTX) earns the ""2.0,"" the excitement around it hints at a crypto space honoring pragmatic solutions. By the end of the year, this new crypto Remittix might be a big competitor if it continues to create actual momentum. Here Is Why Remittix Is Dubbed The Next XRP Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by integrating blockchain technology with fiat transactions, offering fast and cost-efficient cross-border solutions. With support for over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, the platform provides instant conversions into fiat currencies like USD and GBP, enabling seamless deposits into recipients' bank accounts. As a bridge between crypto and fiat, Remittix is the superior counterpart to traditional payment providers such as Stripe and Wise and crypto-exclusive platforms like Coinbase Wallet. Supporting 30+ fiat currencies and over 50 crypto pairs, Remittix ensures accessibility and inclusivity for businesses and individuals, simplifying global commerce with its extensive range of options. Furthermore notable is the platform's open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over exorbitant costs and inadequate exchange rates of conventional banks. This approach guarantees that the full amount sent reaches the recipient, making Remittix a game-changer in the payments industry, where shady practices are unfortunately all too common. Currently priced at $0.0521 during its presale, the RTX token offers a compelling investment opportunity. Forecasts predict significant growth with a 25x multiplier expected in the presale phase and over 1,500% gains after launch, as demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions continues to rise. Beyond their common emphasis on cross-border payments, XRP and Remittix's ability to upend established financial institutions and provide actual answers calls for comparison. While Remittix is going one step further with its inclusive approach and excellent technology, XRP has shown the value of blockchain in worldwide banking. Remittix offers investors a chance to interact with a project with the potential same as XRP but at an earlier stage as the bitcoin market develops. RTX might not only equal XRP's success but also alter the benchmarks for blockchain-based financial solutions with increasing acceptance, a solid basis and evident market demand.

It enhances international payments by offering faster and more cost-effective transactions. Experts have lately identified a new token called Remittix, which they've described as the “Next XRP.” Remittix is notable for its cutting-edge PayFi system and considerable potential. Continue reading to discover more about the RTX token and why it's considered one of the top cryptocurrency investments at the moment. Price Speculation: Could Remittix Compete with Ripple? While Ripple collaborates with major corporations, supporters of Remittix (RTX) argue that their token could stand out by appealing to everyday users. If the general public finds RTX more accessible and cost-effective compared to the solutions offered by big banks, XRP might face some challenges. However, critics emphasize that despite these possibilities, Ripple's strong connections and established reputation make competition challenging. Remittix (RTX) might attract individuals who are not very familiar with crypto due to its ability to handle daily wire fees. Increased real-world usage could make this practical feature transformative, putting the ""XRP 2.0"" label to the test. If the platform gains momentum and forms trustworthy partnerships, some analysts predict it could experience a tenfold growth. Conversely, some remain cautious, noting that new tokens often promise substantial returns but may falter if they don't deliver real value. Nonetheless, Remittix (RTX) focuses on tangible financial solutions, and its advocates believe the token will set itself apart from other cryptocurrencies fueled merely by hype. Whether or not Remittix (RTX) earns the ""2.0"" title, the buzz around it suggests a crypto market appreciating practical solutions. By the year's end, if it continues to gain true momentum, Remittix could emerge as a significant contender in the crypto world. Why Remittix Is Being Called The Next XRP Remittix (RTX) is transforming international payments by merging blockchain technology with fiat transactions, delivering swift and economical cross-border services. The platform supports over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, facilitating instant conversions into fiat currencies like USD and GBP, and allowing seamless deposits into recipients' bank accounts. Acting as a bridge between the crypto and fiat worlds, Remittix surpasses traditional payment services like Stripe and Wise, as well as crypto-only platforms like Coinbase Wallet. With support for more than 30 fiat currencies and over 50 crypto pairs, Remittix ensures accessibility and inclusivity for both businesses and individuals, making international trade simpler with a wide array of choices. Additionally, the platform's transparent flat-fee model offers cost savings and clarity compared to the high fees and poor exchange rates of traditional banks. This model guarantees that the full amount sent reaches the recipient, positioning Remittix as a groundbreaking player in the payments industry, notorious for its murky practices. Currently available for $0.0521 during its presale, the RTX token presents an attractive investment opportunity. Projections indicate substantial growth, with a 25x increase expected in the presale phase and over 1,500% gains anticipated post-launch, as the demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions continues to escalate. Besides their common focus on international payments, XRP and Remittix's potential to challenge established financial systems and deliver practical solutions invites comparison. While XRP has demonstrated the usefulness of blockchain technology in global banking, Remittix is advancing further with its inclusive approach and superior technology. For investors, Remittix offers a chance to engage with a project that possesses potential akin to XRP but at an earlier stage as the cryptocurrency market evolves. With growing acceptance, strong foundations, and evident market interest, RTX could not only match XRP's achievements but also redefine standards for blockchain-driven financial solutions.

Many people are curious whether Dogecoin’s price will reach $1. The coin’s price now sits around $0.3276 with a market cap of $48.41 billion. Renewed whale activity has fueled optimism, and some analysts foresee DOGE hitting $1 sometime in 2025. Yet interestingly, many are also talking about Remittix (RTX) , an under-five-cents altcoin that’s on the rise. If real-world utility wins out, some suspect Remittix (RTX) might actually outperform Dogecoin in the long run. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) Path to $1 The big question: can Dogecoin break the $1 mark in the next few years? Meme-driven hype, celebrity tweets, and robust community support have helped push DOGE to new peaks before. Current whale movements suggest institutions may be dabbling, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Still, critics note that Dogecoin relies heavily on comedic or viral momentum. If the market shifts toward utility-based tokens, the coin could see slower growth. Meanwhile, a newcomer Remittix (RTX) is capturing attention with a more practical approach. Observers say if folks want cheaper cross-border transactions, RTX might overshadow purely hype-driven coins. That dynamic leads many to ask again, “How Long Till The Dogecoin Price Reaches $1? Why Is This Altcoin Priced Below 5 Cents Tipped To Beat It?” PayFi Star Remittix on the Rise While memes help Dogecoin go viral, Remittix (RTX) aims for daily finance use. Already, Remittix (RTX) has raised $10,071,202.38 and sold 424,894,549.52 tokens at $0.0521. With a target price of $0.0539 next, some fans see RTX as the big up-and-comer. The coin sets out to tackle high wire fees, bridging fiat and crypto so families and freelancers can save money. In a market often swayed by jokes, that real-world angle could push Remittix (RTX) to the spotlight. If mainstream crowds catch on, watchers say it might surpass meme-based tokens. By focusing on bridging normal finance, RTX might sustain growth beyond short-term hype. Why This Altcoin Priced Below 5 Cents Tipped to Beat Dogecoin Despite Dogecoin boasting a massive user base, some experts believe an under-five-cent coin like Remittix (RTX) could deliver bigger returns. While DOGE soared through playful jokes and celebrity endorsements, the token’s next leap might hinge on fresh hype. Meanwhile, a PayFialtcoin such as Remittix (RTX) addresses the billion-dollar remittance market. That stable user demand might lead to steadier and potentially larger growth. If the broader market transitions to tokens offering practical cost savings, RTX could outpace many comedic coins. No one can say for sure if Dogecoin will fall behind, but if practicality wins, an under-five cents altcoin might shock everyone. Factors Behind DOGE’s Rally Donald Trump’s victory and Elon Musk’s new political advisory role have rekindled interest in Dogecoin. Over the past few months, the coin’s price more than doubled, bolstering hopes it might crack $1 by 2025. Analysts point to whale wallet expansions, meaning large players have scooped up DOGE recently. It’s a bullish sign that big holders foresee further climbs. Still, longevity is uncertain if the meme fades or the hype moves elsewhere. Enter Remittix (RTX) or RTX, where bridging day-to-day banking stands a better chance at locking in a broad user base. If mainstream folks adopt it, watchers think Remittix(RTX) might see 100x gains overshadowing meme coins. Conclusion: Who Will Win by 2025? So, how long will the Dogecoin price remain at $1? Why is this Altcoin priced below 5 cents and tipped to beat it? Some say Dogecoin could cross $1 by 2025 if hype, institutional interest, and celebrity backing stay consistent. Others see Remittix (RTX) forging a path to outdo DOGE, thanks to bridging crypto with everyday transactions. With $10,371,202.38 raised, RTX stands at $0.0521 but could hit $0.0539 soon. By tackling actual problems like wire fees Remittix (RTX) might draw a more stable, worldwide crowd. Whether DOGE or RTX claims the throne, each offers a unique route to massive growth. Yet if practical PayFi solutions resonate, the under-five-cents altcoin might be the real winner. Ready to explore Remittix further?

Currently priced at approximately $0.3276 with a market capitalization of $48.41 billion, the coin has seen renewed interest from large investors, fueling optimism. Some analysts predict DOGE could hit the $1 mark by 2025. However, what’s intriguing is the buzz around Remittix (RTX) , a rising altcoin priced under five cents. If real-world application triumphs, it’s speculated that Remittix (RTX) could potentially outshine Dogecoin in the long haul. The Road to $1 for Dogecoin (DOGE) The pressing question is whether Dogecoin can reach $1 in the coming years. Previously, the coin has reached new heights thanks to meme-based enthusiasm, celebrity endorsements, and a strong community. Recent activity from large investors suggests that institutions might be getting involved, bolstering a positive outlook. Yet, skeptics argue that Dogecoin's success largely depends on viral or comedic trends. If the market leans towards utility-focused tokens, its growth might slow.

Observers note that for those seeking cost-effective cross-border transactions, RTX could outshine coins driven solely by hype. This situation prompts the question once more, “When Will Dogecoin Hit $1?

While DOGE skyrocketed thanks to humorous memes and celebrity shout-outs, its future rise might depend on fresh waves of excitement. On the other hand, a PayFi coin such as Remittix (RTX) targets the multi-billion-dollar remittance industry. This steady user demand could translate into consistent and potentially larger growth. Should the broader market pivot towards tokens offering tangible savings, RTX might outpace many humor-based coins. Though it’s uncertain if Dogecoin will be left behind, if practicality prevails, a low-cost altcoin could surprise everyone. Elements Fueling DOGE’s Ascent Donald Trump’s triumph and Elon Musk’s new advisory position have rekindled interest in Dogecoin. Over recent months, the coin’s value has more than doubled, sparking hopes it might hit $1 by 2025.

Yet, its long-term success is uncertain if the meme loses steam or the hype shifts. This is where Remittix (RTX) or RTX comes in, as its focus on everyday banking could secure a wide user base. If the mainstream adopts it, analysts believe Remittix (RTX) could see 100x gains, overshadowing meme coins. Final Thoughts: Who Will Prevail by 2025?

The sudden market downturn led to a widespread sell-off, impacting traders who had leveraged positions across multiple exchanges. Leverage trading in cryptocurrency allows investors to borrow funds to increase their position size, amplifying both potential gains and losses. However, it also carries significant risks, especially in highly volatile markets. When prices move sharply in the wrong direction, traders who use leverage may see their positions forcibly closed, or “liquidated,” as exchanges move to protect borrowed funds. Bybit, one of the major cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, saw over $1 billion in liquidations, reflecting the severity of the market crash. The broader crypto market experienced a total of $10 billion in liquidations, with Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the losses. The sharp declines came as unexpected price swings wiped out traders who were overleveraged. “The scale of the liquidations shows just how fragile the market can be when leverage is involved,” noted a market analyst. High leverage levels can create a cascading effect, where initial sell-offs trigger further liquidations, leading to even greater price drops. The incident highlights the risks associated with crypto leverage trading, which has become increasingly popular among retail and institutional investors. Many exchanges offer leverage of up to 100x, meaning traders can open positions far larger than their initial investment. While this can result in significant profits when the market moves in their favor, it also exposes traders to extreme losses if prices move against them. A spokesperson for Bybit commented on the situation, stating that the platform had handled the high volatility efficiently. “Despite the unprecedented liquidations, our systems functioned smoothly, ensuring that risk management mechanisms were in place to protect traders and the broader market,” they said. The impact of the liquidations was felt across the crypto industry, with Bitcoin dropping sharply before partially recovering. Ethereum and other major altcoins also saw significant price swings, as traders scrambled to manage their positions amid the turmoil. Experts believe that the event underscores the need for caution when using leverage in crypto trading. “This kind of volatility is inherent in the crypto market, and leveraged traders need to be prepared for rapid price movements,” said a senior analyst at a trading firm. Despite the massive liquidations, some market participants see potential buying opportunities. Historically, large liquidation events have been followed by price rebounds as the market stabilizes. However, uncertainty remains, especially with ongoing regulatory discussions and macroeconomic factors influencing investor sentiment. The liquidation event serves as a reminder of the risks and rewards of leverage trading in crypto. While it can enhance profits, it can also lead to severe losses, particularly in a market known for its unpredictability. Traders are advised to use risk management strategies, such as stop-loss orders and lower leverage levels, to protect their investments from unexpected market swings.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-03 23:58:00

BNB’s integration within the Binance ecosystem has fueled demand, while Cardano’s research-driven approach has positioned it as a secure and scalable blockchain. However, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out by bridging blockchain with real-world e-commerce, offering a practical use case beyond trading and speculation. With a successful presale surpassing $1 million, Web3Bay’s 3BAY token is gaining traction, signaling increasing interest in decentralized, user-driven marketplaces that challenge traditional platforms. Web3Bay’s 3BAY Token Gains Traction After $1M Presale Web3Bay’s presale has hit $1 million, with 270 million 3BAY tokens sold at a current price of $0.004562625 in Stage 4. This rapid growth, therefore, highlights increasing confidence in blockchain-powered commerce and the demand for decentralized alternatives to traditional e-commerce platforms. As a result, investors are taking notice, not just because of the early-stage presale momentum, but also due to 3BAY’s core utility—facilitating transactions, offering discounts, and granting governance rights within Web3Bay’s marketplace. Consequently, as more users join, demand for the token could rise, potentially driving up its value. When comparing Web3Bay’s growth trajectory with other blockchain marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible, it becomes evident that decentralized platforms are gaining traction. However, unlike NFT-specific platforms, Web3Bay brings real-world e-commerce into the mix, expanding the scope of blockchain adoption. Furthermore, with each presale stage increasing the token price, early investors are positioning themselves for potential gains before 3BAY reaches public trading. If this trend continues, the token could see significant value appreciation post-launch, especially as more users transact on the platform. Beyond price speculation, Web3Bay’s success underscores a larger trend—Web3 commerce is no longer a niche concept. Given that $1 million has been raised in just a few weeks, it is clear that the demand for decentralized, user-driven marketplaces is accelerating. At this point, the question now isn’t whether Web3Bay can compete, but how far it can go in reshaping online commerce. BNB: From Exchange Token to a Leading Cryptocurrency Binance Coin (BNB) launched in 2017 as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum before migrating to Binance Chain. Initially, it offered trading fee discounts on Binance, but over time, its use expanded to payments, staking, and smart contracts. Since then, BNB’s price has grown significantly, from its ICO price of $0.10 to over $576.63 as of February 3, 2025. This marks a staggering increase of more than 576,530%. One key factor behind this growth is Binance’s success, coupled with BNB’s utility in transaction fees, DeFi, and token burns, which has sustained demand. As a result, BNB’s market capitalization has also climbed to over $88 billion. Moreover, the deflationary model, where Binance systematically burns tokens, has contributed to scarcity and long-term value appreciation. For this reason, early investors who participated in the ICO have seen some of the highest returns in cryptocurrency history. Meanwhile, Binance’s ecosystem continues expanding, reinforcing BNB’s dominance as a top-tier digital asset used across multiple blockchain applications and financial services. Cardano (ADA): A Research-Driven Blockchain with Strong Growth Cardano launched in 2017, founded by Charles Hoskinson, focusing on academic research and peer-reviewed blockchain development. At the time, its native cryptocurrency, ADA, was first sold through an ICO at approximately $0.025 per token. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano was built on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros, aiming to provide a scalable and secure platform for decentralized applications. Over the years, ADA has grown significantly, reaching approximately $0.71 as of February 3, 2025, marking an increase of over 2,740% from its ICO price. This growth has been driven by Cardano’s structured development phases—Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire—which have steadily introduced decentralization, smart contracts, and scalability improvements. Additionally, its adoption in DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise applications has bolstered network activity. As a result, with a market capitalization of around $25 billion, Cardano remains a key blockchain player. Therefore, early investors have seen strong returns, benefiting from its continued expansion and research-backed technological advancements aimed at improving blockchain efficiency and real-world use cases. Final Call The growth of blockchain-based assets highlights a shift toward more decentralized and utility-driven platforms. Binance Coin (BNB) has strengthened its position through exchange integration and token burns, while Cardano (ADA) has built a foundation on research-backed development. Yet, Web3Bay is setting itself apart by integrating blockchain into real-world commerce, creating practical applications beyond investment speculation. With over $1 million raised in its presale, the 3BAY token is gaining traction, reflecting growing confidence in decentralized marketplaces. As adoption increases, Web3Bay’s model could redefine how blockchain is applied to e-commerce, offering a compelling alternative to traditional online platforms.

39893542,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=667849,1738627750,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39893542.jpeg,2025 is a make or break year for Meta’s metaverse vision – CTO Andrew “Boz” Bosworth,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/2025-meta-metaverse-vision-andrew-bosworth/,"In an internal memo intended for Meta staff, the company’s CTO, Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, shared that 2025 will be a pivotal year for the company’s metaverse ambitions. Meta is one of the companies intending to put all hands on deck in an effort to leverage opportunities in 2025. The company’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, told employees during a meeting last week to buckle up for an intense year during a meeting about the company’s smart glasses. The company is working on several fronts to make the most of the year. Meta’s strategy for 2025 is pretty clear: from its mixed reality division to its AI glasses, every project is important and crucial to the upward trajectory of the business. The ‘year of greatness’ internal memo Company CTO, Andrew “Boz” Bosworth circulated a memo to the company’s staff. The memo was titled “2025; The Year of Greatness” and was shared on Meta’s Internal Forum Workplace. Business Insider first reported on the intercepted memo . In the memo, Bosworth emphasized the need to improve sales, retention and engagement across the board with special focus on mixed reality, a technology that blends the physical and digital worlds and creates experiences that go way beyond augmented or virtual reality. Bosworth mentioned that the success of Horizon Worlds on mobile platforms will be crucial to Meta’s long-term strategy. “This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure,” Bosworth said Although Bosworth didn’t specify what devices he was referring to in the memo, he said that the company’s Reality Labs division planned to launch half a dozen more AI-powered wearable devices. Meta’s Reality Labs under the microscope Meta acquired Oculus VR in 2014 and has since invested over $80 billion in virtual and augmented reality technologies. In 2024 alone, the company’s Reality Labs division, responsible for products like Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and Quest VR headsets, saw a record investment of $19.9 billion. Despite these substantial investments, Reality Labs reported a significant operating loss of $17.7 billion in 2024, bringing total losses to around $60 billion since 2020. Notably, revenue from Reality Labs increased to $2.1 billion in 2024. Last week, the Reality Labs unit reported a record $1.08 billion in revenue in its fourth-quarter earnings. In an effort to maximize efficiency, Meta is restructuring its Reality Labs division. In the memo, Bosworth referenced Steven Levy’s book “Insanely Great,” which details how the Macintosh computer was created by small teams of one to three people, and added that he had seen smaller teams within Meta achieve better results than the company’s “more generously funded teams.” Perhaps going off this observation, Bosworth announced last week that the unit previously run by Reality Labs’ chief operating officer, Dan Reed, will now be run by company COO, Javier Olivan. The company also reshuffled the reporting lines of other Reality Labs executives, who now report to other key figures in Meta’s core business.

The crypto detective in a “thread” on X detailed how many users have become victims of social engineering attacks on Coinbase. ZachXBT stated that users have lost over $300 million from these socially engineered exploits. How the Crypto Scam Works ZachXBT’s investigations revealed that the scammers employ spoof calls and impersonation of the crypto exchange support team. They also sent phishing emails to lure users into compromising their accounts, as in the Ledger incident in December 2024. They also use leaked personal data to gain users’ trust. To sound convincing, the fraudsters have faked Coinbase’s website and emails, which are difficult to tell apart to the casual observer. The malicious actors then get the potential victims to “verify” their accounts through their private keys . This required the would-be victim to transfer funds to a Coinbase Wallet or whitelisting address. While impersonating the Coinbase support team, they compromise the victim’s security and steal their funds. ZachXBT says the scammers operate from India and primarily target users in the U.S. Surprisingly, between December 2024 and January 2025 alone, Coinbase users lost a minimum of $65 million to theft. This amount does not factor in Coinbase support tickets and police report that ZachXBT could not access. ZachXBT claims that Coinbase has made it difficult to track the theft addresses by failing to report them using compliance tools. Did Coinbase Fail to Wade Off Crypto Scams? The crypto sleuth argues that Coinbase’s risk models have failed to prevent these scams, causing users to lose $300 million. He maintained that these attacks succeeded because of the aggressive risk models that Coinbase adopted to tackle them. Generally, users have suddenly accused Coinbase of restricting their accounts. It appears the malicious actors are exploiting this to scam users. A development ZachXBT has decried as the aggressive risk model has failed to prevent the massive annual loss of funds due to Crypto scams. ZachXBT also highlighted how a Coinbase employee cautioned users via an X post to stop using VPNs so the exchange does not flag them as suspicious. Meanwhile, the crypto detective noted that threat actors block VPNs from phishing sites. According to the investigation, this discrepancy suggests that Coinbase has failed to identify the security issues correctly. He attributes this as the major reason the scammers have succeeded in robbing users of their valuable funds. Coinbase CEO Promises Enhanced Infrastructure In a separate update, Brian Armstrong, the exchange’s CEO, promised a comprehensive overhaul of its system. While more linked to Solana transaction congestion than crypto scam events, the exchange has identified a unique need to upgrade its systems. The trading platform suffered delays in processing Solana transactions in January following the launch of TRUMP and MELANIA. With the event, Brian Amstrong promised a Solana tier-1 infrastructure .

The analyst pinpointed Ethereum (ETH) in his price chart, emphasizing that the second-largest cryptocurrency is set to decline further, in line with his earlier predictions. Step 2: Crypto Market Sells Off As ETH Goes Home Ethereum is currently experiencing widespread market sell-offs as investors react to its bearish price action and tightening liquidity conditions. Failing to meet investors’ expectations, the price of Ethereum has struggled to maintain strong momentum in this bull market. Related Reading: Crypto Market Remains Greedy Despite Bitcoin Price Crash To $94,000, Is A Recovery Coming? Cowen’s chart analysis suggests that the current downtrend aligns with the broader market cycle, where Bitcoin’s dominance rises above 60%, leading to capital flows from altcoins like Ethereum. The analyst announced that the crypto market is currently in the second phase of his guide for 2025’s market trajectory. In a previous X post on January 29, Cowen outlined a structured six-step roadmap for his 2025 market cycle theory. The first step highlights an increase in Bitcoin’s dominance to over 60%. This occurs when investors leave altcoins and move into Bitcoin, seeking stability amidst the volatility and uncertainty of the crypto market. During this time, Ethereum and most altcoins underperform due to the lack of interest and demand from investors. Now, in Step 2 of Cowen’s 2025 guide, the crypto market has entered a correction phase, with Ethereum declining sharply. Cowen claims that ETH will eventually “go home,” meaning the cryptocurrency will undergo a severe decline to long-term key support levels. In this second phase, the broader market also experiences a sell-off as investors take profit amidst volatility and ongoing declines in cryptocurrencies. Despite rising to $3,000 earlier in this bull market, Ethereum has failed to maintain positive momentum, recording steep declines as its price struggles to find stable support. According to data from CoinMarketCap, ETH is currently trading at $2,594, reflecting a massive 16.4% price crash in the last 24 hours. Over the past weeks, Ethereum has performed poorly, experiencing a sharp decline to new lows while other cryptocurrencies have gained momentum. The altcoin’s price has plunged to new lows, dropping by more than 27.6% in just a month. This downturn has also significantly impacted its market capitalization, which has fallen to $312.6 billion. Cowen’s 2025 Market Guide: What’s Next? In Step 3 of his market cycle theory for 2025, Cowen predicts that the Federal Reserve (FED) will shift its policy and end quantitative tightening, which has been draining liquidity from the financial markets. This decision is critical, as easing monetary conditions would pave the way for the analyst’s fourth step — a bullish phase fueled by market rallies. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH Faces ‘Moment Of Truth’ After Crash Toward $3,000 In the fifth step, Cowen predicts that macroeconomic conditions will deteriorate later in the year. This could include factors like inflation, interest rate, geopolitical stability, and others. The final step in his 2025 market cycle guide forecasts a full-blown recession. Cowen projects that this recession would lead to a bear market, aligning with historical midterm election year cycles, where markets tend to face deeper corrections.

A standout feature of BTFD Coin is its high-yield staking mechanism, which offers a staggering 90% APY. For many, this is the magic number that makes BTFD one of the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now. With such a high annual percentage yield, token holders can enjoy substantial passive rewards simply by staking their tokens. Imagine earning significant returns without having to actively trade—this is passive income at its best. The 90% APY on staking creates a robust incentive to hold onto BTFD tokens, turning every holder into a mini passive income generator.

Designed to be both accessible and fun, the P2E game allows participants to earn extra tokens as they engage in interactive gameplay. This feature not only enhances the utility of BTFD Coin but also widens its appeal to a broader audience—from hardcore gamers to crypto newcomers looking for innovative ways to profit.

The Bulls Squad community is another powerhouse driving BTFD Coin’s success. This passionate group fuels the project’s growth through an impressive referral program. The referral program deserves special mention: Every member of the Bulls Squad is incentivized to bring new investors into the fold, amplifying the network’s organic growth.

Its innovative ecosystem and robust referral program offer a gateway to substantial passive income and exponential growth. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin has carved out its own niche in the meme coin market, emerging as a noteworthy contender among the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now. While many investors have cherished the legacy of classic meme coins, it is perfectly fine to miss out on some of them when newer opportunities promise even bigger gains. Dogecoin represents a familiar and beloved token that has long captured the hearts of crypto enthusiasts. However, as the market evolves, the spotlight is shifting toward presale opportunities that offer innovative features and significant profit potential—like those seen with BTFD Coin. The inherent charm of Dogecoin lies in its simplicity and widespread recognition. It has been a staple in the meme coin community for years, and its loyal fan base is a testament to its enduring appeal. Despite this, many forward-thinking investors are now exploring the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now because these projects integrate next-generation features that promise greater returns. Dogecoin remains a fun and engaging token, but it may not deliver the same exponential growth and passive income potential that newer projects can offer. Recent developments in the broader crypto market have shown that innovative presale opportunities are reshaping investor priorities. Analysts predict that tokens with integrated staking rewards, play-to-earn (P2E) games, and robust referral programs—like BTFD Coin—are positioned to outperform traditional meme coins in terms of growth and profitability. This shift is a reflection of the changing times, where dynamic ecosystems and advanced tokenomics are key drivers of long-term success. While Dogecoin has its own merits and continues to be a cherished asset, the emerging trends suggest that the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now are the future of profitable crypto investments. Investors who consider diversifying their portfolio with meme coins are advised to look beyond traditional tokens and embrace presale opportunities that offer cutting-edge features. The Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now not only provide a chance for early entry at discounted prices but also come with unique incentives such as high APY staking and community-driven rewards. The potential for massive returns, as evidenced by recent price predictions and strong presale performance, is a major draw for those seeking passive income. In today’s volatile market, strategic investments in these innovative tokens can pave the way to exponential growth and financial freedom. The familiar allure of Dogecoin is undeniable, and its cultural impact remains strong. However, when evaluating the overall potential for passive income and future gains, many investors find that the emerging presale opportunities hold the key to unlocking greater value. The dynamic features and robust ecosystems of the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now set them apart from more traditional assets. As the market evolves, the emphasis is shifting toward projects that offer not only a nostalgic charm but also the technological edge required for exponential returns. This is why many are willing to embrace new opportunities even if it means letting go of a long-loved token. Why did this coin make it to this list? Dogecoin’s enduring legacy, combined with its simplicity and loyal following, secured its place on this list. However, the shift in focus toward the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now highlights why newer projects with advanced features are capturing investor attention and offering greater potential for massive gains. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market never stands still, and the emergence of innovative presale opportunities is proof of that. With BTFD Coin and Dogecoin leading the charge, the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now offer unparalleled passive income potential through high-yield staking, immersive P2E games, and vibrant referral programs. Analysts predict that these projects will deliver exponential returns as they continue to gain momentum. It’s time to seize the opportunity and invest in the future of crypto.

This groundbreaking token has already proven its worth, raising $1 million in just minutes during its presale. With momentum building and investor interest surging, OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM is positioning itself as the most promising crypto of 2025. What’s Driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s Momentum? Record-Breaking Presale Success The demand for THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has been unprecedented, with $1 million raised in minutes. This strong presale performance demonstrates overwhelming investor confidence, rivaling early excitement around XRP and SOL. Exclusive Availability Unlike XRP and SOLANA, which are widely available on major exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand and ensures that early adopters stand to gain the most from its projected breakout. Growing Investor Confidence With predictions of a 50,000% return, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has become a magnet for investors seeking exponential growth. Its strong performance and limited supply are fueling speculation that it could redefine the crypto market. How It Compares to Market Leaders Ripple (XRP): Known for its dominance in cross-border payments, XRP offers steady growth but doesn’t match the early-stage explosive potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Solana (SOL): A leader in blockchain scalability, SOL excels in speed but can’t rival the exclusivity and investor momentum driving this new token. Act Now Before It’s Too Late With analysts closely watching OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM , the token is proving to be a standout investment. Its record-breaking presale, exclusive availability, and massive growth potential make it a top choice for anyone looking to capitalize on crypto’s next breakout.

Analyst Ali Martinez tells his 122,400 followers on the social media platform X that Solana is in danger of plunging to levels last seen in October of 2024. According to the trader, SOL must stay above a key support level to invalidate his outlook. “This is it! If Solana SOL fails to hold above $191, a drop to $138 could be imminent.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that SOL is still trading within an ascending parallel channel – a pattern indicating that an asset is an uptrend, printing higher highs and higher lows. But he notes that losing $191 as support means invalidating the channel’s diagonal support, potentially ending a multi-month uptrend. At time of writing, SOL is trading for $197, translating to a 39% decline if Solana hits the analyst’s downside target. Looking at XRP , the analyst notes that whales unloaded tens of millions of dollars worth of the third-largest crypto asset by market cap in just one day. “Whales have offloaded over 130 million XRP in the past 24 hours!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.24, down over 20% on the day. Deep-pocketed Dogecoin ( DOGE ) investors also offloaded their stacks, according to Martinez. “Whales sold 270 million Dogecoin DOGE in the last 24 hours!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.227, down over 22% in the past day.

Cardano (ADA), Near Protocol (NEAR), and Kaspa (KAS) have also built strong reputations, while Arbitrum (ARB) has shown potential as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. However, a new coin, OFFICIALMAGACOIN, is now commanding the attention of savvy investors. OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Deliver 60,000% Returns OFFICIALMAGACOIN has emerged as a unique player, with a record-breaking presale raising over $1 million in minutes. The token is only available at officialmagacoin.com , adding an element of exclusivity that appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Its potential for 60,000% returns has investors speculating that it could mirror or even surpass Bitcoin’s early growth trajectory. Early-Stage Growth Potential: With its presale success, OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors a chance to get in on the ground floor of a coin poised for exponential growth. Exclusivity and Scarcity: Available only at its official website, the token creates urgency and a sense of premium access. Affordable Entry Point: At less than $0.20 per token, OFFICIALMAGACOIN provides a low-risk, high-reward opportunity. Comparing OFFICIALMAGACOIN to Competitors Bitcoin (BTC): Established but lacks the explosive growth of a new coin. Cardano (ADA): Reliable but maturing, leaving little room for exponential returns. Near Protocol (NEAR): Focused on Web3 but cannot match OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s exclusivity. Kaspa (KAS): A promising blockchain but with a slower trajectory. Investors eager to secure their position in this promising token can do so exclusively at officialmagacoin.com .

According to the AI news, the framework will address concerns about the dangers of advanced AI technology, particularly in cybersecurity and biosecurity. The company states that some AI models may be too risky to release, requiring internal safeguards before further deployment. AI News: Meta’s Frontier AI Framework Aims to Limit Risky AI Releases In a recent document filing , Meta classified AI systems into two categories based on potential risks. These categories are high-risk and critical-risk, each defined by the extent of possible harm. AI models deemed high-risk may assist in cyber or biological attacks. However, critical-risk AI can cause severe harm, with Meta stating that such systems could lead to catastrophic consequences. According to the AI news, Meta will halt the development of any system classified as critical risk and implement additional security measures to prevent unauthorized access. High-risk AI models will be restricted internally, with further work to reduce risks before release. The framework reflects the company’s focus on minimizing potential threats associated with artificial intelligence. These security measures come amid recent concerns over AI data privacy. In the latest AI news, DeepSeek, a Chinese startup, has been removed from Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store in Italy. The country’s data protection authority is investigating its data collection practices. Stricter Artificial Intelligence Security Measures To determine AI system risk levels, Meta will rely on assessments from internal and external researchers. However, the company states that no single test can fully measure risk, making expert evaluation a key factor in decision-making. The framework outlines a structured review process, with senior decision-makers overseeing final risk classifications. For high-risk AI, Meta plans to introduce mitigation measures before considering a release. This approach will prevent AI systems from being misused while maintaining their intended functionality. If an artificial intelligence model is classified as critical-risk, development will be suspended entirely until safety measures can ensure controlled deployment. Open AI Strategy Faces Scrutiny Meta has pursued an open AI development model, allowing broader access to its Llama AI models. This strategy has resulted in widespread adoption, with millions of downloads recorded. However, concerns have emerged regarding potential misuse, including reports that a U.S. adversary utilized Llama to develop a defense chatbot. With the Frontier AI Framework, the company is addressing these concerns while maintaining its commitment to open AI development. Meanwhile, while AI safety continues to be a matter of concern, OpenAI has continued its development. In other AI news, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT Gov , a secure AI model tailored for U.S. government agencies. This launch comes as DeepSeek gains traction and Meta enhances its security measures, intensifying competition in the AI space.

The approved plan involves converting defaulted debt into TCY (Thorchain Yield) equity tokens, eliminating the need for a private raise, and leveraging existing treasury funds to facilitate recovery. Under this framework , 200 million TCY tokens will be minted and distributed to affected users at a rate of one token per dollar of defaulted debt. These tokens will receive 10% of protocol fees indefinitely, providing long-term incentives for liquidity providers and aligning interests across the ecosystem. A shallow RUNE/TCY pool will be established at $0.10 per TCY, with $5 million in treasury funds allocated for strategic buybacks over ten weeks in a bid to ensure a more stable price discovery process. The proposal also introduces Liquidity Nodes to ramp up capital efficiency and offset forfeited fees, thereby strengthening governance participation for liquidity providers. By writing off debt through an equity conversion, the protocol remains solvent without minting additional RUNE, while affected users gain a potential path to full recovery. The latest development comes after the decentralized cross-chain liquidity protocol temporarily suspended its THORFi services on January 23rd in response to financial instability and insolvency rumors. A 90-day restructuring plan was put in place to address challenges arising from its Savers and Lending programs, which have accumulated excessive debt. Trading activities, including swaps, remained unaffected, but lending services were on hold as validator nodes oversaw the restructuring process. “The Jan 23 pause set the conditions for community members to decide on a restructuring plan to ensure the network’s continued operation while compensating Lending and Savers users. The community stepped up, proposing 8 independent plans, which were reviewed and voted on by Node Operators.” Its native token, RUNE, has been on a steady decline since the first week of December. It took a deep plunge following the suspension of THORFi. Despite minor hints of recovery, RUNE continued its downtrend, shedding almost 80% over the past month alone. It was currently trading at $1.21.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order over the weekend to establish the fund, aiming to strengthen the country’s long-term economic stability. The announcement has sparked discussions about whether Bitcoin and Ethereum could be included in the fund’s assets. Sovereign Wealth Fund Established Amid Economic Strategy Shifts The executive order signed by President Trump marks a strategic move to build a Sovereign Wealth Fund for the United States. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the decision, stating that the fund is expected to play a key role in national financial planning. The announcement comes at a time when global markets face uncertainty due to trade discussions between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. The fund’s purpose and structure have not been fully disclosed, but it is expected to manage various assets. Some financial analysts suggest that alternative investments, including digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, could be considered to diversify holdings. This comes as the cryptocurrency market shows signs of recovery, with Bitcoin price surpassing $101,000 and Ethereum price trading near $2,849. Senator Cynthia Lummis Pushes for a Bitcoin Reserve Senator Cynthia Lummis, an advocate for cryptocurrency, has reiterated her support for integrating Bitcoin into government reserves. Over the weekend, she discussed the progress of a proposed bill that would allow the U.S. government to accumulate 1 million Bitcoin over five years. The bill suggests holding the assets for at least 20 years as a long-term strategy. “This is a big deal,” Lummis said in reaction to the Sovereign Wealth Fund news, emphasizing the potential role of Bitcoin in the country’s financial system. Concurrently, Bitwise senior investment strategist Juan Leon also commented on the possibility of Bitcoin being included in the fund. He stated that the government could add Bitcoin to the Sovereign Wealth Fund while accumulating more BTC for a separate strategic reserve. Could Bitcoin and Ethereum Be Part of the Sovereign Wealth Fund? As the Sovereign Wealth Fund takes shape, discussions continue about what assets will be included. Some financial experts believe that Bitcoin and Ethereum could be considered due to their rising acceptance as store-of-value assets. The recent push from Senator Lummis for a Bitcoin reserve suggests growing interest in incorporating cryptocurrency into national financial strategies. Eric Trump recently expressed optimism about Ethereum, stating on social media that it could be a good time to invest. His comments come as Ethereum shows steady performance, following Bitcoin’s surge. If the government decides to include digital assets in the Sovereign Wealth Fund, it could signal a shift in how the U.S. approaches cryptocurrency at a national level. Cryptocurrency Market Recovers Amid Optimism Financial markets have reacted to recent events, with global stocks declining while the cryptocurrency sector remains strong. The rise of Bitcoin above $101,000 and Ethereum’s steady surge indicate growing investor confidence in digital assets. Some market analysts believe that government interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum could further drive adoption. Meanwhile, the United States, Mexico, and Canada have reached an agreement to delay new tariffs on goods for one month which has restored optimism. The decision came after a discussion between President Trump, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. While traditional markets have shown uncertainty, the cryptocurrency sector appears to be experiencing renewed momentum. Subsequently, the XRP price soared over 17% to trade at $2.73, Shiba Inu price jumped 13% to $0.00001667, Dogecoin too soared over 15% to $0.28 and MANTRA price led the top gainers in the last 24 hours after skyrocketing over 27% followed by Onyxcoin (XCN) 25% rally from its intra-day low.

The decline follows unfavorable macroeconomic developments, including newly imposed US tariffs. This price movement has left investors and analysts closely scrutinizing the market for signs of a reversal or further downturn. According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst TraderOasis, Bitcoin’s decline below critical support levels has resulted in increased panic selling. Despite this, the Coinbase premium index indicates that institutional investors are continuing to accumulate BTC rather than offloading their holdings. This contrast between retail-driven selloffs and institutional accumulation suggests that larger players are using the current dip to boost their positions. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Bullish But It’s Time For Caution Bitcoin Market Dynamics And Institutional Activity TraderOasis highlights several key market indicators that shed light on the current dynamics. Open interest—a measure of active trading positions—has dropped significantly, pointing to a wave of forced liquidations as leveraged traders exit their positions. Oasis wrote: A drop in funding rates suggests that market participants are taking short positions (betting on a price decrease) and that bearish sentiment is increasing. Notably, this ongoing pattern described by the analyst hints at a strategic accumulation phase by so-called “whales,” or large-scale investors. Oasis mentioned that while retail traders face stop-loss liquidations, these larger entities appear to be absorbing Bitcoin at discounted prices. This accumulation during periods of panic is not uncommon and often precedes a market recovery. Rising Liquidations and Signs of Recovery Another CryptoQuant analyst, Mignolet, echoed these observations, emphasizing the scale of recent long-position liquidations. The current liquidation volume is reportedly the highest since September 2023, with many traders caught off guard by the abrupt price drop. Mignolet compares this event to past market shocks, including the FTX collapse and the COVID-induced crash.

As investors rush to secure their positions, the biggest opportunities often come from presale tokens—undiscovered gems that have yet to hit major exchanges. Among the best crypto presales of 2025, some projects stand out for their innovation, real-world utility, and potential for massive returns. One of the most exciting ones? Web3Bay—a blockchain-powered e-commerce platform that eliminates middlemen and gives users full control over online transactions. Here’s a look at six top presale tokens that are catching investors’ attention. 1. Web3Bay ($3BAY) – The Future of Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is breaking new ground in online shopping by creating a decentralized, user-governed marketplace on the blockchain. Unlike traditional platforms that charge hidden fees, control user data, and impose restrictive policies, Web3Bay hands control back to 3BAY token holders. Why Web3Bay Stands Out Decentralized Ownership – Web3Bay will renounce its smart contract post-ICO, meaning no single entity can alter the system. Governance will be fully handled by token holders through a DAO. Security & Transparency – Transactions are secured through smart contracts on a Layer-1 blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof records. Additionally, all data is stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), protecting users from security breaches. Staking & Discounts – 3BAY holders can stake tokens to earn passive income and receive a 5% discount on all transactions made within the platform. Explosive Presale Growth – Web3Bay’s presale has already raised over $1 million, selling 270 million tokens across multiple stages. With each new stage, the price rises, rewarding early adopters with massive potential gains. Current Price: $0.004562625 (Stage 4) Launch Price: $0.1959 (4,200% ROI) 2. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – The ETF for Meme Coins Meme Index is revolutionizing meme coin investing by offering a curated portfolio of top-performing meme tokens, similar to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in traditional finance. 💡 Key Features: 🔹 Community DAO governance – Holders vote on which meme coins enter the index. 🔹 Staking rewards – Up to 700% APY for early stakers. 🔹 $3M+ raised in presale, with prices at just $0.0155933. If you want meme coin exposure without chasing individual projects, MEMEX offers a diversified approach. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s First Layer-2 Scaling Solution Solaxy is bringing Ethereum-style Layer-2 scaling to Solana, solving network congestion and high gas fees. With Solana’s growing adoption, Solaxy is primed for massive demand. 💡 Why Solaxy is a Game-Changer: 🔹 Reduces transaction costs and speeds up processing. 🔹 Ethereum-Solana bridge for cross-chain interoperability. 🔹 $16.3 million raised, proving strong early support. As institutional investors flock to Solana, Solaxy’s role as a scaling solution makes it a must-watch project. 4. The Last Dwarfs (TLD) – The Next Big GameFi Project The GameFi sector is projected to exceed $60 billion by 2028 , and The Last Dwarfs is positioning itself as a leading blockchain gaming ecosystem . 💡 What Makes TLD Special: 🔹 Fully decentralized in-game economy – Players truly own their assets. 🔹 Staking & governance rewards for token holders. 🔹 300,000+ users onboarded and 50+ partnerships secured. With GameFi continuing to expand, The Last Dwarfs could be one of the biggest presale winners. 5. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – A Next-Gen Crypto Wallet Managing digital assets shouldn’t be complicated , and Best Wallet aims to simplify crypto trading with cutting-edge security and trading tools . 💡 Key Features: 🔹 Multi-chain support (Ethereum, BSC, and more). 🔹 DEX aggregator that finds the best trading rates. 🔹 $8M+ raised in presale, proving strong demand. As crypto adoption increases, wallets like Best Wallet will become essential for traders. Final Thoughts: Don’t Wait Until It’s Too Late Crypto presales offer the highest potential for early adopters, and Web3Bay leads the pack with its game-changing decentralized e-commerce model. Unlike speculative meme coins, Web3Bay is built for real-world use, allowing users to shop with crypto while earning staking rewards and discounts. With Bitcoin breaking records and institutional adoption on the rise, the window for early-stage opportunities won’t last forever. Every presale stage sees higher prices, meaning early investors get the best gains. Beyond Web3Bay, Meme Index, Solaxy, The Last Dwarfs, and Best Wallet Token are also offering high-growth potential in 2025. The next crypto bull run is coming, and these projects are positioned for explosive returns. The question is: will you get in before the market catches on?

Blockchain data indicates the transfer involved more than 90% of its multi-asset treasury, including large amounts of Ethereum (ETH) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), as well as positions in AAVE, ENA, and LINK. World Liberty Financial Moves $307M in Crypto to Coinbase On-chain data from Spotonchain reveals that World Liberty Financial transferred approximately $307 million worth of digital assets to Coinbase Prime. The transactions were part of what the project described as “treasury management and business operations.” The assets moved included ETH, WBTC, and other cryptocurrencies previously held in the project’s treasury. The transfers occurred in 13 separate transactions, ranging from $4 million to $95 million. After these transactions, World Liberty Financial’s total holdings dropped from $363 million to around $33 million. Before the large crypto transfers to the top crypto exchange, World Liberty Financial stated on X that Trump’s DeFi project was not planning to sell its crypto holdings. The DeFi project added, “We’re making routine movements of our crypto holdings as part of regular treasury management, and payment of fees and expenses and to address working capital requirements. To be clear, we are not selling tokens—we are simply reallocating assets for ordinary business purposes.” Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s newly proposed Sovereign Wealth Fund has sparked speculation about the inclusion of Ethereum and Bitcoin as part of its asset portfolio. Treasury Holdings Drop by 90% Following Transfers Notably, World Liberty Financial held approximately $175 million worth of ETH, making it the largest asset in its treasury before the transfers. The project also moved holdings in AAVE, ENA, and LINK, collectively valued at around $30 million. Each transaction was executed through multiple intermediary addresses before reaching Coinbase. The only major asset that remained untouched in the treasury was TRX, which the project had acquired after an investment from Justin Sun . The Tron founder initially invested $30 million and later increased his stake to $75 million, also joining as an advisor. Following the transfers to Coinbase, blockchain data showed that World Liberty Financial began receiving a series of small ETH deposits. These deposits, some as low as a few dollars, originated from newly created or inactive addresses. ETH Price Volatility and Eric Trump’s Comments Ethereum experienced sharp price fluctuations in response to market conditions. ETH initially faced downward pressure due to economic concerns tied to President Trump’s trade tariffs but rebounded 50% in a reversal, surpassing $2,800. It is important to note that the $2,800 ETH price level is a key support, and Ethereum has shown signs of recovery after recent volatility. Large investors, including whales like 7 Siblings, have accumulated ETH, suggesting confidence in a rebound. Amid the market movement, Eric Trump posted on X, suggesting it was a favorable time to buy Ethereum during the recent market dip. In my opinion, it’s a great time to add $ETH . — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) February 3, 2025 Despite the large treasury shift, World Liberty Financial still holds approximately $96.62 million in assets across nine known wallets.

39893992,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=667866,1738636491,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39893992.jpeg,Why some Americans are skeptical about Trump’s EO pushing a Sovereign Wealth Fund,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trumps-eo-pushing-a-sovereign-wealth-fund/,"A section of the American public has expressed their misgivings about the country’s intentions of establishing a Sovereign Wealth Fund(SWF). That follows President Donald Trump’s signing of an Executive Order (EO) directing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his nominee for the Commerce Department, Howard Lutnick, to create the investment tool. Speaking during the EO’s signing on Monday at the Oval Office, Mr. Trump expressed his excitement at development. He said, “We’re going to create a lot of wealth for the fund, and I think it’s about time this country had a sovereign wealth fund. ” Expectedly, news of Mr. Trump’s action stirred his fanbase, with some suggesting the SWF could pave the way for creating a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, one of his campaign promises. That excitement, however, failed to rub off on some US citizens, who took to X to express their apprehension about the proposed SWF. Where is disquiet over Trump’s Sovereign Wealth Fund push coming from? A major point of contention is the opaqueness of the SWF. The president and his team haven’t spelled out how the fund will work, something that X users Michelle Denver and Dave Shaffer alluded to when replying to Whitehouse Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s tweet on the EO. Another concern is that the fund could be misused. Doug Arrowsmith labeled the program a government-funded Oligarchy and crypto ponzi scheme, sentiments that resonated with another user, Squirrelmecha . Meanwhile, Tatiana Fuchs likened the fund to money laundering at the highest levels, and the Grand Duchess chimed in, “That’s code for Elon Musk’s piggy bank.” Their fears tally with the findings of a 2024 Carnegie Endowment for International Peace study . This research found that a lack of governance and regulatory safeguards risks turning SWFs into “conduits of corruption, money laundering, and other illicit activities.” Others considered it a wrong choice to establish an SWF when America is already buried in debt. The concept of sovereign wealth funds was said to be for countries with surplus by Wayne Dupree who identified himself as a conservative voter. Max Műller and Max deFreitas also had no kind words to say about the decision, arguing that it was ill advised for a country as deeply in debt as the U.S. Still of concern was Mr. Trump’s seemingly going back on his word on cutting down the government. Steve Hamill pointed to that with a tinge of sarcasm, referring to how the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is threatening to shut down one government slush fund (USAID) only to create a new one. So, what does establishing a US Sovereign Wealth Fund entail? Talking to reporters after the EO’s signing, Mr. Bessent gave a 12-month time frame to have the SWF up and running. During that time, he and his treasury counterpart will need to first get congressional approval, as the vehicle will need laws anchoring its operations. Despite the GOP’s majority over the Democrats in the legislature, it might need to reach across the aisle to gain political goodwill for the SWFs’ smooth running. That could be challenging, considering the parties’ fractious relationship. If Trump’s SWF is to receive the green light from Congress, then the next challenge would be to raise the funds. Many think this will be difficult in the current environment of the country’s growing public debt and budget deficit. A proposal made has been to implement cost cutting measures such as the Elon Musk led DOGE office is currently implementing. However, these interventions have been contentious, with some analysts implying they could present grounds for litigation derailing the effort. Thirdly, Bessent and Co will need to set up the structure for the SWF’s management and oversight. That would involve creating a broadly acceptable, transparent, independent, and professional team to run the fund. They will also need the public’s buy-in from taxpayers, some of whom have reservations about the proposed SWF. Finally, they will need to develop the rules and regulations that keep it in compliance with US Securities laws. Some of the objectives that the US is expecting from the SWF are to create a long term revenue source, to buffer its economy from market shocks, and to relieve its debt problems.

Ishiba has said he wants to increase “cooperation in the field of AI” and will discuss the matter with US President Donald Trump at a summit meeting on February 7, with a joint statement expected to be forthcoming. The move to deepen relations is ostensibly part of a plan to keep pace with China — a commonly cited Western boogeyman — and prevent the massive state’s undue dominance in the field. Trump, for his part, surprised many of his fiscally conservative supporters after taking office, by announcing a $500 billion joint venture into AI known as “Stargate.” The investment involves both Softbank Group (SBG) and OpenAI, as well as an entity known as Oracle. Ishiba is now doubling down on this trans-Pacific handshake, and plans to meet with Trump on the 7th to further cement the development. Ishiba moves to back US in joint AI development The Japanese PM met with Masayoshi Son, CEO of Japan’s investment and communications giant Softbank, as well as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in Tokyo Monday, and “exchanged views on AI investment in the United States,” according to regional media. “We want Japan and the United States to deepen cooperation in the field of AI and strive to make the world more peaceful, prosperous, and safe,” Ishiba is quoted as saying. While some die-hard Trump supporters are now confused as to how dumping billions into a global AI database called Stargate (and spending even more money on the Biden-era initiative) is going to help “make America great,” Japanese are also doubting their own ruler’s intentions when it comes to the tech. As previously reported here on Cryptopolitan, the Japanese government has openly stated its intentions to govern and surveil the populace with massive AI infrastructure, while everyday residents of the archipelago find themselves in financial straits. In response to the February 3 meeting involving Ishiba and OpenAI, one user of X said : “If you’re going to spend that much money, make an AI made in Japan instead.” This sentiment is not rare. Like the Japanese AI governance initiative, Stargate is also tied to digital health records, and also potential mRNA injection initiatives with a stated goal of fighting cancer. Japan’s “My Number” digital health surveillance and catch-all identification system is similarly controversial with Japanese, as some fear My Number will centralize state control and make private information insecure.

Arctic Pablo Coin at $0.000047 Could Be Your Second Shot For Massive Gains in 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-dogs-ico-arctic-pablo-coin-at-0-000047-could-be-your-second-shot-for-massive-gains-in-2025/,"The rise of meme coins has been nothing short of explosive, and one of the most notable success stories in the space was Dogs. Launched at a minuscule price of $0.0000001 during its ICO, it was initially dismissed by many. However, for those few who believed in its potential, the payoff has been monumental. Early investors who jumped in at the beginning have seen their investments soar, turning pennies into incredible profits. For those who missed out on the chance to invest in Dogs at that low price, there’s no need to dwell on regrets. The best meme coin to join in 2025 is here, and it’s called Arctic Pablo Coin. Already making waves in its presale, Arctic Pablo is a chance for investors to experience the same success that early Dogs investors are now reaping. Let’s dive into why Arctic Pablo Coin could be your ticket to a huge return on investment. Dogs’ ICO: A Missed Opportunity That Made Millionaires When Dogs launched its ICO, it was barely on anyone’s radar. Priced at $0.0000001, few saw it as anything more than a joke or a passing trend. But for the brave investors who took the plunge, the payoff has been nothing short of extraordinary. As the coin gained momentum, driven by its growing community and viral popularity, Dogs saw an unprecedented surge in price. Those who bought in at the beginning have seen their investments skyrocket, with some early adopters seeing returns in the thousands of percent. Now, looking back, those who missed the ICO are regretting it, wishing they had taken the risk and joined in when the price was still incredibly low. It’s a classic case of “you snooze, you lose,” but there’s a silver lining: Arctic Pablo Coin is here, and it’s presenting a fresh opportunity for investors. Let’s take a closer look at how Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be the best meme coin to join in 2025. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Best Meme Coin to Join in 2025—Don’t Miss Out on This Second Chance! When Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) was first introduced, it was priced at an incredibly low $0.000047. With a launch price of $0.008, this offers investors the potential for an ROI of over 16,936% from the seventh stage to the launch. But what truly sets Arctic Pablo apart from other meme coins is its unique presale structure. Unlike other ICOs that follow a standard stage-based presale, Arctic Pablo Coin has taken a different approach by dividing the presale into locations as the coin “travels.” Currently, Arctic Pablo Coin finds itself in the Shangri-La location, which has created a sense of excitement and anticipation. This unique model offers investors a rare opportunity to get in early, just like those who got in at the beginning of Dogs. Another standout feature of Arctic Pablo is its 66% APY for staking during the presale. Investors can lock their tokens and earn substantial rewards, making this opportunity even more appealing for those seeking long-term returns. On top of that, Arctic Pablo offers referral incentives—those who spread the word about the coin can earn additional rewards in APC tokens or USD. These features create a community-driven atmosphere that’s primed for success and further adds to Arctic Pablo’s potential for explosive growth. Why Arctic Pablo Coin Is Poised for Explosive Growth in 2025—A Low Entry Price You Can’t Ignore The momentum behind Arctic Pablo Coin is undeniable. With over $870,000 raised already in its presale, the project is off to a strong start. The current price of $0.000047 is still remarkably low, but the presale won’t last forever. Investors who get in now can still take advantage of these rock-bottom prices before the coin launches at its $0.008 price point. Arctic Pablo Coin’s ROI potential is hard to ignore. Early investors have the chance to experience a staggering 16,936% ROI from the seventh stage to the launch price. Compare that to the early days of Dogs, when investors who entered early were rewarded handsomely. Arctic Pablo Coin offers the same type of opportunity for those who were too late to get into Dogs’ ICO. Whether you’re a first-time crypto investor or a seasoned trader looking for the next big thing, Arctic Pablo presents a massive upside potential. Additionally, Arctic Pablo Coin’s community competitions allow users to participate in fun and engaging ways to earn rewards in the form of APC tokens or USD. This further fosters a sense of engagement and inclusion, making Arctic Pablo not just a meme coin, but a project with a loyal and growing community. How Arctic Pablo Coin’s Unique Presale Structure Could Make You a Winner in 2025 What makes Arctic Pablo Coin stand out from other meme coins is its innovative presale structure. Instead of following the traditional staged model, where tokens are released in phases, Arctic Pablo Coin is utilizing a location-based presale system. As the coin “travels,” different locations become the focal points of its presale, creating a sense of excitement and exclusivity. Currently, Arctic Pablo Coin is in the Shangri-La location, and there’s still time to get in before it moves to its next location. This approach has captured the attention of investors who are eager to get in early and ride the wave as the coin progresses. The community-driven rewards, such as staking with an impressive 66% APY and referral incentives, have created an environment where early backers are motivated to spread the word and increase the token’s visibility. As Arctic Pablo continues to build momentum, the potential for huge returns increases, and the unique structure of the presale makes it an exciting investment. If you missed out on Dogs or regret not jumping in sooner, Arctic Pablo Coin offers a second chance to secure a position at a low price before it hits the big leagues. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Your Chance with Arctic Pablo Coin Based on the latest research, the best meme coin to join in 2025 includes Arctic Pablo Coin alongside other popular meme coins like Dogs. However, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as an incredible opportunity for those who missed the early days of Dogs. With an impressive ROI potential, community-driven rewards, and a unique presale structure, Arctic Pablo is positioned for massive growth. The price is still extremely low, and with over $870,000 already raised, the presale is gaining traction quickly. This could be your chance to invest in one of the most promising meme coins of 2025 before it skyrockets. Don’t miss out—join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale now and be part of the next big success story in the meme coin world!

Now, both tokens face sudden price drops, leaving investors shaken. Meanwhile, a PayFi altcoin called Remittix(RTX) has surged by 250% in January, positioning itself as an unexpected hedge against the meme-coin meltdown. With over $10.5 million raised, 430 million tokens sold and a current price of $0.0521, Remittix (RTX) stands out for its real-world approach—focusing on cheaper cross-border transactions rather than social-media hype. Below is a look at the dip in SHIB and PEPE and how Remittix (RTX) found a way to soar despite the meme-coin chaos. Meme-Coin Meltdown: Why SHIB and PEPE Are Struggling Over the past few weeks, Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw a dramatic slip, plagued by questions about its Shibarium roadmap and whether developer updates can sustain hype. At the same time, Pepe (PEPE) faced a perfect storm of oversupply fears and waning social interest. Meme coins typically rely on viral support: prices tumble swiftly if the conversation dies down or a significant influencer moves on. Observers note that SHIB and PEPE still boast strong communities but are more vulnerable to social sentiment than other crypto sectors. In a jittery market, many traders seek stability or tangible utility—a factor often lacking in comedic tokens. That’s why some early SHIB and PEPE enthusiasts, hoping for big breakouts, now pivot to altcoins with everyday problem-solving at their core. As skepticism about pure meme coins grows, where will we invest if viral chatter no longer guarantees success? Enter PayFi solutions like Remittix (RTX) show steady adoption by tackling real-world pain points. Remittix (RTX): 250% Returns and Counting So, how did Remittix (RTX) manage an impressive 250% surge last month, even as meme coins falter? The altcoin appeals to an entirely different audience—think cross-border businesses, freelancers and unbanked families who lose money to steep bank fees. Imagine a local artisan in Morocco selling handcrafted goods to buyers in France; every time she ships a product, she dreads the high costs of traditional wire transfers. With Remittix (RTX), she can send or receive tokens at far lower fees and convert them to local cash without the usual hurdles. In the long run, that immediate utility matters more than memes attracting a broader audience. This practicality is a magnet for investors skeptical about comedic coins. Observers see a chance for Remittix( RTX) to secure large-scale adoption as more regions discover that wallet-to-cash solutions are cheaper and faster than legacy remittances. Remittix (RTX) has already raised over $10.5 million, sold 430 million tokens, and set its price at $0.0521. Analysts suggest that if altcoin keeps forging partnerships with payment agents worldwide, it will repeat—or surpass—its 250% performance. After all, actual cost savings can drive consistent usage, which perks meme coins typically lack. Conclusion: Is Real-World Adoption the New Trend? Meme coins like SHIB and PEPE showed how fast hype can evaporate, casting doubt on short-lived social media bursts. But Remittix(RTX) underscores a different path to crypto success, anchored in bridging fiat and crypto. If global users see how PayFi platforms can cut fees and time for international transfers, altcoin’s 250% jump might be just the beginning. With the broader market looking for safer, solution-oriented bets, Remittix(RTX) stands out as an attractive alternative for burnt meme-coin holders and new investors. As SHIB and PEPE scramble to recapture buzz, the altcoin is delivering tangible, cost-saving benefits that seem ready to maintain momentum. Ready to Explore Remittix (RTX)?

Many are concerned that the exchange may have been “rugpulled.” Xeggex officials have explained that the CEO’s account was hacked, which led to a temporary suspension of logins and access to user funds. However, the exchange reassured users that their wallets were successfully locked to prevent any loss of funds. The database was disconnected from the network, which caused the inability to log in to accounts, though the front-end of the website remained operational. The situation caused a lot of panic among users, especially with the order books showing empty and balances not visible. Some users expressed concern that the platform may have suffered a more severe breach. To safeguard against potential threats, Xeggex took the database offline to prevent hackers from further exploiting the platform. The company has committed to conducting a full assessment of the breach and plans to update users as soon as possible. While no funds have been moved according to blockchain data, the exchange is still investigating the hack’s full impact. At this point, Xeggex has confirmed that they are actively working to secure all wallets and prevent further issues. “Dear users, in this hard time our CEO was hacked and he lost tg account and xeggex community group beside that we still don’t know details about it. Also what is important in this moment is that we succeed to lock down wallets so funds are safe,” the company said.

With its groundbreaking AI-blockchain integration and rapid presale momentum, Lightchain AI could be positioning itself as the next major disruptor in the crypto market.

Presale Growth Signals Strong Investor Confidence Lightchain AI has already raised an impressive $14 million during its presale, signaling strong confidence from early investors in its growth potential. With its combination of a low entry price and high-utility blockchain solutions, the project has quickly gained recognition as one of the most exciting presale opportunities for 2025. As institutional interest in AI-powered blockchain projects continues to rise, Lightchain AI is uniquely positioned to capture significant attention. Its innovative approach to blending AI and blockchain has attracted early accumulation by whales, further emphasizing its potential for long-term success. The growing anticipation around Lightchain AI suggests the project could experience strong price action upon its market debut. Investors are watching closely as it prepares to disrupt the blockchain space. Is Lightchain AI the Next Major Market Disruptor?

With a presale price under $0.20 and a rapid rise in popularity, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts who believe that $300 today could turn into $999,000 in the near future. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Transform Your Investment 1. Early-Stage Opportunity OFFICIALMAGACOIN is still in its presale phase, offering a ground-floor opportunity for investors to buy in before the token gains mainstream attention. This is the stage where gains of 1,000x or more become achievable, as seen with Bitcoin in its early days. 2. Exclusive AvailabilityUnlike widely distributed coins, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand, ensuring that early adopters benefit as interest surges. 3. Record-Breaking Presale SuccessRaising over $1 million in presale funds in record time, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its appeal among investors. Such strong initial support is a hallmark of projects poised for explosive growth. 4. Massive Growth PotentialExperts are predicting OFFICIALMAGACOIN could follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps, transforming small investments into extraordinary returns. With its low entry price and strong market momentum, the potential for turning $300 into $999,000 feels more achievable than ever. How It Stacks Up Against SOL, MATIC, KAS, and BTC Bitcoin (BTC): A proven store of value, but its days of exponential growth are behind it. Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum OFFICIALMAGACOIN is generating. Don’t Miss Out on OFFICIALMAGACOIN The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but OFFICIALMAGACOIN might just be that opportunity. With its affordable price, exclusivity, and massive growth potential, it’s a must-watch for 2025. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and stay updated on their journey via Twitter/X.

In a newly-unsealed indictment filed in the Eastern District of New York (EDNY), prosecutors say Andean “Andy” Medjedovic was the mastermind behind both exploits. Though Medjedovic’s alleged role in the KyberSwap exploit was previously unknown, he has publicly admitted to being the Indexed Finance attacker, wiping $16 million from the DeFi platform when he was still a teenager. Read more: After Stealing $16M, This Teen Hacker Seems Intent on Testing ‘Code is Law’ in the Courts Medjedovic did little to hide his identity as the Indexed Finance hacker because he professed to believe he wasn’t actually doing anything illegal. Another DeFi hacker, Avraham “Avi” Eisenberg, took a similar “code is law” position after his 2022 Mango Markets exploit, claiming that siphoning $110 million from the decentralized exchange was fair game. A New York jury disagreed , finding Eisenberg guilty of fraud and market manipulation . He will be sentenced later this year, and faces up to 20 years in prison. Medjedovic has been on the run since December 2021, when a Canadian court issued a warrant for his arrest. In 2023, he told a DeFi Llama reporter that it was “exhausting” living as a fugitive, saying that he had been bouncing around through Europe, South America and an unnamed island nation while on the lam. A spokesperson for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) told CoinDesk that Medjedovic remains “at large” and is not believed to be in the U.S. Eight months after telling the same reporter that he was now a whitehat hacker, prosecutors say Medjedovic stole about $50 million from KyberSwap . According to the indictment, Medjedovic planned the KyberSwap hack for months before acting, writing to himself “Find time to Strike!” and creating a “POST-EXPLOITATION” plan for himself. In one file, Medjedovic allegedly mused on his past mistakes, writing “Going On the run / Yes / Chance of getting caught Medjedovic has been charged with one count of wire fraud, one count of unauthorized damage to a protected computer, one count of attempted Hobbs Act extortion, one count of money laundering conspiracy and one count of money laundering.

Within just two weeks, its price had skyrocketed to an all-time high that was simply eye-watering. Early investors reaped significant rewards, while those who hesitated were left watching from the sidelines. Notcoin’s integration into the Telegram ecosystem and its play-to-earn gaming model contributed to its rapid ascent, with its market cap approaching $1 billion shortly after launch. The regret of missing out on such a lucrative opportunity is palpable among many in the crypto community. But fear not, for the crypto universe is brimming with new opportunities. Enter BTFD Coin, currently in its 14th presale stage, priced at $0.00016 per token. The presale has already raised over $5.85 million, with more than 68 billion tokens sold and a growing community of over 10,200 holders. Analysts predict that BTFD Coin could surge to $0.0006 or even $0.006 upon listing, offering substantial potential gains for early investors. With its unique features and strong community backing, BTFD Coin presents a promising alternative for those seeking the next big opportunity in the meme coin space. Notcoin’s Meteoric Rise: A Lesson From the Past Notcoin’s ICO on May 16, 2024, was a game-changer. Starting at $0.0068 per token, it didn’t take long for the coin to capture the market’s attention. By June 1, the price had soared to $0.0284, marking a 317% increase in just two weeks. This rapid growth was fueled by its seamless integration into the Telegram ecosystem and an engaging play-to-earn gaming model. Within 30 hours of launch, Notcoin’s Telegram game attracted over 1 million new users, driving its market cap to nearly $1 billion. Trading volumes surged past $1.47 billion on May 29, solidifying Notcoin’s position among the heavyweights of meme cryptocurrencies. Those who got in early celebrated significant gains, while latecomers could only watch as the opportunity slipped away. BTFD Coin: Presale Success? Sounds Like It! For those who missed out on Notcoin, BTFD Coin offers a fresh opportunity. Currently, in its 14th presale stage, BTFD Coin is priced at $0.00016 per token . The presale has already raised over $5.85 million, with more than 68 billion tokens sold and a rapidly growing community of over 10,200 holders. Analysts are buzzing with predictions, suggesting that BTFD Coin could surge to $0.0006 or even $0.006 upon listing. Such projections indicate a potential for substantial returns for early investors. Investment Potential: Detangling the Numbers Suppose you invest $5,000 in BTFD Coin at the current presale price of $0.00016 per token. Here’s how the math works out: Number of Tokens Purchased: $5,000 / $0.00016 = 31,250,000 BTFD tokens Now, if the price reaches $0.0006 per token: Value of Investment: 31,250,000 tokens * $0.0006 = $18,750 That’s a potential profit of $13,750, representing a 275% return on your initial investment. And if the price climbs to $0.006, the numbers become even more impressive: Value of Investment: 31,250,000 tokens * $0.006 = $187,500 In this scenario, you’d be looking at a whopping $182,500 profit—a 3,650% return. While these figures are speculative and depend on market dynamics, they illustrate the significant potential that early investment in promising meme coins like BTFD Coin can offer. But what else does BTFD Coin have up its sleeve besides its crazy presale momentum? Well, to name a few, there’s the staking APY of 90% , a P2E game with rewards convertible into $BTFD tokens, a referral program that rewards both referrers and referrals and more to come. What’s not to be hyped about? To Summarize: Seize the Opportunity Today! The crypto market is known for its volatility, but with risk comes the potential for reward. BTFD Coin’s presale success and the optimistic projections from analysts make it a compelling option for those looking to capitalize on the next big meme coin. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by—consider participating in the BTFD Coin presale and position yourself for potential gains. It hasn’t been named one of the top new meme coins with 1000X potential for nothing! Find Out More: Website: https://www.btfd.io/ X/Twitter: https://x.com/BTFD_COIN Telegram: https://t.me/btfd_coin FAQs Why did Notcoin’s price rise after its ICO? Notcoin’s rapid price surge was driven by its integration with Telegram, which brought in over 1 million users in just 30 hours. Its play-to-earn game also created massive demand, helping its market cap reach nearly $1 billion in record time. What makes BTFD Coin one of the top new meme coins with 1000X potential? BTFD Coin’s presale success, strong community of over 10,200 holders, and staking rewards give it serious growth potential. Analysts predict it could reach $0.0006 or even $0.006, making it a strong contender for high returns. How much could I make if BTFD Coin follows Notcoin’s explosive growth? If you invest $5,000 at the current presale price of $0.00016 and BTFD Coin rises to $0.0006, your investment would be worth $18,750. If it reaches $0.006, it would skyrocket to $187,500.

ETH is up nearly 10% and now faces a major resistance near $2,920. Ethereum started a decent upward move above the $2,500 support zone. The price is trading below $2,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,920 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it stays below the $2,920 level. Ethereum Price Attempts Recovery Ethereum price started a major decline below the $2,800 level, underperforming Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $2,650 and $2,500 levels to enter a bearish zone. There was a clear move below the $2,200 level. The price declined over 25% and tested the $2,120 zone. A low was formed at $2,127 and the price recently started a fresh upward move. There was an increase above the $2,500 level. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,403 wing high to the $2,127 swing low. However, the bears are now active near the $2,900 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,920 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,900 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,920 level and the trend line or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,403 wing high to the $2,127 swing low. The main resistance is now forming near $3,000. A clear move above the $3,000 resistance might send the price toward the $3,120 resistance. An upside break above the $3,120 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,250 resistance zone or even $3,320 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,900 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,765 level. The first major support sits near the $2,650. A clear move below the $2,650 support might push the price toward the $2,500 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,420 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350.

However, some crypto analysts see this sharp decline as a buying opportunity, suggesting that BTC may be oversold and poised for a rebound. Is Bitcoin Poised For A Relief Rally? Yesterday, the crypto market experienced one of its largest sell-offs in history, with over $2.3 billion in liquidations affecting more than 742,000 traders. This level of liquidations surpasses those seen during the COVID market crash in March 2020 and the FTX collapse in November 2022. Related Reading: Crypto Traders Wrecked As Trump’s Tariffs Spark $2 Billion Liquidation Despite the downturn, some analysts argue that BTC may have entered oversold territory, signaling a potential relief rally. Crypto analyst Caleb Franzen shared insights in a post on X, highlighting that Bitcoin’s 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped into oversold levels. He noted: For the 5th time since August 2024, Bitcoin’s 4-hour RSI is becoming oversold. Each of the prior signals were attractive accumulation periods, even if price made new short-term lows after the signal flashed. For the uninitiated, the RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes to determine whether BTC is overbought or oversold. A reading above 70 suggests overbought conditions – potential for a pullback – while a reading below 30 indicates oversold conditions – potential for a rebound. According to Franzen’s chart, Bitcoin’s current RSI is hovering around 24 on the 4-hour timeframe, indicating that BTC may be in an attractive accumulation zone. If historical trends hold, BTC could be on the verge of a short-term recovery. Is There More Trouble For BTC Ahead? As of the latest updates, Donald Trump and his Mexican counterpart Claudia Sheinbaum have agreed to temporarily delay the proposed trade tariffs, offering some relief to financial markets. However, uncertainty remains regarding trade negotiations with Canada, leaving investors cautious about BTC’s next move. Related Reading: Is The Crypto Market ‘Satiated’ For Now? Analysts Say Bitcoin Will Continue Sideways Move Meanwhile, fellow crypto analyst Johnny’s analysis indicates that “the meat” of BTC’s current down move is likely over. The analyst added that as long as BTC continues to trade above range lows and the yearly open, it will “look good compared to the rest of the market.” However, not all experts are optimistic. Renowned businessman and author Robert Kiyosaki warns that BTC could face further downside pressure if Trump follows through with his tariff plans. According to Kiyosaki, increased tariffs could strengthen the US dollar, potentially driving investors away from risk assets like Bitcoin in the short term. At press time, BTC trades at $98,644, up 0.4% in the past 24 hours.

With Crypto.com and Kalshi under review, could stricter oversight be coming for event-based trading? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is closely scrutinizing Crypto.com and Kalshi Inc., seeking clarity on how their newly launched Super Bowl event contracts align with U.S. derivatives regulations, according to Bloomberg . This heightened oversight comes on the heels of a Jan. 27 announcement in which the CFTC ’s leadership pledged to monitor emerging issues in the derivatives market, with event-based trading products falling squarely in their sights. Crypto.com, which operates a U.S.-based derivatives exchange, had notified the CFTC on Dec. 19 of its intent to launch Super Bowl-related contracts by Dec. 23. However, the short notice left regulators with minimal time to review the products ahead of the Christmas holiday and amid concerns over a possible government shutdown. Weeks later, the CFTC is now flexing its regulatory authority, requesting additional information from firms that self-certify their financial offerings. Under existing derivatives laws, firms that self-certify must demonstrate that their products are not easily manipulated and comply with U.S. regulations. While the CFTC’s review process does not grant it immediate power to halt trading, the agency can later issue bans or take enforcement action if concerns arise. A CFTC spokesperson confirmed, “We are continuing to review the contracts in accordance with our regulations,” while leaving the door open for potential enforcement or new rulemaking. Crypto.com remains firm in defending its stance. “We firmly believe in the legality of our event contracts and believe the CFTC is the appropriate regulator to bring federally regulated market integrity, manipulation controls, and product availability in all 50 states,” a company spokesperson told Bloomberg. Interestingly, Crypto.com had previously withdrawn two sports-related filings that were under regulatory scrutiny, later opting to self-certify a new contract targeting spectator sports and related industries. Meanwhile, Kalshi Inc. launched its “Kansas City vs. Philadelphia” Super Bowl market on Jan. 24, which has already seen trading volume climb to nearly $2.5 million as of Jan. 4. Additionally, the company introduced contracts allowing users to wager on brands likely to advertise during the Super Bowl, drawing more than $1.5 million in trading activity. Amid this, the broader prediction markets industry has seen volatility. During the 2024 U.S. presidential election cycle, Polymarket —the largest decentralized prediction market—processed more than $2.5 billion in bets, with election-related wagers leading the surge. You might also like: Singapore and CFTC zero in on Polymarket as wildfire bets fuel public outcry However, by January 2025, volumes dropped significantly to around $1.24 billion, reflecting a cooling interest after the election hype subsided. The CFTC’s ongoing review coincides with Robinhood Markets’ entry into event-based trading. On Feb. 3, Robinhood announced that it would enable its derivatives clients to trade sports event contracts through Kalshi’s exchange. “With an emerging asset class like event contracts, we recognize an opportunity to better serve our customers as their interests converge across the markets, news, sports, and entertainment,” Robinhood stated. While the agency can’t immediately halt trading of these contracts due to a mandatory 90-day review process, it retains the power to ban them later. With the Super Bowl set for Feb. 9, any decision will come after the event.

Sacks, who serves as the White House’s cryptocurrency advisor, will be joined by prominent figures, including Chairman Tim Scott, Chairman John Boozman, Chairman French Hill, and Chairman Thompson. The press conference, scheduled for 2:30 PM, is expected to bring critical discussions about the future of digital assets in the U.S. Key topics likely to be addressed include the potential for a Bitcoin reserve, a crypto stockpile, and updates on upcoming crypto legislation. With French Hill, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, present, there could also be insights into potential tax reforms impacting cryptocurrency transactions. Industry experts, like Perianne Boring of the Digital Chamber of Commerce, see this collaboration between Congress and the administration as a positive step toward a unified, pro-crypto stance. “Very good sign to see multiple congressional committees come together with the administration to deliver a unified message,” Boring stated, adding that big moves are on the horizon for crypto space. https://twitter.com/PerianneDC/status/1886487270925951039 The timing of the press conference aligns with growing optimism about the crypto market, especially as many analysts are predicting a rally into the second quarter of 2025. Bitcoin has rebounded after a major dip caused by tariff concerns, reaching $102,000 today. The tariff situation between Mexico and Canada has been pushed back 30 days, easing market fears. While the market is not completely out of danger, this recovery is a positive sign.

While major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain solid choices, their high prices make it challenging for smaller investors to gain exposure. That’s where presale tokens under $1 come in. These low-cost cryptos provide an opportunity to enter at a fraction of the price while still holding significant growth potential. Some of these projects bring game-changing innovations to blockchain technology, DeFi, gaming, and decentralized marketplaces. Among these, Web3Bay ($3BAY) stands out as one of the most exciting blockchain projects, transforming e-commerce through decentralization. Let’s explore the top seven new cryptocurrencies under $1 that could deliver massive gains in 2025. 1. Web3Bay ($3BAY) – The Future of Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is redefining online shopping by eliminating middlemen and putting buyers and sellers in full control. Unlike traditional marketplaces that charge hidden fees and dictate policies, Web3Bay is community-governed, allowing users to vote on platform decisions. Why Web3Bay Is a Game-Changer Decentralized Ownership – Web3Bay will renounce its smart contract after presale, meaning no single entity can control or manipulate the platform. Governance is fully handled through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Secure Transactions – Built on a Layer-1 blockchain, all transactions are tamper-proof and verifiable, ensuring complete trust and transparency. Passive Income & Staking Rewards – Users can stake their 3BAY tokens to earn passive income, helping secure the network while generating long-term returns. Massive Presale Growth – Web3Bay’s presale has already raised over $1 million, selling 257.7 million tokens in just a few stages. Current Price : $0.004562625 (Stage 4) Launch Price : $0.1959 ( 4,200% ROI potential ) 2. Pandana (PNDN) – The First Panda-Themed Meme Coin Pandana ($PNDN) is an emerging meme coin that has already raised $1 million in its presale. With a zero-fee model, investors only pay for tokens and network fees, making it one of the most cost-effective entries into the meme coin space. 🔹 Total Supply: 8 billion tokens 🔹 50% allocated to presale 🔹 No vesting period – Tokens are distributed within 48 hours Pandana’s smart contract is fully audited, ensuring security and trust. As meme coins continue to thrive, Pandana offers a fun yet lucrative opportunity for early adopters. 3. Solaxy (SOLX) – Solana’s First Layer-2 Scaling Solution Solaxy is Solana’s first Layer-2 blockchain, designed to enhance speed, lower gas fees, and increase scalability. As Solana’s adoption grows, the demand for efficient transaction solutions like Solaxy is skyrocketing. 🔹 Ethereum-Solana Bridge – Enables seamless transactions between both networks 🔹 Drastically reduces transaction fees 🔹 $16.3 million raised in presale With institutional investors eyeing Solana, Solaxy could become one of the most profitable Layer-2 solutions in the near future. 4. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – The ETF for Meme Coins Meme Index ($MEMEX) is an innovative crypto index fund for meme coins, allowing users to invest in baskets of top-performing tokens instead of picking individual ones. 🔹 DAO-governed – Holders vote on which meme coins enter the index 🔹 Staking rewards of up to 700% APY 🔹 $3M+ raised in presale For those who want exposure to the meme coin market with reduced risk, MEMEX offers a diversified approach. 5. The Last Dwarfs (TLD) – The Next Big GameFi Project With blockchain gaming booming, The Last Dwarfs is emerging as a major player by offering a fully decentralized gaming economy where players own all in-game assets. 🔹 Play-to-earn model – Players earn rewards while playing 🔹 Staking & governance options 🔹 Already attracted 300,000+ users With GameFi projected to surpass $60 billion by 2028, The Last Dwarfs could be one of the biggest gaming cryptos in 2025. Final Thoughts The crypto market is evolving fast, and low-cost presale tokens under $1 offer the best chance for exponential gains. While meme coins like Pandana and Meme Index capitalize on community hype, and Solaxy enhances Solana’s scalability, Web3Bay stands out as the most innovative project with real-world utility. As a decentralized e-commerce platform, Web3Bay eliminates middlemen, hidden fees, and centralized control, giving power back to users. Its staking rewards, smart contract renouncement, and strong presale growth position it as the next big cryptocurrency under $1.

The price is back above $2.65 and now faces hurdles near the $2.820 level. XRP price started a strong upward move above the $2.50 level. The price is now trading below $2.80 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2.420 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.820 resistance zone. XRP Price Recovers Over 25% XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.850 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined heavily below the $2.50 and $2.350 support levels. The bears even pushed it below $2.00. There was a sharp drop of over 25% and the price tested the $1.75 zone. A low was formed at $1.75 and the price recently started a sharp recovery wave. The bulls pumped the price above the $2.20 and $2.50 levels. There was a move above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.155 swing high to the $1.750 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2.420 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.80 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.80 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.820 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.155 swing high to the $1.750 low. The next resistance is $2.940. A clear move above the $2.940 resistance might send the price toward the $3.00 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.050 resistance or even $3.120 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.20. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.820 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.620 level. The next major support is near the $2.50 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.50 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.450 support. The next major support sits near the $2.350 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.

Let’s face it – the hype is real. Currently, the $RBLK coin is available for $0.052 and it’s reaching a new price of $0.065 when it hits stage 11. Meanwhile, Pepe Coin (PEPE) has built a name off meme culture, riding trends and staying relevant. Rollblock (RBLK) is aiming for the same kind of dominance but with real utility behind it. With huge presale momentum, a growing community, and a strong use case in crypto gambling, Rollblock is shaping up to be the hottest crypto of 2025. Rollblock is the New Hottest Crypto of 2025 Rollblock (RBLK) is blowing up, and for good reason. This Ethereum-based GambleFi project is shaking up the online casino world with fair, transparent gaming and huge rewards for investors. The Rollblock casino is packed with over 7,000 games and tons of sports betting options. You can bet with 20+ cryptos, meaning fast deposits, quick payouts, and no banking headaches. And since everything runs on-chain, every bet is publicly verifiable, so there’s no funny business – just fair play. But here’s where it gets even better: RBLK holders get paid. Rollblock shares a portion of casino profits with investors, offering up to 30% APY. On top of that, the project buys back and burns RBLK tokens, cutting supply and driving up the price. With crypto gambling booming and a market worth $540 billion, Rollblock is in the perfect spot to take off. That’s why investors have already poured in over$10 million – and this could just be the beginning. When we look at how other coins managed to pull their presales, Rollblock is doing amazingly well. PEPE Price Seems to Have a Hard Time As 2025 kicks off, PEPE is slowly losing its grip. The PEPE price has been dropping for a while, and in the last 30 days alone, it’s down 54%. Back in November’s bull run, PEPE saw a huge pump, but after that, it started slipping. It managed to jump 30% in December, giving holders some hope, but then January hit hard. PEPE crashed back down to its pre-bull run price, wiping out those gains. So, what’s going on? Culture and trends aren’t enough anymore for PEPE. In a crypto market packed with major events – from Trump’s inauguration to big moves in the crypto space – PEPE is struggling to keep up. And here’s the thing: everything is falling right now. But that might not be bad news. Historically, big market dips like this often signal a new bull run is coming. Could this be the setup for the next crypto explosion? Conclusion Rollblock (RBLK) is on fire, yeah – closing in on $10 million in presale, while PEPE struggles to stay relevant. Trends and memes can only go so far – real utility wins and Rollblock is proving it with 7,000+ games, on-chain betting, and a 30% APY for investors. With crypto markets shaky, all signs point to a new bull run, and Rollblock is positioned to explode. Investors aren’t waiting – they’re locking in RBLK now before prices skyrocket. Once the presale ends, this might be the last chance to buy low. Are you in? Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Meanwhile, PlutoChain , a Bitcoin Layer-2 solution, might advance scalability with AI-powered applications and 2-second block times. It also adds smart contracts to the BTC network which could boost its ecosystem and case uses. Here’s what’s fueling XRP’s breakout potential first. XRP Price Prediction – Can XRP Hit $6.35 in the 3rd Wave? XRP has been gaining traction, with Binance analysts eyeing a 285% surge that could push its price to $6.35. XRP’s use in cross-border transactions and growing integration into banking systems continue to boost demand. Financial institutions are increasingly adopting Ripple’s technology, which reinforces its position in the payment sector. TradingView data suggests a strong uptrend, with price consolidations setting up for a potential breakout. Binance analysts predict that if momentum continues, XRP could sustain its upward trajectory beyond $6.35, which could further solidify its role in institutional finance. However, market conditions and macroeconomic factors will play a key role in determining whether this bullish wave materializes. How PlutoChain Might Expand Bitcoin’s Scalability and Cross-Chain Functionality PlutoChain could reshape Bitcoin’s ecosystem with its advanced Layer-2 framework, and potentially deliver significant improvements in speed, efficiency, and interoperability. PlutoChain might open new doors for decentralized applications and financial systems by addressing Bitcoin’s inherent limitations. One of PlutoChain’s standout features is its high-speed processing capability. With 2-second block times and the ability to handle up to 43,200 transactions per day, it could significantly improve Bitcoin’s scalability. This advancement might reduce congestion and transaction delays, which could make Bitcoin more suitable for real-world applications beyond simple transfers. PlutoChain might bridge Bitcoin and Ethereum by offering full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. This feature allows Ethereum-based dApps and smart contracts to operate seamlessly within Bitcoin’s network. It could open the doors to a wide range of applications, from financial tools to NFT platforms, and potentially broaden Bitcoin’s functionality in ways previously limited by its original design. PlutoChain potentially enhances Bitcoin’s usability by integrating decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which could make it a more versatile blockchain for lending, staking, and decentralized trading. PlutoChain maintains a strong focus on security, undergoing extensive audits from industry-leading firms such as SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi.

Despite this partial recovery, the cryptocurrency remains down 5.8% over the past week and more than 13% below its all-time high of $109,000, reached in January. This recent price movement has led a CryptoQuant analyst to suggest that Bitcoin may be transitioning into a distribution cycle, a phase where price gains start to slow as supply shifts toward newer market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Is Trading In This Bearish Flag — What’s The Downside Target? Bitcoin Transitioning From Accumulation to Distribution The analyst known as Oinonen, discussed the current state of Bitcoin’s market cycle in a recent post titled “Entering the Distribution Cycle.” Oinonen noted that after gaining 129.2% over the past year and surpassing $100,000, Bitcoin might be nearing a “cycle top.” He cited comments from Ki Young Ju, who suggested that the market is in the “early distribution phase” and could potentially see a few more quarters of growth, influenced by retail investors entering the market and broader promotional efforts. Applying Dow Theory to Bitcoin’s recent market patterns, Oinonen explained that the cryptocurrency’s market movements can be divided into accumulation and distribution phases. He pointed out that while 2022 represented a clear distribution cycle, Bitcoin transitioned into an accumulation cycle in 2023, which extended through 2024. Now, as 2025 unfolds, Bitcoin appears to be shifting back into a distribution phase. Despite this shift, Oinonen emphasized that the market still has the potential for further price discovery, citing relatively low funding rates and a lack of overleveraged conditions. Price Supports and Future Outlook Oinonen also cited Axel Adler Jr, another market observer, who shared similar sentiments, noting that Bitcoin’s current market environment is not overheated and retains the potential for additional growth under stable macroeconomic conditions. This view is supported by the ongoing institutional demand reflected in MicroStrategy’s recent Bitcoin purchases. The company has continued its pro-cyclical acquisition strategy, adding 10,107 bitcoins in early 2025 and bringing its total holdings to 471,107 BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes $108K: Can Bulls Sustain Momentum Against Bearish Signals? This sustained institutional interest serves as a leading indicator of market confidence and highlights Bitcoin’s continued appeal as a long-term investment. Oinonen mentioned that as Bitcoin hovers near its “fair price” support level of $87,990—identified by its power-law fit—further developments should be watched out for. The analyst added: Despite the approaching distribution cycle, Bitcoin might still reach significantly higher spot price levels. Bitcoin’s funding rate is relatively low and comparable to summer 2024 levels. We’re far from an overleveraged market, and the structure supports further spot price discovery.

Not even close! But Remittix (RTX ) is making history. With a starting price of just $0.0539, it’s already setting records and exciting investors. Many believe it could grow fast and bring huge profits. Could this be the next big thing in crypto? Let’s find out! Will Dogecoin Bounce Back? Remittix Takes the Spotlight Drop about five percent and below the significant $0.35 support level, Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has had a wild ride. Although it is presently selling at $0.3241, Meme coin followers still hope it may have a huge comeback. Thanks in major part to Elon Musk’s immense enthusiasm and support, Dogecoin peaked at $0.737 in 2021. Although some analysts anticipate it might reach $1 by 2026, there are misgivings since DOGE lacks significant improvements. Meanwhile, a new star is rising, Remittix (RTX). Unlike Dogecoin, which struggles to regain its momentum, Remittix is skyrocketing. In just a short time, it has set mega records, reaching a price of $0.0498. Investors are buzzing with excitement because Remittix is growing at a pace that Dogecoin and PEPE never did in their opening weeks. Remittix is already on track for huge profits; some estimate 100X gains, while DOGE takes time to acquire traction. Dogecoin remains one of the strongest Meme coins but its growth might be slowing down. If it doesn’t break past $0.34 soon, it could drop to $0.26. Will Dogecoin surprise everyone with another massive rally, or will Remittix continue to dominate? Investors are watching closely! PEPE Struggles While Remittix Takes Off PEPE Coin had an incredible year, jumping by 1,321% and reaching $1.23. This huge growth was helped by getting listed on big exchanges like Coinbase and Robinhood, making it more popular. Meme coins like Pepe, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu rely on hype and internet fun but their prices can go up and down really fast. Recently, PEPE lost its spot as the third-largest Meme coin to a new TRUMP token, which quickly reached $10 billion in value. Although it is presently selling at $0.00001322, this shows how unpredictable Meme coins can be. While they are exciting, they can also be risky since their prices change so quickly. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) is growing at lightning speed. Unlike Pepe and Dogecoin, which took time to gain traction, Remittix set mega records in just its opening weeks. With its price now at $0.0521, many believe it could skyrocket even higher. While Meme coins struggle, Remittix is proving to be a stronger and more reliable choice for investors looking for massive gains! Remittix Is Growing Fast and Breaking Records A new cryptocurrency is making headlines Remittix (RTX). Unlike Meme coins like Dogecoin and Pepe, which depend on hype, Remittix is built for real-world use. It allows businesses and individuals to turn crypto into real money instantly without extra fees or delays. Right now, Remittix is increasing rapidly. In just its opening weeks, it has already set huge records, with investors rushing in. While other cryptos struggled to reach $10 million, Remittix is soaring past expectations. Its presale has raised millions and experts predict it could skyrocket 250x in value. What makes Remittix different is its PayFi system, which connects digital assets with real-world banking. This means businesses, freelancers, and everyday users can easily spend their crypto like cash. It also passed a strict smart contract audit, proving it is safe and reliable. With its rapid growth and strong real-world use, Remittix is quickly becoming one of the most exciting new cryptos. Many believe it could overtake the biggest names in the market very soon!

This milestone highlights Bitcoin’s increasing market share , as investors move away from altcoins amid ongoing economic uncertainties. Key Bitcoin Dominance Statistics: Current Bitcoin dominance: ~64% Highest level since: February 2021 Altcoin market share: Declining as BTC consolidates its lead Bitcoin’s dominance metric measures its share of the total crypto market capitalization , signaling whether investors are favoring BTC over alternative cryptocurrencies. Why Is Bitcoin Dominance Rising? Several factors are contributing to Bitcoin’s growing dominance in the crypto market : 1. Increased Institutional Investment in Bitcoin Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale are driving institutional demand. Traditional finance firms view BTC as a store of value over altcoins. 2. Altcoin Struggles & Market Corrections Many altcoins have underperformed compared to Bitcoin. Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP have seen price corrections, leading traders to shift back to BTC. 3. Bitcoin’s Stability in Uncertain Economic Conditions Global macroeconomic uncertainties (such as interest rate concerns and trade tariffs) have strengthened BTC’s appeal. Investors consider Bitcoin a safer long-term asset compared to high-risk altcoins. What This Means for the Crypto Market Bullish for Bitcoin A dominance above 60% often signals strong Bitcoin performance . BTC could see continued capital inflows as altcoins remain volatile. Bearish for Altcoins? Historically, high Bitcoin dominance leads to an “Altcoin Season” only after BTC stabilizes . If BTC dominance continues rising, altcoins may face further corrections . Potential Market Scenarios If BTC dominance stabilizes , altcoins may start recovering. If BTC dominance keeps climbing , altcoins could see prolonged underperformance. Conclusion Bitcoin’s dominance surpassing 64% signals a major shift in market sentiment, with investors prioritizing BTC over altcoins . With institutional adoption rising and macro uncertainty persisting , Bitcoin remains the preferred asset in the crypto space. As BTC dominance reaches levels not seen since 2021 , traders should monitor whether altcoins can regain momentum or if Bitcoin continues its path toward further dominance.

This marks a notable shift from Trump’s previous calls for aggressive rate reductions. “I’m not surprised,” Trump stated. “ Holding the rates at this point was the right thing to do. ” His comments come just a week after his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos , where he urged the Fed to lower rates to boost economic growth. Despite his past criticism of the central bank, Trump’s recent remarks suggest a more measured stance on monetary policy . Why Did the Fed Pause Rate Cuts? The Federal Reserve decided to maintain interest rates due to several key economic factors: 1. Inflation Concerns Core inflation remains above target , prompting caution on further rate cuts. The Fed is balancing economic growth and inflation control . 2. Labor Market Resilience Despite global uncertainties, U.S. job data remains strong . The Fed sees no immediate need for additional stimulus . 3. Financial Market Stability Cutting rates further could overheat asset markets . The Fed aims to avoid excessive speculation in stocks and real estate. Trump’s endorsement of the Fed’s decision signals a strategic shift , as he had previously advocated for aggressive monetary easing. Trump’s Evolving Stance on the Federal Reserve Trump has been a consistent critic of the Federal Reserve , often pushing for lower interest rates to spur economic growth. Key Moments in Trump’s Criticism of the Fed: 2019-2020: He repeatedly urged the Fed to cut rates to near-zero . Davos 2025: Advocated for rate cuts just a week before the Fed’s decision . February 2025: Now supports the Fed’s decision to hold rates steady . Trump has also suggested changes to the Fed’s policies , including the controversial idea that the U.S. president should have input on rate decisions . What This Means for the Economy & Markets 1. Signals Stability for Investors Markets often react strongly to monetary policy shifts . Trump’s support for the Fed’s decision may ease volatility . 2. No Immediate Rate Cuts for Borrowers Mortgage rates, loans, and credit costs may not decline further . Businesses may need to adjust borrowing strategies . 3. Political Implications for the Fed’s Independence Trump’s past criticism of the Fed raised concerns over political interference. His new stance could indicate a more balanced relationship with the central bank . Conclusion President Trump’s support for the Fed’s rate pause marks a significant shift in his economic stance. While he has historically demanded lower rates , his recent comments suggest a more cautious approach toward monetary policy. With the Federal Reserve focused on inflation control and economic stability , markets will closely watch whether Trump continues to support their decisions—or returns to advocating for aggressive rate cuts.

This increase in bearish sentiment is attributed to recent U.S. tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China , which could drive inflation higher and weaken crypto market sentiment . Additionally, Bitcoin appears to be forming a double-top reversal pattern , which could signal a further price correction. Why Is Bitcoin Facing Increased Downside Risk? Several key factors are contributing to Bitcoin’s increased risk of decline : 1. Rising U.S. Tariffs and Inflation Concerns The U.S. imposed new tariffs on key trade partners, raising economic uncertainty . Higher inflation risks could lead to stricter Federal Reserve policies , impacting risk assets like Bitcoin. 2. Bearish Options Market Data Deribit’s Bitcoin options market suggests a growing probability of BTC dropping to $75K . Put options (bearish bets) have gained popularity as traders hedge against downside risk. 3. Technical Analysis: Double-Top Reversal Pattern Bitcoin’s recent price movement resembles a double-top , a bearish chart pattern. If BTC fails to hold support above $80K , a drop toward $75K becomes more likely. Will Bitcoin Drop to $75K or Recover? Bearish Scenario (BTC Falls to $75K) Continued macroeconomic uncertainty leads to risk-off sentiment. BTC loses key support levels , confirming a reversal. Options market data suggests a growing probability of a decline. Bullish Scenario (BTC Holds Above $80K & Rallies) Strong buying pressure prevents BTC from breaking key support. Institutional demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs offsets selling pressure. Macroeconomic conditions stabilize, improving market sentiment. Currently, Bitcoin remains at a critical juncture , and the next few weeks will be decisive for its short-term trajectory. Conclusion With Bitcoin’s probability of falling to $75K rising to 22% , traders should monitor market sentiment, options activity, and key support levels . U.S. tariffs, inflation risks, and technical chart patterns could contribute to further downside, but strong institutional demand may help stabilize prices.

Why Did Crypto Liquidations Surge? Several factors contributed to this mass liquidation event : 1.

BTC dominance surged , indicating a shift from altcoins to Bitcoin. 3. High Leverage & Risky Trading Strategies Many traders were using high leverage , leading to forced liquidations when prices moved unexpectedly. Crypto exchanges auto-liquidated positions , further accelerating market losses. How Does This Compare to Past Liquidation Events?

ADA is now correcting losses and struggling to clear the $0.80 resistance. ADA price started a fresh decline from the $0.9250 zone. The price is trading below $0.850 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.8050 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

Bitcoin (BTC) fell 10% to $91,500 . Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) experienced steeper declines . However, analysts at Bernstein argue that while tariffs initially caused a risk-off sentiment , Bitcoin is likely to recover and trade based on its fundamentals once the market stabilizes. Why Analysts Believe Trump’s Tariffs Could Boost Bitcoin 1. Bitcoin’s Long-Term Fundamentals Remain Strong Bernstein maintains its $200K BTC price target for 2025 . Institutional adoption and spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to drive demand. U.S. financial institutions could soon offer crypto custody , following regulatory shifts. 2. Tariffs Could Weaken the U.S. Dollar According to Bitwise’s Jeff Park , Trump’s tariffs are: A strict move to weaken the U.S. dollar . Likely to lower long-term interest rates . Could drive Bitcoin higher as an inflation hedge . Historically, Bitcoin has benefited from monetary policy uncertainty , similar to gold and other alternative assets . 3. Institutional Investors Continue to Accumulate BTC Despite short-term volatility, institutions are increasing Bitcoin exposure . Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen consistent inflows , reinforcing long-term bullish sentiment . Risks: Could Prolonged Tariffs Hurt Crypto? Bearish Arguments from Other Analysts: Extended tariffs could harm the U.S. economy , reducing risk appetite. A prolonged economic slowdown could lead to lower crypto demand . If Bitcoin remains correlated with stocks, it could face further downside volatility . Bullish Scenario: If the U.S. dollar weakens, Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative could strengthen. Institutional adoption, combined with monetary policy shifts , may fuel BTC’s long-term growth. Conclusion While Trump’s tariff policies initially caused Bitcoin to drop , analysts at Bernstein and Bitwise believe that long-term fundamentals remain strong , and the U.S. dollar’s weakening could ultimately boost BTC prices . With institutional interest rising and Bitcoin ETFs expanding , BTC remains positioned for potential long-term gains , despite short-term market uncertainty .

The US President also signed an executive order exploring a US sovereign wealth fund. This started speculation about potential Bitcoin investments, especially after a social media post from Senator Cynthia Lummis. Additionally, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was appointed acting director of the CFPB after Trump removed Rohit Chopra. For now, the reasons behind Bessent’s temporary leadership of the CFPB is still unclear. Trump now has a number of his preferred candidates leading major US financial regulatory bodies. Trump Pauses Tariffs on Canada and Mexico The cryptocurrency market experienced a sharp rebound after an announcement by US President Donald Trump that proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico would be temporarily paused. The move came after discussions with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who confirmed in a statement on X that the 25% tariffs will be on hold for at least 30 days. Trudeau also shared Canada’s plans to improve cooperation with the United States by implementing a $1.3 billion border security plan, which includes the appointment of a Fentanyl czar, classifying cartels as terrorist organizations, and reinforcing the US-Canada border with helicopters and more personnel. Mexico’s tariffs have also been delayed for a month. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that both governments reached a series of agreements, including reinforcing the shared land border while simultaneously working on trade and security concerns. Despite the pause, Trump told Bloomberg TV that negotiations are still ongoing and tariffs could still be imposed if agreements were not finalized. Meanwhile, the executive order issued on Feb. 1 that imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada also included a 10% tariff on China, which is still in effect. A Wall Street Journal report suggested that China’s government is willing to negotiate, with its initial proposal reportedly centered on restoring the Phase 1 trade deal from 2020. This trade deal committed Beijing to increasing its purchases of US exports by $200 billion over two years. On the crypto-based prediction market Polymarket, traders placed odds of 24% that Trump will completely remove the tariff on Mexico before March and a 21% chance that Canada’s tariffs will be revoked. China, however, has only a 7% probability of seeing its tariffs lifted next month. Mexico tariff removal odds (Source: Polymarket ) The crypto market saw very large losses just a day before, when Trump first announced the proposed tariffs on goods from China, Mexico, and Canada. In fact, the announcement led to an estimated $10 billion worth of liquidations. However, after the announcements from world leaders regarding the tariff pause, the market was able to recover. Bitcoin surged past the $100,000 mark, reaching $101,007 after plummeting to a low of $92,000 the previous day, according to CoinMarketCap . Ethereum also saw a bounce to $2,809 after dropping to $2,451 on Feb. 2. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reflected this shift in sentiment by moving into the ”greed” territory with a score of 72. Trump’s Sovereign Wealth Fund Sparks Bitcoin Speculation President Donald Trump also recently signed an executive order directing the government to explore the creation of a sovereign wealth fund. Naturally, this move sparked speculation about potential Bitcoin investments by the US government. During a press event in the Oval Office on Feb. 3, Trump tasked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick with starting the process, and stated that the fund will aim to ”monetize the asset side of the US balance sheet.” Bessent confirmed that the executive order will be enacted within the next 12 months. Trump signing EOs in the Oval Office While Trump and his officials did not explicitly mention cryptocurrencies as part of the fund’s investment strategy, they suggested the government could buy TikTok, which is still under a lot of pressure due to a law requiring its parent company, ByteDance, to divest its US operations or face a potential ban. However, speculation around Bitcoin involvement heated up after Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis hinted on social media that the sovereign wealth fund could be used to buy BTC. Bitcoin advocate Wayne Vaughan also suggested that Bessent and Lutnick might consider allocating part of the fund to crypto. So far, Trump’s executive orders have faced very quick legal challenges since he took office on Jan 20. Some of his actions have already been blocked by courts, including an order trying to revoke birthright citizenship, which a federal judge deemed unconstitutional. His recent executive actions on cryptocurrency have also stirred some debate. On Jan. 23, Trump signed an order establishing a crypto working group while banning the development of a US central bank digital currency (CBDC), though legal experts have questioned the enforceability of this. Trump Appoints Treasury Secretary as CFPB Acting Head US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who was confirmed by the Senate less than a week ago, will also serve as the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) after an order from President Donald Trump. The decision was made after Trump removed former CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, who had urged his successor to continue investigations into Big Tech and Wall Street firms. The reason behind Bessent’s temporary leadership of the CFPB is still unclear. This is especially interesting as he just took on the role of overseeing one of the country’s largest financial departments. Statement from the CFPB Before his confirmation, Bessent aligned himself with the administration’s stance on financial regulations, including opposing the creation of a US central bank digital currency. The Trump administration has been reportedly looking for ways to limit the regulatory reach of agencies overseeing banks, and Tesla CEO and unofficial presidential adviser Elon Musk advocated for the elimination of the CFPB altogether. Additionally, Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 instructing all government agencies to pause proposed rules. This directive could greatly impact regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the CFPB. With Chopra’s removal, Trump now has several of his preferred candidates leading major US financial regulatory bodies. SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda is currently acting chair while the Senate considers Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins for the role. CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham also replaced Rostin Behnam as acting chair on the day of Trump’s inauguration. The CFPB is currently facing legal challenges over its regulatory authority. Technology trade groups TechNet and NetChoice filed a lawsuit against the bureau’s rule that seeks to regulate payment apps and digital wallets in the same way as traditional banks. The rule was finalized in November of 2024, and it seems to exclude crypto wallets and only applies to transactions that are conducted in US dollars.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|MARKET|ASIA|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-04 05:16:53

A report from Blockworks on Monday alleged that representatives from WLFI had pitched protocol teams on a deal to get included in the project’s treasury. The deal was they could buy $10 million WLFI tokens plus a 10 percent fee, and WLFI will purchase the same amount of their protocol’s tokens. “There is no token swap agreement,” a spokesperson from TRON told CoinDesk. TRON’s TRX is the second largest holding in WLFI’s wallet, according to on-chain data curated by Arkham. The WLFI wallet currently holds 40.7 million TRX worth $9.3 million. WLFI made these buys in tranches throughout January . Movement Labs, which saw its MOVE token jump in late January when WLFI purchased $2 million of it, and rumors swirled that the team was in discussion with Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, also denied that there was a swap agreement in place. Rushi Manche, co-founder of Movement Labs, told CoinDesk earlier that they did not send tokens to anyone including WLFI. ""There weren't any deals — any back door deals.

The image accompanying the post displays an order book where one trader has listed XRP at this significantly high price, far above its current trading value of $2.61. The image shows over 288,000 XRP for sale at that price, and this revelation has ignited speculation within the XRP community regarding the trader’s reasoning and expectations for the asset’s future price movement.

What on Earth does this cat know is coming? pic.twitter.com/kaCFlgbrp8 — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) February 3, 2025 Community Reactions And Speculation The post quickly gained traction, with several users responding with their price targets and expectations. One user commented , “My sell order is 9.90,” while another suggested that the $13 target is low, stating , “Needs to change that to $30.” Prominent crypto analysts have set targets around the $13 level , and the community has shown optimism for this lofty target. Some considered it a realistic expectation, with one commenter stating , “Sounds about right for this cycle.” Other traders appeared to take inspiration from the move, adjusting their strategies accordingly. One user shared , “I also now have a sell order at 12.50. I ain’t trying to be greedy!” Meanwhile, another added a more cautious perspective, noting that the trader behind the $13 sell order is likely making an optimistic bet. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Is A $13 Target Realistic? The general sentiment among the commenters is optimistic. It is also likely that this sell order is old. As one commenter pointed out , crypto exchanges no longer allow sell orders this high, suggesting that whoever placed it is a long-time believer in XRP’s potential. XRP has seen significant volatility over time, with periods of rapid price increases followed by corrections. The token has faced regulatory challenges and strong institutional interest, pushing it in different directions. However, this has not shaken the confidence of its loyal community, with community members frequently speculating on even higher targets . It is not uncommon for traders to place high sell orders as part of long-term strategies. These orders can serve as safety measures in case of unexpected price spikes or news-driven movements. Given the history of crypto markets, sudden price surges are not impossible, and XRP has experienced its fair share. As one expert said in 2024 when XRP moves, it moves fast and aggressively, and this sell order could be in anticipation of these fast movements.

Coinbase received approval from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), making it the country’s largest registered crypto exchange, while Kraken acquired a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) license in the European Union, allowing it to offer crypto derivatives trading. These regulatory milestones come as both exchanges continue to expand internationally amid evolving compliance frameworks in the UK and EU, signaling growing institutionalization and mainstream acceptance of digital assets. Coinbase Secures FCA Approval, Strengthening Its Position in the UK Crypto Market Coinbase has received approval from the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as a registered virtual asset service provider (VASP). This regulatory greenlight cements the exchange’s status as the largest FCA-registered crypto exchange in the country and significantly expands its ability to serve both retail and institutional customers in one of its most important international markets. The FCA’s approval , announced by Coinbase in a Feb. 3 press release, enables the Nasdaq-listed exchange to offer crypto-to-fiat services in the UK, a country that has rapidly grown into its largest market outside the United States. This latest development further solidifies Coinbase’s presence in Europe and strengthens its foothold in one of the world's leading financial hubs. The FCA’s decision marks the first registration of a crypto asset firm in 2025, following GSR Markets’ approval in December 2024. It also comes at a time when the UK is aggressively positioning itself as a global hub for digital assets, with plans to roll out a comprehensive regulatory framework by 2026. The UK government, under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, has been increasingly vocal about its commitment to fostering innovation in the blockchain and crypto industry. The FCA’s approval of Coinbase signals a willingness to embrace digital assets, providing regulatory clarity that could further boost institutional participation in the sector. A recent FCA survey conducted in November 2024 found that 12% of UK adults now own cryptocurrencies, a notable increase from 10% in the previous year. Additionally, the average investment per individual rose from £1,595 ($1,964) to £1,842 ($2,268), indicating growing confidence in digital assets among retail investors. Coinbase’s regulatory success in the UK follows a challenging period with the FCA, which had previously investigated Coinbase Payments for compliance breaches. The exchange faced scrutiny over unintentional violations of a 2020 voluntary agreement, primarily linked to onboarding high-risk customers. This led to a £3.5 million ($4.3 million) fine, but the firm has since taken corrective measures, strengthening its compliance framework and improving risk management protocols. Beyond the UK, Coinbase has been actively expanding its European operations, with registrations in key markets such as Ireland and Germany. Its Irish entity is also registered as a crypto service provider in the Netherlands and Italy, further reinforcing its position in the European Union. The exchange's ambitions, however, extend beyond Europe and into Southeast Asia, a rapidly growing digital asset market. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong met with Philippine Finance Secretary Ralph Recto to explore potential market entry into the Philippines. This move aligns with Coinbase’s broader Asia-Pacific expansion strategy, which already includes regulatory approval in Singapore (secured in October 2023). Coinbase has also been actively supporting developer initiatives in the Philippines and Thailand, focusing on local stablecoin development and financial inclusion. The company recently commissioned a report on cryptocurrency adoption in five Southeast Asian countries, reflecting its growing interest in shaping financial infrastructure in the region. Coinbase’s Role in Shaping Global Crypto Regulation Coinbase’s FCA approval not only strengthens its business but also sends a strong message about regulatory acceptance of crypto firms that adhere to compliance standards. With governments worldwide tightening crypto regulations, Coinbase’s ability to navigate regulatory landscapes gives it a competitive edge over less compliant counterparts. The move also reinforces the UK’s ambitions of becoming a global leader in cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation. As the country moves toward a full regulatory framework by 2026, firms like Coinbase will play a crucial role in shaping industry standards and fostering responsible crypto adoption. Coinbase’s approval by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority marks a significant milestone for both the exchange and the country’s crypto industry. With the UK emerging as a key player in the global digital asset space, Coinbase is well-positioned to drive adoption, enhance crypto-fiat services, and play an influential role in shaping the future of crypto regulation. As the UK pushes forward with its vision of becoming a global crypto hub, Coinbase’s presence will likely attract more institutional investors, boost market confidence, and set a precedent for other exchanges seeking regulatory approval. With expansion plans spanning Europe and Southeast Asia, Coinbase’s latest milestone could be just the beginning of a new era of global crypto adoption and integration into traditional financial systems. Kraken Secures MiFID License, Expanding Crypto Derivatives Trading in the EU In realted news, US-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has successfully acquired a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) license for the European Union, marking a significant step in its global expansion. This approval, obtained through the acquisition of a Cypriot investment firm recently approved by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC), allows Kraken to offer derivatives trading services across the EU. Founded in 2011, Kraken has been rapidly expanding its European footprint over the past two years. The exchange has secured regulatory approvals in Spain and Ireland, introduced Kraken Custody services in the UK, and acquired a Dutch crypto broker in September 2024. With the EU crypto market projected to grow by 15% annually until 2030, Kraken’s latest licensing effort is a strategic move to capitalize on the region’s burgeoning demand for advanced trading products. According to Kraken’s Feb. 3 blog post, the exchange described Europe as one of the most active regions for crypto derivatives trading, further emphasizing the increasing appetite for futures and options products. By entering the EU derivatives space, Kraken will be competing with major platforms such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, Backpack, and D2X, all of which are either already offering or planning to roll out derivatives trading products. Crypto derivatives—financial contracts such as futures and options based on the price of an underlying crypto asset—are primarily aimed at experienced traders. These products allow traders to hedge against market volatility or speculate on price movements, but they also carry significant risks due to the highly volatile nature of crypto markets. Kraken’s acquisition of a MiFID license means that it can now legally offer these complex financial instruments across the European Economic Area (EEA), further diversifying its services beyond spot trading. Kraken’s expansion comes amid Europe’s efforts to introduce a comprehensive regulatory framework for the crypto industry. The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, set to be fully implemented by 2026, aims to establish clear compliance standards for crypto businesses operating within the region. MiCA addresses key areas such as: Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance Token issuance guidelines Stablecoin-specific rules Consumer protection measures Several global crypto entities, including Crypto.com and OKX, have already secured MiCA-specific licenses, signaling the growing importance of regulatory compliance in the EU. Kraken’s MiFID approval ensures that it remains well-positioned to adapt to these evolving regulatory requirements. Strategic Growth Amid Regulatory Challenges Kraken has been actively navigating complex regulatory environments across multiple jurisdictions. In the United States, the exchange recently made headlines for reintroducing its staking program, two years after it was forced to shut it down following a legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite regulatory hurdles, Kraken has more than doubled its revenue in 2024, reaching $1.5 billion, according to a recent report. The acquisition of a MiFID license aligns with Kraken’s broader global strategy of diversifying its revenue streams and expanding into high-growth markets. By leveraging Europe’s strong demand for derivatives products, Kraken is positioning itself as a major player in institutional-grade crypto trading. Kraken’s successful bid for a MiFID license in the European Union marks a major milestone in its global expansion. With the EU crypto market heating up and regulations becoming more structured under MiCA, securing this license provides Kraken with a significant competitive advantage. As Europe continues to shape the future of crypto regulation, Kraken is making the necessary moves to align with compliance standards while tapping into the region’s growing demand for sophisticated trading instruments. With competition intensifying in the derivatives space, Kraken’s entrance into the market will likely drive greater innovation and liquidity, benefiting both retail and institutional traders across the EU.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-04 05:30:00

Remittix Leads Top Gaining Cryptos In 2025",https://timestabloid.com/will-ethereum-reach-4000-in-february-remittix-leads-top-gaining/,"Growing acceptance and institutional buying is helping Ethereum to gather momentum. Analysts wonder if ETH will reach $4,000 in February 2025. There are several factors that could drive Ethereum’s potential breakout. On the other hand, Remittix (RTX) is gearing up to become one of the top gaining cryptos in 2025. Remittix’s innovative PayFi mechanism and anticipated token presale are making it a popular choice for developers. Several Factors Are Set To Drive Ethereum’s Rally to $4,000 In February The market sentiment still stands with an Ethereum price change to $4,000 in February. To increase its efficiency, Ethereum as a chain has been experiencing notable developments. These improvements enable its relevance in the crypto domain. Also notable is Ethereum 2.0’s change to proof-of-stake. It basically indicates quicker and more effective transactions. Other factors driving Ethereum’s price surge include the revival of the larger crypto market and growing institutional interest in Ethereum. There is also the development of Ethereum-based financial instruments like ETFs. Should these developments move forward without hiccups, the Ethereum price movement could create a new February high. Remittix Set To Become One of The Top Cryptocurrencies In 2025 Among the most promising new cryptocurrencies, Remittix (RTX) stands out for its emphasis on utility-driven businesses that have the potential to disrupt established markets. Remittix, which combines cutting-edge blockchain technology with traditional banking operations, promises to address inefficiencies in the $180 trillion worldwide money transfer sector.

Remittix enables retailers to better manage their digital assets, setting the groundwork for a more accessible and adaptive financial environment.

Remittix simplifies international commerce by supporting over 30 FIAT currencies and 50 major altcoins.

A game changer in the payments industry, where shady practices are all too common, Remittix’s technology ensures that the recipient receives the full amount intended.

Journalists, politicians, artists and others can all move the needle, but quantitative analysts remain a big deal. Let’s find out what they saw in Toncoin and Solana that they now see in 1FUEL . Toncoin (TON): A Jewel In The Libertarian Blockchain Segment When Toncoin had just come onto the scene in late August 2021, it nearly doubled its price in under two weeks. This caught the attention of many quantitative analysts, who started predicting good things for the project. Indeed, by mid-November of 2021, Toncoin had done a near 9X move, proving them right. The Toncoin team then rolled out a series of crucial developments which saw the coin reach an all-time high in mid-2024. This shows that these quantitative analysts weren’t only right about Toncoin’s short-term potential. They already saw that the Toncoin team and project would keep excelling years later. Solana (SOL): A Supersonic Transaction Vehicle Solana price action had a similar trajectory but with more insane gains (200X in under two years). This is the kind of thing people would expect to never happen again when the Solana price crashed from $249 to about $10 in roughly a year and a month. Devastating, right? Solana eventually redeemed itself, surpassing its all-time high in about two years and a month. This proves that the quantitative analysts who saw Solana as a special coin weren’t hallucinating. They saw what many others would only see much later. Now, let’s understand why they see similarities in a new project. 1FUEL (OFT): A Transcendent Force In Decentralized Trading 1FUEL will offer a crypto exchange and wallet with a comprehensive and unmatched trading experience. Firstly, users will get to trade across different chains, unlocking liquidity and accessing new opportunities previously hard to access. Secondly, 1FUEL users will be able to trade directly with preferred parties thanks to P2P exchange features. Thirdly, 1FUEL will offer AI-powered features that can continuously learn and refine your trading strategies to maximize your profit with minimal manual input from you. This will increase market efficiency, capital mobility and transaction volume, generating more income through trading fees. Lastly, 1FUEL will take security to the next level with built-in mixing capabilities that conceal your transaction paths, denying watchful eyes a competitive edge. It will also offer military-grade cold storage to secure inactive coins in an offline state where hackers and scammers can’t reach them. Why You Should Join The 1FUEL presale 1FUEL has only 28.1% of tokens left in stage three of its presale, meaning your chances of getting them at the low price of $0.017 per token are almost vanishing. Remember, the 20% bonus on all purchases could also disappear if you don’t act fast. Conclusion: Will 1FUEL Surpass What Toncoin And Solana Have Achieved? 1FUEL can outdo these two projects in a much shorter time. This is primarily because, unlike earlier when the quantitative analysts hyping coins were insignificant, there’s proof now. They’ve called it right on no less than two occasions, meaning there’s a pattern. This will encourage many investors to flood into the 1FUEL market, so get your presale tokens quickly before prices leave you behind.

The price is currently trading above the $2.50 level and is now aiming to break above the $3 mark once again. Bitcoin also rose above the $100k mark and is currently trading at crucial support levels. The XRP price had reached its key support area between $2.13 and $2.22 on the 4-day chart, triggering a bearish reaction. This level is crucial for distinguishing bullish momentum from bearish trends. The market has bounced back from this level, and the outlook remains positive, with potential targets at $4.19, $5, and possibly even $6.62 in the coming wave. However, on the weekly chart, XRP is still down by more than 18%. Small-Time Frame Breakdown: A Temporary Setback On the smaller time frame, XRP briefly broke below the $2.64 swing low, invalidating a previous bullish pattern. However, the alternative Elliott Wave count is now leading, and the price found support around the $2.72 to $2.22 zone. A crucial level to watch moving forward is the $2.96 mark, which has provided support in recent moves above $3. The price is currently recovering, but the next corrective pullback will determine if the upward trend can continue. Key Levels and Next Steps for XRP To confirm further upside potential, XRP needs to maintain support above $1.90, which represents the 78.6% retracement level. There are two potential pathways for XRP: either a direct breakout or an extended wave four, which could lead to further upside. As the market remains volatile, it’s important to monitor the next pullback closely. If the pullback is corrective, it could signal a continuation of the bullish trend.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-04 05:53:50

It is on the path to recovery from a crash to $2,260 on Monday following President Donald Trump’s imposition of trade tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. Some of those tariffs have since been suspended , resulting in a crypto market recovery. ETH prices were also boosted by Eric Trump, who said, “In my opinion, it’s a great time to add ETH” on X. However, most of the respondents mocked the comment or posted tribal FUD. “Trump nuked ETH and then his son saves it.

This means that the ETH/BTC ratio is still around its weakest level since December 2020 at 0.028, according to Tradingview. Ethereum prices have been eroded in terms of BTC for the past two and a half years as the asset remains depressed in terms of market sentiment. “No one should freak out if we get a red daily candle now.

U.S. prosecutors revealed that he targeted Indexed Finance in 2021 and KyberSwap in 2023. Meanwhile, he has been on the run from authorities since 2021. Mastermind Behind $65 Million Exploits A U.S. court in Brooklyn has officially charged Andean Medjedovic with wire fraud, computer hacking, and attempted extortion. He is accused of stealing around $65 million in cryptocurrency by exploiting weaknesses in crypto platforms. Prosecutors say Andean Medjedovic borrowed a large number of tokens, manipulated prices through trades, and then took the tokens to make a profit, cheating investors. By exploiting vulnerabilities in the smart contracts that facilitate transactions, he was able to drain $49 million from KyberSwap and $16 million from Indexed Finance. John Durham, acting U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, warned that individuals who misuse technology to deceive investors will be pursued, no matter where they operate. On the Run Since 2021 Medjedovic, who was once a promising master’s student at the University of Waterloo, has been evading authorities since 2021. Canadian courts had already charged him for the Indexed Finance hack, with one judge acknowledging his “formidable mathematical powers” in orchestrating the theft. His digital footprint suggests he sees himself as a “pirate” who operates in a legal gray area. Despite being wanted in Canada, he remained active in the crypto space and, according to the complaint, even attempted to negotiate control over KyberSwap in exchange for returning part of the stolen funds. Crypto Crimes on the Rise The crypto world has seen a surge in financial crimes. Just last year, two men were charged with stealing $230 million in digital assets and spending lavishly in Los Angeles and Miami. Additionally, the founder of a French crypto company was kidnapped and held for ransom before being released.

Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin, is being called the next big opportunity for exponential growth. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Ultimate Choice 1. A Fresh Entrant With Massive Potential: As a newly launched coin, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors the chance to enter at the ground floor. Its early-stage momentum makes it one of the most promising opportunities to achieve life-changing gains. 2. Record-Breaking Presale Success: Raising $1 million almost instantly, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven itself as a high-demand asset. This presale success has cemented its place as a token with unmatched growth potential. 3. Exclusivity That Drives Demand: Unlike ETH, MATIC, or APT, which are widely traded on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity creates urgency and scarcity, increasing its value to early adopters. How It Stands Up Against Competitors XRP: A leader in payments, but it no longer offers the early-stage returns seen with this new coin. Solana (SOL): Strong in scalability but can’t match the momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Optimism (OP): A rising Layer-2 solution but lacks the excitement surrounding this token. SEI: Innovative but doesn’t have the same presale success or exclusivity.

Late on Monday, President Donald Trump agreed to “immediately pause” tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a month following successful negotiations with their respective leaders. Markets are also growing more optimistic that the U.S. and China could reach a deal to avert the 10% tariffs on Chinese imports set to take effect later today. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.76% to around 39,150, while the broader Topix Index rose 1.4% to 2,757 on Tuesday, recouping some of the losses from the previous session. The Japanese yen fell past 155 per dollar on Tuesday, struggling to regain momentum as the suspension of U.S. tariffs on Mexico and Canada reduced demand for the safe-haven currency. Investors are also looking ahead to Wednesday’s release of Japan’s latest wage figures, which could influence the outlook for Bank of Japan monetary policy. China ( SHCOMP ) flat, the offshore yuan held steady around 7.30 per dollar, after recovering from a record low overnight, driven by optimism about a possible trade deal to avoid 10% tariffs on Chinese goods. US President Donald Trump is reportedly set to speak with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, as soon as this week, as the two largest economies are working toward a deal to avoid broader trade tensions, according to the White House. Investors are now eyeing upcoming additional PMI data and inflation figures next week. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 1.71% to a near 8-week high of 20,674 during the Tuesday morning session, following a muted close the prior day. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.50% to 77,684, while the Nifty 50 was above 23,500 in Tuesday morning trade, mainly supported by gains in metals, oil & gas, banking, and tech sectors. The RBI interest rate decision, which will be announced later this week, also lifted sentiment, with the market expecting the central bank to cut rates by 25 bps amid a slowdown in GDP growth. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.06% to rise above 8,430 on Tuesday, recovering some losses from the previous session. The Australian dollar stabilized above $0.62 on Tuesday, recovering from multi-year lows reached in the previous session. In Australia, investors are awaiting December trade figures, due on Thursday, to assess the strength of the country’s export-driven economy. In the U.S., on Monday, all three major indexes ended in red , markets pared some losses after Trump said the US would delay tariffs on Mexican imports by a month following a call with Mexico’s President. U.S. stock futures climbed on Tuesday after President Donald Trump postponed planned tariffs on goods from Canada, echoing the reprieve given to Mexico just hours earlier: Dow -0.30% ; S&P 500 -0.36% ; Nasdaq -0.51% . Investors are now focused on upcoming earnings reports from major companies like Alphabet, AMD, and PayPal on Tuesday.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is probing the Super Bowl events contracts on Crypto.com and Kalshi, according to a Bloomberg report . ""If sports does not constitute gaming, then, given the CFTC’s current legal posture, the CFTC likely does not have the power to prohibit Crypto.com and Kalshi from self-certifying these contracts,"" Brogan told CoinDesk. However, all of this is a bit more complicated than it seems on the surface. ""This is a surprisingly thorny question, which was addressed in the Kalshi ruling,"" Brogan said, referring to the ruling from last fall that allowed Kalshi to move forward with its election betting contracts by confirming that they do not fall under the CFTC’s restricted categories. Brogan explained that the Judge in that ruling defined ""gaming"" as “playing games” or “playing games for stakes” and specifically cited past discussions in Congress during the writing of the Commodities Exchange Act, during which a lawmaker said the rule against gaming was meant to cover sports betting. ""All that sounds bad for these contracts, but I am not wholly convinced,"" Brogan continued. ""Judge Cobb’s finding here is dicta—non-binding—and the legislative history is only relevant where the law is ambiguous."" Brogan also points to the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition of gaming as not “playing games” but “the practice or activity of playing games for stakes.” ""At least in Merriam-Webster, this clearly means gambling, not sports, so I think these prediction markets would have colorable arguments if they had to go to the mats. Some judges might be receptive to this kind of textualist argument,"" Brogan said. And finally, there's the issue of the changing nature of the CFTC itself. Many believe that the appointment of Republican Caroline Pham as the Commission's Chair will lead to a more laissez-faire regulatory approach, Brogan said. ""[The Democrats] had been highly skeptical of retail-oriented event contracts and fought hard against first PredictIt and then Kalshi in 2023 and 2024 to attempt to prevent them from offering election contracts,"" Brogan continued.

The development was enough to put the crypto market on a strong recovery path after a brutal crash on Monday. Bitcoin price is up 7%, reclaiming $100K levels. Altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) have bounced back by 11-22%. Additionally, reports of Trump’s trade wars easing up have provided additional fuel to the market. Crypto Market Recovery – BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA See Strong Bounce Back Bitcoin Leads the Crypto Market Recovery Bitcoin is leading the crypto market recovery today, gaining over 7% and surging all the way to $102,000. BTC has been subject to massive volatility over the fears of the Trump trade war swinging all the way to $90,000 and recovering back above $100K, all within less than 48 hours. The recent recovery in Bitcoin comes as crypto czar David Sacks will hold the first press conference talking about America’s digital asset leadership moving ahead. This has led to strong buying pressure, particularly from US investors. According to data from CryptoQuant, the Coinbase Premium Gap—a metric reflecting the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other exchanges—has surged to its highest level in 2025. Source: CryptoQuant This spike indicates increased demand for Bitcoin among U.S.-based investors, a trend that could potentially fuel further price momentum for BTC. Altcoins Recover A Day After Brutal Correction Top altcoins are recovering strongly, with Ethereum (ETH) leading with more than 12% gains in the last 24 hours, surging past $2,800. Ripple’s XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) have gained more than 20% reclaiming much of the lost ground over the past week. As Donald Trump prepares to create a new Sovereign Wealth Fund , crypto market analysts have turned optimistic about the potential inclusion of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Earlier today, Eric Trump wrote in an X post: “In my opinion, it’s a great time to add ETH,” raising further speculation. Furthermore, the XRP community has been pushing for having the Ripple token into America’s crypto reserves. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that it would be prudent to have a basket of digital assets as crypto reserves instead of just Bitcoin. Citing historical patterns from 2017 and 2021, market analysts are now hopeful that the altcoin season could kickstart anytime, triggering a mega bull run.

The case for low-cost altcoins in 2025’s market With the meteoric rise of Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) , investors are increasingly looking for undervalued altcoins with high potential. While BTC and ETH will continue to dominate in 2025, smaller players have strong chances to carve out niches that can lead them to extraordinary growth. Also, the current bull market is heavily propped up by institutional investors entering the space.

Crypto enthusiasts also prefer these budget-friendly options as they can purchase high volumes with lower investments. Why these altcoins could compete with Bitcoin and Ripple Lightchain AI, Dogwifhat , and Cardano are emerging as promising altcoins with the potential to challenge established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ripple.

33767162,[object Object],1738652419,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin In The Mix? Trump’s Executive Order Sets Up Sovereign Wealth Fund,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-in-the-mix-trumps-executive-order/,"In a move that could significantly impact Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto landscape, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday establishing plans for a government-run sovereign wealth fund aimed at economic development. This initiative follows Trump’s ongoing commitment to leverage Bitcoin and digital assets as a tool for the country’s economic strategy , a promise he made during his campaign last year. Could Bitcoin Find A Place In US Financial Assets? US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated during a press briefing that the administration intends to “monetize the asset side of the US balance sheet for the American people” within the next year. Bessent elaborated that the fund would encompass a range of liquid assets and domestic resources, signaling a potential shift in how the US manages its financial assets. While the executive order does not specifically mention Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, its goals include promoting fiscal sustainability , reducing tax burdens for American families and small businesses, and enhancing the country’s economic and strategic influence globally. The fund is also expected to invest in critical infrastructure projects such as airports and highways, which could bolster US influence in strategic regions like Panama and Greenland. Bessent, alongside Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick—an advocate for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency —will develop a strategy for the fund within 90 days of the order. Pending further details, this move could potentially align with a growing trend among sovereign wealth funds to explore Bitcoin and digital assets as part of their investment strategies. A Model For US Investment Strategies Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the largest in the world with over $1.7 trillion in assets, serves as a notable example. According to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, the Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) has seen its indirect Bitcoin exposure rise by 153% in 2024. This increase, from 1,507 BTC at the end of 2023 to 3,821 BTC by the close of 2024, reflects a broader acceptance of Bitcoin in institutional investment strategies, even if not pursued directly. Crypto expert Vetle Lunde emphasized that this rising exposure to Bitcoin among major institutional players indicates its maturation as a critical component of investment portfolios. Lunde also highlighted that NBIM has expanded its investments in Bitcoin-related companies, including mining firm Riot Platforms and the Japanese entity Metaplanet, while maintaining significant stakes in MicroStrategy, despite earlier predictions of reduced exposure. The potential for a similar approach from Trump’s administration suggests a strategic pivot towards integrating Bitcoin and other digital assets into the US economic framework. Analysts like Lark Davis have noted the substantial implications of this executive order, suggesting it could enable the sovereign wealth fund to invest in stocks, cryptocurrencies, marking a transformative moment for the market. As the administration prepares to unveil more details, the role of the newly appointed White House Crypto Czar will be closely monitored, especially during his upcoming Tuesday conference.

Major tokens like Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) are also being affected. Both cryptos were charting a positive course a while back. Unfortunately, the early days in February have changed their good fortunes. SOL is currently holding on to not fall below $200, while XRP price is maintaining its position well above $2. Meanwhile, a viral altcoin is making waves with the possibility of an incredible 12,800% rally after its listing. With institutional investors keeping a close eye on these assets, the market is heating up. Let’s break down what is happening with Solana and Ripple, and why DTX Exchange is emerging as a game-changer in the space. Ripple (XRP) Desperate to Maintain Strong Position Amidst Crypto Market Dip For some time now, XRP has been a top-performing crypto. It continued to be among the leading digital assets despite its regulatory fights. The start of the year had great prospects for a Ripple price closest to its all-time high of $3.40. Analysts were predicting more bullish momentum and gains. Because of a general market decline, XRP price has plummeted badly by over 8% in a few days. It currently trades around $2.69 after finding some upward momentum to go back above the $2.65 support level. Source: CoinMarketCap However, some positive signs appear. XRP was traded by about 300% more in 24 hours. Many buyers have a view that these corrections would be very short-term, and the long-term outlook is bright. For XRP to break past the $3 mark, strong volume and institutional backing will be necessary. If demand holds, the next cycle could take XRP price back to higher levels. Solana (SOL) Steady Above $200 Given the chain’s fast and cheap transactions, it is no surprise that SOL price has remained the favorite of blockchain developers. After a strong run-up in the first few weeks of the year, it now seems Solana isn’t offering much at these lower prices. Some of the analysts feel this price will again touch $250, even though it has slipped down to just above $200. The market took it back down about 8% in the last few days. The last 24 hours seems to be consolidation as its price is near $208. Source: CoinMarketCap If the blockchain can maintain its uptime and continue attracting developers, it stands a chance to climb higher in 2025. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Viral Altcoin With a Potential 12,800% Rally Amidst the situation, a new player is shaking up the market — DTX Exchange . This emerging platform has gained significant traction due to its hybrid trading model. It combines traditional finance with blockchain technology. DTX Exchange’s token could see a 12,800% surge upon listing. That would make it one of the biggest gainers in many months. It has strong institutional backing, an innovative trading ecosystem, and a rapidly growing user base. Unlike many exchanges, DTX allows users to trade cryptocurrencies, stocks, and forex on a single platform. Its secure Phoenix Wallet helps users manage those assets. The DTX token has already multiplied 800% in the presale alone. It has gone from $0.02 to $0.16, now in its last stage. The expected listing will come at $0.20. The DTX token has also gained credibility through a successful audit by SolidProof and a preview feature on CoinMarketCap. With its presale already raising millions, investors are paying close attention to what’s next. Conclusion With Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) holding steady, DTX Exchange is making headlines with its massive rally. It is proving that new projects can deliver massive returns for early investors. As the crypto landscape evolves, keeping an eye on these assets could present great opportunities in the months ahead.

While major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) , and Ethereum (ETH) have strong use cases, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN sets itself apart as the most exciting opportunity for exponential value creation. Here’s why this token is dominating the conversation. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stands Out 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity With a total supply capped at 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN ensures scarcity that fuels long-term value. Unlike BTC and LTC, which have slower growth due to high circulation, this token’s deflationary model guarantees increasing demand. 2. Exclusive Availability Unlike UNI and DOT, which are available on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity gives early adopters an edge and keeps the token’s growth stable and controlled. 3. Unparalleled Growth Potential Analysts project that THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN could deliver returns of up to 2,000%, thanks to its early-stage momentum and community-driven development. While Bitcoin and Polkadot are well-established, they can’t match the rapid trajectory of this groundbreaking token. 4. Investor Demand at Record Levels Raising $1,000,000 within minutes of its presale launch, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven its appeal. Investors recognize its potential to redefine the market, driving interest far beyond what UNI, BTC, or LTC have recently seen. How THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Compares Uniswap (UNI): A strong DeFi platform but lacks the exclusivity and demand-driving scarcity of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Polkadot (DOT): Reliable for interoperability but cannot match the early-stage explosive growth seen here. Bitcoin (BTC): A store of value, yet its market maturity limits growth opportunities compared to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Litecoin (LTC): Known for efficiency, but it hasn’t captured the market excitement that this new token has.

Dogwifhat (WIF) and Trump (TRUMP) have made headlines with their price surges, but can they maintain momentum? Meanwhile, a new DeFi coin flies under the radar. At just $0.04, this hidden gem is ready to explode for massive gains. As hot as the hype around meme coins is, serious investors are into this new crypto project with real-world utility and exponential profit potential. Read on for more details! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Dogwifhat Continues Its Meme-Fueled Rally Dogwifhat has recently been among the most hyped meme coins, wildly swinging based on social media hype and speculation. After a sharp rally, WIF’s price now stands at $1.17 . The meme coin price has dipped by over 16% in the last seven days. This may be because interest in meme tokens, which typically undergo short-term surges followed by market corrections, isn’t sustainable. Despite its popularity, WIF faces challenges in maintaining price stability due to its lack of fundamental utility. While traders continue to ride the waves of speculation, the question remains—can WIF sustain long-term growth, or will it fade like many meme coins before it? The TRUMP Coin Rises with Political Momentum The OFFICIAL TRUMP token has capitalized on the political landscape, seeing a major price spike as Donald Trump’s 2025 inauguration approached. The token skyrocketed to over $70 , driven by investors betting on political sentiment. However, the surge was short-lived, and TRUMP has since experienced a nosedive to its current price of $27 . Unlike traditional DeFi tokens built around blockchain ecosystems, TRUMP’s value is directly linked to news cycles and speculation. While it remains one of the trending meme coins, its long-term viability is uncertain. Investors seeking stability and passive income opportunities look beyond political hype and towards projects with real utility and security. FXGuys: The $0.04 Crypto Gem That Could Outperform Meme Coins in 2025 Amidst the chaos of meme coin speculation, a game-changing DeFi token has quietly entered the market. Unlike WIF and TRUMP, which rely on hype-driven pumps, FXGuys ($FXG) is built for sustained growth with real-world applications that appeal to crypto traders, investors, and blockchain enthusiasts. What makes the FXGuys project stand out is its strong ecosystem, which offers a suite of financial tools and programs that give holders more than just price appreciation. Here are five key features that make it a must-have investment: Locked Liquidity: FXGuys ensures liquidity, preventing sudden price drops and enhancing market stability. By eliminating rug-pull risks, investors can trust that their funds are safe in the long run. No Buy-or-Sell Tax: Unlike many other DeFi tokens, this one has zero buy-or-sell taxes, allowing traders to maximize their profits. This makes it ideal for short-term traders and long-term holders looking to accumulate. Staking Rewards Program: Investors can stake their $FXG tokens to earn passive income through future price appreciation. The staking mechanism secures the reward system, making it profitable for investors with long-term goals. Trader Funding Program: Holders can use their tokens to purchase trading challenges and qualify for up to $500,000 in funded trading capital.

How $RACE Token is Shaking Up Betting with AI,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/from-memes-to-millions-how-race-token-is-shaking-up-betting-with-ai/,"The post From Memes to Millions? How $RACE Token is Shaking Up Betting with AI appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The blockchain gaming landscape continues to change in the past few years, with Race to a Billion emerging as a notable project that combines AI-powered racing predictions with blockchain technology. At the heart of this innovative platform lies the $RACE token, currently priced at $0.00829 during its presale phase, which has already garnered over $230,000 in contributions from early participants. How the Prediction Model Works Race to a Billion’s prediction model is powered by AI, making every race an exciting blend of strategy and chance. Instead of manually controlling racers, players analyze different factors to make the best possible predictions. At the heart of the system is an advanced AI that simulates racing events. Each race unfolds based on key variables, creating a dynamic and unpredictable experience: Track Conditions – Every track comes with its own challenges, influencing how racers perform. Character Traits – Meme characters aren’t just for show; each one has unique abilities and racing styles that impact the outcome. Historical Data – Players can dive into past race stats, studying trends to refine their predictions. Players can place predictions on multiple race outcomes, adding layers of strategy to the game. Some of the key betting options include: Overall Race Winners – Guess which character will take the top spot. Fastest Laps – Predict who will clock the quickest lap time. Head-to-Head Matchups – Bet on direct rivalries between specific racers. With AI driving the races and blockchain ensuring fairness, the prediction model offers an engaging, transparent, and skill-based betting experience. Breaking Down $RACE Tokenomics The $RACE token follows a carefully structured distribution model with a total supply of 2.5 billion tokens. The largest portion, 40% (1 billion tokens), has been allocated to the presale phase, ensuring broad initial distribution among early platform supporters. The remaining supply is divided strategically, with 20% reserved for staking rewards and four equal portions of 10% each designated for development, liquidity, ecosystem growth, and marketing initiatives. The development allocation plays a crucial role in the platform’s evolution. These funds support continuous improvement of the AI racing system, user interface enhancements, and integration of new features requested by the community. The separate liquidity allocation ensures smooth trading operations and price stability, making it easier for users to enter or exit positions as needed. Marketing and ecosystem funds work in tandem to expand the platform’s reach and capabilities. The marketing allocation supports various promotional activities, from social media campaigns to strategic partnerships with influencers in the crypto space. Meanwhile, the ecosystem fund focuses on building relationships with other projects and platforms, creating opportunities for cross-platform integration and expanded utility for $RACE token holders.

They track staking periods and rewards without any manual intervention needed. Users earn rewards for keeping their tokens staked, which helps maintain a healthy token supply in the market. No joke – stakers are earning a massive 2,500% APY right now. The team’s put aside 500 million tokens just for rewards, so early birds can really cash in. The staking process works on a seven-day lockup period after claiming. This cooling-off period helps stabilize token circulation and prevents rapid sell-offs that could affect token value. Users can monitor their earnings in real-time through the staking dashboard, watching their rewards accumulate with each passing block. Staking rewards are distributed based on the proportion of tokens each user has staked compared to the total staking pool. This fair system ensures that everyone gets their share of rewards based on their commitment to the platform. As more users join the staking program, the reward rate may adjust to maintain long-term sustainability. Technical Infrastructure and Security Measures Security is at the heart of Race to a Billion’s design. The team went the extra mile by partnering with SolidProof to thoroughly audit their smart contracts. This means users can trust that their tokens and transactions are protected by top-notch security measures. The blockchain foundation of the platform ensures complete transparency. Once a race result or transaction is recorded, it’s there for good – unchangeable and visible to everyone. The AI-powered racing system adds another layer of fairness, making sure every race outcome is genuinely random and free from manipulation. How to Buy the $RACE Token? Getting started is simple. Buy tokens using ETH, USDT, BNB or a credit card. Head to Race to a Billion website , choose your payment method, and follow the easy setup process. Remember to check out the staking options – they’re worth considering if you plan to hold your tokens. For crypto-savvy users, the process starts with connecting a compatible wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet to the platform. The minimum purchase amount is kept reasonable to allow broad participation. Users can swap their existing cryptocurrencies for $RACE tokens at the current presale price of $0.00829. Platform accepts crypto cards too if you are new to crypto and do not own it yet. After purchasing, tokens appear in the user’s dashboard. From here, they can track their holdings, view transaction history, and access the staking interface. The dashboard also provides real-time updates on token performance and platform metrics. For those interested in maximizing returns, the platform offers detailed guides on using its features effectively. Support staff are available through official channels to help with any questions about token purchase, staking, or platform navigation.

Meanwhile, Rollblock continues to turn heads with its innovative GambleFi platform which is poised to become the new industry standard in the online gaming space. 45,000 investors have already secured their allocation in the viral RBLK presale and this number is growing by the hundreds every day. Rollblock’s Moon Mission Starts Now By bridging the gap between DeFi and online gaming, Web3 protocol Rollblock brings the best of both worlds for a memorable Vegas-level experience. This means unparalleled ease of access and top-notch security measures powered by blockchain technology. The project offers a massive leap forward regarding safety and transparency, as each transaction is easily traceable and immune to tampering. Individuals can immediately access the 7000-game catalog, offering unmatched variety and gaming options to the rapidly growing user base. On Rollblock, players will find all-time classics such as blackjack and poker, live games, and even brand-new AI-enhanced exclusives. The project has also released a sportsbook covering all major sporting events. The groundbreaking revenue-sharing mechanism is one of Rollblock’s most intriguing and lucrative features, granting users some of the highest APY on the market. Rollblock will spend up to 30% of its weekly earnings to perform open-market buybacks of RBLK tokens. 60% of this amount will be burned, deflating the supply and priming RBLK for long-term price growth. The remaining 40% will be redistributed to the community as recurring staking rewards, allowing holders to simultaneously benefit from passive income and scarcity-driven appreciation. Ripple Labs Locks 700 million XRP, While Price Dips Below $3.00 Ripple recently locked up 700 million XRP in a strategic move aimed at managing supply and stabilizing prices. Analysts suggest that by restricting circulation, Ripple’s actions could drive prices higher, with some predicting XRP could reach $4 by April if positive trends persist. Investors view this development as a potential catalyst for long-term price stability, reinforcing confidence in Ripple’s long-term vision. Despite this effort, XRP saw a 16% intraday drop, forming a bottom around $2.38 as market turbulence intensified over the weekend. The loss of the $3.00 support led to a breakdown in Ripple’s price structure, as many investors rushed to cut their losses, intensifying selling pressure. On the macro level, Ripple’s trajectory remains bullish, although this sudden correction injected a considerable amount of uncertainty in its short-term price action. Solana Bottoms Out Under $200, What’s Next? Solana has been treading water for over a week as it struggled to reclaim and hold the $200 mark. While Solana managed to climb to the $230-$240 zone, these gains quickly evaporated over the weekend as market-wide sell-offs began. At press time, Solana was trading at $199, following an 11% daily decrease. Crypto analyst Bluntz has warned that Solana’s current chart patterns resemble those seen before its sharp decline in 2021, raising concerns about a potential reversal in Solana’s higher timeframe trend. Other experts point out that this could be a “bear-trap”, a move designed to punish leveraged long traders and late shorters. This thesis is also corroborated by Coinalyze exchange data, showing that over the last 24 hours more than $500 million worth of Solana positions were liquidated, wiping out over $400 million in longs and $90 million in short. Rollblock Presale Becomes Safe Haven Many Ripple and Solana holders have been reallocating capital into the RBLK presale which is close to crossing the $10 million mark in raised funds. The argument for this is very simple, as Rollblock’s magnitudes lower market cap grants significantly greater room for growth, especially with the crypto gaming narrative set for a major comeback in the coming months. Stage 10 of the presale is now live and RBLK tokens are selling for just $0.052. RBLK has been in up-only mode since launch as early buyers are already enjoying returns of over 400%, but in addition to this an 800% rally is expected by the end of the event meaning there is still time for investors to win big.

Within 24 hours of its launch, the price skyrocketed by 350%, pushing its market cap to a whopping $150 million almost overnight. The hype was real, and so were the profits—if you got in early. Meanwhile, those who hesitated? They were left staring at missed opportunities and a flood of FOMO-fueled regret on Crypto Twitter. But here’s the thing—history repeats itself. And right now, another potential 1000X meme coin is making waves: BTFD Coin. With its presale already in Stage 14, over 68 billion $BTFD coins sold , and a total of $5.91 million raised, this meme coin is gathering serious momentum. Sitting at just $0.00016 per coin, investors looking for the next big break may want to pay attention. The juiciest part? It’s got a mouthwatering staking APY of 90%, making it one of the top new meme coins to join for short-term gains. Neiro’s Insane Growth: The One That Got Away Neiro’s ICO wasn’t just successful; it was legendary. When it launched on July 28, 2024, few expected the kind of astronomical rise it would see in just a matter of hours. A 350% jump on day one? That’s the kind of thing meme coin investors dream about. But it didn’t stop there. By November 12, 2024, Neiro reached its all-time high of $0.003019, cementing its place as one of the best-performing meme coin launches in recent memory. Early backers who bought in at a fraction of a cent saw their investments multiply, while latecomers and skeptics could only watch in regret. Crypto forums and Twitter were flooded with posts like: “If only I had gotten in sooner!” And let’s not forget: Neiro’s explosive growth wasn’t just hype—it was backed by a strong community and smart tokenomics. It had the perfect storm of meme culture, strategic marketing, and early adoption. Now, the question on everyone’s mind is: What’s the next Neiro? BTFD Coin: Staking Rewards to Marvel at! If you’re looking for a meme coin with 1000X potential, BTFD Coin is making a compelling case. Currently priced at just $0.00016 per token, the potential for serious gains is undeniable. So, what happens if BTFD Coin follows a similar trajectory to Neiro? Let’s break it down: $3,000 invested at today’s price ($0.00016) gets you 18,750,000 BTFD tokens. If BTFD Coin reaches $0.0006 per token, that investment would be worth $11,250. And if it soars even further to $0.006? That’s a $112,500 portfolio. Sounds like a second chance at Neiro-level gains, doesn’t it? Beyond price potential, BTFD Coin presents a full-blown ecosystem with a P2E game and a high-APY staking program that keeps the community engaged. Its staking feature has got investors buzzing, meaning their passive income game could be changed forever. All you have to do is sit back, keep holding your tokens, and wait as they compound year after year without you lifting a finger! Don’t forget about the referral rewards program either, which has the potential of giving you a 10% cut of the total amount of $BTFD bought by your referrals. Final Thoughts: Don’t Be Late to This One Neiro was the one that got away for thousands of investors. But you don’t have to miss the next big thing. BTFD Coin is offering one of the most exciting meme coin opportunities right now, and with over $5.91 million raised, momentum is building fast. The low presale price of $0.00016 makes this a prime opportunity before BTFD Coin potentially takes off toward $0.0006 or beyond. If you want a shot at 1000X returns, now is the time to act. Sign up for the BTFD Coin presale now and grab your stack before the next stage price increase.

Neiro saw rapid growth due to its strong tokenomics, dedicated community, and strategic marketing. It surged 350% in just 24 hours and later reached an all-time high of $0.003019 by November 2024. Can BTFD Coin hit $0.0006? Many analysts believe BTFD Coin has the potential to reach $0.0006 or even higher, given its strong community, staking rewards, and P2E game driving adoption. How can I maximize my BTFD Coin investment? Buying early during presale ensures the lowest possible price. You can also earn extra BTFD through staking and the referral program to increase your holdings over time.

Solaxy Soars to $17.5M, Emerges as New Solana Alternative",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/best-crypto-presale-solaxy-soars-to-17-5m-emerges-as-new-solana-alternative/,"The post Best Crypto Presale? Solaxy Soars to $17.5M, Emerges as New Solana Alternative appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solaxy ($SOLX) , the first-ever Layer-2 scaling solution for Solana, has crossed the $16.3 million presale milestone, reflecting growing investor confidence in its potential to transform the network. The surge comes as Solana’s meme coin launchpad, Pump.fun, recorded an unprecedented $3.3 billion in weekly trading volume, driven largely by a wave of Trump-themed meme coins following the surprise token launches linked to the new U.S. president. On January 23 alone, trading on the platform soared past $544 million, smashing previous single-day records, Dune Analytics data shows . However, the spike in transactions also caused severe congestion on the Solana blockchain. With Solana struggling to handle such massive trading volumes, investors are turning to Solaxy as a promising fix. By processing transactions off the main Layer-1 chain, Solaxy aims to reduce congestion, lower transaction fees, and enhance processing speeds, which are critical improvements for a network aiming to scale efficiently. The Solana community has embraced Solaxy, driving strong demand for $SOLX tokens since the presale began just over a month ago. Currently priced at $0.001624 per token, this rate is set to increase in just two days as the presale moves to its next funding phase. The Growing Impact of Meme Coins on Solana’s Network The recent explosion of Trump-themed meme coins on Pump.fun significantly impacted Solana’s blockchain activity. Reports suggest that over 6,800 tokens were launched using variations of the “Trump” name, many created with the intent of misleading investors by capitalizing on the success of Official Trump ($TRUMP) and Official Melania ($MELANIA). This frenzy led to Solana validators collecting $25 million in transaction fees, as traders scrambled to process transactions amid network congestion. Data Spotlight: How Scammers Reacted to the $TRUMP Token Launch | Blockaid Blog The overwhelming demand slowed down one of the fastest and most cost-effective blockchains, forcing traders to pay higher fees to push their transactions through. This is the problem Solaxy is designed to solve, ensuring Solana can better manage high trading volumes and maintain its efficiency in the long run. Solaxy Unlocks Solana’s Full Potential Despite Solana’s high speeds and low fees, congestion issues have prevented it from being fully recognized as a true Ethereum ($ETH) competitor in DeFi. This is why Ethereum continues to dominate, with a Total Value Locked (TVL) six times higher than Solana’s. Traders are betting that Solaxy could be the missing piece that propels Solana to new heights, addressing the core scalability challenge that has limited its adoption. Some analysts even suggest that Solana’s price could hit $400 by February if congestion issues are resolved, making Solaxy a key catalyst for that growth. Remember when @ethereum launches 5000 NFTs it gets congested in 10 minutes and gas is $100+. #Solana handles $1b of volume in 2.5hrs with average tx fee of 0.3c. Let this be the final time I tell you. Sell $ETH and buy $SOL right now. — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) January 18, 2025 As Solana’s first Layer-2 scaling solution, Solaxy reduces failed transactions, improves processing speeds, and enhances overall network reliability. Its streamlined transaction processing has earned the title of the “DeepSeek of blockchain,” highlighting its efficiency in optimizing the ecosystem. $SOLX: A High-Potential Token for Early Investors The $SOLX token is positioned as a high-growth opportunity, drawing comparisons to early-stage Solana ($SOL) investments. When Solana traded at just $0.50 five years ago, its meteoric rise to $228 delivered a staggering 45,500% return, turning a $1,000 investment into $456,000. Solana Price: SOL Live Price Chart, Market Cap & News Today | CoinGecko Many investors now view $SOLX as a second chance to capitalize on an emerging Solana-based opportunity before its price takes off. With Solaxy being the only available solution to Solana’s scalability challenges, skipping this presale could mean missing out on one of the most promising blockchain innovations in recent years. How to Join the Solaxy ($SOLX) Presale Joining the Solaxy presale is simple and offers early access to a game-changing Layer-2 solution for Solana. Investors can participate by visiting Solaxy’s official website, connecting their wallets, and purchasing $SOLX using SOL. Alternatively, Best Wallet , a next-gen multichain wallet, offers an easy way to buy $SOLX with low fees, seamless Ethereum and Solana integration, and advanced investment screening tools.

The Singapore-based AI and education company Genius Group now holds more Bitcoin ( BTC ) than its own market value. The company has increased its Bitcoin reserves to 440 BTC, adding another $2 million in purchases, it said in a Feb. 3 press release . Genius has now spent $42 million on Bitcoin at an average price of $95,519 per BTC. But with Bitcoin trading at $104,893 as of Jan. 31, the company’s Bitcoin treasury is worth $46 million — while its own market cap sits at $33.1 million. That means each $100 in Genius stock technically holds $139 in Bitcoin. “This gives the Company a BTC / Price ratio of 139%, with the ratio calculated by dividing the market value of the Company’s Bitcoin Treasury by its market cap. Based on this ratio, as at January 31, 2025, $100 of the Company’s equity includes $139 in Bitcoin in its Bitcoin Treasury.” Genius Group You might also like: Metaplanet raises $745m to expand Bitcoin holdings in bid for Asia’s largest crypto deal The latest buy follows Genius’ $5 million Bitcoin purchase weeks ago.

FXGuys ($FXG) is emerging as the new gem with a massive presale opportunity. Crypto analysts are closely watching $FXG and have recommended investments in the token due to its potential to deliver higher profit margins over Cardano and BNB. But investors are asking why $FXG is the best crypto to invest in now instead of ADA and BNB. Let’s find out! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Cardano’s Increased Network Activity Drives the ADA Token Price Surge According to the renowned market analyst Ali Martinez , the network activity on Cardano has continued to show strength as its daily active addresses recently surged to reach 50,828. This increase in active addresses has sent the ADA token into a bull run. ADA jumped 14.46% from $0.83 to $0.95 in the first 9 days of January 2025. By January 17, the Cardano token rose by 22.11% to reach $1.16. However, this momentum didn’t last long, as ADA dropped by 17.24% to $0.96 by January 30. Due to the surge in daily active addresses on Cardano, experts now predict ADA’s price could rebound to reach $3 this year. However, despite the positive ADA future price predictions, investors are shifting their focus to the $FXG coin. It’s the presale token that experts call the best crypto coin to buy now for higher profit margins in the ongoing market. Trader Behavior Drives a BNB Token Rally, But Is it the Best Crypto to Invest in Now? Another token that has experienced price volatility is the BNB token. Coinglass data reveals that the BNB futures market recently recorded $4.01 million in long liquidations and $231.34 thousand in short liquidations. These trader activities in the futures market have driven the BNB coin into a bull run. BNB jumped 2.01% from $699.76 to $713.84 in the first 5 days of January 2025. By January 17, BNB rose further by 2.24% to $729.85. But the BNB token dropped by 7.01% to $678.35 by January 30. However, the rising activities in the futures market have led experts to predict that BNB’s token price could cross $1,000 this year.

The altcoin market awaits regulatory clarity, focusing on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Ethereum faces monetization and platform issues, with key price levels at $2,700 and $3,000. The crypto market has seen a rollercoaster ride, with a huge correction that erased billions in capital. This sharp drop followed escalating global trade tensions, after the US President’s executive order placed tariffs on goods from China, Canada, and Mexico. But, just when things seemed hopeless, the market began to show signs of a strong comeback. Bitcoin , which had dropped to nearly $90,000, is now back above $100,000. The turnaround happened when Donald Trump decided to pause the tariff plans, after a deal with Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum to delay them for a month. Matt Hougan, CIO at Bitwise Asset Management, noted that liquidations can happen quickly, one after another. But at the bottom, buyers are always waiting for the inevitable rebound, he added.

Buterin’s comment came while celebrating the surge in the Ethereum gas limit to more than 32 million. The announcement comes just as the ETH price bounces back over 13% shooting past $2,800 levels once again. Vitalik Buterin Highlights Ethereum Scaling Progress Ethereum Gas Limit Increase Is a Positive sign Nearly half (49.5%) of Ethereum blocks are now signaling support for a gas limit increase, marking the potential for the first adjustment since the transition to proof-of-stake (PoS). This milestone highlights the decentralized nature of PoS, which, while more efficient than proof-of-work (PoW), requires longer coordination times to achieve consensus. The surge in a gas limit is good for Ethereum blockchain scalability as it would allow network validators to process more transactions per block. As per the data from Dune Analytics, Ethereum’s gas limit has already surpassed 32 million. Source: Dune Analytics Vitalik Buterin Reveals Pectra Upgrade Timeline Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has expressed optimism about Layer 1 (L1) scaling. He also acknowledged Ethereum developers ‘ efforts to enhance the network’s efficiency and decentralization. The Ethereum co-founder also acknowledged significant strides being made on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4444, aimed at history expiry, and the move toward statelessness with the introduction of a new binary tree proposal. Vitalik Buterin also revealed that developers are working on client efficiency upgrades to support higher gas limits while maintaining decentralization. In a post on the X platform, Buterin wrote : “Pectra, expected in March, will increase the blob target from 3 to 6, doubling the capacity of L2s. IMO we should make the blob target also staker-voted, so that it can increase in respose to technology improvements without waiting for hard forks”. The upcoming Ethereum Pectra upgrade will transform Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), allowing them to operate like smart contracts. This marks a significant advancement in enhancing user interactions with decentralized applications (dApps). ETH Price Stages Strong Comeback Following a brutal correction on Monday, the ETH price has bounced back 13% shooting past $2,800. Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a potential head-and-shoulders pattern forming for Ethereum (ETH). According to Martinez, ETH must stay above the critical $2,700 support level to preserve its bullish structure. “If this pattern holds, Ethereum could have a clear path to rally toward $7,000,” Martinez noted.

Andean Medjedovic, a University of Waterloo mathematics graduate, has been indicted for wire fraud, computer hacking, attempted extortion, and money laundering in connection with the KyberSwap and I ndexed Finance exploits, the Justice Department announced on Feb. 3. According to the charges , Medjedovic manipulated smart contracts on both platforms, using deceptive trades to trick automated systems into miscalculating key values. By exploiting these flaws, he allegedly drained $48.8 million from KyberSwap in 2023 and swiped $16.5 million from Indexed Finance in 2021. Through his deceptive trades, Medjedovic managed to “withdraw millions in investor funds at artificial prices,” the indictment said. This left victims with effectively worthless investments. Prosecutors added that Medjedovic meticulously planned the KyberSwap exploits over several months, maintaining a directory of files labeled with terms like “KYBER_KILL” and “templateexploit.” He created a “POOL HIT LIST” to identify liquidity pools to target and timed the attack strategically, writing notes such as “Find time to Strike! CEO is in Ho-Chi.” He even calculated the optimal time for the attack to coincide with when Americans and Europeans would likely be asleep. You might also like: Crypto hacks jump ninefold in January: Immunefi After the attack, prosecutors say Medjedovic attempted to extort KyberSwap developers, investors, and DAO members by demanding control of the protocol in exchange for returning 50% of the stolen funds. At the same time, he was working to cover his tracks. Medjedovic and an associate allegedly laundered the stolen crypto through crypto mixers and blockchain bridges, shuffling the funds across multiple networks to obscure their origin. He also opened accounts at crypto exchanges using fake identities, attempting to liquidate his holdings without raising red flags. Furthermore, when one bridge protocol froze his transactions, Medjedovic allegedly paid an undercover law enforcement agent $85,000—believing they were a developer who could bypass the restrictions and unlock $500,000 of his frozen crypto. If convicted, Medjedovic faces significant penalties, including up to 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud, attempted extortion, and money laundering, as well as 10 years for unauthorized damage to a protected computer. Law enforcement agencies, including the Dutch National Police Cybercrime Unit and U.S. prosecutors, continue to pursue Medjedovic, who remains at large.

Bitcoin (BTC) changed the game for early investors, delivering life-changing returns, and Solana (SOL) is recognized for its exceptional scalability. Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin in the market, is grabbing headlines with predictions of 55,000% growth potential. Having raised $1 million during its presale in minutes, it’s being closely watched by experts who see it as the next breakout token alongside top contenders. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is Creating a Buzz 1. Fresh Entry, Massive Upside Being new to the market, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers a rare opportunity to invest before its value skyrockets. Early investors stand to benefit from the kind of exponential returns only seen in the early days of tokens like SOL and XRP. 2. Exceptional Presale Success The presale success of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN , raising $1 million almost instantly, is a clear indicator of its high demand and market appeal. Its early momentum positions it as a leader among emerging cryptos. 3. Exclusivity Fuels Demand Unlike XRP, LINK, and DOT, which are widely available across exchanges, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively sold at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This controlled access ensures scarcity, increasing its value for early adopters. How It Stands Against Competitors XRP: Dominates payments but lacks the early-stage growth potential of this new coin. Solana (SOL): Scalable and fast, but its growth is already stabilizing compared to this fresh token. Chainlink (LINK): Strong in decentralized oracles but can’t match the excitement surrounding THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An emerging project, but its momentum falls short of this token’s presale success. Don’t Miss This Game-Changing Opportunity With experts predicting up to 55,000% gains, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is becoming the most talked-about crypto of 2025. Its record-breaking presale, exclusivity, and high-growth potential make it a must-watch token alongside Solana. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and join the revolution!

The tariff war resolution between the United States and its neighboring countries, Canada and Mexico, contributed to the relief rally in the past 24 hours. However, the tariff retaliation from China to the U.S. has complicated the situation, thus creating more short-term uncertainty. After hitting a local high of about $102.5k on Monday, Bitcoin price dropped around 3 percent earlier on Tuesday to trade at about $99.2k at the time of this writing. The wider altcoin industry followed Bitcoin’s price action in tandem, thus leading to an 8 percent bump in the total crypto market cap to hover at about $3.46 trillion. Brandts on the Bitcoin Market According to market expert Peter Brandt, Bitcoin dominance will rally towards 66 percent against the altcoin industry in the near future. With the rising adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors and soon nation states, Brandt believes that Bitcoin will continue to yield its dominance in the near future. Brandt noted that the Bitcoin price has been ranging between $109k and $90k. As a result, a consistent close outside the consolidation range will lead to a major breakout in the subsequent months. In case of a bearish breakout, Brandt has set a target of around $75k and a short-term target of about $135.9k in case of a bullish breakout. On the Flipside In my opinion, it’s a great time to add $ETH . — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) February 3, 2025 After an impressive rally in the past two years, amounting to over 500 percent, Bitcoin price is likely to experience a lower bullish momentum compared to the altcoin market in the near future. According to Eric Trump, the executive vice president of the Trump organization, now is a great time to consider Ethereum. Moreover, the ETH/BTC pair has been trapped in a multi-year falling trend but recently retested a crucial support level above 0.023.

Meanwhile, a newcomer named Panshibi ($SHIBI) has grabbed the spotlight among meme coin enthusiasts, promising a structured approach that could aim for a remarkable 100x surge before July. Below, we delve into Cardano’s evolving ecosystem, then examine why Panshibi might be more likely to achieve astronomical gains in a short timeframe. Cardano’s Ongoing Evolution Cardano’s latest news emphasizes a significant development: the Plomin hard fork. By activating this upgrade, Cardano moves closer to genuine community governance. ADA holders can now vote on critical updates, treasury spending and other network proposals, reflecting Cardano’s ongoing transformation into a platform shaped by its users. This transition rests on three main approval criteria, from stake pool readiness to an interim committee’s endorsement. Despite a brief drop of 20% tied to global market volatility, many supporters remain confident in Cardano’s future. They point to its decentralized governance model as a factor that could eventually elevate ADA’s price. For now, recent performance shows the token hovers at $0.7071 —a far cry from the $5 some fans forecast. While the Cardano latest news on the Plomin hard fork hints at promising upgrades, it may not spur an immediate price jump unless major adoption catalysts emerge soon. Panshibi: The Meme Coin Targeting a 100x While Cardano cements governance reforms, Panshibi seeks a more explosive approach. Billed as a meme coin, it has structural elements rarely seen in the niche. Currently priced at $0.004 in its third presale stage, Panshibi has raised over $500k, selling out in the two previous stages. These stats underline robust market confidence in a project that merges playful branding with locked liquidity (10 years), team tokens locked for two years and a Coinsult-audited contract. Panshibi also highlights an AI-driven “social-fi” system, which engages users through interactive quests and staking rewards with enticing APYs. This intersection of meme culture and concrete utility makes Panshibi distinct from quick-flip tokens that rely solely on online hype. Traders keen on seizing new meme coin rockets are thus gravitating to Panshibi, eyeing the possibility of a 100x run in under a year—a prospect that, for many, outshines the slower route Cardano might take to eventually reach $5. Which Is More Likely to Hit $5 First? The latest news from the Cardano camp surrounding community-driven governance confirms that ADA remains a formidable player. Still, the coin’s move from $0.7071 to $5 depends on broader adoption and meaningful utility expansions—factors that typically unfold gradually. Panshibi, however, thrives on meme coin momentum, where explosive growth can happen overnight if significant exchange listings or influencer endorsements align with sustained community hype. While Cardano may offer stability for those who value a deeply technical roadmap, Panshibi appeals to traders seeking rapid gains in a shorter time frame. The success of past meme coins indicates that a well-structured token can skyrocket if it strikes the right balance between playful marketing and thorough security measures, both of which Panshibi provides. In a space where unpredictability reigns, many consider the meme sector more conducive to swift, exponential price hikes. Conclusion Although Cardano’s latest news confirms progress in decentralized governance, ADA’s modest price performance has left some holders wondering when they might see $5. Panshibi ($SHIBI), on the other hand, operates in a meme coin market known for sudden rallies and skyrocketing gains. With its first two presale stages sold out, locked liquidity for 10 years and AI-driven engagement tools, Panshibi seems well-positioned for an ambitious 100x run by July. Whether either coin hits its target first depends on a blend of market sentiment, real-world use and community support—but for risk-tolerant investors, Panshibi’s meteoric potential may prove irresistible in the months ahead.

Notably, over 4 million coins were again removed from the asset’s circulating supply, boosting the meme coin’s tokenomics. Simultaneously, SHIB price witnessed a nearly 10% uptick intraday, leveraging the broader market trend and burn rate impact. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Blows Up Over 550%, Investors Optimistic As Supply Shreds According to an X post by the tracker Shibburn on February 4, the Shiba Inu burn rate surged 567.83% in the past 24 hours. This remarkable upswing is attributable to 4.61 million coins being removed from the crypto’s circulating supply. For context, the SHIB token burn mechanism has constantly dealt a blow to the circulating supply, with nearly 1 billion coins removed just the previous month. These coins are sent to a null address, thereby making their retrieval impossible. At the time of reporting, the meme coin’s market supply further shredded to reach 589.25 trillion tokens. As a result, traders and investors eye a bullish outlook for the meme coin, a market sentiment based on the law of supply and demand. Crypto Market Recovery Solidifies Optimism Meanwhile, the broader market recovery has substantially impacted investors’ sentiment on Tuesday. As a result of the quickest trade war, the crypto market recovered as a 30-day halt on Trump’s new tariffs for Canada and Mexico was announced. While Bitcoin price recovered and touched a $102K high intraday, altcoins and meme coins mirrored a similar price action. Simultaneously, even the Shiba Inu coin’s price mirrored a recovery, with the burn rate surge further bolstering it. Can SHIB Price Hit $0.000018 Riding The Burn Rate Surge? At the time of reporting, SHIB price witnessed an 11% uptick in value and is currently trading at $0.00001560. The meme coin’s 24-hour low and high were $0.00001358 and $0.00001691, respectively. As mentioned above, the current bullish movement falls in line with the broader trend and burn rate uptick. Further, a recent Shiba Inu price analysis by CoinGape revealed that large transaction volumes for the token surged remarkably, sparking bullish sentiments over future movements. Notably, this data suggests that institutional or large-scale investors may be capitalizing on the recent market volatility to accumulate, signaling price gain looms. The next vital price point for the meme coin to reclaim remains $0.000015, per the analysis. Intriguingly, with the Shiba Inu burn rate surge and broader market recovery weighing in, the current price is above the level mentioned above. A sustained bullish momentum could help the token move toward $0.000018, supported by the constant reduction of supply with burns.

The market has not yet recovered from the aforementioned correction. Since February 1, the market has declined by 18.52%. However, shortly after the White House hinted at its decision to halt its proposed proceedings related to tariffs, the ETH market showed its initial sign of recovery. Yesterday, the market experienced a mild growth of 0.19%. In the last 24 hours alone, Ethereum has recorded a rise of 8%. Eric Trump’s Crypto Endorsement Sparks Reactions Interestingly, Eric Trump, the president’s son, in a recent post, noted that it is a great time to buy Ethereum. His initial post was highly persuasive in nature, as it contained a statement, “You can thank me later.” The statement was later removed, probably to make it appear less persuasive than the initial one. In my opinion, it’s a great time to add $ETH . — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) February 3, 2025 World Liberty Financial’s Big Crypto Moves World Liberty Financial, a DeFi project controlled by the president’s family, has made some notable moves in the crypto space lately. It recently transferred $307.41M to Coinbase custody, and unstaked 20,000 Lido Staked ETH into regular ETH. It also grabbed 1,826 ETH in exchange for $5M USDC. Experts suggest that the funds could be used to support Earn and Borrow, a lending protocol that WLF is planning to introduce soon. Bitcoin’s $100K Milestone Show Ethereum’s Declining Trend An interesting pattern has emerged when comparing Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Each time Bitcoin reached the $100,000 mark, Ethereum’s price was lower than before. It was on December 5, 2024, that the Bitcoin market reached the milestone of $100K for the first time. At that time, the Ethereum market stood at around $3,900. When BTC touched the $100K mark for the second time, ETH slipped to $3,800. When BTC touched the mark for the third time, ETH declined to $3,700; for the fourth time, to $3,400; for the fifth time, to $3,200; and for the sixth time, to $2,800. This trend shows that even as Bitcoin maintains strong growth, Ethereum has been gradually losing value during the same milestones. It suggests that ETH might be underperforming compared to BTC during major rallies.",News|Altcoins|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|BTC|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-04 07:42:26

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analysts see 1Fuel as a promising project, combining Solana’s speed and Ethereum’s DeFi strength to create a powerful, investor-favored ecosystem for 2025. Table of Contents Solana and Ethereum: Legends in their respective fields 1Fuel: Experts’ pick for 2025 1Fuel poised to mirror SOL and ETH’s success Conclusion 1Fuel, a highly anticipated cryptocurrency wallet, is creating buzz in the cryptocurrency space due to its unique features and functionality. Analysts have noticed the fundamentals of both SOL and ETH in 1Fuel, most especially in SOL’s developer-friendly ecosystem and ETH’s successful initial coin offering. This has prompted experts to term 1Fuel as a leading project in 2025. SOL and ETH are top cryptocurrencies that have dominated the cryptocurrency market, with SOL’s unimaginable speed and great scalability and ETH’s robust system, especially in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts. Despite being in its third stage of presale, 1Fuel has generated over $1.76 million in token sales despite selling for an undervalued price of $0.017. This showcases the massive interest of investors in the token. Solana and Ethereum: Legends in their respective fields SOL’s initial seed sale price started at $0.04, then went on to accumulate a staggering $20 million between April 2018 and July 2019. Since then, SOL has towered over several top cryptocurrencies, reaching an all-time high of $294, an astonishing 41000% from its all-time low. Press time data shows SOL trades at $203, a fall of about 32% from its Jan 19 high. On the other hand, ETH started out with an initial coin offering (ICO) that lasted about three months, between July 22, 2014, and September 2, 2014, selling over 60 million tokens for an undervalued price of $0.31. ETH now sells for $2,944, giving early investors over 9000x return on investment from the launch of the token. Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and a pioneer of decentralized finance (DeFi), having introduced the first smart contracts allowing developers to create decentralized applications (dApps). Experts who have profited from SOL and ETH’s incredible growth have chosen 1Fuel as the most promising project of 2025, as they predict it will replicate their success. 1Fuel: Experts’ pick for 2025 1Fuel stands out as the experts’ best pick for 2025, with its unique functionalities set to integrate the best of both SOL and ETH’s ecosystem. 1Fuel is a cryptocurrency wallet that contains an inbuilt peer-to-peer exchange system to help cut out intermediaries. It supports over 100 fiat currencies, displaying its range and goal to unify the global market. 1Fuel, key on financial integration, provides crypto cards to users to help them access their digital assets in the real world. This bridges the gap between the cryptocurrency world and traditional financial institutions. 1Fuel poised to mirror SOL and ETH’s success Like SOL and ETH once were, 1Fuel is currently in its presale stage and has acquired the support of notable figures, presenting an opportunity for investors to secure tokens before its expected price rally. 1Fuel currently sells for an undervalued price of $0.017, an initial price even lower than SOL and ETH in their presale and ICO phases, respectively. Analysts have predicted that the least returns investors will make on 1Fuel is 100x. Conclusion ETH and SOL are pioneers of blockchain innovation, setting the foundation for subsequent cryptocurrencies, but 1Fuel is implementing the strength of both blockchains while enhancing them for a better and more efficient future. With its undervalued price, interoperability, and financial integration, 1Fuel is positioned as a leading project in 2025.

A massive sell-off happened over the weekend, with the total crypto market cap dropping by half a trillion dollars. Although several news outlets suggest that over $2.27B have been liquidated, Bybit’s CEO says the liquidation could well be in the $8B-10B range . He believes the numbers being circulated don’t reveal the full picture because crypto exchanges typically limit liquidation data. Even worse, most of these liquidations come from long positions, i.e., from traders who were hoping Trump’s nomination as US president would lead to bullish times. It’s worth noting that Trump’s own meme coin, $TRUMP, crashed 40% in the last seven days . On the bright side, though, the crypto economy’s Trump-fueled correction means that the best meme coins are now available at a discount. However, it’s important you select fundamentally strong tokens that also enjoy market hype. We’re here to help; here’s the best crypto to buy now, as they’re best positioned to ride out slumps and skyrocket during the imminent bull run. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best Crypto to Buy Now for First-Time Investors Solaxy ($SOLX) is an altcoin set to explode , but don’t be fooled by its meme appeal – it provides a lot of utility, so much so that analysts are saying it’s the perfect token to weather the correction in crypto and 100x your investment . We’ve identified two major reasons why $SOLX’s presale has been an out-and-out success, raising over $17M at the time of writing. 1. Solana is continuously rising through the ranks and giving the best cryptos a serious run for their money. For instance, it recently beat Ethereum in monthly revenue – $116M in January 2025 as compared to Ethereum’s $107M. Moreover, the Solana ecosystem’s market cap surged 110% in just the last 30 days. 2. By removing Solana’s pain points (network congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability) Solaxy will breathe new life into the network. Invest in one of the best crypto presales by visiting the Solaxy website and connecting a crypto wallet like Best Wallet . You can get 1 $SOLX for just $0.001624 if you get in now. For more information on the buying process, check out our guide on how to buy $SOLX . 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Native Token of the Best Wallet App One of the most prevalent market phenomena is buying the dip – exactly what’s happening now. A surefire way to get behind this phenomenon is investing in a crypto wallet, with Best Wallet simply being the best there is. And it also has its very own token, the Best Wallet Token . With Best Wallet set to capture over 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2026, the $BEST token has become one of the hottest crypto presales in 2025. It supercharges the entire Best Wallet ecosystem, offering token holders a wealth of benefits. These include early access to high-potential projects, reduced transaction fees, voting rights for enhanced governance, and increased staking rewards. The $BEST presale ’s performance is only a confirmation of its huge potential. With over $9M in presale funding so far, the current price of $0.02385 per token offers an attractive entry point for early adopters. 3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – Offers a Safer Approach to Investing in Meme Coins Meme Index ($MEMEX) offers a less risky way to invest in meme coins, making it one of the most promising cryptos to include in your February portfolio. Simply put, it offers four baskets of meme coins, each with a different risk level, profit potential, and volatility. Depending on your risk appetite, you can choose a Meme Index basket. For instance, if the current market scenario makes you more conservative than usual, the Meme Titan Index, which contains the top 10 meme coins, will be ideal for you. However, if you’re a more aggressive investor and believe that a dip is worth capitalizing on, you can choose the Meme Frenzy Index, which is more risky but also more rewarding. $MEMEX is currently in presale and has already raised over $3M since its launch in December 2024. If you like how Meme Index simplifies meme coin investment and would like to benefit from its popularity, visit the $MEMEX website and buy it for just $0.0158443 each. Here’s how to buy it . 4. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) – Smelly Fun to Weather the Current Crypto Storm A token meant solely for amusement, it surprised a lot of investors that $FARTCOIN was among the very few meme coins that actually jumped during Trump’s tariff storm. It’s up by a whopping 13.78% in the last 24 hours, proving that tough times may come and go, but humor stays! Fartcoin is based on…well, farts! The project rewards token holders with free tokens if they submit fart jokes and memes. What’s more, even the creation of Fartcoin was unserious. Essentially, the project was an AI chatbot’s idea, but it wouldn’t have seen the light of day had an unknown developer not decided to take inspiration from the AI’s conversations. Although $FARTCOIN has taken a beating in the last month or so, it has formed a good-looking ascending triangle pattern – and a breakout over the $0.90–$1.00 zone could really send the coin soaring. 5. Dogecoin ($DOGE) – OG Meme Coin Ready to Rocket Another meme coin that has been unaffected by the recent crypto dip is the OG Dogecoin. It has, in fact, rallied more than 12% since yesterday, showing why it’s a great all-weather crypto. Interestingly, $DOGE is also a part of Meme Index ’s Meme Titan basket, which is a low-risk assortment of meme coins. This is further confirmation of Dogecoin’s stability. Moreover, a double bottom pattern suggests Dogecoin may lead crypto market gains this month . It’s currently trading at $0.26. Verdict Having mentioned the best crypto to buy now when the market is reevaluating itself, it’s very important that you’re careful because dips can be awfully notorious. None of the above is a substitute for financial advice, and you must only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing, as well as do your own research before investing your hard-earned money.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,MARKET|DOGE|BUSINESS|TRADING|SOL,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-04 07:54:31

XRP, dogecoin (DOGE), Solana’s SOL, and Cardano’s ADA are up nearly 3%. Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are nearly 4% higher. ""The U.S.-China tariff conflict could decrease the appetite for risk assets and further impact the positive sentiment that has been fueling a bull market in the crypto industry over the past year,"" Ben El-Baz, Managing Director of HashKey Global, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. ""The damage from the tariffs could still be made temporary if more crypto-friendly policies in the U.S. are set in motion,"" El-Baz added. Traders remain mixed on the long-term impact of China's retaliatory decisions, however, with markets hinging on the chance of a reversal or a prolonged drawdown if further actions against the country happen under Trump. ""Despite more people considering Bitcoin as digital gold, it still largely trades like a risk asset,"" Min Jung, research analyst at Prestro Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""As a result, China’s retaliatory 10% tariff on the U.S. is pressuring crypto, much like other global risk assets such as equities."" ""While today’s initial reaction may have been an overreaction, heightened volatility is likely to persist as markets digest further developments. The key question now is whether this move is primarily a negotiation tactic that could eventually be reversed—similar to what we saw with Canada and Mexico—or if it signals the start of a prolonged trade conflict, given that China has been a central focus of Trump’s rhetoric,"" Jung said. Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China led to a steep drop in bitcoin and broader equity markets on Monday, turning investors' focus from Trump's pro-crypto stance to immediate economic repercussions. Monday’s major liquidation event offered a ""buy-the-dip"" opportunity to traders, as a CoinDesk analysis noted, with the tariff announcements sparking interest in dollar-backed stablecoins as a hedge against economic uncertainty and currency volatility. However, the imposition of tariffs could lead to retaliatory measures from affected countries, potentially sparking a broader trade war and leading to further volatility across the crypto market in the days to come.",Markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|DOGE|XRP|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-04 07:59:00

The cryptocurrency’s price has surged 7.5% in the last 24 hours, recovering from its three-week low and leading some analysts to suggest the bleeding might be over. Related Reading: Ethereum Long-Term Bullish Structure At Risk – $2,700 Support Is Key for a $7K Target Solana Falls To Three-Week Low Over the weekend, Solana recorded a 27% price plunge from Friday’s highs to a three-week low of $175. This performance followed the overall market crash, fueled by the US president’s recently announced tariff on the country’s three biggest trading partners. On February 1, the white house revealed that Donald Trump was implementing new tariffs on imported goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. This measure was met with similar responses from the two neighboring countries, which announced they would implement tariffs on US imports. The fear of a global tariff war sparked a massive sell-off that saw Bitcoin’s price plummet to $91,200 and Ethereum’s price drop to $2,100. Additionally, the market registered at least $2.3 billion in liquidation, although Bybit’s CEO suggested the figure could be up to $10 billion. Solana lost the key $200 support zone and fell below $180 on Sunday night. As the market struggled, some analysts suggested that SOL’s price risked a deeper fall. Analyst Ali Martinez noted that SOL could retrace to $138 if it lost the $191 support from its multi-month ascending channel. Crypto trader Bluntz considers that losing the $220 support was “really bad” for the altcoin, as it resembled 2021’s bearish divergence sign. Additionally, it invalidated the “ABC from the highs” and made it look “more impulsive,” which would require a “miracle” to overcome it. SOL Must Hold These Levels Despite falling below the crucial levels, the cryptocurrency retested the $170-180 support zone and bounced from the $175 mark, attempting to break the $200 resistance in the following hours. Crypto analyst Jelle noted that Solana “retraced the TRUMP memecoin pump,” which saw SOL reclaim the $220 resistance and jump to its latest all-time high (ATH) of $295. However, Jelle considered that SOL’s structure “remained sound” during the drop and that its chart looked “very solid” as the cryptocurrency recovered on Monday morning. It’s worth noting that amid the market bleeding, Solana was among the cryptocurrencies that showed strength. SOL, like BTC, held its key horizontal levels, remaining within its post-US elections price range. Related Reading: BNB Bounce From $500: A Temporary Recovery Or Start Of A Rally? Martinez pointed out that “In the middle of this madness, the TD Sequential indicator presents a buy signal on the Solana daily chart.” Meanwhile, Miles Deutscher highlighted that BTC and SOL’s prices were “now higher than yesterday’s pre-liquidations,” noting the high volatility affecting the market. Moreover, Solana, alongside BTC and XRP, is among the only top 10 cryptocurrencies recording green numbers. Jelle considers that if SOL closes above the monthly and weekly supports between $200 and $210, it will continue its solid performance to retest the $240 resistance and see “another push for $300.” As of this writing, Solana is trading at $211, a 7.5% increase in the daily timeframe.

Late last month, Hayes predicted that BTC would drop to as low as $70,000 amid a slew of bearish macroeconomic and crypto signals before rallying to as high as $250,000. “Subtle movements between central bank balance sheet levels, the rate of banking credit expansion, the relationship between the US 10-yr treasury/stocks/Bitcoin prices, and the insane Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin price action produced a pit in my stomach. This is a similar feeling I got in late 2021, right before the bottom fell out of the crypto markets.” Following the severe pullback witnessed over the weekend, Hayes says the correction in crypto will likely continue “until morale improves.” According to the crypto veteran, the downside price action will only stop once the traditional financial (TradFi) industry is on the brink of collapse. At that point, Hayes believes that the Fed would ease monetary policy and give TradFi firms some relief. “The pain stops when a TradFi outfit is on the verge of bankruptcy. Then the Fed reluctantly joins team Trump and prints that money. And then you better be ready to buy crypto like you have never bought before.” Looking at Solana ( SOL ), Hayes says that the altcoin can drop to a level last seen in November of last year. “And they said you would never be able to buy SOL At time of writing, SOL is worth $216.

In a viral thread that has reached millions of views, ZachXBT and zeroShadow web3 security investigator tanuki42 compiled reports from Coinbase users who lost their funds in a series of social engineering scams throughout December 2024 up until January 2025. After gathering Coinbase withdrawals reports from X users via direct messages, the duo concluded that at least $65 million have been stolen from Coinbase user accounts during a two-month period. Though, Zach claims this estimation is likely much lower than the actual number, as it does not include Coinbase support tickets and police reports. Zach predicts that if these scams persist, Coinbase users could stand to lose more than $300 million per year due to falling for social engineering scams. Crypto.news has reached out to Coinbase for comment, but has yet to receive a response. 1/ Over the past few months I imagine you have seen many Coinbase users complain on X about their accounts suddenly being restricted. This is the result of aggressive risk models and Coinbase’s failure to stop its users losing $300M+ per year to social engineering scams. pic.twitter.com/PjtX7vmjqc — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) February 3, 2025 You might also like: ZachXBT awarded with tokenized fundraising coin for his work In the past few months, dozens of Coinbase users have complained online about their accounts getting suddenly restricted. Something the exchange has dubbed “FUD/misinformation,” claiming that the surge of new users and old users reactivating their accounts after the U.S. election has led to an increase of fraudulent attempts by up to three fold. “Our fraud-prevention systems are acting as expected and have saved customers tens of millions in losses in November alone,” wrote Coinbase Support. However, Zach said these restrictions were the direct result of “aggressive risk models and Coinbase’s failure to stop its users losing $300M+ per year to social engineering scams.” Scammers posing as Coinbase support Social engineering scammers steal funds from Coinbase users by calling them on a spoofed number and telling them their account has been compromised. The scammer would then send a fake email from Coinbase with a fake case ID, instructing the victim to transfer funds into a Coinbase wallet while “support” verified their account security. The link on the fake email would lead them to a cloned Coinbase site, which allows scammers to send different prompts to the target via spoofed emails using panels. ZachXBT said Coinbase has failed to properly “diagnose the actual problem” but has also acknowledged some of the things the crypto exchange has done well, such as providing recovery tools for users who deposit unsupported assets and providing a good stablecoin yielding and on-ramp/off-ramp mechanisms. He urged Coinbase to consider making phone numbers optional for advanced users with authenticator apps, creating an app specifically for beginners or elderly users that does not allow withdrawals, improving community outreach, as well as taking legal action against the U.S. based scammers and TransUnion for negligence on behalf of users as it’s the primary tool used by cybercriminals. “Coinbase needs to urgently make changes as more and more users are being scammed for tens of millions every month,” said ZachXBT.

The rapid Ethereum ( ETH ) recovery followed a post-tariff crypto market bloodbath on Feb. 3, which saw Ether plummet to a low of approximately $2,300, and was fueled by Eric Trump’s bullish endorsement of Ethereum in his recent post on X. That being said, Ethereum had already started rebounding to around $2,700 after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a temporary halt on proposed trade tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Eric Trump’s post was a just catalyst, fueling the second half of the rally.

The Ethereum’s sharp rebound follows the World Liberty Financial ’s sudden and near-total liquidation of its crypto treasury—shedding over 90% of its $363 million holdings, including significant positions in ETH, WBTC, AAVE, ENA, and LINK on Feb. 3. The team moved most of its assets to Coinbase Prime and other exchange wallets, often routing through intermediary addresses, as reported by The Block . Meanwhile, the project has been receiving small ETH deposits from newly created or inactive wallets. As of now, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,720, with an intraday high of around $2,900 and a low of approximately $2,500.
