A shift is happening—Ethereum and Shiba Inu holders are starting to explore something new in the form of a new meme coin.

Now, fresh changes are sweeping the markets, especially from the meme coins and some Ethereum holders are looking for new opportunities. With the recent uncertainty of Ethereum price predictions, investors are beginning to explore alternative high-growth opportunities beyond ETH. Shiba Inu is also going through a rough patch on the price charts.

Even though Ethereum and Shiba Inu are leading in the DeFi and meme coin spaces, respectively, they face tough competition from newer entries in the market. With ongoing debates about the ETH price forecast for the coming years, investors are seeking assets with greater growth potential. A notable shift is taking place—Ethereum and Shiba Inu investors are turning their attention to an emerging meme coin. Ethereum and Shiba Inu Backers Seek Out a Fresh Meme Coin Ethereum transformed the DeFi landscape through its smart contracts and dApps, elevating its ETH token to the top of the altcoin hierarchy. However, recent shifts, particularly within the meme coin sector, have prompted some Ethereum enthusiasts to explore new opportunities. With the current unpredictability of Ethereum 's price projections, investors are venturing beyond ETH in search of high-growth alternatives. Shiba Inu is also experiencing turbulence in its price trends. Despite broadening its ecosystem, Shiba Inu traders are facing challenges as the meme coin is currently experiencing a 35.8% monthly decline. To recoup their losses, many Shiba Inu investors are now scouting for new projects that might be the best coins to invest in.

With a promise of a whooping 100x returns post-listing, this token is capturing the attention of Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) investors eager for the next big breakout. As momentum builds, many believe 1Fuel is the new crypto to buy before it skyrockets. Meanwhile, fresh ADA news points to shifting investor strategies, with seasoned traders scouting for emerging opportunities. Could 1Fuel be the catalyst for a major market shake-up this February? The growing excitement suggests something huge is on the horizon. 1Fuel Crypto Revolution: Why Solana & Cardano Investors Are Excited About This New Token 1Fuel is set to redefine decentralized finance (DeFi) by addressing some of its biggest challenges with its innovative features. With seamless cross-chain transactions and cutting-edge privacy tools, 1Fuel is positioned to meet the growing demand for smarter and more efficient DeFi platforms. This isn’t just another crypto project; it’s a force driving the crypto revolution. Its innovative revenue-sharing model and staking rewards offering up to 30% APR makes 1Fuel a standout opportunity for passive long-term growth. These features, combined with the surging interest from Solana and Cardano communities, make 1Fuel a major player in the DeFi space, one that’s ready to lead the charge in the upcoming months. The 1Fuel token (OFT) presale is already turning heads, with over 174 million tokens sold and over $1.77M raised . Early investors are already enjoying 70% returns on their initial investments. As the token remains priced at an attractive $0.017, many are rushing to secure their share before the price climbs. This presale has become one of the most talked-about events in DeFi, sparking excitement among investors who see the potential for explosive growth in February. Cardano News: ADA's Market Moves Stir Investor Excitement Amid 1Fuel's Rise February is shaping up to be a great month for Cardano, as recent news highlights its strategic push to enhance ecosystem liquidity and scalability. With the integration of USDC and the rollout of other key upgrades, ADA is positioning itself as a major player in the crypto revolution. These strategic decisions are crucial as ADA's price dynamics continue to change and influence investor sentiment and market positioning. Cardano has also been making headlines with its recent market performance. As of February 2, 2025, ADA is trading at around $0.3125 , a 3.84% increase over the last 24 hours. This surge in ADA's price action has sparked mixed reactions in the crypto community, especially as the broader market witnesses serious developments from projects like 1Fuel. Solana Price Shake-Up: Why Investors Are Watching 1Fuel This February Solana’s price action has been quite a thing of interest lately. SOL price took a hit recently, dipping 7.96% in the past 24 hours to around $193.45 . While some traders see this as a warning sign, savvy investors know better—market pullbacks often set the stage for massive comebacks. With February shaping up to be a big month for crypto, SOL’s next move is one to watch out for. What’s got traders on edge? A looming short squeeze could liquidate up to $220 million in short positions, forcing the SOL price to surge. If this plays out, Solana bulls could have the last laugh. Conclusion With SOL price showing volatility and Cardano news sparking fresh investor interest, now is the perfect time to get in on 1Fuel’s presale.

Fast-forward to today, its growth has slowed, and many question whether ADA can recreate its glory days. Meanwhile, Elluminex, a new DeFi platform launching on the TON blockchain, offers a bold vision for the crypto space with its advanced features. If you’re looking for the next big opportunity, this might be it. ADA Drops Over 60% Cardano is a third-generation proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform that emphasizes scalability, interoperability, and sustainability for decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. The platform has undergone several development phases, introducing new features to enhance its functionality and performance. In 2021, Cardano's native cryptocurrency, ADA, experienced significant price appreciation, reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $3.09. However, the growth was not sustained, indicating reduced interest. As of press time, ADA is trading at $0.9648, a 68.7767% decrease from its ATH. Recent analyses suggest that ADA’s resistance at $1.09 prevents an upward breakout. Some speculators believe ADA could rally past $2 in the first quarter of 2025, provided it overcomes current resistance levels and attracts renewed interest. However, impatient holders are shifting focus to promising projects like Elluminex. Elluminex To Outperform Cardano Cardano has lagged due to its slower ecosystem development, but Elluminex delivers immediate, practical solutions for DeFi. It comprises a decentralized exchange (DEX), staking, farming, cross-chain bridging, and early token launch access—all designed to create value from day one. While Cardano focuses on building its ecosystem, Elluminex bridges the gap between over 40 blockchain networks. This cross-chain interoperability enables seamless liquidity flow and asset transfers, giving it a significant edge in attracting users from established networks like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Solana. Additionally, Elluminex is introducing advanced tools like an AI-powered portfolio tracker to simplify the DeFi experience. The goal is to make trading, staking, and portfolio management more intuitive for novice and experienced users. The ELX token is central to the platform, providing rewards for staking, liquidity, and ecosystem participation. As Elluminex gains traction, early adopters of the token will benefit from price appreciation, rewards, and exclusive access to new projects launched on TON. Elluminex currently offers a presale for ELX tokens, allowing traders to buy in at a discounted price before it launches on exchanges. This is an opportunity to secure an early position in a token with high potential.

However, as we look at the present, its momentum has slowed considerably, leaving many to wonder if ADA can ever return to its former peak. Meanwhile, Elluminex is entering the scene as a fresh DeFi platform on the TON blockchain, bringing a daring new approach with its cutting-edge features. For those seeking the next major opportunity, this could be a prime candidate. ADA Experiences Over 60% Decline Cardano is recognized as a third-generation proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform, with a focus on scalability, interoperability, and sustainability for decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Through several stages of development, the platform has introduced multiple features to boost its capabilities and performance. Back in 2021, Cardano's native coin, ADA, saw a remarkable increase in value, peaking at an all-time high (ATH) of $3.09. However, this rapid growth was not maintained, signaling waning interest. Currently, ADA is valued at $0.9648, reflecting a 68.7767% drop from its ATH. Recent studies indicate that the $1.09 resistance level is preventing ADA from breaking upward. Some analysts speculate that ADA might surpass $2 in the first quarter of 2025 if it manages to overcome current resistance barriers and regain investor interest. Nonetheless, impatient investors are turning their attention to innovative projects like Elluminex. Why Elluminex Might Surpass Cardano Cardano has fallen behind due to its slower ecosystem development, whereas Elluminex provides immediate, tangible solutions for DeFi. It includes a decentralized exchange (DEX), staking, farming, cross-chain bridging, and early access to token launches—all aimed at generating value right from the start. While Cardano is still building its ecosystem, Elluminex connects more than 40 blockchain networks. This cross-chain interoperability allows for smooth liquidity movement and asset transfers, making it appealing to users from established networks like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Solana. Moreover, Elluminex is rolling out advanced features like an AI-driven portfolio tracker to simplify the DeFi experience. The aim is to make trading, staking, and portfolio management easier for both beginners and seasoned users. The ELX token plays a critical role in the platform, offering rewards for staking, liquidity provision, and ecosystem involvement. As Elluminex gains momentum, early ELX token adopters stand to benefit from price increases, rewards, and exclusive access to new projects launching on TON. Elluminex is currently holding a presale for ELX tokens, giving traders an opportunity to purchase them at a reduced price before they hit the exchanges.

Per Energy Kyungjae , the city – in Gyeonggi Province – will launch “its own electronic virtual asset seizing system.” South Korean City to Strike Out on Its Own in Hunt for Tax Dodgers’ Crypto Crypto trading is not yet subject to taxation in South Korea. However, Seoul has given local tax bodies the right to seize crypto belonging to “habitual” or “large-scale” residents who fail to pay local levies. The South Korean city of Gwacheon. (Source: NordNordWest [edited][CC BY-SA 3.0 DE]) Until recently, Gwacheon used IT solutions operated by the wider Gyeonggi Province to identify crypto wallets belonging to tax delinquents living in the city. Tax officers used the solution to scan domestic crypto exchange wallet data. When they identified wallets belonging to Gwacheon-resident tax offenders, they could then seize coins. In some cases, residents have then followed up by settling their outstanding tax bills. In others, the province has liquidated the coins. It has then handed fiat over to the city. But Gwacheon’s move to launch its own IT solution, independent of Gyeonggi Province’s own solution, suggests smaller cities and counties could look to expand the reach of their tax evasion crackdowns. The city has a population of 85,397, per the Korea Ministry of the Interior and Safety’s 2024 statistics. South Korea's digital media landscape has expanded at a breakneck pace, but the surge in numbers masks deep structural problems, recent government data shows. https://t.co/oXai3RgUDg — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) February 3, 2025 Gwacheon Targets 361 ‘Tax Evaders’ Gwacheon said its solution would go online next month. Officials said that it would follow up with “full-scale collection procedures starting in the first half of 2025.” These have already yielded significant results. In the past five years, Gwacheon says it has seized crypto worth approximately 300 million won (just under $205,000) from tax dodgers. South Korea’s Acting President Choi Sang-mok met with local exporters and vowed support for them following Donald Trump’s announcement of tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico. https://t.co/KpR7kmkIO5 — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) February 3, 2025 Gwacheon tax officials confiscated over a third of this amount in 2024, a further sign that the city is becoming more efficient in its crypto-collection measures. The city said that it was responding to a sharp rise in crypto-related activity in Gwacheon and beyond. As such, it said, the city has noticed an increase in “cases of virtual assets being used as a means of hiding delinquents’ assets.” Gwacheon says it will focus on searching for crypto wallets belonging to “361 residents who have failed to pay more than 3 million won [just over $2,000] in local taxes.” The city said the group owes Gwacheon over $12.8 million worth of taxes. “We will ensure the tax system is fair by taking strong responses to tax delinquents. We will actively block tax evasion by seizing virtual assets.” Gwacheon Tax Division Head Kang Min-ah South Korean city authorities in places like Goyang have also begun using similar solutions to seize crypto belonging to residents with outstanding traffic fines .

Solana (SOL) has been making waves with some impressive price movements, surging by almost 50% of its value in mid January. Meanwhile, a newcomer has been racking up attention in the PayFi space as it promises to address issues in the global payments sector. This project goes by the name Remittix (RTX) , and has amassed more than $10 million in just a few weeks of presale. So why is Remittix seeing so much attention, and will Solana see more price surges this year? Solana (SOL) Prepares For Hyperledger Solang Project Solana (SOL) is trading at $228 after a 8% dip in the last week. However, Solana’s immense surge in mid January means that its net gain still stands at 20% for the month. On the horizon for Solana is the Hyperledger Solang project that has opened Solana up to Ethereum's Solidity developers, providing a new way for them to build on the platform. Technical analysis is promising for Solana, suggesting that if buyers can push the price above $260, bullish momentum may resume, potentially targeting the $300 level and beyond. However, failure to maintain current support levels could lead to further declines before any potential upward movement. Remittix Creates New Possibilities in the PayFi Space Remittix (RTX) is catching fire as investors take notice of its bold entry into the cross-border payments space. The project aims to remove the inefficiencies that plague traditional financial systems, allowing users to swap over 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT and transfer money to any global bank account. Unlike banks and outdated payment providers that stack on hidden fees, Remittix keeps it simple with flat-rate pricing, ensuring that recipients get exactly what was sent. The Remittix Pay API is of great help to businesses, simplifying crypto transactions by letting companies accept digital payments while automatically settling in FIAT. This is a powerful capability for freelancers, e-commerce merchants and international enterprises that are looking to benefit from crypto without being affected by market volatility. Another feature that sets Remittix (RTX) apart is its privacy. Every transaction is processed as a standard bank transfer, meaning the recipient has no idea the payment originally started as crypto. This level of discretion is becoming increasingly rare in financial systems, making Remittix an attractive option for users who value control over their transactions. Remittix Dominates In Presale, Surpassing $10 Million Raised The $RTX token fuels the entire ecosystem, serving as the backbone for staking, governance and platform rewards. With a hard cap of 1.5 billion tokens, scarcity is built into its framework, making early accumulation potentially lucrative. Right now, $RTX tokens are priced at $0.521 in presale and over $10 million has already been raised. Crypto analysts are eyeing massive gains, predicting an 800% jump before the presale ends and another rally post-launch. As Remittix (RTX) gains traction in the $190 trillion cross-border payments industry, it’s shaping up to be one of the biggest crypto disruptors of 2025.

Solana (SOL) is making headlines with notable price increases, having jumped nearly 50% in value around mid-January. Meanwhile, a new player is gaining traction in the PayFi arena, aiming to tackle challenges in international payments. This project, known as Remittix (RTX) , has already gathered over $10 million in just a few weeks of its presale. So, what’s driving the buzz around Remittix, and could Solana experience further price hikes this year? Solana (SOL) Gears Up For the Hyperledger Solang Initiative Solana (SOL) is currently valued at $228 following an 8% decline over the past week. Despite this setback, the significant rise seen in mid-January keeps its monthly gain at 20%. Looking ahead, Solana is set to benefit from the Hyperledger Solang project, which has opened doors for Ethereum's Solidity developers to build on its platform, offering new opportunities. Technical indicators are optimistic for Solana, indicating that if the price is pushed above $260 by buyers, it could reignite a bullish trend, potentially aiming for the $300 mark and beyond. However, failing to sustain current support levels might lead to further drops before any upward recovery. Remittix Unlocks Fresh Opportunities in the PayFi Sector Remittix (RTX) is rapidly gaining ground as investors recognize its ambitious entry into the cross-border payments domain. The project seeks to eliminate inefficiencies plaguing traditional financial routes, enabling users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT and send funds to any global bank account. In contrast to banks and outdated payment services that impose hidden charges, Remittix offers straightforward flat-rate pricing, ensuring that recipients receive the exact amount sent. The Remittix Pay API is a valuable tool for businesses, streamlining crypto transactions by allowing firms to accept digital payments with automatic FIAT settlements. This feature is incredibly beneficial for freelancers, online retailers, and international companies looking to embrace crypto without being affected by market fluctuations. Another standout aspect of Remittix (RTX) is its focus on privacy. Each transaction is processed as a regular bank transfer, so the recipient is unaware that the payment originated in cryptocurrency. This level of confidentiality is increasingly rare in financial systems, making Remittix appealing to users who prioritize control over their transactions. Remittix Takes the Lead in Presale, Exceeding $10 Million in Funds Raised The $RTX token is central to the ecosystem, acting as the foundation for staking, governance, and platform incentives. With a limited supply of 1.5 billion tokens, built-in scarcity could make early acquisition profitable. Currently, $RTX tokens are available for $0.521 during the presale, with over $10 million already secured. Crypto experts are forecasting substantial gains, anticipating an 800% increase before the presale concludes and further growth after launch. As Remittix (RTX) gains momentum in the $190 trillion cross-border payments market, it’s emerging as a potential major disruptor in the crypto world by 2025.

While Dogecoin once led the industry, newer projects like Panshibi ($SHIBI) are gaining attention. This rising token blends Asian culture, memes and technology, proving Dogecoin (DOGE) is no longer the only major player and that meme coins are evolving beyond internet jokes. Panshibi: The Meme Coin Revolution Taking Over Panshibi is quickly emerging as the next big meme coin set to dominate the scene in 2025. Combining Asia’s massive crypto community with the universal appeal of pandas, Panshibioffers a unique twist on the traditional meme coin model. Unlike Dogecoin and other meme coins, Panshibi incorporates SocialFi and AI, providing holders with interactive quests, rewards and governance rights. The $SHIBI token powers this ecosystem, offering investors high-yield staking opportunities of up to 1,200% APY and exclusive perks for early adopters. The presale is priced at just $0.004, but this won’t last long. As demand grows, the price will rise to $0.005 and continue increasing with each new stage. For those seeking the top meme coins to invest in, Panshibi is a worthy option. The presale is capped at $10 million and lasts only 60 days. During this period, the price is set to increase by 1,200%, with post-launch projections predicting a staggering 145,000% rise. Early investors will also gain access to the exclusive Bamboo Private VIP Club, unlocking additional rewards and benefits. Security and transparency are top priorities for Panshibi. The project has passed a full smart contract audit with Coinsult, ensuring investor confidence. The liquidity pool will be locked for 10 years and team tokens will remain inaccessible for 2 years, ensuring long-term stability. With time running out, now is the moment to act. Don't miss your chance to join the presale and secure your place before prices surge. Dogecoin Faces Pressure As Market Dynamics Shift Dogecoin (DOGE), once a top contender in the meme coin space, is now feeling significant pressure as newer projects like Panshibi gain traction. The Dogecoin price is now trading at $0.276 , down by 21.6% over the last week and almost 27% on the monthly trends. Analysts project that this dip could continue into the new month if the bulls don’t gain control of the Dogecoin price, with prices potentially hitting $0.25 by the end of February. The Dogecoin market is currently on a predominately bearish course, as represented by the price reading of the Fear & Greed Index. Though benefitting from various high-profile endorsements, Dogecoin finds itself taken over in popularity by the likes of newer meme coins with a utility focus, such as Panshibi. The Future Of Meme Coins: Why Panshibi Stands Out As DOGE news today highlights, the meme coin market is shifting and Dogecoin faces increasing pressure. Since the Dogecoin price has dropped to $0.276, analysts predict further declines may happen. This trend, combined with bearish sentiment, suggests Dogecoin's dominance may be slipping. Investors are now looking at newer projects like Panshibi that provide more innovative features, leaving Dogecoin (DOGE) under pressure in a changing market. Panshibi is a project with a unique combination of SocialFi, AI technology and cultural relevance.

Last week Monday, the fallout from the DeepSeek AI model launch hit the crypto market hard, sending the flagship crypto, Bitcoin, below $100,000. However, it recovered above the $100,000 mark before the week ended. The story is similar this week as markets plunged to historic depths thanks to trepidation caused by President Donald Trump’s tariff threats. Even though Bitcoin dipped as low as $91,000, it has already reclaimed the $100,000 at the time of publication. Notably, one aspect of the market that has stayed immune to this volatility is the RWA sector. The merits of tokenization are just now coming to light, and it is still a severely undervalued sector in its infancy. It also stands to gain from the regulatory clarity that the Trump administration is expected to bring to crypto as various jurisdictions have even started developing frameworks. According to data from RWA.xyz , a site that provides analytics on tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) like stablecoins, tokenized US Treasuries, bonds, cash equivalents, and other commodities (like gold, silver, and oil), the sector has been growing steadily. The total value of tokenized real-world assets (RWA) on-chain is now $17.10 billion, which reflects a 10.02% increase over the past 30 days. Holders have increased to 82,978, with a total of 112 issuers. Over the same 30-day period, the premier crypto BTC only rose about 2% while ETH fell by over 20% while enduring wide volatility swings in between. Other altcoins have suffered even more, and investor confidence dips and surges with price. The global RWA market is up and to the right According to data from RWA.xyz, the market cap of stablecoins is currently at $213.86 billion, having experienced a 4.84% increase in the last month. Meanwhile the monthly transfer volume is $3.35 trillion, down almost 28% from 30 days ago, and the number of holders has surpassed 140M. The largest issuer remains Tether, with Circle in second place and Ethena in third. Leading tokenized assets include USDT at $138.50 billion, USDC at $52.20 billion, and USYC at $1.20 billion. RWA market overview. Source: RWA.xyz The institutional funds section of the data monitors tokenized alternatives such as hedge funds, venture capital, private equity, and private credit. It holds a total value of $410.49 million, up 11.52% from 30 days ago. There are currently 8,343 asset holders and 48 monthly active addresses participating in the tokenized institutional funds market. Private credit data focuses on the tokenization of private credit loans. According to data, active and total loan values are now at $11.81 billion and $21.49 billion, respectively, with a current average APR of 10.10%. The loans now total 2,414, with a bulk of them on the Provenance and Ethereum network. Tokenized commodities include digital assets pegged to commodities like gold, silver, and oil. It has a $1.14 billion market cap, with a monthly transfer volume of over $400 million. There are also 3,630 monthly active addresses and nearly 60,000 holders now. While precious metal products are already available, agricultural and oil & gas products are expected to be included soon. RWAs as a diversification strategy While Ethereum has underperformed in the bull run, the network holds the top spot in terms of RWA tokenization activities. It currently leads with 67 RWAs valued at $3.77 billion. ZKsync Era follows with 28 RWAs valued at $1.93 billion and Arbitrum follows with 20 assets and a $75.84 billion valuation. Other networks with RWAs include Polygon and Base, both with 19 assets each. Polygon has a $181.35 million valuation, while Base lags behind with a $51.54 million. Solana, currently one of the hottest networks because it is home to the top-performing memecoins, has not done so well with RWAs. It has only three, valued at $135.47 million. More investors are increasingly looking into RWAs as a way to diversify their portfolios and interact with tokenized versions of real-world assets. RWAs cover tangible assets like real estate, commodities, and infrastructure. These assets usually have different risk profiles relative to traditional financial assets. Some RWAs can help manage risk by reducing exposure to market volatility. They are also known to have low correlation with stocks and bonds, which makes them some sort of buffer against market downturns. Tokenized versions of commodities like gold can also be used as shields against inflation and currency devaluation. Many of them also generate regular income, such as rental income from real estate or dividends from infrastructure projects.

While Dogecoin once led the industry, newer projects like Panshibi ($SHIBI) are gaining attention. This rising token blends Asian culture, memes and technology, proving Dogecoin (DOGE) is no longer the only major player and that meme coins are evolving beyond internet jokes. Panshibi: Leading the Charge in the Meme Coin Revolution Panshibi is rapidly positioning itself as the meme coin to watch in 2025. By merging Asia's vast crypto audience with the charming appeal of pandas, Panshibi presents a novel spin on the conventional meme coin framework. Unlike Dogecoin and its counterparts, Panshibi integrates SocialFi and AI to offer holders interactive missions, rewards, and governance privileges. The $SHIBI token fuels this framework, delivering high-yield staking options up to 1,200% APY and special bonuses for early supporters. The presale is set at a price of $0.004, but this rate will rise as demand increases, going up to $0.005 and beyond with each presale stage. For those on the lookout for top meme coins for investment, Panshibi stands out as a strong contender. The presale is limited to $10 million and is open for just 60 days. During this time, the price is expected to surge by 1,200%, with post-launch estimates forecasting a jaw-dropping 145,000% increase. Early backers will also have the chance to join the exclusive Bamboo Private VIP Club, unlocking further rewards and incentives. Security and transparency remain core commitments for Panshibi.

The liquidity pool will be locked for a decade, and team tokens will be inaccessible for two years, supporting long-term security. Time is of the essence; seize the opportunity to join the presale before prices escalate. Dogecoin Feels the Strain as Market Dynamics Evolve Dogecoin (DOGE), once a leading figure in the meme coin realm, now faces intense competition from newcomers like Panshibi. The Dogecoin price currently stands at $0.276 , reflecting a 21.6% drop over the past week and a nearly 27% decline over the month. Experts suggest this downward trend might persist into the next month if the bulls fail to regain control over the Dogecoin price, potentially dipping to $0.25 by the end of February. Currently, the Dogecoin market is largely bearish, as indicated by the Fear & Greed Index. Despite benefiting from several high-profile endorsements, Dogecoin is now overshadowed by newer, utility-focused meme coins like Panshibi. The Future of Meme Coins: Panshibi's Unique Edge Today's DOGE news underscores a changing meme coin landscape, with Dogecoin experiencing mounting pressure. As the Dogecoin price slips to $0.276, analysts foresee further reductions. This pattern, combined with a bearish outlook, suggests Dogecoin's supremacy may be waning. Investors are turning to newer ventures like Panshibi that offer more advanced features, placing Dogecoin (DOGE) under strain in this evolving market.

Its rapid transaction capabilities and successful presale have experts predicting a potential 100x surge, making it a standout investment amid shifting market dynamics. Dogecoin (DOGE) Catches Whales’ Attention Amid ETF Buzz In the past week, crypto whales snapped up over 560 million DOGE , hinting at renewed confidence in its future. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted this trend, pointing to the steady accumulation as a sign that big players are eyeing potential gains. This shift follows a sharp sell-off, which makes the timing interesting. On-chain data reveals long-term holders quietly adding to their positions, suggesting that sentiment might be turning bullish. Historically, these accumulation patterns often appear before major price moves, so the market is watching closely. Even more exciting is a fresh filing for a spot Dogecoin ETF. The SEC has started reviewing the proposal under its 19b-4 process, with an initial decision expected within 45 days of its publication in the Federal Register. If needed, the review could stretch to 90 days. Should the SEC give the green light, Grayscale would join other major firms offering crypto-based ETFs alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. If a spot Dogecoin ETF is approved, it would be a huge milestone. It would push DOGE into the financial mainstream and reshape how investors view meme coins. As regulatory decisions unfold, DOGE holders will watch closely, eager to see how this chapter plays out. 1Fuel (OFT) Redefines the crypto trading experience 1Fuel (OFT) is starting to turn heads, for a good reason. Unlike most projects that stick to the same old formula, 1Fuel focuses on making crypto trading simple. No more juggling different wallets for every coin. Just one place to manage everything hassle-free. Security is a guaranteed feature, but 1Fuel goes beyond the basics. It offers disposable wallets, smart encryption layers, and a privacy mixer that keeps transactions under the radar. For anyone worried about safety, it’s like having a digital vault. What’s interesting is how it blends DeFi tools with AI. Predicting market shifts, automating trades, and flagging suspicious activity are handled effortlessly. This isn’t just another wallet; it’s a full-on crypto command center. The peer-to-peer setup means traders have no middlemen, which means lower fees and faster trades. Plus, there’s the cool factor of having crypto cards, both virtual and physical, that work like regular debit and credit cards. Add staking rewards up to 30% APR, and it is easy to understand why crypto communities are abuzz. At its core, 1Fuel isn't attempting to redefine crypto trading; it is making it smarter, quicker, and safer. 1Fuel Launches Presale with $1.7 Million Raised—Is This the Next 100x Crypto? 1Fuel’s (OFT) presale is gaining serious traction. Over 170 million tokens have been sold, raising more than $1.7 million. At just $0.017 per token, OFT offers an early entry point before its anticipated 100x surge post-launch. As 1Fuel gears up for its public debut, investors see this as a rare chance to secure massive gains. Ready to get in early?

Although miners play a critical role in the growth of Bitcoin, a lot of risk and operational expenses are involved. Purchasing mining hardware and acquiring land for facilities is expensive . Miners also struggle to maintain revenue due to the volatility of Bitcoin (BTC) . Hashrate Derivative Products Gain Interest Bitcoin miners today are therefore exploring new ways to ensure that their operations remain profitable. One of these ways is through the financialization of Bitcoin mining hashrate . For this week's Forwards Market update, both USD and BTC contracts are trading in backwardation. The hashrate forward market is pricing in an average hashprice of $55.25 (0.00054 BTC) over the next six months. pic.twitter.com/rVlYs5M7G2 — Luxor Technology (@luxor) February 3, 2025 Andy Fajar Handika, CEO of Loka Mining, told Cryptonews that “hashrate derivatives” allow Bitcoin miners to hedge against fluctuations in mining revenue by locking in a fixed price for their future hashrate. “This means that miners can secure predictable cash flows regardless of Bitcoin’s price volatility or changes in network difficulty,” Fajar Handika said. How Miners Can Sell Future Hashrate For example, Loka Protocol is a platform that enables Bitcoin miners to sell their future hashrate in the form of tokenized mining contracts. Fajar Handika explained that these contracts function similarly to commodity futures in traditional markets. “Just like corn farmers hedge against crop price fluctuations, Bitcoin miners can sell hashrate contracts upfront to secure capital while investors gain exposure to mining rewards without operating hardware,” he said. Source: Loka This concept reduces risk for both parties, while making mining financing more accessible. Ryan Condron, CEO of Titan.io, told Cryptonews that hashpower marketplace Lumerin offers a decentralized ecosystem for miners to sell off their hashpower for up to 7 days in the future. Bitcoin mining hashpower can then be traded by Lumerin users on-chain. Aaron Foster, director of business development at Luxor Technology, told Cryptonews that Luxor also offers a “Non-Deliverable Forward” (NDF) product that allows miners to take a position on hashprice. “This lets miners effectively lock in 1-12 month revenue certainty for their mining operations (this product is also available to non-miners as well),” Foster said. “Miners are naturally long Bitcoin (hashprice), so taking a position and locking in a price to create revenue certainty makes sense.” Foster believes that hashrate derivatives will likely extend the lifetime of mining operations by reducing exposure to short-term downturns. Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Derivatives Critical With Rising Bitcoin Price It’s also interesting to point out that as the price of Bitcoin rises, hashrate derivatives are becoming more important. Fajar Handika explained that as more miners enter the market, the Bitcoin network faces increasing difficulty . This makes it harder for existing miners to maintain profitability. “Hashrate derivatives provide upfront liquidity that allows Bitcoin miners to buy new hardware and expand operations,” he said. Financializing hashrate may also reduce the need for miners to sell off their BTC over time. “Instead of selling mined Bitcoin at lower prices to cover operational costs, miners can use forward hashrate contracts to secure capital without giving up their BTC holdings,” Fajar Handika remarked. Echoing this, Foster noted that miners who hedge their exposure to hashprice volatility as a percentage of their operational costs will lock in longer-term profit margins before a depressed hashprice market develops. “These instruments allow miners to hedge against hashprice volatility, making mining more predictable and financing easier,” he commented. Hashrate Derivative Products Gain Traction While hashrate derivatives have been a known concept for a few years, industry experts believe that this is finally catching on for both Bitcoin miners and institutions. Speaking about the topic at The North American Blockchain Summit (NABS) in November last year, Condron stated, “This is very much the next stage in this market for evolution and maturity. The financialization of hashpower needs to be treated more as a commodity than a hobby.” Foster – who was also on the derivatives panel at NABS – further remarked that institutions want to buy hashrate to get exposure to this asset class. He explained that this is why Luxor created its NDF product. “We created that product to service the institutional side to allow them access to the product without having to go through the hurdles of setting up on the physical side,” he said. Luxor’s end of year summary report for 2024 notes that its hashrate derivative product witnessed exponential growth. The report states that last year Luxor’s hashrate derivatives were used by public and private miners, prop trading funds, financiers, market makers, hosting providers, hashrate marketplaces, and ASIC brokers. “On the business side, we onboarded 30 new clients into our markets and traded $65 million in notional USD, settling about 1.2EH per day on average,” the report states. Source: Luxor It’s further documented that interest from miners and traditional finance communities reached a record high at the end of 2024. As a result, Luxor has continued to expand its product offering by increasing its tenures to 12 months in duration. The company also recently launched hashrate exchange-traded futures. Additionally, last week Grayscale announced the launch of a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering exposure to Bitcoin mining . Known as “Grayscale Bitcoin Miners ETF” (MNRS), the fund specifically invests in companies that comprise the Indxx Bitcoin Miners Index. This is a proprietary index designed to measure the performance of global Bitcoin mining companies that generate the majority of their revenue from Bitcoin mining or mining-related hardware, software, services, and projects. Key Hurdles for Miners and Institutions While hashrate derivatives are becoming more popular, challenges may prevent some miners and institutions from using these products. Fajar Handika pointed out that this is likely due to a lack of education around these offerings. “Many miners are unfamiliar with these products and may hesitate to use them,” he said. Liquidity concerns also remain, as Fajar Handika noted that investors must be willing to buy hashrate contracts, but if demand is low, pricing may not be favorable for miners. Moreover, decentralized derivative solutions – like the product offering from Loka Protocol – are subject to smart contract risks. Yet while challenges remain, Condron believes that all miners will eventually start to sell their hashpower. “This may be to a global hashpower ‘grid’ or mining pool. Countries, banks, and large corporations will bid against each other to buy up the hashpower in order to mine blocks and process transactions on the BTC network,” he said. Condron added that while hashrate derivatives may be a “less sexy” part of the ecosystem, miners need to start hedging strategies to generate predictable revenue regardless of market volatility. “This will help stabilize the entire ecosystem as Bitcoin continues to become part of the world’s core economic architecture,” he said.

Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is the latest buzz in the crypto world, offering incredible opportunities for early investors. As meme coins continue to make waves, APC has been steadily building momentum, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts eager to discover the next big thing. With the presale underway, investors are rushing to get a piece of the action as the project’s unique features start to shine. Meanwhile, the crypto sphere is abuzz with new developments surrounding ANDY and Osaka Protocol. ANDY is forging new partnerships that could boost its presence in the space, while Osaka Protocol is steadily advancing towards its next milestones. But today, we’re diving deeper into the exciting world of Arctic Pablo Coin. This article will cover the developments and updates of all 3 coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, ANDY, and Osaka Protocol. Arctic Pablo Coin: Token Burns That Drive Value One of the standout features of Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is its innovative token burn mechanism, which is designed to enhance scarcity and value. Every week during the presale, unsold tokens are permanently burned, reducing supply and driving demand. This continuous burn process ensures that APC maintains a deflationary environment, which means that every token in circulation is worth more. Token burns help secure long-term sustainability and make APC a promising asset for those looking to maximize their investments. By reducing the supply, Arctic Pablo Coin creates a sense of rarity, which is a key ingredient for driving up value. This burn mechanism is fully recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC ), ensuring transparency and trust. As more tokens are burned, the value of each remaining token increases, which is an attractive proposition for early investors. With the added benefit of weekly burns, the scarcity of Arctic Pablo Coin will only grow, making it one of the top cryptos to join for short term value. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: Get in Before It’s Too Late Arctic Pablo Coin has reached a critical phase in its journey, having just completed the 8th stage, called Shangri-La. In less than six days, the project finished exploring all seven locations, faster than expected, and now it’s preparing for the next leg of its journey. Right now, 1 APC is priced at an unbelievably low $0.000047, with an impressive ROI of 16,936% from the 8th stage to the listing price of $0.008. Over $870,000 has already been raised, fueling excitement around this presale. As Arctic Pablo Coin continues to “travel” and enter new locations, prices are set to rise, so this is a unique opportunity to invest at a low entry price. With the presale divided into locations, Arctic Pablo Coin offers an unconventional and exciting way for investors to get involved. As the coin progresses through each new location, the price will naturally increase, making this an opportunity you don’t want to miss. The presale’s current stage—Shangri-La—is already showing massive potential, with the price set to increase soon. So, if you’re considering entering the market, now is the time to act. Don’t wait until the price rises further—join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale and get in on one of the top cryptos to join for short term growth. Latest News on ANDY: New Partnerships and Growing Influence ANDY is continuing to expand its footprint in the cryptocurrency world. Recently, the project announced a series of strategic partnerships that are set to boost its ecosystem. These alliances will introduce new use cases and increase the utility of ANDY tokens, drawing attention from both investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. As the partnerships roll out, ANDY is poised to tap into new markets, increasing its adoption and driving future growth. The momentum surrounding ANDY is undeniable, with positive sentiment building around the project’s future prospects. As more businesses and platforms integrate ANDY, its value could see significant growth, making it one of the top cryptos to join for short term investments. Keep an eye on ANDY as its influence continues to grow, and its collaborations begin to take shape. Osaka Protocol: Key Updates and Upcoming Milestones Osaka Protocol is also showing signs of significant development. The project has recently announced updates to its underlying infrastructure, enhancing its scalability and security features. These improvements are designed to make Osaka Protocol even more robust, enabling it to handle a higher volume of transactions and attracting greater attention from developers and investors. The protocol’s technical advancements position it as a strong contender in the crypto space. As Osaka Protocol moves forward, its development team remains committed to delivering cutting-edge solutions that could reshape the blockchain ecosystem. With strong technical foundations and a growing community, Osaka Protocol is poised to achieve its next milestone soon, making it another one of the top cryptos to join for short term growth. Conclusion: Why Arctic Pablo Coin is the Top Choice for Investors All three projects— Arctic Pablo Coin, ANDY, and Osaka Protocol—are showing promising potential, but Arctic Pablo Coin stands out with its innovative presale model, token burn mechanism, and increasing momentum. As APC continues to raise funds and its price steadily increases, investors have the chance to enter at a very low entry point. With over $870,000 already raised and an ROI of 16,936% expected, Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be one of the top cryptos to join for short term growth.

New Wallet Exchange Launch Looks To Skyrocket,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/what-has-solana-just-paired-up-with-htx-trying-to-new-wallet-exchange-launch-looks-to-skyrocket,"Solana saw an explosive rally to an ATH owing to the $TRUMP token, only to experience a sharp decline after the initial hype faded. Meanwhile, HTX is making big moves with AI-powered trading and global expansion plans. But amidst the noise, one project is quietly stealing the spotlight, 1Fuel (OFT) . Unlike hype-driven tokens, 1Fuel is building a solid foundation with innovative cross-chain technology, and real-world utility. Investors looking for a long-term winner are turning to 1Fuel, which has already raised over $1.7M in its presale. Let's learn more about it! Is Solana still a buy? Price surges, airdrops, and market volatility Solana (SOL) saw some significant shifts in January 2025, most notably the introduction of the $TRUMP coin on its network. This token, which had a 200 million coin initial supply at the time of President Trump's inauguration, swiftly grew to a market value of $13.5 billion, driving Solana's price to an all-time high of $294. But after President Trump failed to discuss cryptocurrency issues on his first day in office, the token's value fell. In January 2025, the Solana environment also got ready for significant airdrops. Jupiter, a decentralized exchange aggregator on Solana, declared that 700 million JUP tokens, worth $625 million, will be distributed to about 2.3 million wallet addresses as part of its ""JUPuary"" airdrop. HTX’s bold 2025 plans: What’s ahead? Formerly known as Huobi Global, HTX has set ambitious goals for 2025. During a recent livestream called ""Hello 2025,"" the exchange revealed that it plans to expand internationally, with a focus on the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Furthermore, HTX wants to incorporate AI into its cryptocurrency services by creating smart contract apps and AI-powered tools that improve user experience. Through the HTX DAO forum and governance committees, the platform also aims to improve community governance by promoting increased user involvement in decision-making. 1Fuel’s presale boom: The next big crypto wallet? The crypto market keeps moving with innovations every day, however, only a few remain to rule the world. One such project is, 1Fuel (OFT) which is here to rule due to its solid fundamentals, revolutionary offerings, and massive profits potential. It is currently in its presale stage and has already raised more than $1.5 million. The presale has advanced to stage three, with each OFT token priced at $0.017, and over half of the token supply for this round has been sold. Global traders and investors are starting to notice its innovative strategy for transforming cryptocurrency wallets. This cryptocurrency wallet's one-click cross-chain transaction is among its most important features. It allows its users to transact effortlessly across several networks without having to pay high network fees or create separate wallets, since 1Fuel handles everything, making the entire experience faster and easier. Another feature that distinguishes 1Fuel (OFT) from rivals like MetaMask and Ledger is disposable wallets. These wallets are intended to be used just once and erased after each transaction, making it more difficult to monitor a user's activities, ensuring top-notch privacy for every user. Analysts predict over 100x returns with the project's formal listing, which has got investors from all crypto projects exploring this project as their next long-term investment. Final thoughts While the crypto market remains unpredictable, 1Fuel (OFT) is proving to be more than just another trending token. With its groundbreaking features, seamless cross-chain transactions, and privacy-focused disposable wallets, it’s setting a new standard for crypto wallets. As its presale skyrockets, early investors are positioning themselves for massive gains. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this game-changing movement, secure your 1Fuel tokens now.

According to reports , the fund is backed by Yun and a Toncoin miner, though the miner’s identity and contribution remain undisclosed to the public. A Major Investment to Fuel TON’s Growth The former President postulated that TVM Ventures is focused on advancing decentralized finance (DeFi) and payment finance (PayFi) projects within the TON network. “Regarding DeFi, it will be imperative to build natively on TON, including the smart contract logic written on TVM directly,” Yun said. “PayFi is cross-chain by nature and therefore more flexible, but 100% must support the TON network.” This move follows a related move from Ian Wittkopp and Inal Kardan, two former TON Foundation members, who have unveiled a venture capital firm, TON Ventures . Investing in Early-Stage Startups Based on reports, TVM Ventures targets early-stage startups. It will invest between $500,000 and $1 million in companies valued between $5 million and $10 million. Furthermore, the firm will provide an additional $5 million in liquidity to help projects establish a solid financial foundation. It is worth mentioning that TVM Ventures has already backed four TON-based startups. These include Factorial, a modular lending platform similar to Morpho; Torch Finance, which specializes in stablecoin swaps; Fiva, a platform focused on tokenized yield like Pendle; and Memes Lab, a memepad that enables users to purchase memecoins using Telegram Stars, according to Yun. What Lies Ahead for TON and TVM Ventures According to Yun, the TON ecosystem is expected to experience tremendous growth by mid-2025. With the introduction of the tgBTC bridge and a new DeFi incentive program from the TON Foundation, he predicts an increase in adoption. Furthermore, he expects TON to capture a tremendous share of the stablecoin market over the next few years. Yun believes that the TON Foundation will become more independent in the next three to five years, forming high-impact partnerships to strengthen its ecosystem. He also sees the organization making “high-impact deals” to accelerate its growth. Yun predicted that Toncoin, valued at around $4 with a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion, could surpass $40 in the next bull cycle, representing a 900% increase. Even though Yun resigned as president of the TON Foundation last month, these recent events make it vehemently apparent that he has a clear and ambitious vision for TVM Ventures He stated, “Our focus is to build an advanced and comprehensive financial system capable of meeting the financial needs of 500 million users in the next few years.” On the other hand, inflation has caused Toncoin’s price to drop to $4.80 , marking a notable 33% decline from its highest value last November. This downturn coincides with a rise in exchange inflows, as over 240,000 TON tokens have been moved to exchanges in the past week.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $1,142. In 2031, AAVE will range between $3,073 to $3,778. Aave is a leading decentralized finance ( DeFi ) protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn their interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, will AAVE reach new heights in 2025? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $279 Market cap $4,174,111,006.49 Trading volume (24-h) $1,421,224,426.19 Circulating supply 15,057,562.92 AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $202.42 24-hour high $279.44 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.46% 50-day SMA $319.87 14-Day RSI 38.96 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 44 (Fear) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $191.86 Aave 1-day price analysis: AAVE to recover above $294? Key takeaways AAVE is up 9% in the last 24 hours. The coin is approaching its 0.382 Fibonacci level. A breakout above $294 could take the coin to $340.24. Aave 1-day price chart: AAVE is above its 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level The AAVE 1-day price chart for February 3 shows an emerging bull market. The coin rebounded above $202 and is now closing in on the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $294.16, which is acting as resistance. AAVE’s next key support lies at the 61.8% level ($228.87). AAVE is above its 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level While the price candles suggest a bullish recovery, the MACD indicator shows otherwise, with the MACD line below the signal line. Overall, indicators show mixed signals for AAVE. A break above $294.16 is needed to confirm an uptrend. Failure to maintain support at $228 may lead to the coin testing lower levels around $188. Aave 4-hour price chart: AAVE sees mild buyer interest in the short-term The AAVE 4-hour price chart analysis corroborates the mild recovery observed on the daily chart. AAVE has rebounded from the lower Bollinger Band, confirming some short-term buying interest. In the meantime, resistance lies at $287.98 and support at $226.56. AAVE sees mild buyer interest in the short-term A sustained move above $287-$290 is needed to confirm a stronger reversal to the upside. The RSI is almost in the oversold territory, suggesting that significant buying pressure could be gathering at the bottom. Similarly, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicates more inflows than outflows, supporting the current uptrend. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $295.22 SELL SMA 5 $304.00 SELL SMA 10 $319.25 SELL SMA 21 $326.28 SELL SMA 50 $319.87 SELL SMA 100 $260.96 BUY SMA 200 $191.86 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $308.17 SELL EMA 5 $304.88 SELL EMA 10 $306.76 SELL EMA 21 $312.62 SELL EMA 50 $293.70 SELL EMA 100 $251.51 BUY EMA 200 $201.89 BUY What to expect from AAVE price analysis? Overall, a bullish signal exists for AAVE in the short term, but the bears still hold some control over the market. To fully break out, AAVE must overcome resistance at $294. The risk of further downside remains if the coin drops below $228. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. Its AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE? AAVE tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Aave is Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, offering a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, ByBit, OKX, Kraken and KuCoin also support AAVE. Why is AAVE down? Aave (AAVE) is currently experiencing a recovery due to renewed buyer interest, jumping from a low of $202 to above $280. AAVE price history Will Aave reach $500? Aave (AAVE) can potentially reach $500 if it breaks through the current resistance levels and gains momentum from positive market sentiment and trends. AAVE had previously reached an ATH of $666.86; attaining $500 should be an achievable feat in the near term if market conditions align. Does Aave have a good long-term future?

Should average users find RTX more affordable and simpler than large bank offerings, XRP may lose some power. Critics point out that Ripple still has strong ties and a well-known brand, thus competing is not easy. Remittix (RTX), however, may attract those who aren't particularly crypto-savvy because of its capacity to daily handle wire fees. Should true adoption increase, this pragmatic aspect might be revolutionary, testing the ""XRP 2.0"" name. If the platform moves fast and finds credible alliances, some analysts estimate it might see 10x increase. Others, on the other hand, have a wary view since new tokens usually generate large gains but fail if the actual value does not show. Still, Remittix (RTX) emphasizes practical financial solutions, hence its supporters believe the token would distinguish it from other altcoins driven just by excitement. Whether or not Remittix (RTX) earns the ""2.0,"" the excitement around it hints at a crypto space honoring pragmatic solutions. By the end of the year, this new crypto Remittix might be a big competitor if it continues to create actual momentum. Here Is Why Remittix Is Dubbed The Next XRP Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by integrating blockchain technology with fiat transactions, offering fast and cost-efficient cross-border solutions. With support for over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, the platform provides instant conversions into fiat currencies like USD and GBP, enabling seamless deposits into recipients' bank accounts. As a bridge between crypto and fiat, Remittix is the superior counterpart to traditional payment providers such as Stripe and Wise and crypto-exclusive platforms like Coinbase Wallet. Supporting 30+ fiat currencies and over 50 crypto pairs, Remittix ensures accessibility and inclusivity for businesses and individuals, simplifying global commerce with its extensive range of options. Furthermore notable is the platform's open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over exorbitant costs and inadequate exchange rates of conventional banks. This approach guarantees that the full amount sent reaches the recipient, making Remittix a game-changer in the payments industry, where shady practices are unfortunately all too common. Currently priced at $0.0521 during its presale, the RTX token offers a compelling investment opportunity. Forecasts predict significant growth with a 25x multiplier expected in the presale phase and over 1,500% gains after launch, as demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions continues to rise. Beyond their common emphasis on cross-border payments, XRP and Remittix's ability to upend established financial institutions and provide actual answers calls for comparison. While Remittix is going one step further with its inclusive approach and excellent technology, XRP has shown the value of blockchain in worldwide banking. Remittix offers investors a chance to interact with a project with the potential same as XRP but at an earlier stage as the bitcoin market develops. RTX might not only equal XRP's success but also alter the benchmarks for blockchain-based financial solutions with increasing acceptance, a solid basis and evident market demand.

It enhances international payments by offering faster and more cost-effective transactions. Experts have lately identified a new token called Remittix, which they've described as the “Next XRP.” Remittix is notable for its cutting-edge PayFi system and considerable potential. Continue reading to discover more about the RTX token and why it's considered one of the top cryptocurrency investments at the moment. Price Speculation: Could Remittix Compete with Ripple? While Ripple collaborates with major corporations, supporters of Remittix (RTX) argue that their token could stand out by appealing to everyday users. If the general public finds RTX more accessible and cost-effective compared to the solutions offered by big banks, XRP might face some challenges. However, critics emphasize that despite these possibilities, Ripple's strong connections and established reputation make competition challenging. Remittix (RTX) might attract individuals who are not very familiar with crypto due to its ability to handle daily wire fees. Increased real-world usage could make this practical feature transformative, putting the ""XRP 2.0"" label to the test. If the platform gains momentum and forms trustworthy partnerships, some analysts predict it could experience a tenfold growth. Conversely, some remain cautious, noting that new tokens often promise substantial returns but may falter if they don't deliver real value. Nonetheless, Remittix (RTX) focuses on tangible financial solutions, and its advocates believe the token will set itself apart from other cryptocurrencies fueled merely by hype. Whether or not Remittix (RTX) earns the ""2.0"" title, the buzz around it suggests a crypto market appreciating practical solutions. By the year's end, if it continues to gain true momentum, Remittix could emerge as a significant contender in the crypto world. Why Remittix Is Being Called The Next XRP Remittix (RTX) is transforming international payments by merging blockchain technology with fiat transactions, delivering swift and economical cross-border services. The platform supports over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, facilitating instant conversions into fiat currencies like USD and GBP, and allowing seamless deposits into recipients' bank accounts. Acting as a bridge between the crypto and fiat worlds, Remittix surpasses traditional payment services like Stripe and Wise, as well as crypto-only platforms like Coinbase Wallet. With support for more than 30 fiat currencies and over 50 crypto pairs, Remittix ensures accessibility and inclusivity for both businesses and individuals, making international trade simpler with a wide array of choices. Additionally, the platform's transparent flat-fee model offers cost savings and clarity compared to the high fees and poor exchange rates of traditional banks. This model guarantees that the full amount sent reaches the recipient, positioning Remittix as a groundbreaking player in the payments industry, notorious for its murky practices. Currently available for $0.0521 during its presale, the RTX token presents an attractive investment opportunity. Projections indicate substantial growth, with a 25x increase expected in the presale phase and over 1,500% gains anticipated post-launch, as the demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions continues to escalate. Besides their common focus on international payments, XRP and Remittix's potential to challenge established financial systems and deliver practical solutions invites comparison. While XRP has demonstrated the usefulness of blockchain technology in global banking, Remittix is advancing further with its inclusive approach and superior technology. For investors, Remittix offers a chance to engage with a project that possesses potential akin to XRP but at an earlier stage as the cryptocurrency market evolves. With growing acceptance, strong foundations, and evident market interest, RTX could not only match XRP's achievements but also redefine standards for blockchain-driven financial solutions.

Many people are curious whether Dogecoin’s price will reach $1. The coin’s price now sits around $0.3276 with a market cap of $48.41 billion. Renewed whale activity has fueled optimism, and some analysts foresee DOGE hitting $1 sometime in 2025. Yet interestingly, many are also talking about Remittix (RTX) , an under-five-cents altcoin that’s on the rise. If real-world utility wins out, some suspect Remittix (RTX) might actually outperform Dogecoin in the long run. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) Path to $1 The big question: can Dogecoin break the $1 mark in the next few years? Meme-driven hype, celebrity tweets, and robust community support have helped push DOGE to new peaks before. Current whale movements suggest institutions may be dabbling, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Still, critics note that Dogecoin relies heavily on comedic or viral momentum. If the market shifts toward utility-based tokens, the coin could see slower growth. Meanwhile, a newcomer Remittix (RTX) is capturing attention with a more practical approach. Observers say if folks want cheaper cross-border transactions, RTX might overshadow purely hype-driven coins. That dynamic leads many to ask again, “How Long Till The Dogecoin Price Reaches $1? Why Is This Altcoin Priced Below 5 Cents Tipped To Beat It?” PayFi Star Remittix on the Rise While memes help Dogecoin go viral, Remittix (RTX) aims for daily finance use. Already, Remittix (RTX) has raised $10,071,202.38 and sold 424,894,549.52 tokens at $0.0521. With a target price of $0.0539 next, some fans see RTX as the big up-and-comer. The coin sets out to tackle high wire fees, bridging fiat and crypto so families and freelancers can save money. In a market often swayed by jokes, that real-world angle could push Remittix (RTX) to the spotlight. If mainstream crowds catch on, watchers say it might surpass meme-based tokens. By focusing on bridging normal finance, RTX might sustain growth beyond short-term hype. Why This Altcoin Priced Below 5 Cents Tipped to Beat Dogecoin Despite Dogecoin boasting a massive user base, some experts believe an under-five-cent coin like Remittix (RTX) could deliver bigger returns. While DOGE soared through playful jokes and celebrity endorsements, the token’s next leap might hinge on fresh hype. Meanwhile, a PayFialtcoin such as Remittix (RTX) addresses the billion-dollar remittance market. That stable user demand might lead to steadier and potentially larger growth. If the broader market transitions to tokens offering practical cost savings, RTX could outpace many comedic coins. No one can say for sure if Dogecoin will fall behind, but if practicality wins, an under-five cents altcoin might shock everyone. Factors Behind DOGE’s Rally Donald Trump’s victory and Elon Musk’s new political advisory role have rekindled interest in Dogecoin. Over the past few months, the coin’s price more than doubled, bolstering hopes it might crack $1 by 2025. Analysts point to whale wallet expansions, meaning large players have scooped up DOGE recently. It’s a bullish sign that big holders foresee further climbs. Still, longevity is uncertain if the meme fades or the hype moves elsewhere. Enter Remittix (RTX) or RTX, where bridging day-to-day banking stands a better chance at locking in a broad user base. If mainstream folks adopt it, watchers think Remittix(RTX) might see 100x gains overshadowing meme coins. Conclusion: Who Will Win by 2025? So, how long will the Dogecoin price remain at $1? Why is this Altcoin priced below 5 cents and tipped to beat it? Some say Dogecoin could cross $1 by 2025 if hype, institutional interest, and celebrity backing stay consistent. Others see Remittix (RTX) forging a path to outdo DOGE, thanks to bridging crypto with everyday transactions. With $10,371,202.38 raised, RTX stands at $0.0521 but could hit $0.0539 soon. By tackling actual problems like wire fees Remittix (RTX) might draw a more stable, worldwide crowd. Whether DOGE or RTX claims the throne, each offers a unique route to massive growth. Yet if practical PayFi solutions resonate, the under-five-cents altcoin might be the real winner. Ready to explore Remittix further?

Currently priced at approximately $0.3276 with a market capitalization of $48.41 billion, the coin has seen renewed interest from large investors, fueling optimism. Some analysts predict DOGE could hit the $1 mark by 2025. However, what’s intriguing is the buzz around Remittix (RTX) , a rising altcoin priced under five cents. If real-world application triumphs, it’s speculated that Remittix (RTX) could potentially outshine Dogecoin in the long haul. The Road to $1 for Dogecoin (DOGE) The pressing question is whether Dogecoin can reach $1 in the coming years. Previously, the coin has reached new heights thanks to meme-based enthusiasm, celebrity endorsements, and a strong community. Recent activity from large investors suggests that institutions might be getting involved, bolstering a positive outlook. Yet, skeptics argue that Dogecoin's success largely depends on viral or comedic trends. If the market leans towards utility-focused tokens, its growth might slow.

Observers note that for those seeking cost-effective cross-border transactions, RTX could outshine coins driven solely by hype. This situation prompts the question once more, “When Will Dogecoin Hit $1?

While DOGE skyrocketed thanks to humorous memes and celebrity shout-outs, its future rise might depend on fresh waves of excitement. On the other hand, a PayFi coin such as Remittix (RTX) targets the multi-billion-dollar remittance industry. This steady user demand could translate into consistent and potentially larger growth. Should the broader market pivot towards tokens offering tangible savings, RTX might outpace many humor-based coins. Though it’s uncertain if Dogecoin will be left behind, if practicality prevails, a low-cost altcoin could surprise everyone. Elements Fueling DOGE’s Ascent Donald Trump’s triumph and Elon Musk’s new advisory position have rekindled interest in Dogecoin. Over recent months, the coin’s value has more than doubled, sparking hopes it might hit $1 by 2025.

Yet, its long-term success is uncertain if the meme loses steam or the hype shifts. This is where Remittix (RTX) or RTX comes in, as its focus on everyday banking could secure a wide user base. If the mainstream adopts it, analysts believe Remittix (RTX) could see 100x gains, overshadowing meme coins. Final Thoughts: Who Will Prevail by 2025?

The sudden market downturn led to a widespread sell-off, impacting traders who had leveraged positions across multiple exchanges. Leverage trading in cryptocurrency allows investors to borrow funds to increase their position size, amplifying both potential gains and losses. However, it also carries significant risks, especially in highly volatile markets. When prices move sharply in the wrong direction, traders who use leverage may see their positions forcibly closed, or “liquidated,” as exchanges move to protect borrowed funds. Bybit, one of the major cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, saw over $1 billion in liquidations, reflecting the severity of the market crash. The broader crypto market experienced a total of $10 billion in liquidations, with Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the losses. The sharp declines came as unexpected price swings wiped out traders who were overleveraged. “The scale of the liquidations shows just how fragile the market can be when leverage is involved,” noted a market analyst. High leverage levels can create a cascading effect, where initial sell-offs trigger further liquidations, leading to even greater price drops. The incident highlights the risks associated with crypto leverage trading, which has become increasingly popular among retail and institutional investors. Many exchanges offer leverage of up to 100x, meaning traders can open positions far larger than their initial investment. While this can result in significant profits when the market moves in their favor, it also exposes traders to extreme losses if prices move against them. A spokesperson for Bybit commented on the situation, stating that the platform had handled the high volatility efficiently. “Despite the unprecedented liquidations, our systems functioned smoothly, ensuring that risk management mechanisms were in place to protect traders and the broader market,” they said. The impact of the liquidations was felt across the crypto industry, with Bitcoin dropping sharply before partially recovering. Ethereum and other major altcoins also saw significant price swings, as traders scrambled to manage their positions amid the turmoil. Experts believe that the event underscores the need for caution when using leverage in crypto trading. “This kind of volatility is inherent in the crypto market, and leveraged traders need to be prepared for rapid price movements,” said a senior analyst at a trading firm. Despite the massive liquidations, some market participants see potential buying opportunities. Historically, large liquidation events have been followed by price rebounds as the market stabilizes. However, uncertainty remains, especially with ongoing regulatory discussions and macroeconomic factors influencing investor sentiment. The liquidation event serves as a reminder of the risks and rewards of leverage trading in crypto. While it can enhance profits, it can also lead to severe losses, particularly in a market known for its unpredictability. Traders are advised to use risk management strategies, such as stop-loss orders and lower leverage levels, to protect their investments from unexpected market swings.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-03 23:58:00

BNB’s integration within the Binance ecosystem has fueled demand, while Cardano’s research-driven approach has positioned it as a secure and scalable blockchain. However, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out by bridging blockchain with real-world e-commerce, offering a practical use case beyond trading and speculation. With a successful presale surpassing $1 million, Web3Bay’s 3BAY token is gaining traction, signaling increasing interest in decentralized, user-driven marketplaces that challenge traditional platforms. Web3Bay’s 3BAY Token Gains Traction After $1M Presale Web3Bay’s presale has hit $1 million, with 270 million 3BAY tokens sold at a current price of $0.004562625 in Stage 4. This rapid growth, therefore, highlights increasing confidence in blockchain-powered commerce and the demand for decentralized alternatives to traditional e-commerce platforms. As a result, investors are taking notice, not just because of the early-stage presale momentum, but also due to 3BAY’s core utility—facilitating transactions, offering discounts, and granting governance rights within Web3Bay’s marketplace. Consequently, as more users join, demand for the token could rise, potentially driving up its value. When comparing Web3Bay’s growth trajectory with other blockchain marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible, it becomes evident that decentralized platforms are gaining traction. However, unlike NFT-specific platforms, Web3Bay brings real-world e-commerce into the mix, expanding the scope of blockchain adoption. Furthermore, with each presale stage increasing the token price, early investors are positioning themselves for potential gains before 3BAY reaches public trading. If this trend continues, the token could see significant value appreciation post-launch, especially as more users transact on the platform. Beyond price speculation, Web3Bay’s success underscores a larger trend—Web3 commerce is no longer a niche concept. Given that $1 million has been raised in just a few weeks, it is clear that the demand for decentralized, user-driven marketplaces is accelerating. At this point, the question now isn’t whether Web3Bay can compete, but how far it can go in reshaping online commerce. BNB: From Exchange Token to a Leading Cryptocurrency Binance Coin (BNB) launched in 2017 as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum before migrating to Binance Chain. Initially, it offered trading fee discounts on Binance, but over time, its use expanded to payments, staking, and smart contracts. Since then, BNB’s price has grown significantly, from its ICO price of $0.10 to over $576.63 as of February 3, 2025. This marks a staggering increase of more than 576,530%. One key factor behind this growth is Binance’s success, coupled with BNB’s utility in transaction fees, DeFi, and token burns, which has sustained demand. As a result, BNB’s market capitalization has also climbed to over $88 billion. Moreover, the deflationary model, where Binance systematically burns tokens, has contributed to scarcity and long-term value appreciation. For this reason, early investors who participated in the ICO have seen some of the highest returns in cryptocurrency history. Meanwhile, Binance’s ecosystem continues expanding, reinforcing BNB’s dominance as a top-tier digital asset used across multiple blockchain applications and financial services. Cardano (ADA): A Research-Driven Blockchain with Strong Growth Cardano launched in 2017, founded by Charles Hoskinson, focusing on academic research and peer-reviewed blockchain development. At the time, its native cryptocurrency, ADA, was first sold through an ICO at approximately $0.025 per token. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano was built on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros, aiming to provide a scalable and secure platform for decentralized applications. Over the years, ADA has grown significantly, reaching approximately $0.71 as of February 3, 2025, marking an increase of over 2,740% from its ICO price. This growth has been driven by Cardano’s structured development phases—Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire—which have steadily introduced decentralization, smart contracts, and scalability improvements. Additionally, its adoption in DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise applications has bolstered network activity. As a result, with a market capitalization of around $25 billion, Cardano remains a key blockchain player. Therefore, early investors have seen strong returns, benefiting from its continued expansion and research-backed technological advancements aimed at improving blockchain efficiency and real-world use cases. Final Call The growth of blockchain-based assets highlights a shift toward more decentralized and utility-driven platforms. Binance Coin (BNB) has strengthened its position through exchange integration and token burns, while Cardano (ADA) has built a foundation on research-backed development. Yet, Web3Bay is setting itself apart by integrating blockchain into real-world commerce, creating practical applications beyond investment speculation. With over $1 million raised in its presale, the 3BAY token is gaining traction, reflecting growing confidence in decentralized marketplaces. As adoption increases, Web3Bay’s model could redefine how blockchain is applied to e-commerce, offering a compelling alternative to traditional online platforms.

39893542,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=667849,1738627750,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39893542.jpeg,2025 is a make or break year for Meta’s metaverse vision – CTO Andrew “Boz” Bosworth,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/2025-meta-metaverse-vision-andrew-bosworth/,"In an internal memo intended for Meta staff, the company’s CTO, Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, shared that 2025 will be a pivotal year for the company’s metaverse ambitions. Meta is one of the companies intending to put all hands on deck in an effort to leverage opportunities in 2025. The company’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, told employees during a meeting last week to buckle up for an intense year during a meeting about the company’s smart glasses. The company is working on several fronts to make the most of the year. Meta’s strategy for 2025 is pretty clear: from its mixed reality division to its AI glasses, every project is important and crucial to the upward trajectory of the business. The ‘year of greatness’ internal memo Company CTO, Andrew “Boz” Bosworth circulated a memo to the company’s staff. The memo was titled “2025; The Year of Greatness” and was shared on Meta’s Internal Forum Workplace. Business Insider first reported on the intercepted memo . In the memo, Bosworth emphasized the need to improve sales, retention and engagement across the board with special focus on mixed reality, a technology that blends the physical and digital worlds and creates experiences that go way beyond augmented or virtual reality. Bosworth mentioned that the success of Horizon Worlds on mobile platforms will be crucial to Meta’s long-term strategy. “This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure,” Bosworth said Although Bosworth didn’t specify what devices he was referring to in the memo, he said that the company’s Reality Labs division planned to launch half a dozen more AI-powered wearable devices. Meta’s Reality Labs under the microscope Meta acquired Oculus VR in 2014 and has since invested over $80 billion in virtual and augmented reality technologies. In 2024 alone, the company’s Reality Labs division, responsible for products like Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and Quest VR headsets, saw a record investment of $19.9 billion. Despite these substantial investments, Reality Labs reported a significant operating loss of $17.7 billion in 2024, bringing total losses to around $60 billion since 2020. Notably, revenue from Reality Labs increased to $2.1 billion in 2024. Last week, the Reality Labs unit reported a record $1.08 billion in revenue in its fourth-quarter earnings. In an effort to maximize efficiency, Meta is restructuring its Reality Labs division. In the memo, Bosworth referenced Steven Levy’s book “Insanely Great,” which details how the Macintosh computer was created by small teams of one to three people, and added that he had seen smaller teams within Meta achieve better results than the company’s “more generously funded teams.” Perhaps going off this observation, Bosworth announced last week that the unit previously run by Reality Labs’ chief operating officer, Dan Reed, will now be run by company COO, Javier Olivan. The company also reshuffled the reporting lines of other Reality Labs executives, who now report to other key figures in Meta’s core business.

The crypto detective in a “thread” on X detailed how many users have become victims of social engineering attacks on Coinbase. ZachXBT stated that users have lost over $300 million from these socially engineered exploits. How the Crypto Scam Works ZachXBT’s investigations revealed that the scammers employ spoof calls and impersonation of the crypto exchange support team. They also sent phishing emails to lure users into compromising their accounts, as in the Ledger incident in December 2024. They also use leaked personal data to gain users’ trust. To sound convincing, the fraudsters have faked Coinbase’s website and emails, which are difficult to tell apart to the casual observer. The malicious actors then get the potential victims to “verify” their accounts through their private keys . This required the would-be victim to transfer funds to a Coinbase Wallet or whitelisting address. While impersonating the Coinbase support team, they compromise the victim’s security and steal their funds. ZachXBT says the scammers operate from India and primarily target users in the U.S. Surprisingly, between December 2024 and January 2025 alone, Coinbase users lost a minimum of $65 million to theft. This amount does not factor in Coinbase support tickets and police report that ZachXBT could not access. ZachXBT claims that Coinbase has made it difficult to track the theft addresses by failing to report them using compliance tools. Did Coinbase Fail to Wade Off Crypto Scams? The crypto sleuth argues that Coinbase’s risk models have failed to prevent these scams, causing users to lose $300 million. He maintained that these attacks succeeded because of the aggressive risk models that Coinbase adopted to tackle them. Generally, users have suddenly accused Coinbase of restricting their accounts. It appears the malicious actors are exploiting this to scam users. A development ZachXBT has decried as the aggressive risk model has failed to prevent the massive annual loss of funds due to Crypto scams. ZachXBT also highlighted how a Coinbase employee cautioned users via an X post to stop using VPNs so the exchange does not flag them as suspicious. Meanwhile, the crypto detective noted that threat actors block VPNs from phishing sites. According to the investigation, this discrepancy suggests that Coinbase has failed to identify the security issues correctly. He attributes this as the major reason the scammers have succeeded in robbing users of their valuable funds. Coinbase CEO Promises Enhanced Infrastructure In a separate update, Brian Armstrong, the exchange’s CEO, promised a comprehensive overhaul of its system. While more linked to Solana transaction congestion than crypto scam events, the exchange has identified a unique need to upgrade its systems. The trading platform suffered delays in processing Solana transactions in January following the launch of TRUMP and MELANIA. With the event, Brian Amstrong promised a Solana tier-1 infrastructure .

The analyst pinpointed Ethereum (ETH) in his price chart, emphasizing that the second-largest cryptocurrency is set to decline further, in line with his earlier predictions. Step 2: Crypto Market Sells Off As ETH Goes Home Ethereum is currently experiencing widespread market sell-offs as investors react to its bearish price action and tightening liquidity conditions. Failing to meet investors’ expectations, the price of Ethereum has struggled to maintain strong momentum in this bull market. Related Reading: Crypto Market Remains Greedy Despite Bitcoin Price Crash To $94,000, Is A Recovery Coming? Cowen’s chart analysis suggests that the current downtrend aligns with the broader market cycle, where Bitcoin’s dominance rises above 60%, leading to capital flows from altcoins like Ethereum. The analyst announced that the crypto market is currently in the second phase of his guide for 2025’s market trajectory. In a previous X post on January 29, Cowen outlined a structured six-step roadmap for his 2025 market cycle theory. The first step highlights an increase in Bitcoin’s dominance to over 60%. This occurs when investors leave altcoins and move into Bitcoin, seeking stability amidst the volatility and uncertainty of the crypto market. During this time, Ethereum and most altcoins underperform due to the lack of interest and demand from investors. Now, in Step 2 of Cowen’s 2025 guide, the crypto market has entered a correction phase, with Ethereum declining sharply. Cowen claims that ETH will eventually “go home,” meaning the cryptocurrency will undergo a severe decline to long-term key support levels. In this second phase, the broader market also experiences a sell-off as investors take profit amidst volatility and ongoing declines in cryptocurrencies. Despite rising to $3,000 earlier in this bull market, Ethereum has failed to maintain positive momentum, recording steep declines as its price struggles to find stable support. According to data from CoinMarketCap, ETH is currently trading at $2,594, reflecting a massive 16.4% price crash in the last 24 hours. Over the past weeks, Ethereum has performed poorly, experiencing a sharp decline to new lows while other cryptocurrencies have gained momentum. The altcoin’s price has plunged to new lows, dropping by more than 27.6% in just a month. This downturn has also significantly impacted its market capitalization, which has fallen to $312.6 billion. Cowen’s 2025 Market Guide: What’s Next? In Step 3 of his market cycle theory for 2025, Cowen predicts that the Federal Reserve (FED) will shift its policy and end quantitative tightening, which has been draining liquidity from the financial markets. This decision is critical, as easing monetary conditions would pave the way for the analyst’s fourth step — a bullish phase fueled by market rallies. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH Faces ‘Moment Of Truth’ After Crash Toward $3,000 In the fifth step, Cowen predicts that macroeconomic conditions will deteriorate later in the year. This could include factors like inflation, interest rate, geopolitical stability, and others. The final step in his 2025 market cycle guide forecasts a full-blown recession. Cowen projects that this recession would lead to a bear market, aligning with historical midterm election year cycles, where markets tend to face deeper corrections.

A standout feature of BTFD Coin is its high-yield staking mechanism, which offers a staggering 90% APY. For many, this is the magic number that makes BTFD one of the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now. With such a high annual percentage yield, token holders can enjoy substantial passive rewards simply by staking their tokens. Imagine earning significant returns without having to actively trade—this is passive income at its best. The 90% APY on staking creates a robust incentive to hold onto BTFD tokens, turning every holder into a mini passive income generator.

Designed to be both accessible and fun, the P2E game allows participants to earn extra tokens as they engage in interactive gameplay. This feature not only enhances the utility of BTFD Coin but also widens its appeal to a broader audience—from hardcore gamers to crypto newcomers looking for innovative ways to profit.

The Bulls Squad community is another powerhouse driving BTFD Coin’s success. This passionate group fuels the project’s growth through an impressive referral program. The referral program deserves special mention: Every member of the Bulls Squad is incentivized to bring new investors into the fold, amplifying the network’s organic growth.

Its innovative ecosystem and robust referral program offer a gateway to substantial passive income and exponential growth. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin has carved out its own niche in the meme coin market, emerging as a noteworthy contender among the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now. While many investors have cherished the legacy of classic meme coins, it is perfectly fine to miss out on some of them when newer opportunities promise even bigger gains. Dogecoin represents a familiar and beloved token that has long captured the hearts of crypto enthusiasts. However, as the market evolves, the spotlight is shifting toward presale opportunities that offer innovative features and significant profit potential—like those seen with BTFD Coin. The inherent charm of Dogecoin lies in its simplicity and widespread recognition. It has been a staple in the meme coin community for years, and its loyal fan base is a testament to its enduring appeal. Despite this, many forward-thinking investors are now exploring the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now because these projects integrate next-generation features that promise greater returns. Dogecoin remains a fun and engaging token, but it may not deliver the same exponential growth and passive income potential that newer projects can offer. Recent developments in the broader crypto market have shown that innovative presale opportunities are reshaping investor priorities. Analysts predict that tokens with integrated staking rewards, play-to-earn (P2E) games, and robust referral programs—like BTFD Coin—are positioned to outperform traditional meme coins in terms of growth and profitability. This shift is a reflection of the changing times, where dynamic ecosystems and advanced tokenomics are key drivers of long-term success. While Dogecoin has its own merits and continues to be a cherished asset, the emerging trends suggest that the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now are the future of profitable crypto investments. Investors who consider diversifying their portfolio with meme coins are advised to look beyond traditional tokens and embrace presale opportunities that offer cutting-edge features. The Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now not only provide a chance for early entry at discounted prices but also come with unique incentives such as high APY staking and community-driven rewards. The potential for massive returns, as evidenced by recent price predictions and strong presale performance, is a major draw for those seeking passive income. In today’s volatile market, strategic investments in these innovative tokens can pave the way to exponential growth and financial freedom. The familiar allure of Dogecoin is undeniable, and its cultural impact remains strong. However, when evaluating the overall potential for passive income and future gains, many investors find that the emerging presale opportunities hold the key to unlocking greater value. The dynamic features and robust ecosystems of the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now set them apart from more traditional assets. As the market evolves, the emphasis is shifting toward projects that offer not only a nostalgic charm but also the technological edge required for exponential returns. This is why many are willing to embrace new opportunities even if it means letting go of a long-loved token. Why did this coin make it to this list? Dogecoin’s enduring legacy, combined with its simplicity and loyal following, secured its place on this list. However, the shift in focus toward the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now highlights why newer projects with advanced features are capturing investor attention and offering greater potential for massive gains. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market never stands still, and the emergence of innovative presale opportunities is proof of that. With BTFD Coin and Dogecoin leading the charge, the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now offer unparalleled passive income potential through high-yield staking, immersive P2E games, and vibrant referral programs. Analysts predict that these projects will deliver exponential returns as they continue to gain momentum. It’s time to seize the opportunity and invest in the future of crypto.

This groundbreaking token has already proven its worth, raising $1 million in just minutes during its presale. With momentum building and investor interest surging, OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM is positioning itself as the most promising crypto of 2025. What’s Driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s Momentum? Record-Breaking Presale Success The demand for THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has been unprecedented, with $1 million raised in minutes. This strong presale performance demonstrates overwhelming investor confidence, rivaling early excitement around XRP and SOL. Exclusive Availability Unlike XRP and SOLANA, which are widely available on major exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand and ensures that early adopters stand to gain the most from its projected breakout. Growing Investor Confidence With predictions of a 50,000% return, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has become a magnet for investors seeking exponential growth. Its strong performance and limited supply are fueling speculation that it could redefine the crypto market. How It Compares to Market Leaders Ripple (XRP): Known for its dominance in cross-border payments, XRP offers steady growth but doesn’t match the early-stage explosive potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Solana (SOL): A leader in blockchain scalability, SOL excels in speed but can’t rival the exclusivity and investor momentum driving this new token. Act Now Before It’s Too Late With analysts closely watching OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM , the token is proving to be a standout investment. Its record-breaking presale, exclusive availability, and massive growth potential make it a top choice for anyone looking to capitalize on crypto’s next breakout.

Analyst Ali Martinez tells his 122,400 followers on the social media platform X that Solana is in danger of plunging to levels last seen in October of 2024. According to the trader, SOL must stay above a key support level to invalidate his outlook. “This is it! If Solana SOL fails to hold above $191, a drop to $138 could be imminent.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that SOL is still trading within an ascending parallel channel – a pattern indicating that an asset is an uptrend, printing higher highs and higher lows. But he notes that losing $191 as support means invalidating the channel’s diagonal support, potentially ending a multi-month uptrend. At time of writing, SOL is trading for $197, translating to a 39% decline if Solana hits the analyst’s downside target. Looking at XRP , the analyst notes that whales unloaded tens of millions of dollars worth of the third-largest crypto asset by market cap in just one day. “Whales have offloaded over 130 million XRP in the past 24 hours!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.24, down over 20% on the day. Deep-pocketed Dogecoin ( DOGE ) investors also offloaded their stacks, according to Martinez. “Whales sold 270 million Dogecoin DOGE in the last 24 hours!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.227, down over 22% in the past day.

Cardano (ADA), Near Protocol (NEAR), and Kaspa (KAS) have also built strong reputations, while Arbitrum (ARB) has shown potential as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. However, a new coin, OFFICIALMAGACOIN, is now commanding the attention of savvy investors. OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Deliver 60,000% Returns OFFICIALMAGACOIN has emerged as a unique player, with a record-breaking presale raising over $1 million in minutes. The token is only available at officialmagacoin.com , adding an element of exclusivity that appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Its potential for 60,000% returns has investors speculating that it could mirror or even surpass Bitcoin’s early growth trajectory. Early-Stage Growth Potential: With its presale success, OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors a chance to get in on the ground floor of a coin poised for exponential growth. Exclusivity and Scarcity: Available only at its official website, the token creates urgency and a sense of premium access. Affordable Entry Point: At less than $0.20 per token, OFFICIALMAGACOIN provides a low-risk, high-reward opportunity. Comparing OFFICIALMAGACOIN to Competitors Bitcoin (BTC): Established but lacks the explosive growth of a new coin. Cardano (ADA): Reliable but maturing, leaving little room for exponential returns. Near Protocol (NEAR): Focused on Web3 but cannot match OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s exclusivity. Kaspa (KAS): A promising blockchain but with a slower trajectory. Investors eager to secure their position in this promising token can do so exclusively at officialmagacoin.com .

According to the AI news, the framework will address concerns about the dangers of advanced AI technology, particularly in cybersecurity and biosecurity. The company states that some AI models may be too risky to release, requiring internal safeguards before further deployment. AI News: Meta’s Frontier AI Framework Aims to Limit Risky AI Releases In a recent document filing , Meta classified AI systems into two categories based on potential risks. These categories are high-risk and critical-risk, each defined by the extent of possible harm. AI models deemed high-risk may assist in cyber or biological attacks. However, critical-risk AI can cause severe harm, with Meta stating that such systems could lead to catastrophic consequences. According to the AI news, Meta will halt the development of any system classified as critical risk and implement additional security measures to prevent unauthorized access. High-risk AI models will be restricted internally, with further work to reduce risks before release. The framework reflects the company’s focus on minimizing potential threats associated with artificial intelligence. These security measures come amid recent concerns over AI data privacy. In the latest AI news, DeepSeek, a Chinese startup, has been removed from Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store in Italy. The country’s data protection authority is investigating its data collection practices. Stricter Artificial Intelligence Security Measures To determine AI system risk levels, Meta will rely on assessments from internal and external researchers. However, the company states that no single test can fully measure risk, making expert evaluation a key factor in decision-making. The framework outlines a structured review process, with senior decision-makers overseeing final risk classifications. For high-risk AI, Meta plans to introduce mitigation measures before considering a release. This approach will prevent AI systems from being misused while maintaining their intended functionality. If an artificial intelligence model is classified as critical-risk, development will be suspended entirely until safety measures can ensure controlled deployment. Open AI Strategy Faces Scrutiny Meta has pursued an open AI development model, allowing broader access to its Llama AI models. This strategy has resulted in widespread adoption, with millions of downloads recorded. However, concerns have emerged regarding potential misuse, including reports that a U.S. adversary utilized Llama to develop a defense chatbot. With the Frontier AI Framework, the company is addressing these concerns while maintaining its commitment to open AI development. Meanwhile, while AI safety continues to be a matter of concern, OpenAI has continued its development. In other AI news, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT Gov , a secure AI model tailored for U.S. government agencies. This launch comes as DeepSeek gains traction and Meta enhances its security measures, intensifying competition in the AI space.

The approved plan involves converting defaulted debt into TCY (Thorchain Yield) equity tokens, eliminating the need for a private raise, and leveraging existing treasury funds to facilitate recovery. Under this framework , 200 million TCY tokens will be minted and distributed to affected users at a rate of one token per dollar of defaulted debt. These tokens will receive 10% of protocol fees indefinitely, providing long-term incentives for liquidity providers and aligning interests across the ecosystem. A shallow RUNE/TCY pool will be established at $0.10 per TCY, with $5 million in treasury funds allocated for strategic buybacks over ten weeks in a bid to ensure a more stable price discovery process. The proposal also introduces Liquidity Nodes to ramp up capital efficiency and offset forfeited fees, thereby strengthening governance participation for liquidity providers. By writing off debt through an equity conversion, the protocol remains solvent without minting additional RUNE, while affected users gain a potential path to full recovery. The latest development comes after the decentralized cross-chain liquidity protocol temporarily suspended its THORFi services on January 23rd in response to financial instability and insolvency rumors. A 90-day restructuring plan was put in place to address challenges arising from its Savers and Lending programs, which have accumulated excessive debt. Trading activities, including swaps, remained unaffected, but lending services were on hold as validator nodes oversaw the restructuring process. “The Jan 23 pause set the conditions for community members to decide on a restructuring plan to ensure the network’s continued operation while compensating Lending and Savers users. The community stepped up, proposing 8 independent plans, which were reviewed and voted on by Node Operators.” Its native token, RUNE, has been on a steady decline since the first week of December. It took a deep plunge following the suspension of THORFi. Despite minor hints of recovery, RUNE continued its downtrend, shedding almost 80% over the past month alone. It was currently trading at $1.21.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order over the weekend to establish the fund, aiming to strengthen the country’s long-term economic stability. The announcement has sparked discussions about whether Bitcoin and Ethereum could be included in the fund’s assets. Sovereign Wealth Fund Established Amid Economic Strategy Shifts The executive order signed by President Trump marks a strategic move to build a Sovereign Wealth Fund for the United States. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the decision, stating that the fund is expected to play a key role in national financial planning. The announcement comes at a time when global markets face uncertainty due to trade discussions between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. The fund’s purpose and structure have not been fully disclosed, but it is expected to manage various assets. Some financial analysts suggest that alternative investments, including digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, could be considered to diversify holdings. This comes as the cryptocurrency market shows signs of recovery, with Bitcoin price surpassing $101,000 and Ethereum price trading near $2,849. Senator Cynthia Lummis Pushes for a Bitcoin Reserve Senator Cynthia Lummis, an advocate for cryptocurrency, has reiterated her support for integrating Bitcoin into government reserves. Over the weekend, she discussed the progress of a proposed bill that would allow the U.S. government to accumulate 1 million Bitcoin over five years. The bill suggests holding the assets for at least 20 years as a long-term strategy. “This is a big deal,” Lummis said in reaction to the Sovereign Wealth Fund news, emphasizing the potential role of Bitcoin in the country’s financial system. Concurrently, Bitwise senior investment strategist Juan Leon also commented on the possibility of Bitcoin being included in the fund. He stated that the government could add Bitcoin to the Sovereign Wealth Fund while accumulating more BTC for a separate strategic reserve. Could Bitcoin and Ethereum Be Part of the Sovereign Wealth Fund? As the Sovereign Wealth Fund takes shape, discussions continue about what assets will be included. Some financial experts believe that Bitcoin and Ethereum could be considered due to their rising acceptance as store-of-value assets. The recent push from Senator Lummis for a Bitcoin reserve suggests growing interest in incorporating cryptocurrency into national financial strategies. Eric Trump recently expressed optimism about Ethereum, stating on social media that it could be a good time to invest. His comments come as Ethereum shows steady performance, following Bitcoin’s surge. If the government decides to include digital assets in the Sovereign Wealth Fund, it could signal a shift in how the U.S. approaches cryptocurrency at a national level. Cryptocurrency Market Recovers Amid Optimism Financial markets have reacted to recent events, with global stocks declining while the cryptocurrency sector remains strong. The rise of Bitcoin above $101,000 and Ethereum’s steady surge indicate growing investor confidence in digital assets. Some market analysts believe that government interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum could further drive adoption. Meanwhile, the United States, Mexico, and Canada have reached an agreement to delay new tariffs on goods for one month which has restored optimism. The decision came after a discussion between President Trump, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. While traditional markets have shown uncertainty, the cryptocurrency sector appears to be experiencing renewed momentum. Subsequently, the XRP price soared over 17% to trade at $2.73, Shiba Inu price jumped 13% to $0.00001667, Dogecoin too soared over 15% to $0.28 and MANTRA price led the top gainers in the last 24 hours after skyrocketing over 27% followed by Onyxcoin (XCN) 25% rally from its intra-day low.

The decline follows unfavorable macroeconomic developments, including newly imposed US tariffs. This price movement has left investors and analysts closely scrutinizing the market for signs of a reversal or further downturn. According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst TraderOasis, Bitcoin’s decline below critical support levels has resulted in increased panic selling. Despite this, the Coinbase premium index indicates that institutional investors are continuing to accumulate BTC rather than offloading their holdings. This contrast between retail-driven selloffs and institutional accumulation suggests that larger players are using the current dip to boost their positions. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Bullish But It’s Time For Caution Bitcoin Market Dynamics And Institutional Activity TraderOasis highlights several key market indicators that shed light on the current dynamics. Open interest—a measure of active trading positions—has dropped significantly, pointing to a wave of forced liquidations as leveraged traders exit their positions. Oasis wrote: A drop in funding rates suggests that market participants are taking short positions (betting on a price decrease) and that bearish sentiment is increasing. Notably, this ongoing pattern described by the analyst hints at a strategic accumulation phase by so-called “whales,” or large-scale investors. Oasis mentioned that while retail traders face stop-loss liquidations, these larger entities appear to be absorbing Bitcoin at discounted prices. This accumulation during periods of panic is not uncommon and often precedes a market recovery. Rising Liquidations and Signs of Recovery Another CryptoQuant analyst, Mignolet, echoed these observations, emphasizing the scale of recent long-position liquidations. The current liquidation volume is reportedly the highest since September 2023, with many traders caught off guard by the abrupt price drop. Mignolet compares this event to past market shocks, including the FTX collapse and the COVID-induced crash.

As investors rush to secure their positions, the biggest opportunities often come from presale tokens—undiscovered gems that have yet to hit major exchanges. Among the best crypto presales of 2025, some projects stand out for their innovation, real-world utility, and potential for massive returns. One of the most exciting ones? Web3Bay—a blockchain-powered e-commerce platform that eliminates middlemen and gives users full control over online transactions. Here’s a look at six top presale tokens that are catching investors’ attention. 1. Web3Bay ($3BAY) – The Future of Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is breaking new ground in online shopping by creating a decentralized, user-governed marketplace on the blockchain. Unlike traditional platforms that charge hidden fees, control user data, and impose restrictive policies, Web3Bay hands control back to 3BAY token holders. Why Web3Bay Stands Out Decentralized Ownership – Web3Bay will renounce its smart contract post-ICO, meaning no single entity can alter the system. Governance will be fully handled by token holders through a DAO. Security & Transparency – Transactions are secured through smart contracts on a Layer-1 blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof records. Additionally, all data is stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), protecting users from security breaches. Staking & Discounts – 3BAY holders can stake tokens to earn passive income and receive a 5% discount on all transactions made within the platform. Explosive Presale Growth – Web3Bay’s presale has already raised over $1 million, selling 270 million tokens across multiple stages. With each new stage, the price rises, rewarding early adopters with massive potential gains. Current Price: $0.004562625 (Stage 4) Launch Price: $0.1959 (4,200% ROI) 2. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – The ETF for Meme Coins Meme Index is revolutionizing meme coin investing by offering a curated portfolio of top-performing meme tokens, similar to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in traditional finance. 💡 Key Features: 🔹 Community DAO governance – Holders vote on which meme coins enter the index. 🔹 Staking rewards – Up to 700% APY for early stakers. 🔹 $3M+ raised in presale, with prices at just $0.0155933. If you want meme coin exposure without chasing individual projects, MEMEX offers a diversified approach. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s First Layer-2 Scaling Solution Solaxy is bringing Ethereum-style Layer-2 scaling to Solana, solving network congestion and high gas fees. With Solana’s growing adoption, Solaxy is primed for massive demand. 💡 Why Solaxy is a Game-Changer: 🔹 Reduces transaction costs and speeds up processing. 🔹 Ethereum-Solana bridge for cross-chain interoperability. 🔹 $16.3 million raised, proving strong early support. As institutional investors flock to Solana, Solaxy’s role as a scaling solution makes it a must-watch project. 4. The Last Dwarfs (TLD) – The Next Big GameFi Project The GameFi sector is projected to exceed $60 billion by 2028 , and The Last Dwarfs is positioning itself as a leading blockchain gaming ecosystem . 💡 What Makes TLD Special: 🔹 Fully decentralized in-game economy – Players truly own their assets. 🔹 Staking & governance rewards for token holders. 🔹 300,000+ users onboarded and 50+ partnerships secured. With GameFi continuing to expand, The Last Dwarfs could be one of the biggest presale winners. 5. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – A Next-Gen Crypto Wallet Managing digital assets shouldn’t be complicated , and Best Wallet aims to simplify crypto trading with cutting-edge security and trading tools . 💡 Key Features: 🔹 Multi-chain support (Ethereum, BSC, and more). 🔹 DEX aggregator that finds the best trading rates. 🔹 $8M+ raised in presale, proving strong demand. As crypto adoption increases, wallets like Best Wallet will become essential for traders. Final Thoughts: Don’t Wait Until It’s Too Late Crypto presales offer the highest potential for early adopters, and Web3Bay leads the pack with its game-changing decentralized e-commerce model. Unlike speculative meme coins, Web3Bay is built for real-world use, allowing users to shop with crypto while earning staking rewards and discounts. With Bitcoin breaking records and institutional adoption on the rise, the window for early-stage opportunities won’t last forever. Every presale stage sees higher prices, meaning early investors get the best gains. Beyond Web3Bay, Meme Index, Solaxy, The Last Dwarfs, and Best Wallet Token are also offering high-growth potential in 2025. The next crypto bull run is coming, and these projects are positioned for explosive returns. The question is: will you get in before the market catches on?

Blockchain data indicates the transfer involved more than 90% of its multi-asset treasury, including large amounts of Ethereum (ETH) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), as well as positions in AAVE, ENA, and LINK. World Liberty Financial Moves $307M in Crypto to Coinbase On-chain data from Spotonchain reveals that World Liberty Financial transferred approximately $307 million worth of digital assets to Coinbase Prime. The transactions were part of what the project described as “treasury management and business operations.” The assets moved included ETH, WBTC, and other cryptocurrencies previously held in the project’s treasury. The transfers occurred in 13 separate transactions, ranging from $4 million to $95 million. After these transactions, World Liberty Financial’s total holdings dropped from $363 million to around $33 million. Before the large crypto transfers to the top crypto exchange, World Liberty Financial stated on X that Trump’s DeFi project was not planning to sell its crypto holdings. The DeFi project added, “We’re making routine movements of our crypto holdings as part of regular treasury management, and payment of fees and expenses and to address working capital requirements. To be clear, we are not selling tokens—we are simply reallocating assets for ordinary business purposes.” Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s newly proposed Sovereign Wealth Fund has sparked speculation about the inclusion of Ethereum and Bitcoin as part of its asset portfolio. Treasury Holdings Drop by 90% Following Transfers Notably, World Liberty Financial held approximately $175 million worth of ETH, making it the largest asset in its treasury before the transfers. The project also moved holdings in AAVE, ENA, and LINK, collectively valued at around $30 million. Each transaction was executed through multiple intermediary addresses before reaching Coinbase. The only major asset that remained untouched in the treasury was TRX, which the project had acquired after an investment from Justin Sun . The Tron founder initially invested $30 million and later increased his stake to $75 million, also joining as an advisor. Following the transfers to Coinbase, blockchain data showed that World Liberty Financial began receiving a series of small ETH deposits. These deposits, some as low as a few dollars, originated from newly created or inactive addresses. ETH Price Volatility and Eric Trump’s Comments Ethereum experienced sharp price fluctuations in response to market conditions. ETH initially faced downward pressure due to economic concerns tied to President Trump’s trade tariffs but rebounded 50% in a reversal, surpassing $2,800. It is important to note that the $2,800 ETH price level is a key support, and Ethereum has shown signs of recovery after recent volatility. Large investors, including whales like 7 Siblings, have accumulated ETH, suggesting confidence in a rebound. Amid the market movement, Eric Trump posted on X, suggesting it was a favorable time to buy Ethereum during the recent market dip. In my opinion, it’s a great time to add $ETH . — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) February 3, 2025 Despite the large treasury shift, World Liberty Financial still holds approximately $96.62 million in assets across nine known wallets.

39893992,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=667866,1738636491,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39893992.jpeg,Why some Americans are skeptical about Trump’s EO pushing a Sovereign Wealth Fund,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trumps-eo-pushing-a-sovereign-wealth-fund/,"A section of the American public has expressed their misgivings about the country’s intentions of establishing a Sovereign Wealth Fund(SWF). That follows President Donald Trump’s signing of an Executive Order (EO) directing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his nominee for the Commerce Department, Howard Lutnick, to create the investment tool. Speaking during the EO’s signing on Monday at the Oval Office, Mr. Trump expressed his excitement at development. He said, “We’re going to create a lot of wealth for the fund, and I think it’s about time this country had a sovereign wealth fund. ” Expectedly, news of Mr. Trump’s action stirred his fanbase, with some suggesting the SWF could pave the way for creating a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, one of his campaign promises. That excitement, however, failed to rub off on some US citizens, who took to X to express their apprehension about the proposed SWF. Where is disquiet over Trump’s Sovereign Wealth Fund push coming from? A major point of contention is the opaqueness of the SWF. The president and his team haven’t spelled out how the fund will work, something that X users Michelle Denver and Dave Shaffer alluded to when replying to Whitehouse Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s tweet on the EO. Another concern is that the fund could be misused. Doug Arrowsmith labeled the program a government-funded Oligarchy and crypto ponzi scheme, sentiments that resonated with another user, Squirrelmecha . Meanwhile, Tatiana Fuchs likened the fund to money laundering at the highest levels, and the Grand Duchess chimed in, “That’s code for Elon Musk’s piggy bank.” Their fears tally with the findings of a 2024 Carnegie Endowment for International Peace study . This research found that a lack of governance and regulatory safeguards risks turning SWFs into “conduits of corruption, money laundering, and other illicit activities.” Others considered it a wrong choice to establish an SWF when America is already buried in debt. The concept of sovereign wealth funds was said to be for countries with surplus by Wayne Dupree who identified himself as a conservative voter. Max Műller and Max deFreitas also had no kind words to say about the decision, arguing that it was ill advised for a country as deeply in debt as the U.S. Still of concern was Mr. Trump’s seemingly going back on his word on cutting down the government. Steve Hamill pointed to that with a tinge of sarcasm, referring to how the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is threatening to shut down one government slush fund (USAID) only to create a new one. So, what does establishing a US Sovereign Wealth Fund entail? Talking to reporters after the EO’s signing, Mr. Bessent gave a 12-month time frame to have the SWF up and running. During that time, he and his treasury counterpart will need to first get congressional approval, as the vehicle will need laws anchoring its operations. Despite the GOP’s majority over the Democrats in the legislature, it might need to reach across the aisle to gain political goodwill for the SWFs’ smooth running. That could be challenging, considering the parties’ fractious relationship. If Trump’s SWF is to receive the green light from Congress, then the next challenge would be to raise the funds. Many think this will be difficult in the current environment of the country’s growing public debt and budget deficit. A proposal made has been to implement cost cutting measures such as the Elon Musk led DOGE office is currently implementing. However, these interventions have been contentious, with some analysts implying they could present grounds for litigation derailing the effort. Thirdly, Bessent and Co will need to set up the structure for the SWF’s management and oversight. That would involve creating a broadly acceptable, transparent, independent, and professional team to run the fund. They will also need the public’s buy-in from taxpayers, some of whom have reservations about the proposed SWF. Finally, they will need to develop the rules and regulations that keep it in compliance with US Securities laws. Some of the objectives that the US is expecting from the SWF are to create a long term revenue source, to buffer its economy from market shocks, and to relieve its debt problems.

Ishiba has said he wants to increase “cooperation in the field of AI” and will discuss the matter with US President Donald Trump at a summit meeting on February 7, with a joint statement expected to be forthcoming. The move to deepen relations is ostensibly part of a plan to keep pace with China — a commonly cited Western boogeyman — and prevent the massive state’s undue dominance in the field. Trump, for his part, surprised many of his fiscally conservative supporters after taking office, by announcing a $500 billion joint venture into AI known as “Stargate.” The investment involves both Softbank Group (SBG) and OpenAI, as well as an entity known as Oracle. Ishiba is now doubling down on this trans-Pacific handshake, and plans to meet with Trump on the 7th to further cement the development. Ishiba moves to back US in joint AI development The Japanese PM met with Masayoshi Son, CEO of Japan’s investment and communications giant Softbank, as well as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in Tokyo Monday, and “exchanged views on AI investment in the United States,” according to regional media. “We want Japan and the United States to deepen cooperation in the field of AI and strive to make the world more peaceful, prosperous, and safe,” Ishiba is quoted as saying. While some die-hard Trump supporters are now confused as to how dumping billions into a global AI database called Stargate (and spending even more money on the Biden-era initiative) is going to help “make America great,” Japanese are also doubting their own ruler’s intentions when it comes to the tech. As previously reported here on Cryptopolitan, the Japanese government has openly stated its intentions to govern and surveil the populace with massive AI infrastructure, while everyday residents of the archipelago find themselves in financial straits. In response to the February 3 meeting involving Ishiba and OpenAI, one user of X said : “If you’re going to spend that much money, make an AI made in Japan instead.” This sentiment is not rare. Like the Japanese AI governance initiative, Stargate is also tied to digital health records, and also potential mRNA injection initiatives with a stated goal of fighting cancer. Japan’s “My Number” digital health surveillance and catch-all identification system is similarly controversial with Japanese, as some fear My Number will centralize state control and make private information insecure.

Arctic Pablo Coin at $0.000047 Could Be Your Second Shot For Massive Gains in 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-dogs-ico-arctic-pablo-coin-at-0-000047-could-be-your-second-shot-for-massive-gains-in-2025/,"The rise of meme coins has been nothing short of explosive, and one of the most notable success stories in the space was Dogs. Launched at a minuscule price of $0.0000001 during its ICO, it was initially dismissed by many. However, for those few who believed in its potential, the payoff has been monumental. Early investors who jumped in at the beginning have seen their investments soar, turning pennies into incredible profits. For those who missed out on the chance to invest in Dogs at that low price, there’s no need to dwell on regrets. The best meme coin to join in 2025 is here, and it’s called Arctic Pablo Coin. Already making waves in its presale, Arctic Pablo is a chance for investors to experience the same success that early Dogs investors are now reaping. Let’s dive into why Arctic Pablo Coin could be your ticket to a huge return on investment. Dogs’ ICO: A Missed Opportunity That Made Millionaires When Dogs launched its ICO, it was barely on anyone’s radar. Priced at $0.0000001, few saw it as anything more than a joke or a passing trend. But for the brave investors who took the plunge, the payoff has been nothing short of extraordinary. As the coin gained momentum, driven by its growing community and viral popularity, Dogs saw an unprecedented surge in price. Those who bought in at the beginning have seen their investments skyrocket, with some early adopters seeing returns in the thousands of percent. Now, looking back, those who missed the ICO are regretting it, wishing they had taken the risk and joined in when the price was still incredibly low. It’s a classic case of “you snooze, you lose,” but there’s a silver lining: Arctic Pablo Coin is here, and it’s presenting a fresh opportunity for investors. Let’s take a closer look at how Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be the best meme coin to join in 2025. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Best Meme Coin to Join in 2025—Don’t Miss Out on This Second Chance! When Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) was first introduced, it was priced at an incredibly low $0.000047. With a launch price of $0.008, this offers investors the potential for an ROI of over 16,936% from the seventh stage to the launch. But what truly sets Arctic Pablo apart from other meme coins is its unique presale structure. Unlike other ICOs that follow a standard stage-based presale, Arctic Pablo Coin has taken a different approach by dividing the presale into locations as the coin “travels.” Currently, Arctic Pablo Coin finds itself in the Shangri-La location, which has created a sense of excitement and anticipation. This unique model offers investors a rare opportunity to get in early, just like those who got in at the beginning of Dogs. Another standout feature of Arctic Pablo is its 66% APY for staking during the presale. Investors can lock their tokens and earn substantial rewards, making this opportunity even more appealing for those seeking long-term returns. On top of that, Arctic Pablo offers referral incentives—those who spread the word about the coin can earn additional rewards in APC tokens or USD. These features create a community-driven atmosphere that’s primed for success and further adds to Arctic Pablo’s potential for explosive growth. Why Arctic Pablo Coin Is Poised for Explosive Growth in 2025—A Low Entry Price You Can’t Ignore The momentum behind Arctic Pablo Coin is undeniable. With over $870,000 raised already in its presale, the project is off to a strong start. The current price of $0.000047 is still remarkably low, but the presale won’t last forever. Investors who get in now can still take advantage of these rock-bottom prices before the coin launches at its $0.008 price point. Arctic Pablo Coin’s ROI potential is hard to ignore. Early investors have the chance to experience a staggering 16,936% ROI from the seventh stage to the launch price. Compare that to the early days of Dogs, when investors who entered early were rewarded handsomely. Arctic Pablo Coin offers the same type of opportunity for those who were too late to get into Dogs’ ICO. Whether you’re a first-time crypto investor or a seasoned trader looking for the next big thing, Arctic Pablo presents a massive upside potential. Additionally, Arctic Pablo Coin’s community competitions allow users to participate in fun and engaging ways to earn rewards in the form of APC tokens or USD. This further fosters a sense of engagement and inclusion, making Arctic Pablo not just a meme coin, but a project with a loyal and growing community. How Arctic Pablo Coin’s Unique Presale Structure Could Make You a Winner in 2025 What makes Arctic Pablo Coin stand out from other meme coins is its innovative presale structure. Instead of following the traditional staged model, where tokens are released in phases, Arctic Pablo Coin is utilizing a location-based presale system. As the coin “travels,” different locations become the focal points of its presale, creating a sense of excitement and exclusivity. Currently, Arctic Pablo Coin is in the Shangri-La location, and there’s still time to get in before it moves to its next location. This approach has captured the attention of investors who are eager to get in early and ride the wave as the coin progresses. The community-driven rewards, such as staking with an impressive 66% APY and referral incentives, have created an environment where early backers are motivated to spread the word and increase the token’s visibility. As Arctic Pablo continues to build momentum, the potential for huge returns increases, and the unique structure of the presale makes it an exciting investment. If you missed out on Dogs or regret not jumping in sooner, Arctic Pablo Coin offers a second chance to secure a position at a low price before it hits the big leagues. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Your Chance with Arctic Pablo Coin Based on the latest research, the best meme coin to join in 2025 includes Arctic Pablo Coin alongside other popular meme coins like Dogs. However, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as an incredible opportunity for those who missed the early days of Dogs. With an impressive ROI potential, community-driven rewards, and a unique presale structure, Arctic Pablo is positioned for massive growth. The price is still extremely low, and with over $870,000 already raised, the presale is gaining traction quickly. This could be your chance to invest in one of the most promising meme coins of 2025 before it skyrockets. Don’t miss out—join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale now and be part of the next big success story in the meme coin world!

Now, both tokens face sudden price drops, leaving investors shaken. Meanwhile, a PayFi altcoin called Remittix(RTX) has surged by 250% in January, positioning itself as an unexpected hedge against the meme-coin meltdown. With over $10.5 million raised, 430 million tokens sold and a current price of $0.0521, Remittix (RTX) stands out for its real-world approach—focusing on cheaper cross-border transactions rather than social-media hype. Below is a look at the dip in SHIB and PEPE and how Remittix (RTX) found a way to soar despite the meme-coin chaos. Meme-Coin Meltdown: Why SHIB and PEPE Are Struggling Over the past few weeks, Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw a dramatic slip, plagued by questions about its Shibarium roadmap and whether developer updates can sustain hype. At the same time, Pepe (PEPE) faced a perfect storm of oversupply fears and waning social interest. Meme coins typically rely on viral support: prices tumble swiftly if the conversation dies down or a significant influencer moves on. Observers note that SHIB and PEPE still boast strong communities but are more vulnerable to social sentiment than other crypto sectors. In a jittery market, many traders seek stability or tangible utility—a factor often lacking in comedic tokens. That’s why some early SHIB and PEPE enthusiasts, hoping for big breakouts, now pivot to altcoins with everyday problem-solving at their core. As skepticism about pure meme coins grows, where will we invest if viral chatter no longer guarantees success? Enter PayFi solutions like Remittix (RTX) show steady adoption by tackling real-world pain points. Remittix (RTX): 250% Returns and Counting So, how did Remittix (RTX) manage an impressive 250% surge last month, even as meme coins falter? The altcoin appeals to an entirely different audience—think cross-border businesses, freelancers and unbanked families who lose money to steep bank fees. Imagine a local artisan in Morocco selling handcrafted goods to buyers in France; every time she ships a product, she dreads the high costs of traditional wire transfers. With Remittix (RTX), she can send or receive tokens at far lower fees and convert them to local cash without the usual hurdles. In the long run, that immediate utility matters more than memes attracting a broader audience. This practicality is a magnet for investors skeptical about comedic coins. Observers see a chance for Remittix( RTX) to secure large-scale adoption as more regions discover that wallet-to-cash solutions are cheaper and faster than legacy remittances. Remittix (RTX) has already raised over $10.5 million, sold 430 million tokens, and set its price at $0.0521. Analysts suggest that if altcoin keeps forging partnerships with payment agents worldwide, it will repeat—or surpass—its 250% performance. After all, actual cost savings can drive consistent usage, which perks meme coins typically lack. Conclusion: Is Real-World Adoption the New Trend? Meme coins like SHIB and PEPE showed how fast hype can evaporate, casting doubt on short-lived social media bursts. But Remittix(RTX) underscores a different path to crypto success, anchored in bridging fiat and crypto. If global users see how PayFi platforms can cut fees and time for international transfers, altcoin’s 250% jump might be just the beginning. With the broader market looking for safer, solution-oriented bets, Remittix(RTX) stands out as an attractive alternative for burnt meme-coin holders and new investors. As SHIB and PEPE scramble to recapture buzz, the altcoin is delivering tangible, cost-saving benefits that seem ready to maintain momentum. Ready to Explore Remittix (RTX)?

Many are concerned that the exchange may have been “rugpulled.” Xeggex officials have explained that the CEO’s account was hacked, which led to a temporary suspension of logins and access to user funds. However, the exchange reassured users that their wallets were successfully locked to prevent any loss of funds. The database was disconnected from the network, which caused the inability to log in to accounts, though the front-end of the website remained operational. The situation caused a lot of panic among users, especially with the order books showing empty and balances not visible. Some users expressed concern that the platform may have suffered a more severe breach. To safeguard against potential threats, Xeggex took the database offline to prevent hackers from further exploiting the platform. The company has committed to conducting a full assessment of the breach and plans to update users as soon as possible. While no funds have been moved according to blockchain data, the exchange is still investigating the hack’s full impact. At this point, Xeggex has confirmed that they are actively working to secure all wallets and prevent further issues. “Dear users, in this hard time our CEO was hacked and he lost tg account and xeggex community group beside that we still don’t know details about it. Also what is important in this moment is that we succeed to lock down wallets so funds are safe,” the company said.

With its groundbreaking AI-blockchain integration and rapid presale momentum, Lightchain AI could be positioning itself as the next major disruptor in the crypto market.

Presale Growth Signals Strong Investor Confidence Lightchain AI has already raised an impressive $14 million during its presale, signaling strong confidence from early investors in its growth potential. With its combination of a low entry price and high-utility blockchain solutions, the project has quickly gained recognition as one of the most exciting presale opportunities for 2025. As institutional interest in AI-powered blockchain projects continues to rise, Lightchain AI is uniquely positioned to capture significant attention. Its innovative approach to blending AI and blockchain has attracted early accumulation by whales, further emphasizing its potential for long-term success. The growing anticipation around Lightchain AI suggests the project could experience strong price action upon its market debut. Investors are watching closely as it prepares to disrupt the blockchain space. Is Lightchain AI the Next Major Market Disruptor?

With a presale price under $0.20 and a rapid rise in popularity, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts who believe that $300 today could turn into $999,000 in the near future. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Transform Your Investment 1. Early-Stage Opportunity OFFICIALMAGACOIN is still in its presale phase, offering a ground-floor opportunity for investors to buy in before the token gains mainstream attention. This is the stage where gains of 1,000x or more become achievable, as seen with Bitcoin in its early days. 2. Exclusive AvailabilityUnlike widely distributed coins, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand, ensuring that early adopters benefit as interest surges. 3. Record-Breaking Presale SuccessRaising over $1 million in presale funds in record time, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its appeal among investors. Such strong initial support is a hallmark of projects poised for explosive growth. 4. Massive Growth PotentialExperts are predicting OFFICIALMAGACOIN could follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps, transforming small investments into extraordinary returns. With its low entry price and strong market momentum, the potential for turning $300 into $999,000 feels more achievable than ever. How It Stacks Up Against SOL, MATIC, KAS, and BTC Bitcoin (BTC): A proven store of value, but its days of exponential growth are behind it. Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum OFFICIALMAGACOIN is generating. Don’t Miss Out on OFFICIALMAGACOIN The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but OFFICIALMAGACOIN might just be that opportunity. With its affordable price, exclusivity, and massive growth potential, it’s a must-watch for 2025. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and stay updated on their journey via Twitter/X.

In a newly-unsealed indictment filed in the Eastern District of New York (EDNY), prosecutors say Andean “Andy” Medjedovic was the mastermind behind both exploits. Though Medjedovic’s alleged role in the KyberSwap exploit was previously unknown, he has publicly admitted to being the Indexed Finance attacker, wiping $16 million from the DeFi platform when he was still a teenager. Read more: After Stealing $16M, This Teen Hacker Seems Intent on Testing ‘Code is Law’ in the Courts Medjedovic did little to hide his identity as the Indexed Finance hacker because he professed to believe he wasn’t actually doing anything illegal. Another DeFi hacker, Avraham “Avi” Eisenberg, took a similar “code is law” position after his 2022 Mango Markets exploit, claiming that siphoning $110 million from the decentralized exchange was fair game. A New York jury disagreed , finding Eisenberg guilty of fraud and market manipulation . He will be sentenced later this year, and faces up to 20 years in prison. Medjedovic has been on the run since December 2021, when a Canadian court issued a warrant for his arrest. In 2023, he told a DeFi Llama reporter that it was “exhausting” living as a fugitive, saying that he had been bouncing around through Europe, South America and an unnamed island nation while on the lam. A spokesperson for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) told CoinDesk that Medjedovic remains “at large” and is not believed to be in the U.S. Eight months after telling the same reporter that he was now a whitehat hacker, prosecutors say Medjedovic stole about $50 million from KyberSwap . According to the indictment, Medjedovic planned the KyberSwap hack for months before acting, writing to himself “Find time to Strike!” and creating a “POST-EXPLOITATION” plan for himself. In one file, Medjedovic allegedly mused on his past mistakes, writing “Going On the run / Yes / Chance of getting caught Medjedovic has been charged with one count of wire fraud, one count of unauthorized damage to a protected computer, one count of attempted Hobbs Act extortion, one count of money laundering conspiracy and one count of money laundering.

Within just two weeks, its price had skyrocketed to an all-time high that was simply eye-watering. Early investors reaped significant rewards, while those who hesitated were left watching from the sidelines. Notcoin’s integration into the Telegram ecosystem and its play-to-earn gaming model contributed to its rapid ascent, with its market cap approaching $1 billion shortly after launch. The regret of missing out on such a lucrative opportunity is palpable among many in the crypto community. But fear not, for the crypto universe is brimming with new opportunities. Enter BTFD Coin, currently in its 14th presale stage, priced at $0.00016 per token. The presale has already raised over $5.85 million, with more than 68 billion tokens sold and a growing community of over 10,200 holders. Analysts predict that BTFD Coin could surge to $0.0006 or even $0.006 upon listing, offering substantial potential gains for early investors. With its unique features and strong community backing, BTFD Coin presents a promising alternative for those seeking the next big opportunity in the meme coin space. Notcoin’s Meteoric Rise: A Lesson From the Past Notcoin’s ICO on May 16, 2024, was a game-changer. Starting at $0.0068 per token, it didn’t take long for the coin to capture the market’s attention. By June 1, the price had soared to $0.0284, marking a 317% increase in just two weeks. This rapid growth was fueled by its seamless integration into the Telegram ecosystem and an engaging play-to-earn gaming model. Within 30 hours of launch, Notcoin’s Telegram game attracted over 1 million new users, driving its market cap to nearly $1 billion. Trading volumes surged past $1.47 billion on May 29, solidifying Notcoin’s position among the heavyweights of meme cryptocurrencies. Those who got in early celebrated significant gains, while latecomers could only watch as the opportunity slipped away. BTFD Coin: Presale Success? Sounds Like It! For those who missed out on Notcoin, BTFD Coin offers a fresh opportunity. Currently, in its 14th presale stage, BTFD Coin is priced at $0.00016 per token . The presale has already raised over $5.85 million, with more than 68 billion tokens sold and a rapidly growing community of over 10,200 holders. Analysts are buzzing with predictions, suggesting that BTFD Coin could surge to $0.0006 or even $0.006 upon listing. Such projections indicate a potential for substantial returns for early investors. Investment Potential: Detangling the Numbers Suppose you invest $5,000 in BTFD Coin at the current presale price of $0.00016 per token. Here’s how the math works out: Number of Tokens Purchased: $5,000 / $0.00016 = 31,250,000 BTFD tokens Now, if the price reaches $0.0006 per token: Value of Investment: 31,250,000 tokens * $0.0006 = $18,750 That’s a potential profit of $13,750, representing a 275% return on your initial investment. And if the price climbs to $0.006, the numbers become even more impressive: Value of Investment: 31,250,000 tokens * $0.006 = $187,500 In this scenario, you’d be looking at a whopping $182,500 profit—a 3,650% return. While these figures are speculative and depend on market dynamics, they illustrate the significant potential that early investment in promising meme coins like BTFD Coin can offer. But what else does BTFD Coin have up its sleeve besides its crazy presale momentum? Well, to name a few, there’s the staking APY of 90% , a P2E game with rewards convertible into $BTFD tokens, a referral program that rewards both referrers and referrals and more to come. What’s not to be hyped about? To Summarize: Seize the Opportunity Today! The crypto market is known for its volatility, but with risk comes the potential for reward. BTFD Coin’s presale success and the optimistic projections from analysts make it a compelling option for those looking to capitalize on the next big meme coin. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by—consider participating in the BTFD Coin presale and position yourself for potential gains. It hasn’t been named one of the top new meme coins with 1000X potential for nothing! Find Out More: Website: https://www.btfd.io/ X/Twitter: https://x.com/BTFD_COIN Telegram: https://t.me/btfd_coin FAQs Why did Notcoin’s price rise after its ICO? Notcoin’s rapid price surge was driven by its integration with Telegram, which brought in over 1 million users in just 30 hours. Its play-to-earn game also created massive demand, helping its market cap reach nearly $1 billion in record time. What makes BTFD Coin one of the top new meme coins with 1000X potential? BTFD Coin’s presale success, strong community of over 10,200 holders, and staking rewards give it serious growth potential. Analysts predict it could reach $0.0006 or even $0.006, making it a strong contender for high returns. How much could I make if BTFD Coin follows Notcoin’s explosive growth? If you invest $5,000 at the current presale price of $0.00016 and BTFD Coin rises to $0.0006, your investment would be worth $18,750. If it reaches $0.006, it would skyrocket to $187,500.

ETH is up nearly 10% and now faces a major resistance near $2,920. Ethereum started a decent upward move above the $2,500 support zone. The price is trading below $2,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,920 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it stays below the $2,920 level. Ethereum Price Attempts Recovery Ethereum price started a major decline below the $2,800 level, underperforming Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $2,650 and $2,500 levels to enter a bearish zone. There was a clear move below the $2,200 level. The price declined over 25% and tested the $2,120 zone. A low was formed at $2,127 and the price recently started a fresh upward move. There was an increase above the $2,500 level. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,403 wing high to the $2,127 swing low. However, the bears are now active near the $2,900 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,920 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,900 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,920 level and the trend line or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,403 wing high to the $2,127 swing low. The main resistance is now forming near $3,000. A clear move above the $3,000 resistance might send the price toward the $3,120 resistance. An upside break above the $3,120 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,250 resistance zone or even $3,320 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,900 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,765 level. The first major support sits near the $2,650. A clear move below the $2,650 support might push the price toward the $2,500 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,420 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350.

However, some crypto analysts see this sharp decline as a buying opportunity, suggesting that BTC may be oversold and poised for a rebound. Is Bitcoin Poised For A Relief Rally? Yesterday, the crypto market experienced one of its largest sell-offs in history, with over $2.3 billion in liquidations affecting more than 742,000 traders. This level of liquidations surpasses those seen during the COVID market crash in March 2020 and the FTX collapse in November 2022. Related Reading: Crypto Traders Wrecked As Trump’s Tariffs Spark $2 Billion Liquidation Despite the downturn, some analysts argue that BTC may have entered oversold territory, signaling a potential relief rally. Crypto analyst Caleb Franzen shared insights in a post on X, highlighting that Bitcoin’s 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped into oversold levels. He noted: For the 5th time since August 2024, Bitcoin’s 4-hour RSI is becoming oversold. Each of the prior signals were attractive accumulation periods, even if price made new short-term lows after the signal flashed. For the uninitiated, the RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes to determine whether BTC is overbought or oversold. A reading above 70 suggests overbought conditions – potential for a pullback – while a reading below 30 indicates oversold conditions – potential for a rebound. According to Franzen’s chart, Bitcoin’s current RSI is hovering around 24 on the 4-hour timeframe, indicating that BTC may be in an attractive accumulation zone. If historical trends hold, BTC could be on the verge of a short-term recovery. Is There More Trouble For BTC Ahead? As of the latest updates, Donald Trump and his Mexican counterpart Claudia Sheinbaum have agreed to temporarily delay the proposed trade tariffs, offering some relief to financial markets. However, uncertainty remains regarding trade negotiations with Canada, leaving investors cautious about BTC’s next move. Related Reading: Is The Crypto Market ‘Satiated’ For Now? Analysts Say Bitcoin Will Continue Sideways Move Meanwhile, fellow crypto analyst Johnny’s analysis indicates that “the meat” of BTC’s current down move is likely over. The analyst added that as long as BTC continues to trade above range lows and the yearly open, it will “look good compared to the rest of the market.” However, not all experts are optimistic. Renowned businessman and author Robert Kiyosaki warns that BTC could face further downside pressure if Trump follows through with his tariff plans. According to Kiyosaki, increased tariffs could strengthen the US dollar, potentially driving investors away from risk assets like Bitcoin in the short term. At press time, BTC trades at $98,644, up 0.4% in the past 24 hours.

With Crypto.com and Kalshi under review, could stricter oversight be coming for event-based trading? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is closely scrutinizing Crypto.com and Kalshi Inc., seeking clarity on how their newly launched Super Bowl event contracts align with U.S. derivatives regulations, according to Bloomberg . This heightened oversight comes on the heels of a Jan. 27 announcement in which the CFTC ’s leadership pledged to monitor emerging issues in the derivatives market, with event-based trading products falling squarely in their sights. Crypto.com, which operates a U.S.-based derivatives exchange, had notified the CFTC on Dec. 19 of its intent to launch Super Bowl-related contracts by Dec. 23. However, the short notice left regulators with minimal time to review the products ahead of the Christmas holiday and amid concerns over a possible government shutdown. Weeks later, the CFTC is now flexing its regulatory authority, requesting additional information from firms that self-certify their financial offerings. Under existing derivatives laws, firms that self-certify must demonstrate that their products are not easily manipulated and comply with U.S. regulations. While the CFTC’s review process does not grant it immediate power to halt trading, the agency can later issue bans or take enforcement action if concerns arise. A CFTC spokesperson confirmed, “We are continuing to review the contracts in accordance with our regulations,” while leaving the door open for potential enforcement or new rulemaking. Crypto.com remains firm in defending its stance. “We firmly believe in the legality of our event contracts and believe the CFTC is the appropriate regulator to bring federally regulated market integrity, manipulation controls, and product availability in all 50 states,” a company spokesperson told Bloomberg. Interestingly, Crypto.com had previously withdrawn two sports-related filings that were under regulatory scrutiny, later opting to self-certify a new contract targeting spectator sports and related industries. Meanwhile, Kalshi Inc. launched its “Kansas City vs. Philadelphia” Super Bowl market on Jan. 24, which has already seen trading volume climb to nearly $2.5 million as of Jan. 4. Additionally, the company introduced contracts allowing users to wager on brands likely to advertise during the Super Bowl, drawing more than $1.5 million in trading activity. Amid this, the broader prediction markets industry has seen volatility. During the 2024 U.S. presidential election cycle, Polymarket —the largest decentralized prediction market—processed more than $2.5 billion in bets, with election-related wagers leading the surge. You might also like: Singapore and CFTC zero in on Polymarket as wildfire bets fuel public outcry However, by January 2025, volumes dropped significantly to around $1.24 billion, reflecting a cooling interest after the election hype subsided. The CFTC’s ongoing review coincides with Robinhood Markets’ entry into event-based trading. On Feb. 3, Robinhood announced that it would enable its derivatives clients to trade sports event contracts through Kalshi’s exchange. “With an emerging asset class like event contracts, we recognize an opportunity to better serve our customers as their interests converge across the markets, news, sports, and entertainment,” Robinhood stated. While the agency can’t immediately halt trading of these contracts due to a mandatory 90-day review process, it retains the power to ban them later. With the Super Bowl set for Feb. 9, any decision will come after the event.

Sacks, who serves as the White House’s cryptocurrency advisor, will be joined by prominent figures, including Chairman Tim Scott, Chairman John Boozman, Chairman French Hill, and Chairman Thompson. The press conference, scheduled for 2:30 PM, is expected to bring critical discussions about the future of digital assets in the U.S. Key topics likely to be addressed include the potential for a Bitcoin reserve, a crypto stockpile, and updates on upcoming crypto legislation. With French Hill, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, present, there could also be insights into potential tax reforms impacting cryptocurrency transactions. Industry experts, like Perianne Boring of the Digital Chamber of Commerce, see this collaboration between Congress and the administration as a positive step toward a unified, pro-crypto stance. “Very good sign to see multiple congressional committees come together with the administration to deliver a unified message,” Boring stated, adding that big moves are on the horizon for crypto space. https://twitter.com/PerianneDC/status/1886487270925951039 The timing of the press conference aligns with growing optimism about the crypto market, especially as many analysts are predicting a rally into the second quarter of 2025. Bitcoin has rebounded after a major dip caused by tariff concerns, reaching $102,000 today. The tariff situation between Mexico and Canada has been pushed back 30 days, easing market fears. While the market is not completely out of danger, this recovery is a positive sign.

While major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain solid choices, their high prices make it challenging for smaller investors to gain exposure. That’s where presale tokens under $1 come in. These low-cost cryptos provide an opportunity to enter at a fraction of the price while still holding significant growth potential. Some of these projects bring game-changing innovations to blockchain technology, DeFi, gaming, and decentralized marketplaces. Among these, Web3Bay ($3BAY) stands out as one of the most exciting blockchain projects, transforming e-commerce through decentralization. Let’s explore the top seven new cryptocurrencies under $1 that could deliver massive gains in 2025. 1. Web3Bay ($3BAY) – The Future of Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is redefining online shopping by eliminating middlemen and putting buyers and sellers in full control. Unlike traditional marketplaces that charge hidden fees and dictate policies, Web3Bay is community-governed, allowing users to vote on platform decisions. Why Web3Bay Is a Game-Changer Decentralized Ownership – Web3Bay will renounce its smart contract after presale, meaning no single entity can control or manipulate the platform. Governance is fully handled through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Secure Transactions – Built on a Layer-1 blockchain, all transactions are tamper-proof and verifiable, ensuring complete trust and transparency. Passive Income & Staking Rewards – Users can stake their 3BAY tokens to earn passive income, helping secure the network while generating long-term returns. Massive Presale Growth – Web3Bay’s presale has already raised over $1 million, selling 257.7 million tokens in just a few stages. Current Price : $0.004562625 (Stage 4) Launch Price : $0.1959 ( 4,200% ROI potential ) 2. Pandana (PNDN) – The First Panda-Themed Meme Coin Pandana ($PNDN) is an emerging meme coin that has already raised $1 million in its presale. With a zero-fee model, investors only pay for tokens and network fees, making it one of the most cost-effective entries into the meme coin space. 🔹 Total Supply: 8 billion tokens 🔹 50% allocated to presale 🔹 No vesting period – Tokens are distributed within 48 hours Pandana’s smart contract is fully audited, ensuring security and trust. As meme coins continue to thrive, Pandana offers a fun yet lucrative opportunity for early adopters. 3. Solaxy (SOLX) – Solana’s First Layer-2 Scaling Solution Solaxy is Solana’s first Layer-2 blockchain, designed to enhance speed, lower gas fees, and increase scalability. As Solana’s adoption grows, the demand for efficient transaction solutions like Solaxy is skyrocketing. 🔹 Ethereum-Solana Bridge – Enables seamless transactions between both networks 🔹 Drastically reduces transaction fees 🔹 $16.3 million raised in presale With institutional investors eyeing Solana, Solaxy could become one of the most profitable Layer-2 solutions in the near future. 4. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – The ETF for Meme Coins Meme Index ($MEMEX) is an innovative crypto index fund for meme coins, allowing users to invest in baskets of top-performing tokens instead of picking individual ones. 🔹 DAO-governed – Holders vote on which meme coins enter the index 🔹 Staking rewards of up to 700% APY 🔹 $3M+ raised in presale For those who want exposure to the meme coin market with reduced risk, MEMEX offers a diversified approach. 5. The Last Dwarfs (TLD) – The Next Big GameFi Project With blockchain gaming booming, The Last Dwarfs is emerging as a major player by offering a fully decentralized gaming economy where players own all in-game assets. 🔹 Play-to-earn model – Players earn rewards while playing 🔹 Staking & governance options 🔹 Already attracted 300,000+ users With GameFi projected to surpass $60 billion by 2028, The Last Dwarfs could be one of the biggest gaming cryptos in 2025. Final Thoughts The crypto market is evolving fast, and low-cost presale tokens under $1 offer the best chance for exponential gains. While meme coins like Pandana and Meme Index capitalize on community hype, and Solaxy enhances Solana’s scalability, Web3Bay stands out as the most innovative project with real-world utility. As a decentralized e-commerce platform, Web3Bay eliminates middlemen, hidden fees, and centralized control, giving power back to users. Its staking rewards, smart contract renouncement, and strong presale growth position it as the next big cryptocurrency under $1.

The price is back above $2.65 and now faces hurdles near the $2.820 level. XRP price started a strong upward move above the $2.50 level. The price is now trading below $2.80 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2.420 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.820 resistance zone. XRP Price Recovers Over 25% XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.850 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined heavily below the $2.50 and $2.350 support levels. The bears even pushed it below $2.00. There was a sharp drop of over 25% and the price tested the $1.75 zone. A low was formed at $1.75 and the price recently started a sharp recovery wave. The bulls pumped the price above the $2.20 and $2.50 levels. There was a move above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.155 swing high to the $1.750 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2.420 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.80 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.80 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.820 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.155 swing high to the $1.750 low. The next resistance is $2.940. A clear move above the $2.940 resistance might send the price toward the $3.00 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.050 resistance or even $3.120 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.20. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.820 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.620 level. The next major support is near the $2.50 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.50 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.450 support. The next major support sits near the $2.350 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.

Let’s face it – the hype is real. Currently, the $RBLK coin is available for $0.052 and it’s reaching a new price of $0.065 when it hits stage 11. Meanwhile, Pepe Coin (PEPE) has built a name off meme culture, riding trends and staying relevant. Rollblock (RBLK) is aiming for the same kind of dominance but with real utility behind it. With huge presale momentum, a growing community, and a strong use case in crypto gambling, Rollblock is shaping up to be the hottest crypto of 2025. Rollblock is the New Hottest Crypto of 2025 Rollblock (RBLK) is blowing up, and for good reason. This Ethereum-based GambleFi project is shaking up the online casino world with fair, transparent gaming and huge rewards for investors. The Rollblock casino is packed with over 7,000 games and tons of sports betting options. You can bet with 20+ cryptos, meaning fast deposits, quick payouts, and no banking headaches. And since everything runs on-chain, every bet is publicly verifiable, so there’s no funny business – just fair play. But here’s where it gets even better: RBLK holders get paid. Rollblock shares a portion of casino profits with investors, offering up to 30% APY. On top of that, the project buys back and burns RBLK tokens, cutting supply and driving up the price. With crypto gambling booming and a market worth $540 billion, Rollblock is in the perfect spot to take off. That’s why investors have already poured in over$10 million – and this could just be the beginning. When we look at how other coins managed to pull their presales, Rollblock is doing amazingly well. PEPE Price Seems to Have a Hard Time As 2025 kicks off, PEPE is slowly losing its grip. The PEPE price has been dropping for a while, and in the last 30 days alone, it’s down 54%. Back in November’s bull run, PEPE saw a huge pump, but after that, it started slipping. It managed to jump 30% in December, giving holders some hope, but then January hit hard. PEPE crashed back down to its pre-bull run price, wiping out those gains. So, what’s going on? Culture and trends aren’t enough anymore for PEPE. In a crypto market packed with major events – from Trump’s inauguration to big moves in the crypto space – PEPE is struggling to keep up. And here’s the thing: everything is falling right now. But that might not be bad news. Historically, big market dips like this often signal a new bull run is coming. Could this be the setup for the next crypto explosion? Conclusion Rollblock (RBLK) is on fire, yeah – closing in on $10 million in presale, while PEPE struggles to stay relevant. Trends and memes can only go so far – real utility wins and Rollblock is proving it with 7,000+ games, on-chain betting, and a 30% APY for investors. With crypto markets shaky, all signs point to a new bull run, and Rollblock is positioned to explode. Investors aren’t waiting – they’re locking in RBLK now before prices skyrocket. Once the presale ends, this might be the last chance to buy low. Are you in? Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Meanwhile, PlutoChain , a Bitcoin Layer-2 solution, might advance scalability with AI-powered applications and 2-second block times. It also adds smart contracts to the BTC network which could boost its ecosystem and case uses. Here’s what’s fueling XRP’s breakout potential first. XRP Price Prediction – Can XRP Hit $6.35 in the 3rd Wave? XRP has been gaining traction, with Binance analysts eyeing a 285% surge that could push its price to $6.35. XRP’s use in cross-border transactions and growing integration into banking systems continue to boost demand. Financial institutions are increasingly adopting Ripple’s technology, which reinforces its position in the payment sector. TradingView data suggests a strong uptrend, with price consolidations setting up for a potential breakout. Binance analysts predict that if momentum continues, XRP could sustain its upward trajectory beyond $6.35, which could further solidify its role in institutional finance. However, market conditions and macroeconomic factors will play a key role in determining whether this bullish wave materializes. How PlutoChain Might Expand Bitcoin’s Scalability and Cross-Chain Functionality PlutoChain could reshape Bitcoin’s ecosystem with its advanced Layer-2 framework, and potentially deliver significant improvements in speed, efficiency, and interoperability. PlutoChain might open new doors for decentralized applications and financial systems by addressing Bitcoin’s inherent limitations. One of PlutoChain’s standout features is its high-speed processing capability. With 2-second block times and the ability to handle up to 43,200 transactions per day, it could significantly improve Bitcoin’s scalability. This advancement might reduce congestion and transaction delays, which could make Bitcoin more suitable for real-world applications beyond simple transfers. PlutoChain might bridge Bitcoin and Ethereum by offering full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. This feature allows Ethereum-based dApps and smart contracts to operate seamlessly within Bitcoin’s network. It could open the doors to a wide range of applications, from financial tools to NFT platforms, and potentially broaden Bitcoin’s functionality in ways previously limited by its original design. PlutoChain potentially enhances Bitcoin’s usability by integrating decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which could make it a more versatile blockchain for lending, staking, and decentralized trading. PlutoChain maintains a strong focus on security, undergoing extensive audits from industry-leading firms such as SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi.

Despite this partial recovery, the cryptocurrency remains down 5.8% over the past week and more than 13% below its all-time high of $109,000, reached in January. This recent price movement has led a CryptoQuant analyst to suggest that Bitcoin may be transitioning into a distribution cycle, a phase where price gains start to slow as supply shifts toward newer market participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Is Trading In This Bearish Flag — What’s The Downside Target? Bitcoin Transitioning From Accumulation to Distribution The analyst known as Oinonen, discussed the current state of Bitcoin’s market cycle in a recent post titled “Entering the Distribution Cycle.” Oinonen noted that after gaining 129.2% over the past year and surpassing $100,000, Bitcoin might be nearing a “cycle top.” He cited comments from Ki Young Ju, who suggested that the market is in the “early distribution phase” and could potentially see a few more quarters of growth, influenced by retail investors entering the market and broader promotional efforts. Applying Dow Theory to Bitcoin’s recent market patterns, Oinonen explained that the cryptocurrency’s market movements can be divided into accumulation and distribution phases. He pointed out that while 2022 represented a clear distribution cycle, Bitcoin transitioned into an accumulation cycle in 2023, which extended through 2024. Now, as 2025 unfolds, Bitcoin appears to be shifting back into a distribution phase. Despite this shift, Oinonen emphasized that the market still has the potential for further price discovery, citing relatively low funding rates and a lack of overleveraged conditions. Price Supports and Future Outlook Oinonen also cited Axel Adler Jr, another market observer, who shared similar sentiments, noting that Bitcoin’s current market environment is not overheated and retains the potential for additional growth under stable macroeconomic conditions. This view is supported by the ongoing institutional demand reflected in MicroStrategy’s recent Bitcoin purchases. The company has continued its pro-cyclical acquisition strategy, adding 10,107 bitcoins in early 2025 and bringing its total holdings to 471,107 BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes $108K: Can Bulls Sustain Momentum Against Bearish Signals? This sustained institutional interest serves as a leading indicator of market confidence and highlights Bitcoin’s continued appeal as a long-term investment. Oinonen mentioned that as Bitcoin hovers near its “fair price” support level of $87,990—identified by its power-law fit—further developments should be watched out for. The analyst added: Despite the approaching distribution cycle, Bitcoin might still reach significantly higher spot price levels. Bitcoin’s funding rate is relatively low and comparable to summer 2024 levels. We’re far from an overleveraged market, and the structure supports further spot price discovery.

Not even close! But Remittix (RTX ) is making history. With a starting price of just $0.0539, it’s already setting records and exciting investors. Many believe it could grow fast and bring huge profits. Could this be the next big thing in crypto? Let’s find out! Will Dogecoin Bounce Back? Remittix Takes the Spotlight Drop about five percent and below the significant $0.35 support level, Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has had a wild ride. Although it is presently selling at $0.3241, Meme coin followers still hope it may have a huge comeback. Thanks in major part to Elon Musk’s immense enthusiasm and support, Dogecoin peaked at $0.737 in 2021. Although some analysts anticipate it might reach $1 by 2026, there are misgivings since DOGE lacks significant improvements. Meanwhile, a new star is rising, Remittix (RTX). Unlike Dogecoin, which struggles to regain its momentum, Remittix is skyrocketing. In just a short time, it has set mega records, reaching a price of $0.0498. Investors are buzzing with excitement because Remittix is growing at a pace that Dogecoin and PEPE never did in their opening weeks. Remittix is already on track for huge profits; some estimate 100X gains, while DOGE takes time to acquire traction. Dogecoin remains one of the strongest Meme coins but its growth might be slowing down. If it doesn’t break past $0.34 soon, it could drop to $0.26. Will Dogecoin surprise everyone with another massive rally, or will Remittix continue to dominate? Investors are watching closely! PEPE Struggles While Remittix Takes Off PEPE Coin had an incredible year, jumping by 1,321% and reaching $1.23. This huge growth was helped by getting listed on big exchanges like Coinbase and Robinhood, making it more popular. Meme coins like Pepe, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu rely on hype and internet fun but their prices can go up and down really fast. Recently, PEPE lost its spot as the third-largest Meme coin to a new TRUMP token, which quickly reached $10 billion in value. Although it is presently selling at $0.00001322, this shows how unpredictable Meme coins can be. While they are exciting, they can also be risky since their prices change so quickly. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) is growing at lightning speed. Unlike Pepe and Dogecoin, which took time to gain traction, Remittix set mega records in just its opening weeks. With its price now at $0.0521, many believe it could skyrocket even higher. While Meme coins struggle, Remittix is proving to be a stronger and more reliable choice for investors looking for massive gains! Remittix Is Growing Fast and Breaking Records A new cryptocurrency is making headlines Remittix (RTX). Unlike Meme coins like Dogecoin and Pepe, which depend on hype, Remittix is built for real-world use. It allows businesses and individuals to turn crypto into real money instantly without extra fees or delays. Right now, Remittix is increasing rapidly. In just its opening weeks, it has already set huge records, with investors rushing in. While other cryptos struggled to reach $10 million, Remittix is soaring past expectations. Its presale has raised millions and experts predict it could skyrocket 250x in value. What makes Remittix different is its PayFi system, which connects digital assets with real-world banking. This means businesses, freelancers, and everyday users can easily spend their crypto like cash. It also passed a strict smart contract audit, proving it is safe and reliable. With its rapid growth and strong real-world use, Remittix is quickly becoming one of the most exciting new cryptos. Many believe it could overtake the biggest names in the market very soon!

This milestone highlights Bitcoin’s increasing market share , as investors move away from altcoins amid ongoing economic uncertainties. Key Bitcoin Dominance Statistics: Current Bitcoin dominance: ~64% Highest level since: February 2021 Altcoin market share: Declining as BTC consolidates its lead Bitcoin’s dominance metric measures its share of the total crypto market capitalization , signaling whether investors are favoring BTC over alternative cryptocurrencies. Why Is Bitcoin Dominance Rising? Several factors are contributing to Bitcoin’s growing dominance in the crypto market : 1. Increased Institutional Investment in Bitcoin Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale are driving institutional demand. Traditional finance firms view BTC as a store of value over altcoins. 2. Altcoin Struggles & Market Corrections Many altcoins have underperformed compared to Bitcoin. Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP have seen price corrections, leading traders to shift back to BTC. 3. Bitcoin’s Stability in Uncertain Economic Conditions Global macroeconomic uncertainties (such as interest rate concerns and trade tariffs) have strengthened BTC’s appeal. Investors consider Bitcoin a safer long-term asset compared to high-risk altcoins. What This Means for the Crypto Market Bullish for Bitcoin A dominance above 60% often signals strong Bitcoin performance . BTC could see continued capital inflows as altcoins remain volatile. Bearish for Altcoins? Historically, high Bitcoin dominance leads to an “Altcoin Season” only after BTC stabilizes . If BTC dominance continues rising, altcoins may face further corrections . Potential Market Scenarios If BTC dominance stabilizes , altcoins may start recovering. If BTC dominance keeps climbing , altcoins could see prolonged underperformance. Conclusion Bitcoin’s dominance surpassing 64% signals a major shift in market sentiment, with investors prioritizing BTC over altcoins . With institutional adoption rising and macro uncertainty persisting , Bitcoin remains the preferred asset in the crypto space. As BTC dominance reaches levels not seen since 2021 , traders should monitor whether altcoins can regain momentum or if Bitcoin continues its path toward further dominance.

This marks a notable shift from Trump’s previous calls for aggressive rate reductions. “I’m not surprised,” Trump stated. “ Holding the rates at this point was the right thing to do. ” His comments come just a week after his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos , where he urged the Fed to lower rates to boost economic growth. Despite his past criticism of the central bank, Trump’s recent remarks suggest a more measured stance on monetary policy . Why Did the Fed Pause Rate Cuts? The Federal Reserve decided to maintain interest rates due to several key economic factors: 1. Inflation Concerns Core inflation remains above target , prompting caution on further rate cuts. The Fed is balancing economic growth and inflation control . 2. Labor Market Resilience Despite global uncertainties, U.S. job data remains strong . The Fed sees no immediate need for additional stimulus . 3. Financial Market Stability Cutting rates further could overheat asset markets . The Fed aims to avoid excessive speculation in stocks and real estate. Trump’s endorsement of the Fed’s decision signals a strategic shift , as he had previously advocated for aggressive monetary easing. Trump’s Evolving Stance on the Federal Reserve Trump has been a consistent critic of the Federal Reserve , often pushing for lower interest rates to spur economic growth. Key Moments in Trump’s Criticism of the Fed: 2019-2020: He repeatedly urged the Fed to cut rates to near-zero . Davos 2025: Advocated for rate cuts just a week before the Fed’s decision . February 2025: Now supports the Fed’s decision to hold rates steady . Trump has also suggested changes to the Fed’s policies , including the controversial idea that the U.S. president should have input on rate decisions . What This Means for the Economy & Markets 1. Signals Stability for Investors Markets often react strongly to monetary policy shifts . Trump’s support for the Fed’s decision may ease volatility . 2. No Immediate Rate Cuts for Borrowers Mortgage rates, loans, and credit costs may not decline further . Businesses may need to adjust borrowing strategies . 3. Political Implications for the Fed’s Independence Trump’s past criticism of the Fed raised concerns over political interference. His new stance could indicate a more balanced relationship with the central bank . Conclusion President Trump’s support for the Fed’s rate pause marks a significant shift in his economic stance. While he has historically demanded lower rates , his recent comments suggest a more cautious approach toward monetary policy. With the Federal Reserve focused on inflation control and economic stability , markets will closely watch whether Trump continues to support their decisions—or returns to advocating for aggressive rate cuts.

This increase in bearish sentiment is attributed to recent U.S. tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China , which could drive inflation higher and weaken crypto market sentiment . Additionally, Bitcoin appears to be forming a double-top reversal pattern , which could signal a further price correction. Why Is Bitcoin Facing Increased Downside Risk? Several key factors are contributing to Bitcoin’s increased risk of decline : 1. Rising U.S. Tariffs and Inflation Concerns The U.S. imposed new tariffs on key trade partners, raising economic uncertainty . Higher inflation risks could lead to stricter Federal Reserve policies , impacting risk assets like Bitcoin. 2. Bearish Options Market Data Deribit’s Bitcoin options market suggests a growing probability of BTC dropping to $75K . Put options (bearish bets) have gained popularity as traders hedge against downside risk. 3. Technical Analysis: Double-Top Reversal Pattern Bitcoin’s recent price movement resembles a double-top , a bearish chart pattern. If BTC fails to hold support above $80K , a drop toward $75K becomes more likely. Will Bitcoin Drop to $75K or Recover? Bearish Scenario (BTC Falls to $75K) Continued macroeconomic uncertainty leads to risk-off sentiment. BTC loses key support levels , confirming a reversal. Options market data suggests a growing probability of a decline. Bullish Scenario (BTC Holds Above $80K & Rallies) Strong buying pressure prevents BTC from breaking key support. Institutional demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs offsets selling pressure. Macroeconomic conditions stabilize, improving market sentiment. Currently, Bitcoin remains at a critical juncture , and the next few weeks will be decisive for its short-term trajectory. Conclusion With Bitcoin’s probability of falling to $75K rising to 22% , traders should monitor market sentiment, options activity, and key support levels . U.S. tariffs, inflation risks, and technical chart patterns could contribute to further downside, but strong institutional demand may help stabilize prices.

Why Did Crypto Liquidations Surge? Several factors contributed to this mass liquidation event : 1.

BTC dominance surged , indicating a shift from altcoins to Bitcoin. 3. High Leverage & Risky Trading Strategies Many traders were using high leverage , leading to forced liquidations when prices moved unexpectedly. Crypto exchanges auto-liquidated positions , further accelerating market losses. How Does This Compare to Past Liquidation Events?

ADA is now correcting losses and struggling to clear the $0.80 resistance. ADA price started a fresh decline from the $0.9250 zone. The price is trading below $0.850 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.8050 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

Bitcoin (BTC) fell 10% to $91,500 . Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) experienced steeper declines . However, analysts at Bernstein argue that while tariffs initially caused a risk-off sentiment , Bitcoin is likely to recover and trade based on its fundamentals once the market stabilizes. Why Analysts Believe Trump’s Tariffs Could Boost Bitcoin 1. Bitcoin’s Long-Term Fundamentals Remain Strong Bernstein maintains its $200K BTC price target for 2025 . Institutional adoption and spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to drive demand. U.S. financial institutions could soon offer crypto custody , following regulatory shifts. 2. Tariffs Could Weaken the U.S. Dollar According to Bitwise’s Jeff Park , Trump’s tariffs are: A strict move to weaken the U.S. dollar . Likely to lower long-term interest rates . Could drive Bitcoin higher as an inflation hedge . Historically, Bitcoin has benefited from monetary policy uncertainty , similar to gold and other alternative assets . 3. Institutional Investors Continue to Accumulate BTC Despite short-term volatility, institutions are increasing Bitcoin exposure . Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen consistent inflows , reinforcing long-term bullish sentiment . Risks: Could Prolonged Tariffs Hurt Crypto? Bearish Arguments from Other Analysts: Extended tariffs could harm the U.S. economy , reducing risk appetite. A prolonged economic slowdown could lead to lower crypto demand . If Bitcoin remains correlated with stocks, it could face further downside volatility . Bullish Scenario: If the U.S. dollar weakens, Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative could strengthen. Institutional adoption, combined with monetary policy shifts , may fuel BTC’s long-term growth. Conclusion While Trump’s tariff policies initially caused Bitcoin to drop , analysts at Bernstein and Bitwise believe that long-term fundamentals remain strong , and the U.S. dollar’s weakening could ultimately boost BTC prices . With institutional interest rising and Bitcoin ETFs expanding , BTC remains positioned for potential long-term gains , despite short-term market uncertainty .

The US President also signed an executive order exploring a US sovereign wealth fund. This started speculation about potential Bitcoin investments, especially after a social media post from Senator Cynthia Lummis. Additionally, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was appointed acting director of the CFPB after Trump removed Rohit Chopra. For now, the reasons behind Bessent’s temporary leadership of the CFPB is still unclear. Trump now has a number of his preferred candidates leading major US financial regulatory bodies. Trump Pauses Tariffs on Canada and Mexico The cryptocurrency market experienced a sharp rebound after an announcement by US President Donald Trump that proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico would be temporarily paused. The move came after discussions with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who confirmed in a statement on X that the 25% tariffs will be on hold for at least 30 days. Trudeau also shared Canada’s plans to improve cooperation with the United States by implementing a $1.3 billion border security plan, which includes the appointment of a Fentanyl czar, classifying cartels as terrorist organizations, and reinforcing the US-Canada border with helicopters and more personnel. Mexico’s tariffs have also been delayed for a month. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that both governments reached a series of agreements, including reinforcing the shared land border while simultaneously working on trade and security concerns. Despite the pause, Trump told Bloomberg TV that negotiations are still ongoing and tariffs could still be imposed if agreements were not finalized. Meanwhile, the executive order issued on Feb. 1 that imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada also included a 10% tariff on China, which is still in effect. A Wall Street Journal report suggested that China’s government is willing to negotiate, with its initial proposal reportedly centered on restoring the Phase 1 trade deal from 2020. This trade deal committed Beijing to increasing its purchases of US exports by $200 billion over two years. On the crypto-based prediction market Polymarket, traders placed odds of 24% that Trump will completely remove the tariff on Mexico before March and a 21% chance that Canada’s tariffs will be revoked. China, however, has only a 7% probability of seeing its tariffs lifted next month. Mexico tariff removal odds (Source: Polymarket ) The crypto market saw very large losses just a day before, when Trump first announced the proposed tariffs on goods from China, Mexico, and Canada. In fact, the announcement led to an estimated $10 billion worth of liquidations. However, after the announcements from world leaders regarding the tariff pause, the market was able to recover. Bitcoin surged past the $100,000 mark, reaching $101,007 after plummeting to a low of $92,000 the previous day, according to CoinMarketCap . Ethereum also saw a bounce to $2,809 after dropping to $2,451 on Feb. 2. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reflected this shift in sentiment by moving into the ”greed” territory with a score of 72. Trump’s Sovereign Wealth Fund Sparks Bitcoin Speculation President Donald Trump also recently signed an executive order directing the government to explore the creation of a sovereign wealth fund. Naturally, this move sparked speculation about potential Bitcoin investments by the US government. During a press event in the Oval Office on Feb. 3, Trump tasked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick with starting the process, and stated that the fund will aim to ”monetize the asset side of the US balance sheet.” Bessent confirmed that the executive order will be enacted within the next 12 months. Trump signing EOs in the Oval Office While Trump and his officials did not explicitly mention cryptocurrencies as part of the fund’s investment strategy, they suggested the government could buy TikTok, which is still under a lot of pressure due to a law requiring its parent company, ByteDance, to divest its US operations or face a potential ban. However, speculation around Bitcoin involvement heated up after Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis hinted on social media that the sovereign wealth fund could be used to buy BTC. Bitcoin advocate Wayne Vaughan also suggested that Bessent and Lutnick might consider allocating part of the fund to crypto. So far, Trump’s executive orders have faced very quick legal challenges since he took office on Jan 20. Some of his actions have already been blocked by courts, including an order trying to revoke birthright citizenship, which a federal judge deemed unconstitutional. His recent executive actions on cryptocurrency have also stirred some debate. On Jan. 23, Trump signed an order establishing a crypto working group while banning the development of a US central bank digital currency (CBDC), though legal experts have questioned the enforceability of this. Trump Appoints Treasury Secretary as CFPB Acting Head US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who was confirmed by the Senate less than a week ago, will also serve as the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) after an order from President Donald Trump. The decision was made after Trump removed former CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, who had urged his successor to continue investigations into Big Tech and Wall Street firms. The reason behind Bessent’s temporary leadership of the CFPB is still unclear. This is especially interesting as he just took on the role of overseeing one of the country’s largest financial departments. Statement from the CFPB Before his confirmation, Bessent aligned himself with the administration’s stance on financial regulations, including opposing the creation of a US central bank digital currency. The Trump administration has been reportedly looking for ways to limit the regulatory reach of agencies overseeing banks, and Tesla CEO and unofficial presidential adviser Elon Musk advocated for the elimination of the CFPB altogether. Additionally, Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 instructing all government agencies to pause proposed rules. This directive could greatly impact regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the CFPB. With Chopra’s removal, Trump now has several of his preferred candidates leading major US financial regulatory bodies. SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda is currently acting chair while the Senate considers Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins for the role. CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham also replaced Rostin Behnam as acting chair on the day of Trump’s inauguration. The CFPB is currently facing legal challenges over its regulatory authority. Technology trade groups TechNet and NetChoice filed a lawsuit against the bureau’s rule that seeks to regulate payment apps and digital wallets in the same way as traditional banks. The rule was finalized in November of 2024, and it seems to exclude crypto wallets and only applies to transactions that are conducted in US dollars.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|MARKET|ASIA|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-04 05:16:53

A report from Blockworks on Monday alleged that representatives from WLFI had pitched protocol teams on a deal to get included in the project’s treasury. The deal was they could buy $10 million WLFI tokens plus a 10 percent fee, and WLFI will purchase the same amount of their protocol’s tokens. “There is no token swap agreement,” a spokesperson from TRON told CoinDesk. TRON’s TRX is the second largest holding in WLFI’s wallet, according to on-chain data curated by Arkham. The WLFI wallet currently holds 40.7 million TRX worth $9.3 million. WLFI made these buys in tranches throughout January . Movement Labs, which saw its MOVE token jump in late January when WLFI purchased $2 million of it, and rumors swirled that the team was in discussion with Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, also denied that there was a swap agreement in place. Rushi Manche, co-founder of Movement Labs, told CoinDesk earlier that they did not send tokens to anyone including WLFI. ""There weren't any deals — any back door deals.

The image accompanying the post displays an order book where one trader has listed XRP at this significantly high price, far above its current trading value of $2.61. The image shows over 288,000 XRP for sale at that price, and this revelation has ignited speculation within the XRP community regarding the trader’s reasoning and expectations for the asset’s future price movement.

What on Earth does this cat know is coming? pic.twitter.com/kaCFlgbrp8 — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) February 3, 2025 Community Reactions And Speculation The post quickly gained traction, with several users responding with their price targets and expectations. One user commented , “My sell order is 9.90,” while another suggested that the $13 target is low, stating , “Needs to change that to $30.” Prominent crypto analysts have set targets around the $13 level , and the community has shown optimism for this lofty target. Some considered it a realistic expectation, with one commenter stating , “Sounds about right for this cycle.” Other traders appeared to take inspiration from the move, adjusting their strategies accordingly. One user shared , “I also now have a sell order at 12.50. I ain’t trying to be greedy!” Meanwhile, another added a more cautious perspective, noting that the trader behind the $13 sell order is likely making an optimistic bet. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Is A $13 Target Realistic? The general sentiment among the commenters is optimistic. It is also likely that this sell order is old. As one commenter pointed out , crypto exchanges no longer allow sell orders this high, suggesting that whoever placed it is a long-time believer in XRP’s potential. XRP has seen significant volatility over time, with periods of rapid price increases followed by corrections. The token has faced regulatory challenges and strong institutional interest, pushing it in different directions. However, this has not shaken the confidence of its loyal community, with community members frequently speculating on even higher targets . It is not uncommon for traders to place high sell orders as part of long-term strategies. These orders can serve as safety measures in case of unexpected price spikes or news-driven movements. Given the history of crypto markets, sudden price surges are not impossible, and XRP has experienced its fair share. As one expert said in 2024 when XRP moves, it moves fast and aggressively, and this sell order could be in anticipation of these fast movements.

Coinbase received approval from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), making it the country’s largest registered crypto exchange, while Kraken acquired a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) license in the European Union, allowing it to offer crypto derivatives trading. These regulatory milestones come as both exchanges continue to expand internationally amid evolving compliance frameworks in the UK and EU, signaling growing institutionalization and mainstream acceptance of digital assets. Coinbase Secures FCA Approval, Strengthening Its Position in the UK Crypto Market Coinbase has received approval from the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as a registered virtual asset service provider (VASP). This regulatory greenlight cements the exchange’s status as the largest FCA-registered crypto exchange in the country and significantly expands its ability to serve both retail and institutional customers in one of its most important international markets. The FCA’s approval , announced by Coinbase in a Feb. 3 press release, enables the Nasdaq-listed exchange to offer crypto-to-fiat services in the UK, a country that has rapidly grown into its largest market outside the United States. This latest development further solidifies Coinbase’s presence in Europe and strengthens its foothold in one of the world's leading financial hubs. The FCA’s decision marks the first registration of a crypto asset firm in 2025, following GSR Markets’ approval in December 2024. It also comes at a time when the UK is aggressively positioning itself as a global hub for digital assets, with plans to roll out a comprehensive regulatory framework by 2026. The UK government, under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, has been increasingly vocal about its commitment to fostering innovation in the blockchain and crypto industry. The FCA’s approval of Coinbase signals a willingness to embrace digital assets, providing regulatory clarity that could further boost institutional participation in the sector. A recent FCA survey conducted in November 2024 found that 12% of UK adults now own cryptocurrencies, a notable increase from 10% in the previous year. Additionally, the average investment per individual rose from £1,595 ($1,964) to £1,842 ($2,268), indicating growing confidence in digital assets among retail investors. Coinbase’s regulatory success in the UK follows a challenging period with the FCA, which had previously investigated Coinbase Payments for compliance breaches. The exchange faced scrutiny over unintentional violations of a 2020 voluntary agreement, primarily linked to onboarding high-risk customers. This led to a £3.5 million ($4.3 million) fine, but the firm has since taken corrective measures, strengthening its compliance framework and improving risk management protocols. Beyond the UK, Coinbase has been actively expanding its European operations, with registrations in key markets such as Ireland and Germany. Its Irish entity is also registered as a crypto service provider in the Netherlands and Italy, further reinforcing its position in the European Union. The exchange's ambitions, however, extend beyond Europe and into Southeast Asia, a rapidly growing digital asset market. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong met with Philippine Finance Secretary Ralph Recto to explore potential market entry into the Philippines. This move aligns with Coinbase’s broader Asia-Pacific expansion strategy, which already includes regulatory approval in Singapore (secured in October 2023). Coinbase has also been actively supporting developer initiatives in the Philippines and Thailand, focusing on local stablecoin development and financial inclusion. The company recently commissioned a report on cryptocurrency adoption in five Southeast Asian countries, reflecting its growing interest in shaping financial infrastructure in the region. Coinbase’s Role in Shaping Global Crypto Regulation Coinbase’s FCA approval not only strengthens its business but also sends a strong message about regulatory acceptance of crypto firms that adhere to compliance standards. With governments worldwide tightening crypto regulations, Coinbase’s ability to navigate regulatory landscapes gives it a competitive edge over less compliant counterparts. The move also reinforces the UK’s ambitions of becoming a global leader in cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation. As the country moves toward a full regulatory framework by 2026, firms like Coinbase will play a crucial role in shaping industry standards and fostering responsible crypto adoption. Coinbase’s approval by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority marks a significant milestone for both the exchange and the country’s crypto industry. With the UK emerging as a key player in the global digital asset space, Coinbase is well-positioned to drive adoption, enhance crypto-fiat services, and play an influential role in shaping the future of crypto regulation. As the UK pushes forward with its vision of becoming a global crypto hub, Coinbase’s presence will likely attract more institutional investors, boost market confidence, and set a precedent for other exchanges seeking regulatory approval. With expansion plans spanning Europe and Southeast Asia, Coinbase’s latest milestone could be just the beginning of a new era of global crypto adoption and integration into traditional financial systems. Kraken Secures MiFID License, Expanding Crypto Derivatives Trading in the EU In realted news, US-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has successfully acquired a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) license for the European Union, marking a significant step in its global expansion. This approval, obtained through the acquisition of a Cypriot investment firm recently approved by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC), allows Kraken to offer derivatives trading services across the EU. Founded in 2011, Kraken has been rapidly expanding its European footprint over the past two years. The exchange has secured regulatory approvals in Spain and Ireland, introduced Kraken Custody services in the UK, and acquired a Dutch crypto broker in September 2024. With the EU crypto market projected to grow by 15% annually until 2030, Kraken’s latest licensing effort is a strategic move to capitalize on the region’s burgeoning demand for advanced trading products. According to Kraken’s Feb. 3 blog post, the exchange described Europe as one of the most active regions for crypto derivatives trading, further emphasizing the increasing appetite for futures and options products. By entering the EU derivatives space, Kraken will be competing with major platforms such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, Backpack, and D2X, all of which are either already offering or planning to roll out derivatives trading products. Crypto derivatives—financial contracts such as futures and options based on the price of an underlying crypto asset—are primarily aimed at experienced traders. These products allow traders to hedge against market volatility or speculate on price movements, but they also carry significant risks due to the highly volatile nature of crypto markets. Kraken’s acquisition of a MiFID license means that it can now legally offer these complex financial instruments across the European Economic Area (EEA), further diversifying its services beyond spot trading. Kraken’s expansion comes amid Europe’s efforts to introduce a comprehensive regulatory framework for the crypto industry. The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, set to be fully implemented by 2026, aims to establish clear compliance standards for crypto businesses operating within the region. MiCA addresses key areas such as: Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance Token issuance guidelines Stablecoin-specific rules Consumer protection measures Several global crypto entities, including Crypto.com and OKX, have already secured MiCA-specific licenses, signaling the growing importance of regulatory compliance in the EU. Kraken’s MiFID approval ensures that it remains well-positioned to adapt to these evolving regulatory requirements. Strategic Growth Amid Regulatory Challenges Kraken has been actively navigating complex regulatory environments across multiple jurisdictions. In the United States, the exchange recently made headlines for reintroducing its staking program, two years after it was forced to shut it down following a legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite regulatory hurdles, Kraken has more than doubled its revenue in 2024, reaching $1.5 billion, according to a recent report. The acquisition of a MiFID license aligns with Kraken’s broader global strategy of diversifying its revenue streams and expanding into high-growth markets. By leveraging Europe’s strong demand for derivatives products, Kraken is positioning itself as a major player in institutional-grade crypto trading. Kraken’s successful bid for a MiFID license in the European Union marks a major milestone in its global expansion. With the EU crypto market heating up and regulations becoming more structured under MiCA, securing this license provides Kraken with a significant competitive advantage. As Europe continues to shape the future of crypto regulation, Kraken is making the necessary moves to align with compliance standards while tapping into the region’s growing demand for sophisticated trading instruments. With competition intensifying in the derivatives space, Kraken’s entrance into the market will likely drive greater innovation and liquidity, benefiting both retail and institutional traders across the EU.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-04 05:30:00

Remittix Leads Top Gaining Cryptos In 2025",https://timestabloid.com/will-ethereum-reach-4000-in-february-remittix-leads-top-gaining/,"Growing acceptance and institutional buying is helping Ethereum to gather momentum. Analysts wonder if ETH will reach $4,000 in February 2025. There are several factors that could drive Ethereum’s potential breakout. On the other hand, Remittix (RTX) is gearing up to become one of the top gaining cryptos in 2025. Remittix’s innovative PayFi mechanism and anticipated token presale are making it a popular choice for developers. Several Factors Are Set To Drive Ethereum’s Rally to $4,000 In February The market sentiment still stands with an Ethereum price change to $4,000 in February. To increase its efficiency, Ethereum as a chain has been experiencing notable developments. These improvements enable its relevance in the crypto domain. Also notable is Ethereum 2.0’s change to proof-of-stake. It basically indicates quicker and more effective transactions. Other factors driving Ethereum’s price surge include the revival of the larger crypto market and growing institutional interest in Ethereum. There is also the development of Ethereum-based financial instruments like ETFs. Should these developments move forward without hiccups, the Ethereum price movement could create a new February high. Remittix Set To Become One of The Top Cryptocurrencies In 2025 Among the most promising new cryptocurrencies, Remittix (RTX) stands out for its emphasis on utility-driven businesses that have the potential to disrupt established markets. Remittix, which combines cutting-edge blockchain technology with traditional banking operations, promises to address inefficiencies in the $180 trillion worldwide money transfer sector.

Remittix enables retailers to better manage their digital assets, setting the groundwork for a more accessible and adaptive financial environment.

Remittix simplifies international commerce by supporting over 30 FIAT currencies and 50 major altcoins.

A game changer in the payments industry, where shady practices are all too common, Remittix’s technology ensures that the recipient receives the full amount intended.

Journalists, politicians, artists and others can all move the needle, but quantitative analysts remain a big deal. Let’s find out what they saw in Toncoin and Solana that they now see in 1FUEL . Toncoin (TON): A Jewel In The Libertarian Blockchain Segment When Toncoin had just come onto the scene in late August 2021, it nearly doubled its price in under two weeks. This caught the attention of many quantitative analysts, who started predicting good things for the project. Indeed, by mid-November of 2021, Toncoin had done a near 9X move, proving them right. The Toncoin team then rolled out a series of crucial developments which saw the coin reach an all-time high in mid-2024. This shows that these quantitative analysts weren’t only right about Toncoin’s short-term potential. They already saw that the Toncoin team and project would keep excelling years later. Solana (SOL): A Supersonic Transaction Vehicle Solana price action had a similar trajectory but with more insane gains (200X in under two years). This is the kind of thing people would expect to never happen again when the Solana price crashed from $249 to about $10 in roughly a year and a month. Devastating, right? Solana eventually redeemed itself, surpassing its all-time high in about two years and a month. This proves that the quantitative analysts who saw Solana as a special coin weren’t hallucinating. They saw what many others would only see much later. Now, let’s understand why they see similarities in a new project. 1FUEL (OFT): A Transcendent Force In Decentralized Trading 1FUEL will offer a crypto exchange and wallet with a comprehensive and unmatched trading experience. Firstly, users will get to trade across different chains, unlocking liquidity and accessing new opportunities previously hard to access. Secondly, 1FUEL users will be able to trade directly with preferred parties thanks to P2P exchange features. Thirdly, 1FUEL will offer AI-powered features that can continuously learn and refine your trading strategies to maximize your profit with minimal manual input from you. This will increase market efficiency, capital mobility and transaction volume, generating more income through trading fees. Lastly, 1FUEL will take security to the next level with built-in mixing capabilities that conceal your transaction paths, denying watchful eyes a competitive edge. It will also offer military-grade cold storage to secure inactive coins in an offline state where hackers and scammers can’t reach them. Why You Should Join The 1FUEL presale 1FUEL has only 28.1% of tokens left in stage three of its presale, meaning your chances of getting them at the low price of $0.017 per token are almost vanishing. Remember, the 20% bonus on all purchases could also disappear if you don’t act fast. Conclusion: Will 1FUEL Surpass What Toncoin And Solana Have Achieved? 1FUEL can outdo these two projects in a much shorter time. This is primarily because, unlike earlier when the quantitative analysts hyping coins were insignificant, there’s proof now. They’ve called it right on no less than two occasions, meaning there’s a pattern. This will encourage many investors to flood into the 1FUEL market, so get your presale tokens quickly before prices leave you behind.

The price is currently trading above the $2.50 level and is now aiming to break above the $3 mark once again. Bitcoin also rose above the $100k mark and is currently trading at crucial support levels. The XRP price had reached its key support area between $2.13 and $2.22 on the 4-day chart, triggering a bearish reaction. This level is crucial for distinguishing bullish momentum from bearish trends. The market has bounced back from this level, and the outlook remains positive, with potential targets at $4.19, $5, and possibly even $6.62 in the coming wave. However, on the weekly chart, XRP is still down by more than 18%. Small-Time Frame Breakdown: A Temporary Setback On the smaller time frame, XRP briefly broke below the $2.64 swing low, invalidating a previous bullish pattern. However, the alternative Elliott Wave count is now leading, and the price found support around the $2.72 to $2.22 zone. A crucial level to watch moving forward is the $2.96 mark, which has provided support in recent moves above $3. The price is currently recovering, but the next corrective pullback will determine if the upward trend can continue. Key Levels and Next Steps for XRP To confirm further upside potential, XRP needs to maintain support above $1.90, which represents the 78.6% retracement level. There are two potential pathways for XRP: either a direct breakout or an extended wave four, which could lead to further upside. As the market remains volatile, it’s important to monitor the next pullback closely. If the pullback is corrective, it could signal a continuation of the bullish trend.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-04 05:53:50

It is on the path to recovery from a crash to $2,260 on Monday following President Donald Trump’s imposition of trade tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. Some of those tariffs have since been suspended , resulting in a crypto market recovery. ETH prices were also boosted by Eric Trump, who said, “In my opinion, it’s a great time to add ETH” on X. However, most of the respondents mocked the comment or posted tribal FUD. “Trump nuked ETH and then his son saves it.

This means that the ETH/BTC ratio is still around its weakest level since December 2020 at 0.028, according to Tradingview. Ethereum prices have been eroded in terms of BTC for the past two and a half years as the asset remains depressed in terms of market sentiment. “No one should freak out if we get a red daily candle now.

U.S. prosecutors revealed that he targeted Indexed Finance in 2021 and KyberSwap in 2023. Meanwhile, he has been on the run from authorities since 2021. Mastermind Behind $65 Million Exploits A U.S. court in Brooklyn has officially charged Andean Medjedovic with wire fraud, computer hacking, and attempted extortion. He is accused of stealing around $65 million in cryptocurrency by exploiting weaknesses in crypto platforms. Prosecutors say Andean Medjedovic borrowed a large number of tokens, manipulated prices through trades, and then took the tokens to make a profit, cheating investors. By exploiting vulnerabilities in the smart contracts that facilitate transactions, he was able to drain $49 million from KyberSwap and $16 million from Indexed Finance. John Durham, acting U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, warned that individuals who misuse technology to deceive investors will be pursued, no matter where they operate. On the Run Since 2021 Medjedovic, who was once a promising master’s student at the University of Waterloo, has been evading authorities since 2021. Canadian courts had already charged him for the Indexed Finance hack, with one judge acknowledging his “formidable mathematical powers” in orchestrating the theft. His digital footprint suggests he sees himself as a “pirate” who operates in a legal gray area. Despite being wanted in Canada, he remained active in the crypto space and, according to the complaint, even attempted to negotiate control over KyberSwap in exchange for returning part of the stolen funds. Crypto Crimes on the Rise The crypto world has seen a surge in financial crimes. Just last year, two men were charged with stealing $230 million in digital assets and spending lavishly in Los Angeles and Miami. Additionally, the founder of a French crypto company was kidnapped and held for ransom before being released.

Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin, is being called the next big opportunity for exponential growth. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Ultimate Choice 1. A Fresh Entrant With Massive Potential: As a newly launched coin, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors the chance to enter at the ground floor. Its early-stage momentum makes it one of the most promising opportunities to achieve life-changing gains. 2. Record-Breaking Presale Success: Raising $1 million almost instantly, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven itself as a high-demand asset. This presale success has cemented its place as a token with unmatched growth potential. 3. Exclusivity That Drives Demand: Unlike ETH, MATIC, or APT, which are widely traded on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity creates urgency and scarcity, increasing its value to early adopters. How It Stands Up Against Competitors XRP: A leader in payments, but it no longer offers the early-stage returns seen with this new coin. Solana (SOL): Strong in scalability but can’t match the momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Optimism (OP): A rising Layer-2 solution but lacks the excitement surrounding this token. SEI: Innovative but doesn’t have the same presale success or exclusivity.

Late on Monday, President Donald Trump agreed to “immediately pause” tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a month following successful negotiations with their respective leaders. Markets are also growing more optimistic that the U.S. and China could reach a deal to avert the 10% tariffs on Chinese imports set to take effect later today. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.76% to around 39,150, while the broader Topix Index rose 1.4% to 2,757 on Tuesday, recouping some of the losses from the previous session. The Japanese yen fell past 155 per dollar on Tuesday, struggling to regain momentum as the suspension of U.S. tariffs on Mexico and Canada reduced demand for the safe-haven currency. Investors are also looking ahead to Wednesday’s release of Japan’s latest wage figures, which could influence the outlook for Bank of Japan monetary policy. China ( SHCOMP ) flat, the offshore yuan held steady around 7.30 per dollar, after recovering from a record low overnight, driven by optimism about a possible trade deal to avoid 10% tariffs on Chinese goods. US President Donald Trump is reportedly set to speak with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, as soon as this week, as the two largest economies are working toward a deal to avoid broader trade tensions, according to the White House. Investors are now eyeing upcoming additional PMI data and inflation figures next week. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 1.71% to a near 8-week high of 20,674 during the Tuesday morning session, following a muted close the prior day. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.50% to 77,684, while the Nifty 50 was above 23,500 in Tuesday morning trade, mainly supported by gains in metals, oil & gas, banking, and tech sectors. The RBI interest rate decision, which will be announced later this week, also lifted sentiment, with the market expecting the central bank to cut rates by 25 bps amid a slowdown in GDP growth. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.06% to rise above 8,430 on Tuesday, recovering some losses from the previous session. The Australian dollar stabilized above $0.62 on Tuesday, recovering from multi-year lows reached in the previous session. In Australia, investors are awaiting December trade figures, due on Thursday, to assess the strength of the country’s export-driven economy. In the U.S., on Monday, all three major indexes ended in red , markets pared some losses after Trump said the US would delay tariffs on Mexican imports by a month following a call with Mexico’s President. U.S. stock futures climbed on Tuesday after President Donald Trump postponed planned tariffs on goods from Canada, echoing the reprieve given to Mexico just hours earlier: Dow -0.30% ; S&P 500 -0.36% ; Nasdaq -0.51% . Investors are now focused on upcoming earnings reports from major companies like Alphabet, AMD, and PayPal on Tuesday.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is probing the Super Bowl events contracts on Crypto.com and Kalshi, according to a Bloomberg report . ""If sports does not constitute gaming, then, given the CFTC’s current legal posture, the CFTC likely does not have the power to prohibit Crypto.com and Kalshi from self-certifying these contracts,"" Brogan told CoinDesk. However, all of this is a bit more complicated than it seems on the surface. ""This is a surprisingly thorny question, which was addressed in the Kalshi ruling,"" Brogan said, referring to the ruling from last fall that allowed Kalshi to move forward with its election betting contracts by confirming that they do not fall under the CFTC’s restricted categories. Brogan explained that the Judge in that ruling defined ""gaming"" as “playing games” or “playing games for stakes” and specifically cited past discussions in Congress during the writing of the Commodities Exchange Act, during which a lawmaker said the rule against gaming was meant to cover sports betting. ""All that sounds bad for these contracts, but I am not wholly convinced,"" Brogan continued. ""Judge Cobb’s finding here is dicta—non-binding—and the legislative history is only relevant where the law is ambiguous."" Brogan also points to the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition of gaming as not “playing games” but “the practice or activity of playing games for stakes.” ""At least in Merriam-Webster, this clearly means gambling, not sports, so I think these prediction markets would have colorable arguments if they had to go to the mats. Some judges might be receptive to this kind of textualist argument,"" Brogan said. And finally, there's the issue of the changing nature of the CFTC itself. Many believe that the appointment of Republican Caroline Pham as the Commission's Chair will lead to a more laissez-faire regulatory approach, Brogan said. ""[The Democrats] had been highly skeptical of retail-oriented event contracts and fought hard against first PredictIt and then Kalshi in 2023 and 2024 to attempt to prevent them from offering election contracts,"" Brogan continued.

The development was enough to put the crypto market on a strong recovery path after a brutal crash on Monday. Bitcoin price is up 7%, reclaiming $100K levels. Altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) have bounced back by 11-22%. Additionally, reports of Trump’s trade wars easing up have provided additional fuel to the market. Crypto Market Recovery – BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA See Strong Bounce Back Bitcoin Leads the Crypto Market Recovery Bitcoin is leading the crypto market recovery today, gaining over 7% and surging all the way to $102,000. BTC has been subject to massive volatility over the fears of the Trump trade war swinging all the way to $90,000 and recovering back above $100K, all within less than 48 hours. The recent recovery in Bitcoin comes as crypto czar David Sacks will hold the first press conference talking about America’s digital asset leadership moving ahead. This has led to strong buying pressure, particularly from US investors. According to data from CryptoQuant, the Coinbase Premium Gap—a metric reflecting the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other exchanges—has surged to its highest level in 2025. Source: CryptoQuant This spike indicates increased demand for Bitcoin among U.S.-based investors, a trend that could potentially fuel further price momentum for BTC. Altcoins Recover A Day After Brutal Correction Top altcoins are recovering strongly, with Ethereum (ETH) leading with more than 12% gains in the last 24 hours, surging past $2,800. Ripple’s XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) have gained more than 20% reclaiming much of the lost ground over the past week. As Donald Trump prepares to create a new Sovereign Wealth Fund , crypto market analysts have turned optimistic about the potential inclusion of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Earlier today, Eric Trump wrote in an X post: “In my opinion, it’s a great time to add ETH,” raising further speculation. Furthermore, the XRP community has been pushing for having the Ripple token into America’s crypto reserves. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that it would be prudent to have a basket of digital assets as crypto reserves instead of just Bitcoin. Citing historical patterns from 2017 and 2021, market analysts are now hopeful that the altcoin season could kickstart anytime, triggering a mega bull run.

Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar David Sacks will hold the first press conference on Tuesday, regarding America’s leadership in digital assets moving ahead. He will be accompanied by other representatives from the US Congress. According to the announcement, Sacks will outline the White House’s strategic approach to digital assets and the overall crypto market. This strategy is expected to address key areas such as regulatory policies, innovation incentives, and national security concerns. The event underscores the administration’s commitment to collaborating with lawmakers to shape policies for the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Altcoins, including Lightchain AI, Dogwifhat, and Cardano, are gaining traction as investors seek high-growth opportunities such as Bitcoin and Ripple in 2025. Table of Contents The case for low-cost altcoins in 2025’s market Why these altcoins could compete with Bitcoin and Ripple Lightchain AI: Game-changing powerhouse under $5 As the crypto market evolves, savvy investors are exploring altcoins with high growth potential, particularly those priced under $5. Among the top picks are Lightchain AI, Dogwifhat (WIF), and Cardano (ADA), all poised to work the same magic as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple (XRP) in 2025. Lightchain AI stands out with its fusion of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Currently, in its presale phase at $0.005625 per token, it has raised $13.5 million, showcasing strong investor confidence and substantial future growth potential. The case for low-cost altcoins in 2025’s market With the meteoric rise of Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) , investors are increasingly looking for undervalued altcoins with high potential. While BTC and ETH will continue to dominate in 2025, smaller players have strong chances to carve out niches that can lead them to extraordinary growth. Also, the current bull market is heavily propped up by institutional investors entering the space. As they look to diversify their portfolios, altcoins priced under $5 offer higher rewards at a lower risk. Crypto enthusiasts also prefer these budget-friendly options as they can purchase high volumes with lower investments. Why these altcoins could compete with Bitcoin and Ripple Lightchain AI, Dogwifhat , and Cardano are emerging as promising altcoins with the potential to challenge established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ripple. Lightchain AI uniquely integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, offering decentralized and secure AI computations, which positions it for significant growth in industries. Dogwifhat has garnered attention for its innovative approach and community-driven development, which has contributed to its increasing market presence. Cardano is recognized for its research-driven development and commitment to scalability and sustainability, making it a strong contender in the decentralized applications space. These distinctive features and strategic focuses suggest that these altcoins could deliver substantial returns, potentially surpassing the performance of Bitcoin and Ripple in the evolving cryptocurrency market. Lightchain AI: Game-changing powerhouse under $5 Lightchain AI is making waves in the blockchain and AI industries, tackling the biggest challenges holding back mass adoption. With its unique platform, it’s not just disrupting traditional models; it’s creating entirely new opportunities. What sets Lightchain AI apart?

Major tokens like Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) are also being affected. Both cryptos were charting a positive course a while back. Unfortunately, the early days in February have changed their good fortunes. SOL is currently holding on to not fall below $200, while XRP price is maintaining its position well above $2. Meanwhile, a viral altcoin is making waves with the possibility of an incredible 12,800% rally after its listing. With institutional investors keeping a close eye on these assets, the market is heating up. Let’s break down what is happening with Solana and Ripple, and why DTX Exchange is emerging as a game-changer in the space. Ripple (XRP) Desperate to Maintain Strong Position Amidst Crypto Market Dip For some time now, XRP has been a top-performing crypto. It continued to be among the leading digital assets despite its regulatory fights. The start of the year had great prospects for a Ripple price closest to its all-time high of $3.40. Analysts were predicting more bullish momentum and gains. Because of a general market decline, XRP price has plummeted badly by over 8% in a few days. It currently trades around $2.69 after finding some upward momentum to go back above the $2.65 support level. Source: CoinMarketCap However, some positive signs appear. XRP was traded by about 300% more in 24 hours. Many buyers have a view that these corrections would be very short-term, and the long-term outlook is bright. For XRP to break past the $3 mark, strong volume and institutional backing will be necessary. If demand holds, the next cycle could take XRP price back to higher levels. Solana (SOL) Steady Above $200 Given the chain’s fast and cheap transactions, it is no surprise that SOL price has remained the favorite of blockchain developers. After a strong run-up in the first few weeks of the year, it now seems Solana isn’t offering much at these lower prices. Some of the analysts feel this price will again touch $250, even though it has slipped down to just above $200. The market took it back down about 8% in the last few days. The last 24 hours seems to be consolidation as its price is near $208. Source: CoinMarketCap If the blockchain can maintain its uptime and continue attracting developers, it stands a chance to climb higher in 2025. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Viral Altcoin With a Potential 12,800% Rally Amidst the situation, a new player is shaking up the market — DTX Exchange . This emerging platform has gained significant traction due to its hybrid trading model. It combines traditional finance with blockchain technology. DTX Exchange’s token could see a 12,800% surge upon listing. That would make it one of the biggest gainers in many months. It has strong institutional backing, an innovative trading ecosystem, and a rapidly growing user base. Unlike many exchanges, DTX allows users to trade cryptocurrencies, stocks, and forex on a single platform. Its secure Phoenix Wallet helps users manage those assets. The DTX token has already multiplied 800% in the presale alone. It has gone from $0.02 to $0.16, now in its last stage. The expected listing will come at $0.20. The DTX token has also gained credibility through a successful audit by SolidProof and a preview feature on CoinMarketCap. With its presale already raising millions, investors are paying close attention to what’s next. Conclusion With Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) holding steady, DTX Exchange is making headlines with its massive rally. It is proving that new projects can deliver massive returns for early investors. As the crypto landscape evolves, keeping an eye on these assets could present great opportunities in the months ahead.

While major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) , and Ethereum (ETH) have strong use cases, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN sets itself apart as the most exciting opportunity for exponential value creation. Here’s why this token is dominating the conversation. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stands Out 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity With a total supply capped at 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN ensures scarcity that fuels long-term value. Unlike BTC and LTC, which have slower growth due to high circulation, this token’s deflationary model guarantees increasing demand. 2. Exclusive Availability Unlike UNI and DOT, which are available on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity gives early adopters an edge and keeps the token’s growth stable and controlled. 3. Unparalleled Growth Potential Analysts project that THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN could deliver returns of up to 2,000%, thanks to its early-stage momentum and community-driven development. While Bitcoin and Polkadot are well-established, they can’t match the rapid trajectory of this groundbreaking token. 4. Investor Demand at Record Levels Raising $1,000,000 within minutes of its presale launch, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven its appeal. Investors recognize its potential to redefine the market, driving interest far beyond what UNI, BTC, or LTC have recently seen. How THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Compares Uniswap (UNI): A strong DeFi platform but lacks the exclusivity and demand-driving scarcity of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Polkadot (DOT): Reliable for interoperability but cannot match the early-stage explosive growth seen here. Bitcoin (BTC): A store of value, yet its market maturity limits growth opportunities compared to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Litecoin (LTC): Known for efficiency, but it hasn’t captured the market excitement that this new token has.

Dogwifhat (WIF) and Trump (TRUMP) have made headlines with their price surges, but can they maintain momentum? Meanwhile, a new DeFi coin flies under the radar. At just $0.04, this hidden gem is ready to explode for massive gains. As hot as the hype around meme coins is, serious investors are into this new crypto project with real-world utility and exponential profit potential. Read on for more details! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Dogwifhat Continues Its Meme-Fueled Rally Dogwifhat has recently been among the most hyped meme coins, wildly swinging based on social media hype and speculation. After a sharp rally, WIF’s price now stands at $1.17 . The meme coin price has dipped by over 16% in the last seven days. This may be because interest in meme tokens, which typically undergo short-term surges followed by market corrections, isn’t sustainable. Despite its popularity, WIF faces challenges in maintaining price stability due to its lack of fundamental utility. While traders continue to ride the waves of speculation, the question remains—can WIF sustain long-term growth, or will it fade like many meme coins before it? The TRUMP Coin Rises with Political Momentum The OFFICIAL TRUMP token has capitalized on the political landscape, seeing a major price spike as Donald Trump’s 2025 inauguration approached. The token skyrocketed to over $70 , driven by investors betting on political sentiment. However, the surge was short-lived, and TRUMP has since experienced a nosedive to its current price of $27 . Unlike traditional DeFi tokens built around blockchain ecosystems, TRUMP’s value is directly linked to news cycles and speculation. While it remains one of the trending meme coins, its long-term viability is uncertain. Investors seeking stability and passive income opportunities look beyond political hype and towards projects with real utility and security. FXGuys: The $0.04 Crypto Gem That Could Outperform Meme Coins in 2025 Amidst the chaos of meme coin speculation, a game-changing DeFi token has quietly entered the market. Unlike WIF and TRUMP, which rely on hype-driven pumps, FXGuys ($FXG) is built for sustained growth with real-world applications that appeal to crypto traders, investors, and blockchain enthusiasts.

The staking mechanism secures the reward system, making it profitable for investors with long-term goals.

While meme coins like WIF and TRUMP continue to dominate headlines, the real profit opportunity lies in a DeFi token designed for long-term success. While WIF and TRUMP rely on hype, $FXG is built on real-world utility and long-term sustainability. As of late January 2025, $FXG is in Stage 2 of its public presale, offering tokens at $0.04 each. The project has successfully raised over $3.7 million so far. The anticipated launch price is set at $0.10, suggesting potential gains of over 150% for Stage 2 investors. More investors are flocking in, knowing that this DeFi token could surge over 10,000% post-listing, making it one of the best cryptocurrency picks for 2025.

How $RACE Token is Shaking Up Betting with AI,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/from-memes-to-millions-how-race-token-is-shaking-up-betting-with-ai/,"The post From Memes to Millions? How $RACE Token is Shaking Up Betting with AI appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The blockchain gaming landscape continues to change in the past few years, with Race to a Billion emerging as a notable project that combines AI-powered racing predictions with blockchain technology. At the heart of this innovative platform lies the $RACE token, currently priced at $0.00829 during its presale phase, which has already garnered over $230,000 in contributions from early participants. How the Prediction Model Works Race to a Billion’s prediction model is powered by AI, making every race an exciting blend of strategy and chance. Instead of manually controlling racers, players analyze different factors to make the best possible predictions. At the heart of the system is an advanced AI that simulates racing events. Each race unfolds based on key variables, creating a dynamic and unpredictable experience: Track Conditions – Every track comes with its own challenges, influencing how racers perform. Character Traits – Meme characters aren’t just for show; each one has unique abilities and racing styles that impact the outcome. Historical Data – Players can dive into past race stats, studying trends to refine their predictions. Players can place predictions on multiple race outcomes, adding layers of strategy to the game. Some of the key betting options include: Overall Race Winners – Guess which character will take the top spot. Fastest Laps – Predict who will clock the quickest lap time. Head-to-Head Matchups – Bet on direct rivalries between specific racers. With AI driving the races and blockchain ensuring fairness, the prediction model offers an engaging, transparent, and skill-based betting experience. Breaking Down $RACE Tokenomics The $RACE token follows a carefully structured distribution model with a total supply of 2.5 billion tokens. The largest portion, 40% (1 billion tokens), has been allocated to the presale phase, ensuring broad initial distribution among early platform supporters. The remaining supply is divided strategically, with 20% reserved for staking rewards and four equal portions of 10% each designated for development, liquidity, ecosystem growth, and marketing initiatives. The development allocation plays a crucial role in the platform’s evolution. These funds support continuous improvement of the AI racing system, user interface enhancements, and integration of new features requested by the community. The separate liquidity allocation ensures smooth trading operations and price stability, making it easier for users to enter or exit positions as needed. Marketing and ecosystem funds work in tandem to expand the platform’s reach and capabilities. The marketing allocation supports various promotional activities, from social media campaigns to strategic partnerships with influencers in the crypto space. Meanwhile, the ecosystem fund focuses on building relationships with other projects and platforms, creating opportunities for cross-platform integration and expanded utility for $RACE token holders.

They track staking periods and rewards without any manual intervention needed. Users earn rewards for keeping their tokens staked, which helps maintain a healthy token supply in the market. No joke – stakers are earning a massive 2,500% APY right now. The team’s put aside 500 million tokens just for rewards, so early birds can really cash in. The staking process works on a seven-day lockup period after claiming. This cooling-off period helps stabilize token circulation and prevents rapid sell-offs that could affect token value. Users can monitor their earnings in real-time through the staking dashboard, watching their rewards accumulate with each passing block. Staking rewards are distributed based on the proportion of tokens each user has staked compared to the total staking pool. This fair system ensures that everyone gets their share of rewards based on their commitment to the platform. As more users join the staking program, the reward rate may adjust to maintain long-term sustainability. Technical Infrastructure and Security Measures Security is at the heart of Race to a Billion’s design. The team went the extra mile by partnering with SolidProof to thoroughly audit their smart contracts. This means users can trust that their tokens and transactions are protected by top-notch security measures. The blockchain foundation of the platform ensures complete transparency. Once a race result or transaction is recorded, it’s there for good – unchangeable and visible to everyone. The AI-powered racing system adds another layer of fairness, making sure every race outcome is genuinely random and free from manipulation. How to Buy the $RACE Token? Getting started is simple. Buy tokens using ETH, USDT, BNB or a credit card. Head to Race to a Billion website , choose your payment method, and follow the easy setup process. Remember to check out the staking options – they’re worth considering if you plan to hold your tokens. For crypto-savvy users, the process starts with connecting a compatible wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet to the platform. The minimum purchase amount is kept reasonable to allow broad participation. Users can swap their existing cryptocurrencies for $RACE tokens at the current presale price of $0.00829. Platform accepts crypto cards too if you are new to crypto and do not own it yet. After purchasing, tokens appear in the user’s dashboard. From here, they can track their holdings, view transaction history, and access the staking interface. The dashboard also provides real-time updates on token performance and platform metrics. For those interested in maximizing returns, the platform offers detailed guides on using its features effectively. Support staff are available through official channels to help with any questions about token purchase, staking, or platform navigation.

Meanwhile, Rollblock continues to turn heads with its innovative GambleFi platform which is poised to become the new industry standard in the online gaming space. 45,000 investors have already secured their allocation in the viral RBLK presale and this number is growing by the hundreds every day. Rollblock’s Moon Mission Starts Now By bridging the gap between DeFi and online gaming, Web3 protocol Rollblock brings the best of both worlds for a memorable Vegas-level experience. This means unparalleled ease of access and top-notch security measures powered by blockchain technology. The project offers a massive leap forward regarding safety and transparency, as each transaction is easily traceable and immune to tampering. Individuals can immediately access the 7000-game catalog, offering unmatched variety and gaming options to the rapidly growing user base. On Rollblock, players will find all-time classics such as blackjack and poker, live games, and even brand-new AI-enhanced exclusives. The project has also released a sportsbook covering all major sporting events. The groundbreaking revenue-sharing mechanism is one of Rollblock’s most intriguing and lucrative features, granting users some of the highest APY on the market. Rollblock will spend up to 30% of its weekly earnings to perform open-market buybacks of RBLK tokens. 60% of this amount will be burned, deflating the supply and priming RBLK for long-term price growth. The remaining 40% will be redistributed to the community as recurring staking rewards, allowing holders to simultaneously benefit from passive income and scarcity-driven appreciation. Ripple Labs Locks 700 million XRP, While Price Dips Below $3.00 Ripple recently locked up 700 million XRP in a strategic move aimed at managing supply and stabilizing prices. Analysts suggest that by restricting circulation, Ripple’s actions could drive prices higher, with some predicting XRP could reach $4 by April if positive trends persist. Investors view this development as a potential catalyst for long-term price stability, reinforcing confidence in Ripple’s long-term vision. Despite this effort, XRP saw a 16% intraday drop, forming a bottom around $2.38 as market turbulence intensified over the weekend. The loss of the $3.00 support led to a breakdown in Ripple’s price structure, as many investors rushed to cut their losses, intensifying selling pressure. On the macro level, Ripple’s trajectory remains bullish, although this sudden correction injected a considerable amount of uncertainty in its short-term price action. Solana Bottoms Out Under $200, What’s Next? Solana has been treading water for over a week as it struggled to reclaim and hold the $200 mark. While Solana managed to climb to the $230-$240 zone, these gains quickly evaporated over the weekend as market-wide sell-offs began. At press time, Solana was trading at $199, following an 11% daily decrease. Crypto analyst Bluntz has warned that Solana’s current chart patterns resemble those seen before its sharp decline in 2021, raising concerns about a potential reversal in Solana’s higher timeframe trend. Other experts point out that this could be a “bear-trap”, a move designed to punish leveraged long traders and late shorters. This thesis is also corroborated by Coinalyze exchange data, showing that over the last 24 hours more than $500 million worth of Solana positions were liquidated, wiping out over $400 million in longs and $90 million in short. Rollblock Presale Becomes Safe Haven Many Ripple and Solana holders have been reallocating capital into the RBLK presale which is close to crossing the $10 million mark in raised funds. The argument for this is very simple, as Rollblock’s magnitudes lower market cap grants significantly greater room for growth, especially with the crypto gaming narrative set for a major comeback in the coming months. Stage 10 of the presale is now live and RBLK tokens are selling for just $0.052. RBLK has been in up-only mode since launch as early buyers are already enjoying returns of over 400%, but in addition to this an 800% rally is expected by the end of the event meaning there is still time for investors to win big.

Within 24 hours of its launch, the price skyrocketed by 350%, pushing its market cap to a whopping $150 million almost overnight. The hype was real, and so were the profits—if you got in early. Meanwhile, those who hesitated? They were left staring at missed opportunities and a flood of FOMO-fueled regret on Crypto Twitter. But here’s the thing—history repeats itself. And right now, another potential 1000X meme coin is making waves: BTFD Coin. With its presale already in Stage 14, over 68 billion $BTFD coins sold , and a total of $5.91 million raised, this meme coin is gathering serious momentum. Sitting at just $0.00016 per coin, investors looking for the next big break may want to pay attention. The juiciest part? It’s got a mouthwatering staking APY of 90%, making it one of the top new meme coins to join for short-term gains. Neiro’s Insane Growth: The One That Got Away Neiro’s ICO wasn’t just successful; it was legendary. When it launched on July 28, 2024, few expected the kind of astronomical rise it would see in just a matter of hours. A 350% jump on day one? That’s the kind of thing meme coin investors dream about. But it didn’t stop there. By November 12, 2024, Neiro reached its all-time high of $0.003019, cementing its place as one of the best-performing meme coin launches in recent memory. Early backers who bought in at a fraction of a cent saw their investments multiply, while latecomers and skeptics could only watch in regret. Crypto forums and Twitter were flooded with posts like: “If only I had gotten in sooner!” And let’s not forget: Neiro’s explosive growth wasn’t just hype—it was backed by a strong community and smart tokenomics. It had the perfect storm of meme culture, strategic marketing, and early adoption. Now, the question on everyone’s mind is: What’s the next Neiro? BTFD Coin: Staking Rewards to Marvel at! If you’re looking for a meme coin with 1000X potential, BTFD Coin is making a compelling case. Currently priced at just $0.00016 per token, the potential for serious gains is undeniable. So, what happens if BTFD Coin follows a similar trajectory to Neiro? Let’s break it down: $3,000 invested at today’s price ($0.00016) gets you 18,750,000 BTFD tokens. If BTFD Coin reaches $0.0006 per token, that investment would be worth $11,250. And if it soars even further to $0.006? That’s a $112,500 portfolio. Sounds like a second chance at Neiro-level gains, doesn’t it? Beyond price potential, BTFD Coin presents a full-blown ecosystem with a P2E game and a high-APY staking program that keeps the community engaged. Its staking feature has got investors buzzing, meaning their passive income game could be changed forever. All you have to do is sit back, keep holding your tokens, and wait as they compound year after year without you lifting a finger! Don’t forget about the referral rewards program either, which has the potential of giving you a 10% cut of the total amount of $BTFD bought by your referrals. Final Thoughts: Don’t Be Late to This One Neiro was the one that got away for thousands of investors. But you don’t have to miss the next big thing. BTFD Coin is offering one of the most exciting meme coin opportunities right now, and with over $5.91 million raised, momentum is building fast. The low presale price of $0.00016 makes this a prime opportunity before BTFD Coin potentially takes off toward $0.0006 or beyond. If you want a shot at 1000X returns, now is the time to act. Sign up for the BTFD Coin presale now and grab your stack before the next stage price increase.

Neiro saw rapid growth due to its strong tokenomics, dedicated community, and strategic marketing. It surged 350% in just 24 hours and later reached an all-time high of $0.003019 by November 2024. Can BTFD Coin hit $0.0006? Many analysts believe BTFD Coin has the potential to reach $0.0006 or even higher, given its strong community, staking rewards, and P2E game driving adoption. How can I maximize my BTFD Coin investment? Buying early during presale ensures the lowest possible price. You can also earn extra BTFD through staking and the referral program to increase your holdings over time.

Solaxy Soars to $17.5M, Emerges as New Solana Alternative",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/best-crypto-presale-solaxy-soars-to-17-5m-emerges-as-new-solana-alternative/,"The post Best Crypto Presale? Solaxy Soars to $17.5M, Emerges as New Solana Alternative appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solaxy ($SOLX) , the first-ever Layer-2 scaling solution for Solana, has crossed the $16.3 million presale milestone, reflecting growing investor confidence in its potential to transform the network. The surge comes as Solana’s meme coin launchpad, Pump.fun, recorded an unprecedented $3.3 billion in weekly trading volume, driven largely by a wave of Trump-themed meme coins following the surprise token launches linked to the new U.S. president. On January 23 alone, trading on the platform soared past $544 million, smashing previous single-day records, Dune Analytics data shows . However, the spike in transactions also caused severe congestion on the Solana blockchain. With Solana struggling to handle such massive trading volumes, investors are turning to Solaxy as a promising fix. By processing transactions off the main Layer-1 chain, Solaxy aims to reduce congestion, lower transaction fees, and enhance processing speeds, which are critical improvements for a network aiming to scale efficiently. The Solana community has embraced Solaxy, driving strong demand for $SOLX tokens since the presale began just over a month ago. Currently priced at $0.001624 per token, this rate is set to increase in just two days as the presale moves to its next funding phase. The Growing Impact of Meme Coins on Solana’s Network The recent explosion of Trump-themed meme coins on Pump.fun significantly impacted Solana’s blockchain activity. Reports suggest that over 6,800 tokens were launched using variations of the “Trump” name, many created with the intent of misleading investors by capitalizing on the success of Official Trump ($TRUMP) and Official Melania ($MELANIA). This frenzy led to Solana validators collecting $25 million in transaction fees, as traders scrambled to process transactions amid network congestion. Data Spotlight: How Scammers Reacted to the $TRUMP Token Launch | Blockaid Blog The overwhelming demand slowed down one of the fastest and most cost-effective blockchains, forcing traders to pay higher fees to push their transactions through. This is the problem Solaxy is designed to solve, ensuring Solana can better manage high trading volumes and maintain its efficiency in the long run. Solaxy Unlocks Solana’s Full Potential Despite Solana’s high speeds and low fees, congestion issues have prevented it from being fully recognized as a true Ethereum ($ETH) competitor in DeFi. This is why Ethereum continues to dominate, with a Total Value Locked (TVL) six times higher than Solana’s. Traders are betting that Solaxy could be the missing piece that propels Solana to new heights, addressing the core scalability challenge that has limited its adoption. Some analysts even suggest that Solana’s price could hit $400 by February if congestion issues are resolved, making Solaxy a key catalyst for that growth. Remember when @ethereum launches 5000 NFTs it gets congested in 10 minutes and gas is $100+. #Solana handles $1b of volume in 2.5hrs with average tx fee of 0.3c. Let this be the final time I tell you. Sell $ETH and buy $SOL right now. — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) January 18, 2025 As Solana’s first Layer-2 scaling solution, Solaxy reduces failed transactions, improves processing speeds, and enhances overall network reliability. Its streamlined transaction processing has earned the title of the “DeepSeek of blockchain,” highlighting its efficiency in optimizing the ecosystem. $SOLX: A High-Potential Token for Early Investors The $SOLX token is positioned as a high-growth opportunity, drawing comparisons to early-stage Solana ($SOL) investments. When Solana traded at just $0.50 five years ago, its meteoric rise to $228 delivered a staggering 45,500% return, turning a $1,000 investment into $456,000. Solana Price: SOL Live Price Chart, Market Cap & News Today | CoinGecko Many investors now view $SOLX as a second chance to capitalize on an emerging Solana-based opportunity before its price takes off. With Solaxy being the only available solution to Solana’s scalability challenges, skipping this presale could mean missing out on one of the most promising blockchain innovations in recent years. How to Join the Solaxy ($SOLX) Presale Joining the Solaxy presale is simple and offers early access to a game-changing Layer-2 solution for Solana. Investors can participate by visiting Solaxy’s official website, connecting their wallets, and purchasing $SOLX using SOL. Alternatively, Best Wallet , a next-gen multichain wallet, offers an easy way to buy $SOLX with low fees, seamless Ethereum and Solana integration, and advanced investment screening tools. Best Wallet’s “Upcoming Tokens” screener has already identified Solaxy as a high-potential project, reinforcing its long-term investment appeal. $SOLX purchases can be made directly within the app, making the process even more convenient.

The Singapore-based AI and education company Genius Group now holds more Bitcoin ( BTC ) than its own market value. The company has increased its Bitcoin reserves to 440 BTC, adding another $2 million in purchases, it said in a Feb. 3 press release . Genius has now spent $42 million on Bitcoin at an average price of $95,519 per BTC. But with Bitcoin trading at $104,893 as of Jan. 31, the company’s Bitcoin treasury is worth $46 million — while its own market cap sits at $33.1 million. That means each $100 in Genius stock technically holds $139 in Bitcoin. “This gives the Company a BTC / Price ratio of 139%, with the ratio calculated by dividing the market value of the Company’s Bitcoin Treasury by its market cap. Based on this ratio, as at January 31, 2025, $100 of the Company’s equity includes $139 in Bitcoin in its Bitcoin Treasury.” Genius Group You might also like: Metaplanet raises $745m to expand Bitcoin holdings in bid for Asia’s largest crypto deal The latest buy follows Genius’ $5 million Bitcoin purchase weeks ago.

FXGuys ($FXG) is emerging as the new gem with a massive presale opportunity. Crypto analysts are closely watching $FXG and have recommended investments in the token due to its potential to deliver higher profit margins over Cardano and BNB. But investors are asking why $FXG is the best crypto to invest in now instead of ADA and BNB. Let’s find out! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Cardano’s Increased Network Activity Drives the ADA Token Price Surge According to the renowned market analyst Ali Martinez , the network activity on Cardano has continued to show strength as its daily active addresses recently surged to reach 50,828. This increase in active addresses has sent the ADA token into a bull run. ADA jumped 14.46% from $0.83 to $0.95 in the first 9 days of January 2025. By January 17, the Cardano token rose by 22.11% to reach $1.16. However, this momentum didn’t last long, as ADA dropped by 17.24% to $0.96 by January 30. Due to the surge in daily active addresses on Cardano, experts now predict ADA’s price could rebound to reach $3 this year. However, despite the positive ADA future price predictions, investors are shifting their focus to the $FXG coin.

Coinglass data reveals that the BNB futures market recently recorded $4.01 million in long liquidations and $231.34 thousand in short liquidations.

By January 17, BNB rose further by 2.24% to $729.85. But the BNB token dropped by 7.01% to $678.35 by January 30.

The altcoin market awaits regulatory clarity, focusing on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Ethereum faces monetization and platform issues, with key price levels at $2,700 and $3,000. The crypto market has seen a rollercoaster ride, with a huge correction that erased billions in capital. This sharp drop followed escalating global trade tensions, after the US President’s executive order placed tariffs on goods from China, Canada, and Mexico. But, just when things seemed hopeless, the market began to show signs of a strong comeback. Bitcoin , which had dropped to nearly $90,000, is now back above $100,000. The turnaround happened when Donald Trump decided to pause the tariff plans, after a deal with Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum to delay them for a month. Matt Hougan, CIO at Bitwise Asset Management, noted that liquidations can happen quickly, one after another. But at the bottom, buyers are always waiting for the inevitable rebound, he added. This cycle is a familiar part of crypto, and those who know it well understand these price swings come with the territory.

Buterin’s comment came while celebrating the surge in the Ethereum gas limit to more than 32 million. The announcement comes just as the ETH price bounces back over 13% shooting past $2,800 levels once again. Vitalik Buterin Highlights Ethereum Scaling Progress Ethereum Gas Limit Increase Is a Positive sign Nearly half (49.5%) of Ethereum blocks are now signaling support for a gas limit increase, marking the potential for the first adjustment since the transition to proof-of-stake (PoS). This milestone highlights the decentralized nature of PoS, which, while more efficient than proof-of-work (PoW), requires longer coordination times to achieve consensus. The surge in a gas limit is good for Ethereum blockchain scalability as it would allow network validators to process more transactions per block. As per the data from Dune Analytics, Ethereum’s gas limit has already surpassed 32 million. Source: Dune Analytics Vitalik Buterin Reveals Pectra Upgrade Timeline Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has expressed optimism about Layer 1 (L1) scaling. He also acknowledged Ethereum developers ‘ efforts to enhance the network’s efficiency and decentralization. The Ethereum co-founder also acknowledged significant strides being made on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4444, aimed at history expiry, and the move toward statelessness with the introduction of a new binary tree proposal. Vitalik Buterin also revealed that developers are working on client efficiency upgrades to support higher gas limits while maintaining decentralization. In a post on the X platform, Buterin wrote : “Pectra, expected in March, will increase the blob target from 3 to 6, doubling the capacity of L2s. IMO we should make the blob target also staker-voted, so that it can increase in respose to technology improvements without waiting for hard forks”. The upcoming Ethereum Pectra upgrade will transform Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), allowing them to operate like smart contracts. This marks a significant advancement in enhancing user interactions with decentralized applications (dApps). ETH Price Stages Strong Comeback Following a brutal correction on Monday, the ETH price has bounced back 13% shooting past $2,800. Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a potential head-and-shoulders pattern forming for Ethereum (ETH). According to Martinez, ETH must stay above the critical $2,700 support level to preserve its bullish structure. “If this pattern holds, Ethereum could have a clear path to rally toward $7,000,” Martinez noted.

Andean Medjedovic, a University of Waterloo mathematics graduate, has been indicted for wire fraud, computer hacking, attempted extortion, and money laundering in connection with the KyberSwap and I ndexed Finance exploits, the Justice Department announced on Feb. 3. According to the charges , Medjedovic manipulated smart contracts on both platforms, using deceptive trades to trick automated systems into miscalculating key values. By exploiting these flaws, he allegedly drained $48.8 million from KyberSwap in 2023 and swiped $16.5 million from Indexed Finance in 2021. Through his deceptive trades, Medjedovic managed to “withdraw millions in investor funds at artificial prices,” the indictment said. This left victims with effectively worthless investments. Prosecutors added that Medjedovic meticulously planned the KyberSwap exploits over several months, maintaining a directory of files labeled with terms like “KYBER_KILL” and “templateexploit.” He created a “POOL HIT LIST” to identify liquidity pools to target and timed the attack strategically, writing notes such as “Find time to Strike! CEO is in Ho-Chi.” He even calculated the optimal time for the attack to coincide with when Americans and Europeans would likely be asleep. You might also like: Crypto hacks jump ninefold in January: Immunefi After the attack, prosecutors say Medjedovic attempted to extort KyberSwap developers, investors, and DAO members by demanding control of the protocol in exchange for returning 50% of the stolen funds. At the same time, he was working to cover his tracks. Medjedovic and an associate allegedly laundered the stolen crypto through crypto mixers and blockchain bridges, shuffling the funds across multiple networks to obscure their origin. He also opened accounts at crypto exchanges using fake identities, attempting to liquidate his holdings without raising red flags. Furthermore, when one bridge protocol froze his transactions, Medjedovic allegedly paid an undercover law enforcement agent $85,000—believing they were a developer who could bypass the restrictions and unlock $500,000 of his frozen crypto. If convicted, Medjedovic faces significant penalties, including up to 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud, attempted extortion, and money laundering, as well as 10 years for unauthorized damage to a protected computer. Law enforcement agencies, including the Dutch National Police Cybercrime Unit and U.S. prosecutors, continue to pursue Medjedovic, who remains at large.

Bitcoin (BTC) changed the game for early investors, delivering life-changing returns, and Solana (SOL) is recognized for its exceptional scalability. Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin in the market, is grabbing headlines with predictions of 55,000% growth potential. Having raised $1 million during its presale in minutes, it’s being closely watched by experts who see it as the next breakout token alongside top contenders. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is Creating a Buzz 1. Fresh Entry, Massive Upside Being new to the market, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers a rare opportunity to invest before its value skyrockets. Early investors stand to benefit from the kind of exponential returns only seen in the early days of tokens like SOL and XRP. 2. Exceptional Presale Success The presale success of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN , raising $1 million almost instantly, is a clear indicator of its high demand and market appeal. Its early momentum positions it as a leader among emerging cryptos. 3. Exclusivity Fuels Demand Unlike XRP, LINK, and DOT, which are widely available across exchanges, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively sold at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This controlled access ensures scarcity, increasing its value for early adopters. How It Stands Against Competitors XRP: Dominates payments but lacks the early-stage growth potential of this new coin. Solana (SOL): Scalable and fast, but its growth is already stabilizing compared to this fresh token. Chainlink (LINK): Strong in decentralized oracles but can’t match the excitement surrounding THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An emerging project, but its momentum falls short of this token’s presale success. Don’t Miss This Game-Changing Opportunity With experts predicting up to 55,000% gains, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is becoming the most talked-about crypto of 2025. Its record-breaking presale, exclusivity, and high-growth potential make it a must-watch token alongside Solana. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and join the revolution!

The tariff war resolution between the United States and its neighboring countries, Canada and Mexico, contributed to the relief rally in the past 24 hours. However, the tariff retaliation from China to the U.S. has complicated the situation, thus creating more short-term uncertainty. After hitting a local high of about $102.5k on Monday, Bitcoin price dropped around 3 percent earlier on Tuesday to trade at about $99.2k at the time of this writing. The wider altcoin industry followed Bitcoin’s price action in tandem, thus leading to an 8 percent bump in the total crypto market cap to hover at about $3.46 trillion. Brandts on the Bitcoin Market According to market expert Peter Brandt, Bitcoin dominance will rally towards 66 percent against the altcoin industry in the near future. With the rising adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors and soon nation states, Brandt believes that Bitcoin will continue to yield its dominance in the near future. Brandt noted that the Bitcoin price has been ranging between $109k and $90k. As a result, a consistent close outside the consolidation range will lead to a major breakout in the subsequent months. In case of a bearish breakout, Brandt has set a target of around $75k and a short-term target of about $135.9k in case of a bullish breakout. On the Flipside In my opinion, it’s a great time to add $ETH . — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) February 3, 2025 After an impressive rally in the past two years, amounting to over 500 percent, Bitcoin price is likely to experience a lower bullish momentum compared to the altcoin market in the near future. According to Eric Trump, the executive vice president of the Trump organization, now is a great time to consider Ethereum. Moreover, the ETH/BTC pair has been trapped in a multi-year falling trend but recently retested a crucial support level above 0.023.

Meanwhile, a newcomer named Panshibi ($SHIBI) has grabbed the spotlight among meme coin enthusiasts, promising a structured approach that could aim for a remarkable 100x surge before July. Below, we delve into Cardano’s evolving ecosystem, then examine why Panshibi might be more likely to achieve astronomical gains in a short timeframe. Cardano’s Ongoing Evolution Cardano’s latest news emphasizes a significant development: the Plomin hard fork. By activating this upgrade, Cardano moves closer to genuine community governance. ADA holders can now vote on critical updates, treasury spending and other network proposals, reflecting Cardano’s ongoing transformation into a platform shaped by its users. This transition rests on three main approval criteria, from stake pool readiness to an interim committee’s endorsement. Despite a brief drop of 20% tied to global market volatility, many supporters remain confident in Cardano’s future. They point to its decentralized governance model as a factor that could eventually elevate ADA’s price. For now, recent performance shows the token hovers at $0.7071 —a far cry from the $5 some fans forecast. While the Cardano latest news on the Plomin hard fork hints at promising upgrades, it may not spur an immediate price jump unless major adoption catalysts emerge soon. Panshibi: The Meme Coin Targeting a 100x While Cardano cements governance reforms, Panshibi seeks a more explosive approach. Billed as a meme coin, it has structural elements rarely seen in the niche. Currently priced at $0.004 in its third presale stage, Panshibi has raised over $500k, selling out in the two previous stages. These stats underline robust market confidence in a project that merges playful branding with locked liquidity (10 years), team tokens locked for two years and a Coinsult-audited contract. Panshibi also highlights an AI-driven “social-fi” system, which engages users through interactive quests and staking rewards with enticing APYs. This intersection of meme culture and concrete utility makes Panshibi distinct from quick-flip tokens that rely solely on online hype. Traders keen on seizing new meme coin rockets are thus gravitating to Panshibi, eyeing the possibility of a 100x run in under a year—a prospect that, for many, outshines the slower route Cardano might take to eventually reach $5. Which Is More Likely to Hit $5 First? The latest news from the Cardano camp surrounding community-driven governance confirms that ADA remains a formidable player. Still, the coin’s move from $0.7071 to $5 depends on broader adoption and meaningful utility expansions—factors that typically unfold gradually. Panshibi, however, thrives on meme coin momentum, where explosive growth can happen overnight if significant exchange listings or influencer endorsements align with sustained community hype. While Cardano may offer stability for those who value a deeply technical roadmap, Panshibi appeals to traders seeking rapid gains in a shorter time frame. The success of past meme coins indicates that a well-structured token can skyrocket if it strikes the right balance between playful marketing and thorough security measures, both of which Panshibi provides. In a space where unpredictability reigns, many consider the meme sector more conducive to swift, exponential price hikes. Conclusion Although Cardano’s latest news confirms progress in decentralized governance, ADA’s modest price performance has left some holders wondering when they might see $5. Panshibi ($SHIBI), on the other hand, operates in a meme coin market known for sudden rallies and skyrocketing gains. With its first two presale stages sold out, locked liquidity for 10 years and AI-driven engagement tools, Panshibi seems well-positioned for an ambitious 100x run by July. Whether either coin hits its target first depends on a blend of market sentiment, real-world use and community support—but for risk-tolerant investors, Panshibi’s meteoric potential may prove irresistible in the months ahead.

Notably, over 4 million coins were again removed from the asset’s circulating supply, boosting the meme coin’s tokenomics. Simultaneously, SHIB price witnessed a nearly 10% uptick intraday, leveraging the broader market trend and burn rate impact. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Blows Up Over 550%, Investors Optimistic As Supply Shreds According to an X post by the tracker Shibburn on February 4, the Shiba Inu burn rate surged 567.83% in the past 24 hours. This remarkable upswing is attributable to 4.61 million coins being removed from the crypto’s circulating supply. For context, the SHIB token burn mechanism has constantly dealt a blow to the circulating supply, with nearly 1 billion coins removed just the previous month. These coins are sent to a null address, thereby making their retrieval impossible. At the time of reporting, the meme coin’s market supply further shredded to reach 589.25 trillion tokens. As a result, traders and investors eye a bullish outlook for the meme coin, a market sentiment based on the law of supply and demand. Crypto Market Recovery Solidifies Optimism Meanwhile, the broader market recovery has substantially impacted investors’ sentiment on Tuesday. As a result of the quickest trade war, the crypto market recovered as a 30-day halt on Trump’s new tariffs for Canada and Mexico was announced. While Bitcoin price recovered and touched a $102K high intraday, altcoins and meme coins mirrored a similar price action. Simultaneously, even the Shiba Inu coin’s price mirrored a recovery, with the burn rate surge further bolstering it. Can SHIB Price Hit $0.000018 Riding The Burn Rate Surge? At the time of reporting, SHIB price witnessed an 11% uptick in value and is currently trading at $0.00001560. The meme coin’s 24-hour low and high were $0.00001358 and $0.00001691, respectively. As mentioned above, the current bullish movement falls in line with the broader trend and burn rate uptick. Further, a recent Shiba Inu price analysis by CoinGape revealed that large transaction volumes for the token surged remarkably, sparking bullish sentiments over future movements. Notably, this data suggests that institutional or large-scale investors may be capitalizing on the recent market volatility to accumulate, signaling price gain looms. The next vital price point for the meme coin to reclaim remains $0.000015, per the analysis. Intriguingly, with the Shiba Inu burn rate surge and broader market recovery weighing in, the current price is above the level mentioned above. A sustained bullish momentum could help the token move toward $0.000018, supported by the constant reduction of supply with burns.

Ether Rebounds After Trump’s Tariff Pause It was on February 1, 2025, that President Trump took the aggressive decision to impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada. At the start of February 1, the price of Ethereum was around $3,301.00. In the first two days of the month alone, the market showed a severe drop of 13.103%.

Experts suggest that the funds could be used to support Earn and Borrow, a lending protocol that WLF is planning to introduce soon. Bitcoin’s $100K Milestone Show Ethereum’s Declining Trend An interesting pattern has emerged when comparing Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Each time Bitcoin reached the $100,000 mark, Ethereum’s price was lower than before. It was on December 5, 2024, that the Bitcoin market reached the milestone of $100K for the first time. At that time, the Ethereum market stood at around $3,900. When BTC touched the $100K mark for the second time, ETH slipped to $3,800. When BTC touched the mark for the third time, ETH declined to $3,700; for the fourth time, to $3,400; for the fifth time, to $3,200; and for the sixth time, to $2,800.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analysts see 1Fuel as a promising project, combining Solana’s speed and Ethereum’s DeFi strength to create a powerful, investor-favored ecosystem for 2025. Table of Contents Solana and Ethereum: Legends in their respective fields 1Fuel: Experts’ pick for 2025 1Fuel poised to mirror SOL and ETH’s success Conclusion 1Fuel, a highly anticipated cryptocurrency wallet, is creating buzz in the cryptocurrency space due to its unique features and functionality. Analysts have noticed the fundamentals of both SOL and ETH in 1Fuel, most especially in SOL’s developer-friendly ecosystem and ETH’s successful initial coin offering. This has prompted experts to term 1Fuel as a leading project in 2025. SOL and ETH are top cryptocurrencies that have dominated the cryptocurrency market, with SOL’s unimaginable speed and great scalability and ETH’s robust system, especially in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts. Despite being in its third stage of presale, 1Fuel has generated over $1.76 million in token sales despite selling for an undervalued price of $0.017. This showcases the massive interest of investors in the token. Solana and Ethereum: Legends in their respective fields SOL’s initial seed sale price started at $0.04, then went on to accumulate a staggering $20 million between April 2018 and July 2019. Since then, SOL has towered over several top cryptocurrencies, reaching an all-time high of $294, an astonishing 41000% from its all-time low. Press time data shows SOL trades at $203, a fall of about 32% from its Jan 19 high. On the other hand, ETH started out with an initial coin offering (ICO) that lasted about three months, between July 22, 2014, and September 2, 2014, selling over 60 million tokens for an undervalued price of $0.31. ETH now sells for $2,944, giving early investors over 9000x return on investment from the launch of the token. Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and a pioneer of decentralized finance (DeFi), having introduced the first smart contracts allowing developers to create decentralized applications (dApps). Experts who have profited from SOL and ETH’s incredible growth have chosen 1Fuel as the most promising project of 2025, as they predict it will replicate their success. 1Fuel: Experts’ pick for 2025 1Fuel stands out as the experts’ best pick for 2025, with its unique functionalities set to integrate the best of both SOL and ETH’s ecosystem. 1Fuel is a cryptocurrency wallet that contains an inbuilt peer-to-peer exchange system to help cut out intermediaries. It supports over 100 fiat currencies, displaying its range and goal to unify the global market. 1Fuel, key on financial integration, provides crypto cards to users to help them access their digital assets in the real world. This bridges the gap between the cryptocurrency world and traditional financial institutions. 1Fuel poised to mirror SOL and ETH’s success Like SOL and ETH once were, 1Fuel is currently in its presale stage and has acquired the support of notable figures, presenting an opportunity for investors to secure tokens before its expected price rally. 1Fuel currently sells for an undervalued price of $0.017, an initial price even lower than SOL and ETH in their presale and ICO phases, respectively. Analysts have predicted that the least returns investors will make on 1Fuel is 100x. Conclusion ETH and SOL are pioneers of blockchain innovation, setting the foundation for subsequent cryptocurrencies, but 1Fuel is implementing the strength of both blockchains while enhancing them for a better and more efficient future. With its undervalued price, interoperability, and financial integration, 1Fuel is positioned as a leading project in 2025.

A massive sell-off happened over the weekend, with the total crypto market cap dropping by half a trillion dollars. Although several news outlets suggest that over $2.27B have been liquidated, Bybit’s CEO says the liquidation could well be in the $8B-10B range . He believes the numbers being circulated don’t reveal the full picture because crypto exchanges typically limit liquidation data. Even worse, most of these liquidations come from long positions, i.e., from traders who were hoping Trump’s nomination as US president would lead to bullish times. It’s worth noting that Trump’s own meme coin, $TRUMP, crashed 40% in the last seven days . On the bright side, though, the crypto economy’s Trump-fueled correction means that the best meme coins are now available at a discount. However, it’s important you select fundamentally strong tokens that also enjoy market hype. We’re here to help; here’s the best crypto to buy now, as they’re best positioned to ride out slumps and skyrocket during the imminent bull run. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best Crypto to Buy Now for First-Time Investors Solaxy ($SOLX) is an altcoin set to explode , but don’t be fooled by its meme appeal – it provides a lot of utility, so much so that analysts are saying it’s the perfect token to weather the correction in crypto and 100x your investment . We’ve identified two major reasons why $SOLX’s presale has been an out-and-out success, raising over $17M at the time of writing. 1. Solana is continuously rising through the ranks and giving the best cryptos a serious run for their money. For instance, it recently beat Ethereum in monthly revenue – $116M in January 2025 as compared to Ethereum’s $107M. Moreover, the Solana ecosystem’s market cap surged 110% in just the last 30 days. 2. By removing Solana’s pain points (network congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability) Solaxy will breathe new life into the network. Invest in one of the best crypto presales by visiting the Solaxy website and connecting a crypto wallet like Best Wallet . You can get 1 $SOLX for just $0.001624 if you get in now. For more information on the buying process, check out our guide on how to buy $SOLX . 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Native Token of the Best Wallet App One of the most prevalent market phenomena is buying the dip – exactly what’s happening now. A surefire way to get behind this phenomenon is investing in a crypto wallet, with Best Wallet simply being the best there is. And it also has its very own token, the Best Wallet Token . With Best Wallet set to capture over 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2026, the $BEST token has become one of the hottest crypto presales in 2025. It supercharges the entire Best Wallet ecosystem, offering token holders a wealth of benefits. These include early access to high-potential projects, reduced transaction fees, voting rights for enhanced governance, and increased staking rewards. The $BEST presale ’s performance is only a confirmation of its huge potential. With over $9M in presale funding so far, the current price of $0.02385 per token offers an attractive entry point for early adopters. 3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – Offers a Safer Approach to Investing in Meme Coins Meme Index ($MEMEX) offers a less risky way to invest in meme coins, making it one of the most promising cryptos to include in your February portfolio. Simply put, it offers four baskets of meme coins, each with a different risk level, profit potential, and volatility. Depending on your risk appetite, you can choose a Meme Index basket. For instance, if the current market scenario makes you more conservative than usual, the Meme Titan Index, which contains the top 10 meme coins, will be ideal for you. However, if you’re a more aggressive investor and believe that a dip is worth capitalizing on, you can choose the Meme Frenzy Index, which is more risky but also more rewarding. $MEMEX is currently in presale and has already raised over $3M since its launch in December 2024. If you like how Meme Index simplifies meme coin investment and would like to benefit from its popularity, visit the $MEMEX website and buy it for just $0.0158443 each. Here’s how to buy it . 4. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) – Smelly Fun to Weather the Current Crypto Storm A token meant solely for amusement, it surprised a lot of investors that $FARTCOIN was among the very few meme coins that actually jumped during Trump’s tariff storm. It’s up by a whopping 13.78% in the last 24 hours, proving that tough times may come and go, but humor stays! Fartcoin is based on…well, farts! The project rewards token holders with free tokens if they submit fart jokes and memes. What’s more, even the creation of Fartcoin was unserious. Essentially, the project was an AI chatbot’s idea, but it wouldn’t have seen the light of day had an unknown developer not decided to take inspiration from the AI’s conversations. Although $FARTCOIN has taken a beating in the last month or so, it has formed a good-looking ascending triangle pattern – and a breakout over the $0.90–$1.00 zone could really send the coin soaring. 5. Dogecoin ($DOGE) – OG Meme Coin Ready to Rocket Another meme coin that has been unaffected by the recent crypto dip is the OG Dogecoin. It has, in fact, rallied more than 12% since yesterday, showing why it’s a great all-weather crypto. Interestingly, $DOGE is also a part of Meme Index ’s Meme Titan basket, which is a low-risk assortment of meme coins. This is further confirmation of Dogecoin’s stability. Moreover, a double bottom pattern suggests Dogecoin may lead crypto market gains this month . It’s currently trading at $0.26. Verdict Having mentioned the best crypto to buy now when the market is reevaluating itself, it’s very important that you’re careful because dips can be awfully notorious. None of the above is a substitute for financial advice, and you must only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing, as well as do your own research before investing your hard-earned money.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,MARKET|DOGE|BUSINESS|TRADING|SOL,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-04 07:54:31

XRP, dogecoin (DOGE), Solana’s SOL, and Cardano’s ADA are up nearly 3%. Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are nearly 4% higher. ""The U.S.-China tariff conflict could decrease the appetite for risk assets and further impact the positive sentiment that has been fueling a bull market in the crypto industry over the past year,"" Ben El-Baz, Managing Director of HashKey Global, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. ""The damage from the tariffs could still be made temporary if more crypto-friendly policies in the U.S. are set in motion,"" El-Baz added. Traders remain mixed on the long-term impact of China's retaliatory decisions, however, with markets hinging on the chance of a reversal or a prolonged drawdown if further actions against the country happen under Trump. ""Despite more people considering Bitcoin as digital gold, it still largely trades like a risk asset,"" Min Jung, research analyst at Prestro Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""As a result, China’s retaliatory 10% tariff on the U.S. is pressuring crypto, much like other global risk assets such as equities."" ""While today’s initial reaction may have been an overreaction, heightened volatility is likely to persist as markets digest further developments. The key question now is whether this move is primarily a negotiation tactic that could eventually be reversed—similar to what we saw with Canada and Mexico—or if it signals the start of a prolonged trade conflict, given that China has been a central focus of Trump’s rhetoric,"" Jung said. Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China led to a steep drop in bitcoin and broader equity markets on Monday, turning investors' focus from Trump's pro-crypto stance to immediate economic repercussions. Monday’s major liquidation event offered a ""buy-the-dip"" opportunity to traders, as a CoinDesk analysis noted, with the tariff announcements sparking interest in dollar-backed stablecoins as a hedge against economic uncertainty and currency volatility. However, the imposition of tariffs could lead to retaliatory measures from affected countries, potentially sparking a broader trade war and leading to further volatility across the crypto market in the days to come.",Markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|DOGE|XRP|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-04 07:59:00

The cryptocurrency’s price has surged 7.5% in the last 24 hours, recovering from its three-week low and leading some analysts to suggest the bleeding might be over. Related Reading: Ethereum Long-Term Bullish Structure At Risk – $2,700 Support Is Key for a $7K Target Solana Falls To Three-Week Low Over the weekend, Solana recorded a 27% price plunge from Friday’s highs to a three-week low of $175. This performance followed the overall market crash, fueled by the US president’s recently announced tariff on the country’s three biggest trading partners. On February 1, the white house revealed that Donald Trump was implementing new tariffs on imported goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. This measure was met with similar responses from the two neighboring countries, which announced they would implement tariffs on US imports. The fear of a global tariff war sparked a massive sell-off that saw Bitcoin’s price plummet to $91,200 and Ethereum’s price drop to $2,100. Additionally, the market registered at least $2.3 billion in liquidation, although Bybit’s CEO suggested the figure could be up to $10 billion. Solana lost the key $200 support zone and fell below $180 on Sunday night. As the market struggled, some analysts suggested that SOL’s price risked a deeper fall. Analyst Ali Martinez noted that SOL could retrace to $138 if it lost the $191 support from its multi-month ascending channel. Crypto trader Bluntz considers that losing the $220 support was “really bad” for the altcoin, as it resembled 2021’s bearish divergence sign. Additionally, it invalidated the “ABC from the highs” and made it look “more impulsive,” which would require a “miracle” to overcome it. SOL Must Hold These Levels Despite falling below the crucial levels, the cryptocurrency retested the $170-180 support zone and bounced from the $175 mark, attempting to break the $200 resistance in the following hours. Crypto analyst Jelle noted that Solana “retraced the TRUMP memecoin pump,” which saw SOL reclaim the $220 resistance and jump to its latest all-time high (ATH) of $295. However, Jelle considered that SOL’s structure “remained sound” during the drop and that its chart looked “very solid” as the cryptocurrency recovered on Monday morning. It’s worth noting that amid the market bleeding, Solana was among the cryptocurrencies that showed strength. SOL, like BTC, held its key horizontal levels, remaining within its post-US elections price range. Related Reading: BNB Bounce From $500: A Temporary Recovery Or Start Of A Rally? Martinez pointed out that “In the middle of this madness, the TD Sequential indicator presents a buy signal on the Solana daily chart.” Meanwhile, Miles Deutscher highlighted that BTC and SOL’s prices were “now higher than yesterday’s pre-liquidations,” noting the high volatility affecting the market. Moreover, Solana, alongside BTC and XRP, is among the only top 10 cryptocurrencies recording green numbers. Jelle considers that if SOL closes above the monthly and weekly supports between $200 and $210, it will continue its solid performance to retest the $240 resistance and see “another push for $300.” As of this writing, Solana is trading at $211, a 7.5% increase in the daily timeframe.

Late last month, Hayes predicted that BTC would drop to as low as $70,000 amid a slew of bearish macroeconomic and crypto signals before rallying to as high as $250,000. “Subtle movements between central bank balance sheet levels, the rate of banking credit expansion, the relationship between the US 10-yr treasury/stocks/Bitcoin prices, and the insane Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin price action produced a pit in my stomach. This is a similar feeling I got in late 2021, right before the bottom fell out of the crypto markets.” Following the severe pullback witnessed over the weekend, Hayes says the correction in crypto will likely continue “until morale improves.” According to the crypto veteran, the downside price action will only stop once the traditional financial (TradFi) industry is on the brink of collapse. At that point, Hayes believes that the Fed would ease monetary policy and give TradFi firms some relief. “The pain stops when a TradFi outfit is on the verge of bankruptcy. Then the Fed reluctantly joins team Trump and prints that money. And then you better be ready to buy crypto like you have never bought before.” Looking at Solana ( SOL ), Hayes says that the altcoin can drop to a level last seen in November of last year. “And they said you would never be able to buy SOL At time of writing, SOL is worth $216.

In a viral thread that has reached millions of views, ZachXBT and zeroShadow web3 security investigator tanuki42 compiled reports from Coinbase users who lost their funds in a series of social engineering scams throughout December 2024 up until January 2025. After gathering Coinbase withdrawals reports from X users via direct messages, the duo concluded that at least $65 million have been stolen from Coinbase user accounts during a two-month period. Though, Zach claims this estimation is likely much lower than the actual number, as it does not include Coinbase support tickets and police reports. Zach predicts that if these scams persist, Coinbase users could stand to lose more than $300 million per year due to falling for social engineering scams. Crypto.news has reached out to Coinbase for comment, but has yet to receive a response. 1/ Over the past few months I imagine you have seen many Coinbase users complain on X about their accounts suddenly being restricted. This is the result of aggressive risk models and Coinbase’s failure to stop its users losing $300M+ per year to social engineering scams. pic.twitter.com/PjtX7vmjqc — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) February 3, 2025 You might also like: ZachXBT awarded with tokenized fundraising coin for his work In the past few months, dozens of Coinbase users have complained online about their accounts getting suddenly restricted. Something the exchange has dubbed “FUD/misinformation,” claiming that the surge of new users and old users reactivating their accounts after the U.S. election has led to an increase of fraudulent attempts by up to three fold. “Our fraud-prevention systems are acting as expected and have saved customers tens of millions in losses in November alone,” wrote Coinbase Support. However, Zach said these restrictions were the direct result of “aggressive risk models and Coinbase’s failure to stop its users losing $300M+ per year to social engineering scams.” Scammers posing as Coinbase support Social engineering scammers steal funds from Coinbase users by calling them on a spoofed number and telling them their account has been compromised. The scammer would then send a fake email from Coinbase with a fake case ID, instructing the victim to transfer funds into a Coinbase wallet while “support” verified their account security. The link on the fake email would lead them to a cloned Coinbase site, which allows scammers to send different prompts to the target via spoofed emails using panels. ZachXBT said Coinbase has failed to properly “diagnose the actual problem” but has also acknowledged some of the things the crypto exchange has done well, such as providing recovery tools for users who deposit unsupported assets and providing a good stablecoin yielding and on-ramp/off-ramp mechanisms. He urged Coinbase to consider making phone numbers optional for advanced users with authenticator apps, creating an app specifically for beginners or elderly users that does not allow withdrawals, improving community outreach, as well as taking legal action against the U.S. based scammers and TransUnion for negligence on behalf of users as it’s the primary tool used by cybercriminals. “Coinbase needs to urgently make changes as more and more users are being scammed for tens of millions every month,” said ZachXBT.

The rapid Ethereum ( ETH ) recovery followed a post-tariff crypto market bloodbath on Feb. 3, which saw Ether plummet to a low of approximately $2,300, and was fueled by Eric Trump’s bullish endorsement of Ethereum in his recent post on X. That being said, Ethereum had already started rebounding to around $2,700 after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a temporary halt on proposed trade tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Eric Trump’s post was a just catalyst, fueling the second half of the rally.

The team moved most of its assets to Coinbase Prime and other exchange wallets, often routing through intermediary addresses, as reported by The Block . Meanwhile, the project has been receiving small ETH deposits from newly created or inactive wallets.

The company based its list on code edits on Github, where the codes of open source cryptocurrency projects are located. The data reveals that SOL, the native token of the Solana network, is unsurprisingly the most developed altcoin by developers. The Solana altcoins that crypto developers have focused on the most in the last thirty days, along with the rest of their developer scores, are as follows: Solana (LEFT) – 143.67 PythNetwork (PYTH) – 78.1 Wormhole (W) – 45.43 Neon (NEON) – 45.03 Swarms (SWARMS) – 44.54 Drift (DRIFT) – 41.07 Metaplex (MPLX) – 39.97 Helium IOT (IOT) – 38.4 Helium Mobile (MOBILE) – 38.4 JTO – 28.27 Related News: Analysis Company: “We're Entering a New Phase in the Bitcoin Bull, Be Prepared” When we examine the changes in the list compared to last month's data, we see that the first two places have not changed. However, W, NEON, SWARMS, DRIFT and JITO experienced an increase in developer activity, while MPLX, IOT and MOBILE decreased.

This favorable change has alleviated economic pressures, fostering a better atmosphere for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. Consequently, numerous altcoins have reached all-time highs (ATH), attracting considerable interest from investors. Among them, AI Companions (AIC), Minotaurus (MTAUR), Alpha (ALPHA), and MANTRA (OM) have excelled with remarkable price performances. 4 Altcoins Hitting ATH as the Crypto Market Recovers Within the vast array of best cryptos to buy , AIC, ALPHA, and OM distinguish themselves, each establishing a unique position in the dynamic crypto landscape with their unique features, as they hit all-time highs. Minotaurus (MTAUR) is emerging as a game changer in the gaming industry. 1. AI Companions (AIC): The Future of Digital Companionship AI Companions (AIC) has taken center stage with its rapid ascent, hitting an ATH of $0.4888 today before experiencing a minor pullback. In the last 24 hours, $AIC has increased by 42.57%, indicating a rising excitement for AI-oriented virtual connections. The initiative anticipates a future in which AI-driven virtual companions transform online engagements. Utilizing artificial intelligence, virtual reality (VR), and blockchain technology, AI Companions enables users to develop highly personalized digital partners that adapt and improve over time. The need for these immersive experiences is swiftly growing, positioning AIC as an essential participant in this expanding market. With a market capitalization of $360.28 million and a daily trading volume that has increased by 42.43%, AI Companions demonstrates that the AI movement in cryptocurrency is far from finished. AI Companions (AIC) price chart 2. Minotaurus (MTAUR): A High-Potential Presale Token While not yet listed on major exchanges, Minotaurus (MTAUR) is generating significant buzz with its current presale price of 0 . 0 0 0 1 0 5 0 1 USDT. Participants are eyeing a potential 234% yield when it officially lists at $0.00020 USDT, making it one of the most talked-about early-stage cryptocurrencies . Minotaurus isn’t just riding the hype train—it offers referral and vesting incentives, which encourage long-term holding. The project has also launched a massive 100K USDT giveaway, with a top prize of 50,000 USDT in MTAUR tokens. Beyond its financial appeal, Minotaurus has built a strong community and is gaining traction among influential crypto voices. With its promising fundamentals and momentum, this gaming token could experience explosive growth upon listing. 3. Alpha (ALPHA): An Altcoin Representing the Values of Leadership, Strength, and Resilience Alpha (ALPHA), rising as one of the top Solana meme coins to watch, has skyrocketed an impressive 87.34% in the past 24 hours and an extraordinary 346.39% in the last week. It recently hit a new peak of $0.2022 before undergoing a slight correction. In contrast to typical meme coins that rely solely on online culture, Alpha represents the values of leadership, strength, and resilience. Branded as the “GIGA Chad” of cryptocurrencies, ALPHA has cultivated a dedicated community that sees holding the token as a statement of dominance and confidence in the market. With a $167.79 million market cap and $31.01 million in daily trading volume, its rapid ascent signals that meme coins are far from dead—especially when they tap into a powerful narrative. Alpha (ALPHA) price chart 4. MANTRA (OM): Real-World Asset Tokenization Gains Traction MANTRA (OM) continues to solidify its place as a leading blockchain project, surging to an all-time high of $6.22 today. Over the past year, the altcoin has skyrocketed by 3031.97%, with a 12.98% gain in the past 24 hours alone. The recent rally is largely attributed to Republic, a major player in crypto investment, joining as a validator on the MANTRA network . Republic’s connections to Coinbase, Avalanche, Polygon, and Binance provide strong credibility to the project. Additionally, MANTRA’s focus on real-world asset tokenization has secured lucrative deals with Middle Eastern real estate giants MAG and DAMAC. Tokenization is gaining traction among institutional investors, with BlackRock’s $500 million BUIDL fund and Franklin Templeton’s $400 million collaboration with Stellar (XLM) highlighting the potential in this space. With open interest in MANTRA’s futures market nearing its all-time high of $434 million, investor confidence in this RWA token remains robust. MANTRA (OM) price chart Final Thoughts: A Strong Market Rebound with Promising Altcoins The suspension of import tariffs has given essential support to financial markets, prompting a significant surge in cryptocurrencies. AI Companions (AIC), Minotaurus (MTAUR), Alpha (ALPHA), and MANTRA (OM) have surfaced as exceptional performers, with each achieving or approaching new record highs. From AI-driven virtual relationships to real-world asset tokenization and the ever-evolving meme coin landscape, these four altcoins represent different but equally exciting opportunities in the crypto space. As the market continues to rebound, investors will be watching these projects closely, anticipating further gains and potential new milestones.

39904248,https://nulltx.com/?p=143658,1738659916,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Aptos’ Remarkable Achievements in January 2025: A Game Changer in the Blockchain Space,https://nulltx.com/aptos-remarkable-achievements-in-january-2025-a-game-changer-in-the-blockchain-space/,"Aptos , a top ecosystem in the blockchain arena, has received a burst of propulsion as we head into 2025, achieving a series of noteworthy milestones and strategic new developments that place it firmly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) camp. Most of Aptos had a very busy fourth week of January, as it rolled out some big new features and upsized several definitely-developing partnerships. As these developments played out, Aptos went into hyperdrive with user uptake: in January, it recorded its highest number of monthly active users to date. Circle’s USDC Goes Live on Aptos Mainnet In the first month of 2025, Aptos pulled off a particularly impressive move when it welcomed Circle’s USDC stablecoin onto its mainnet. USDC, a stablecoin most often used in the current crypto space, is pegged to the US dollar; it’s essentially peanut butter in the crypto ecosystem. And now it’s symbiotically cohabitating with APT on the Aptos blockchain. This development is obviously a good thing for Aptos. But what does it mean overall for USDC, and how will it affect the broader movement toward large-scale crypto adoption? The crypto ecosystem depends on stablecoins for several reasons, not least of which is that they offer a stable alternative to the more volatile cryptocurrencies. USDC, a type of stablecoin, is now available on Aptos. The basis for saying that is this: Aptos recently integrated USDC into its system architecture. This setup now allows Aptos users—to say nothing of users by way of other blockchains in the Aptos ecosystem—to perform cross-chain transactions with USDC as their stable, reliable digital asset. Aptos Leading the Move Ecosystem Aptos has set a firm course as the leader in the Move ecosystem, with $798 million in the stablecoins circulating on-chain, according to data from DeFiLlama. Move is the programming language that Aptos developed, specifically to boost security and scalability for decentralized applications. This impressive amount shows not only that Aptos has and is gaining traction but also that it has the popular support to lead in a space that’s highly competitive. The Move ecosystem is gaining momentum from its ability to furnish transactions that are both faster and more secure than traditional blockchain networks. Aptos has attracted a wide variety of developers and users who are seeking an efficient solution for their blockchain-based applications—an Aptos ecosystem that includes Enoma, f.(x), and others, as well as the 1.1 million unique wallet addresses we mentioned earlier, which together hold $798 million in value on-chain. Breakthrough in User Growth In January, Aptos achieved a noteworthy milestone, notching an all-time high of 16.1 million monthly active users, a 55% uptick from December 2022. This surge in user activity underscores the burgeoning interest in Aptos as a blockchain platform and its adoption across different areas of the crypto and blockchain sectors. Aptos and its ecosystem are appealing to many more people now; the platform is increasingly being explored by individuals and businesses alike. The platform saw 55% user growth in a three-month span from December to March and was at 159,600 user accounts in March. This number is a sharp uptick that seems to indicate more people are coming onto the platform and sticking around to do things. Strategic Partnerships and Tokenization of Real-World Assets Along with its technical progress, Aptos is making good strides in RWA tokenization. A point of interest is its partnership with Apollo and Securitize to tokenize the ACRED credit fund. Now live on several blockchain networks, including Aptos, Avalanche, and Ethereum, ACRED is a showcase for the kind of real-world asset tokenization that Aptos could help mainstream. This partnership shows the increasing curiosity about employing blockchain tech to oversee tangible assets, offering our traditional finance realm something it has long needed: more transparency and liquidity. The partnership between ACRED and Aptos allows us to take the next step in that direction. APT is now available on Aptos, which means our asset-backed token is now in a decentralized financial ecosystem where the “realness” of our assets has never been in question. Indeed, APT is a digital-access pathway to a decentralized-future finance realm where you can fractionalize access to an asset-class market. The Launch of TheAptosBridge To bolster its compatibility with other blockchain systems, Aptos, in January, released TheAptosBridge on the Stargate interface. This bridge functions as the Aptos ecosystem’s official connection to the Stargate network, allowing users to transfer assets and data across the Aptos and Stargate bridge projects. TheAptosBridge, then, is now the easiest way to execute cross-chain transactions—those that happen between two separate blockchain systems. “The Stargate bridge project is fully within the Aptos ecosystem and provides a seamless way of connecting to other bridge projects that are part of the Stargate network,” Aptos developers explained in a recent Twitter space. The decentralized finance ecosystem can grow only if assets can be transferred efficiently and effectively across various blockchains. The Aptos Bridge enables something that is quite basic in most programming languages: moving not just assets but also the logic that controls those assets between different environments. That makes it unique and makes the Aptos ecosystem that much stronger.

The platform has grown to be one of the premier blockchain ecosystems in the crypto space, and it seems to be solidifying that position. Aptos’s achievements now seem to be happening at an accelerating pace, and the upcoming Mainnet launch should only fan those flames. Here is a look at what Aptos has accomplished in this transparent month of January and why those developments matter to the price of APT, which we fully expect to skyrocket in the not-too-distant future. Aptos looks to be boosting its trajectory of growth and success as it expands the world through new users and developers. There’s a lot to like about Aptos potentially as USDC integration brings nearly a quarter of a billion in liquidity, Aptos’s role as a blockchain community leader in Move, and some strategic partnerships. It now seems poised to capture that ecosystem. Meanwhile, TheAptosBridge promises to be an appealing offering to the potential Aptos user base, allowing them to do DeFi and other non-crypto-native things once they enter the Aptos world.

Onyxcoin’s token (XCN) broke out of its four days of downtrend to an intraday high of $0.033 on Feb. 4. Today’s gains pushed its market cap to nearly $1 billion while extending its monthly gains to over 1,000% as of last check Tuesday afternoon, Asian time. XCN’s price rally came along with a jump in demand and trading activity. Over the past 24 hours, the altcoin’s daily trading volume jumped 20% to over $434 million, while open interest in its futures market was up 17% to nearly $21 million per CoinGlass data. What did XCN rally today? The key catalyst behind XCN’s rally today is the launch of its own Layer-3 blockchain, the Onyx XCN Ledger. According to an excerpt from its official blog post , the blockchain is “designed for financial-grade applications while offering near-instant confirmations and low fees.” Built on Arbitrum Orbit and secured by Coinbase’s Layer-2 chain, Base, the platform will use XCN as its native gas token and implement EIP-1559 to burn tokens with every transaction. Burning tokens permanently removes them from a crypto asset’s total supply, theoretically creating deflationary pressure and scarcity, which can drive demand and lead to a price increase.

According to CoinGlass, since Jan. 27, outflows from centralized exchanges have consistently surpassed inflows. XCN has also benefited from Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) recovery, along with the broader crypto market, following over $2 billion in liquidations the previous day. The leading crypto asset rebounded to the $100k level on Tuesday morning, aligning with a 4.6% jump in the global crypto market cap after President Donald Trump reached an agreement with the Canadian and Mexican presidents to pause the imposition of his controversial tariffs for a month. XCN price analysis XCN price, 50-day and 200-day MA — Feb. 4 | Source: crypto.news On the daily chart, XCN’s price remains high above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which means while XCN’s bullish trend still persists, the asset is approaching an overbought level and could face a potential reversal soon. XCN MACD and PP0 chart — Feb. 4 | Source: crypto.news This is confirmed by the MACD and price oscillator lines pointing downwards which also signals a potential reversal of the current trend. The Relative Strength Index also points to a bearish divergence with the price which signals weakness in the ongoing trend with a potential reversal or correction on the horizon. Based on these signals, XCN could retreat to the psychological support level of $0.025. However, this scenario may be invalidated if Bitcoin regains its bullish momentum in the coming days.

MIND poised for breakout as AI-driven cryptos gain momentum The recent GRIFT price rally highlights a growing trend in the crypto space: AI-powered tokens are capturing investor attention.

One such project making waves is MIND of Pepe (MIND) , a meme coin that blends autonomous AI technology with community-driven innovation. The presale has raised over $5 million so far. Unlike typical meme tokens, MIND uses an AI agent to scan market sentiment and analyze social media trends, allowing it to detect emerging crypto narratives before they go mainstream. With token-gated access, MIND holders unlock exclusive AI-generated insights, curated market data, and automated trend analysis. The AI behind the platform continues to evolve, learning from blockchain activity and decentralized applications to stay ahead of market shifts. Currently, in its presale phase at $0.0032532, MIND of Pepe presents an early entry opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the intersection of AI and meme culture. A staking program with up to 458% APY adds an extra layer of incentive, combining long-term growth potential with high-reward staking options.

According to Gerald Goh, CEO of Sygnum, a Singapore-based virtual asset banking group, Trump’s re-entry has had an electrifying effect on cryptocurrencies and crypto-related companies, leading to a mad scramble for rich Asian investors who are now allocating larger portions of their portfolios to digital assets. In an interview with Nikkei Asia , Goh revealed that his firm’s onboarding rate for new clients “probably doubled or tripled” in the week following Trump’s victory. Giving a wider overview over prevailing market sentiment in Singapore, he said: Specifically, in Singapore, investors generally are more positive about incorporating crypto investments as part of their investment portfolios. We’ve already seen in 2024 an improvement in the mood, let’s say, in the sentiment, on the crypto side.

In stark contrast, Rollblock (RBLK) is defying the trend, posting new highs weekly as demand surges during its presale. With strong fundamentals and growing investor interest, analysts believe Rollblock holds a 40x potential post-launch, positioning it as a standout in the current market. Rollblock (RBLK): Disrupting the Online Gaming Space with Blockchain Transparency Rollblock (RBLK) is making bold moves in the online gaming industry by addressing the long-ignored problem of trust. Unlike traditional platforms, where fairness often feels questionable, Rollblock uses the power of blockchain technology to eliminate doubts. Every bid and game outcome is permanently recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring results are transparent, verifiable, and immune to manipulation. This approach builds confidence, offering players a level of fairness that traditional platforms simply can’t match. Rollblock’s extensive game library, featuring over 7,000 titles, caters to casual gamers and high-stakes bettors. There’s something for everyone, whether classics like Roulette and Blackjack or modern virtual games such as Motorbike on Demand and World Cup. For sports enthusiasts, Rollblock also provides the thrill of bidding on thousands of live events, making it a versatile hub for all types of gamers. The platform’s rapid growth is hard to ignore. In December, users wagered over $1.75 million, reflecting rising trust and engagement. This momentum shows no signs of slowing, and projections indicate that this figure could double as Rollblock continues to attract more players and investors. Rollblock’s standout feature is its RBLK token’s revenue-sharing model. Up to 30% of the platform’s profits are used weekly to buy back RBLK tokens from the open market. 60% of these tokens are burned to maintain long-term value, creating scarcity and driving price appreciation. The remaining 40% is distributed to token holders who stake RBLK, offering them both passive income and the benefit of holding a deflationary asset. With over 45,000 active investors and its presale crossing the $10 million mark, Rollblock has proven that it is more than a trend. At $0.052 per token , the RBLK presale is an affordable entry point for those wanting to invest in the platform’s development potential. Dogecoin Faces Bearish Pressure Amid Whale Dump, But Long-Term Optimism Persists Dogecoin (DOGE) trades at $0.2553 after a 13.49% drop in the last 24 hours. Despite this bearish momentum, Dogecoin’s 24-hour trading volume surged 345.35% to over $10.93 billion. The recent price dip is primarily attributed to Donald Trump’s announcement of new import tariffs, which rattled global markets and triggered widespread sell-offs across the crypto sector. This volatility was further intensified by a significant whale dump, where a large Dogecoin holder transferred 200 million tokens—valued at $49.94 million—to Binance, as reported by Whale Alert. The wallet address linked to this transaction, “DU8gPC5m,” has heightened concerns about potential further sell-offs, contributing to investor caution. Massive whale movements typically signal declining confidence among large holders and negatively impact Dogecoin’s tokenomics. However, Elon Musk’s continued support for Dogecoin and positive developments, such as the D.O.G.E. department’s reported success in saving Americans $1 billion, have maintained Dogecoin’s relevance in the crypto space. While short-term volatility persists, analysts from CoinGape suggest that Dogecoin could rebound significantly, with projections indicating a potential surge to $1 by Q4 2025 , driven by long-term investor confidence and strong community backing. Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Stage 10 is Live – 420% Gains and Counting! Stage 10 of the RBLK presale is live, and early investors have already secured 420% gains. Tokens are priced at just $0.052, offering a prime opportunity to accumulate before prices soar.

They’ve been trending for years now, transforming from inside jokes to legitimate market movers. And why not? With the right community and a dash of celebrity endorsement, meme coins can take over the crypto scene faster than a viral TikTok dance. But some meme coins have truly set themselves apart from the pack. For instance, BTFD Coin’s presale performance has been nothing short of legendary, smashing records and drawing serious attention. So, if you’re on the hunt for the best cryptos to stake right now, buckle up. With an eye-popping $5.91 million raised in presale funds, BTFD Coin is taking the crypto world by storm. Stage 14 is officially here, and with the LAUNCH100 bonus code in play, now is the time to get in on the action. But there’s more to it than just impressive numbers; this is all about staking and the potential returns for savvy investors. Analysts predict a price jump to $0.0006 upon launch, with moonshot predictions of hitting $0.006 as the project matures. Ready to jump in? BTFD Coin: Presale Momentum and Analyst Predictions That Wow Investors BTFD Coin has garnered a massive $5.91 million during its presale so far, and the current price of $0.00016 per token means there’s still plenty of room for growth. Here’s where things get interesting. Let’s say you decide to invest $5,000 at the current price of $0.00016 per token. You’d receive a whopping 31,250,000 BTFD tokens for your $5,000. Thanks to the LAUNCH100 bonus code, you get an additional 100% bonus tokens. So, instead of 31,250,000 tokens, you’ll walk away with an impressive 62,500,000 BTFD tokens! That would bring your investment up to a cool $37,500, with a 650% return on your $5,000 investment. With its community-driven focus, the Bulls Squad is at the heart of everything, making this token more than just an asset to buy and sell. The staking rewards offer an average annual percentage yield (APY) of 90% , and its play-to-earn game promises users even more opportunities to earn within the ecosystem. With presale prices still low and massive upside potential, there’s no better time to jump in than right now. BabyDoge: The Adorable Meme Coin with a Heart for Charity Born out of the desire to spread awareness about pet adoption, BabyDoge quickly gained momentum after a tweet from none other than Elon Musk. Since then, it’s become a cultural icon—so much so that it even holds a world record for helping save dogs by donating over 81,000 pounds of dog food.

The project has recently received an inordinate amount of visibility for some stellar developments, including acceptance into the NVIDIA Inception program, integration with Zapier, and a top-billing interview with Mario Nawfal, who’s connected to some large lights, like Elon Musk, David Sacks, and CZ of Binance. A Big Step Forward: SNAI Joins NVIDIA Inception Program Being recently included in the NVIDIA Inception program is a significant marker for the Swarmnode project. The NVIDIA Inception program is meant to advance innovative AI startups. For Swarmnode, this partnership is incredibly fruitful; it connects the project with a huge network of experts who make up the vast resources, funding, and guidance marshaled by NVIDIA and its Inception partners. Working with NVIDIA, a top-tier AI and ML company, puts Swarmnode at the industry’s leading edge—indeed, at the very “swarm front,” as our friends at Swarmnode would say. Membership in this prestigious program confers on us more than just credibility. It also gives us access to the kind of tools that can really help us grow the company and push the boundaries of what we’re doing with blockchain and AI—two areas that are not just converging but also creating some amazing new tech possibilities in the space. The NVIDIA Inception program is recognized for cultivating pioneering businesses in AI. It offers rare and vital resources, including NVIDIA’s mighty hardware, the hand of helpful technical personnel, and the kind of co-marketing that gets you noticed by the right people. As Swarmnode enters this elite program, it should gain more attention— and better be gaining attention— from investors and the tech community. And that makes us happy. Zapier Integration Boosts Swarmnode’s Accessibility Besides its collaboration with NVIDIA, Swarmnode made headlines when it declared a new integration with Zapier, the well-known automation platform. This integration gives users the ability to hook up Swarmnode’s already impressive toolset to the other thousands of apps and tools they use in their day-to-day business lives. Doing so only serves to amplify both the already significant power of Swarmnode’s services and the ridiculously powerful opportunity that comes with using Zapier. Swarmnode gets more valuable because it integrates with Zapier. Swarmnode melds intimately with the Salesforce platform, yet is equally at home alongside dozens of other familiar business applications. That makes it all the more interesting for potential users, who can now access virtually all of the common business tools they already use. Swarmnode earns its keep by helping companies better understand their data and, by extension, their customers. And because it can be used in conjunction with AI applications, it has the potential—especially when paired with business tools like Salesforce—to boost business intelligence tenfold. $SNAI @swarmnode just got accepted into $NVDA inception program for startups. This will be a great opportunity to connect with investors. @bakar_io also just did an interview with @MarioNawfal and may get posted anytime now. Mario almost has 2M followers with key public figures… pic.twitter.com/fXUbQPRNuw — Dangstrat (@Dangstrat) February 3, 2025 High-Profile Interview with Mario Nawfal: Major Exposure for Swarmnode One of the most thrilling developments for Swarmnode is that its founder, @bakar_io, was recently interviewed by Mario Nawfal. He’s a well-known figure in the tech and crypto space. Nawfal, who is close to 2 million followers, and who has pulled together some really big names in the public universe—figures such as Elon Musk, David Sacks, and CZ (the CEO of Binance)—is someone whose power to bring significant exposure to the projects he talks about is undeniable. Soon to be released, this might-be-launched-any-day-now interview could be a game changer for Swarmnode, depending on what comes out of it. When a cryptocurrency personality like Nawfal—the host of this potentially big-deal interview—pulls a phase change in terms of viewers when they tune in to see whom he’s conversing with, that should, all things being equal, also pull a phase change in trading volume for the cryptocurrency the “with” host is associated with. All those viewers equal a lot of potential new investors seeing what’s going on with $SNAI. When major names in cryptocurrency take part in something, it tends to radiate impact, and that’s precisely the case with Swarmnode. The interview seen here was conducted with the company’s co-founder, and amplification from the major crypto names involved in this project enhances the overall reach of this message. Swarmnode has a very promising concept, is currently putting it into action, and, quite frankly, could be the next big opportunity in blockchain and AI. Swarmnode’s Increasing Mindshare on the AI Index Swarmnode’s recent successes are also helping to establish its increasing mindshare in the industry. Over the last six hours, the $SNAI token has received a huge bump in awareness, leading the charge on the @goatindexai AI Index. This mindshare increase suggests that the market is starting to really pay attention to the step-ups that Swarmnode is taking and seems to be leading us toward their making a major moment in the AI and blockchain space. These key developments all come together to give Swarmnode a potent boost toward even greater recognition: – Acceptance into the NVIDIA Inception program – Integration with Zapier – A headline interview with Mario Nawfal Together, these developments make Swarmnode a rising star in the epochs of both AI and blockchain. SNAI ( @swarmnode ) leads in mindshare over the last 6 hours on @goatindexai AI Index after getting accepted into the NVIDIA Inception program. pic.twitter.com/UyWoF2OdPl — The Solana Post (@thesolanapost) February 3, 2025 Conclusion: The Future Looks Bright for Swarmnode Swarmnode is making gains in both the artificial intelligence and blockchain industries, thanks to some recent accomplishments. It became part of the exclusive NVIDIA Inception program. It struck an important integration deal with Zapier. It’s in talks with some other important potential partners. Very soon, it’s going to be featured in an interview with prominent business figure Mario Nawfal. And lately, it’s been picking up some buzz in the AI space—mostly for how its work intersects with GPT-4. While Swarmnode expands its ecosystem and garners more interest from the tech and investment communities, its future appears increasingly bright. Banking on industry luminaries like NVIDIA, swelling with a user base that’s getting hard to ignore, and better still, studying a clear path to exposure via high-profile influencers, the Swarmnode platform looks to be a serious contender in the blockchain and AI spaces.

This probe, first reported by Bloomberg, could impact how sports betting and event-based contracts are regulated in the future. The Big Question: Is Sports Betting “Gaming”? The key issue in this investigation is whether sports prediction markets fall under the definition of “gaming.” According to crypto lawyer Aaron Brogan, if sports betting is not legally considered gaming, the CFTC might not have the authority to ban Crypto.com and Kalshi from offering such contracts. However, past legal discussions suggest that sports betting was included in the law’s restricted categories. Brogan referenced a past ruling on Kalshi’s election betting contracts, where a judge defined gaming as “playing games for stakes.” He noted that while this ruling could pose challenges for Kalshi’s sports contracts, it is not legally binding. The interpretation remains debatable, and different judges could view the matter differently. Changing Leadership Could Influence Regulations The regulatory scene may change with Republican Caroline Pham leading the CFTC. Many believe her leadership could bring a more relaxed approach, especially toward retail-oriented event contracts. The previous Democratic-led commission had been skeptical of such contracts and actively fought against platforms like PredictIt and Kalshi offering election-based bets. However, the extent of this policy shift remains uncertain. If the CFTC is still investigating Kalshi’s post-inauguration sports contracts, it suggests that the agency may continue to take a strict stance on certain event-based markets. Kalshi had previously withdrawn two sports-related filings but later self-certified a new contract focused on spectator sports. On January 24, it launched a Super Bowl market for the “Kansas City vs. Philadelphia” game, which has already seen $2.5 million in trading. Plus, it introduced contracts on brands expected to advertise during the game, attracting over $1.5 million in activity. What’s Next for Crypto Betting? If the CFTC classifies sports contracts as gaming, platforms like Kalshi and Crypto.com could face regulatory problems or outright bans on their prediction markets. On the other hand, if courts lean toward a broader interpretation, these platforms may have a strong case to continue operating. Any decision regarding their legality will only be made after the Super Bowl on February 9. For now, the future of sports-based prediction markets hangs in the balance as regulators and legal experts debate whether these contracts should be allowed under U.S. law.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|COMMODITY|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-04 09:19:24

The gas limit on Ethereum reached nearly 32 million gas units as of Tuesday morning with a maximum expected capacity of 36 million units. The last significant increase was in 2021, when the limit jumped from 15 million to 30 million gas units. This change was implemented after more than half of the validators supported the adjustment, which was enacted automatically without the need for a hard fork (or a split in the network). On Ethereum, gas is a unit that measures the computational work required to execute operations like transactions or smart contract functions. Each operation has a gas cost associated with it, ensuring that users pay for the exact amount of computational effort their actions require. The gas limit is the total amount of gas that can be used in a block. If transactions in a block exceed this limit, they are either delayed to the next block or must compete for inclusion based on the gas price offered. Raising the gas limit allows Ethereum to process more transactions or more complex operations within each block, thus improving network throughput and allowing the creation of sophisticated decentralized financial (DeFi) applications with minimal downtime. Higher gas limits also mean less congestion during peak times, which can make the network costly to use and turn users away to cheaper networks such as Solana.More network utility can add to investor demand for ETH, helping buoy the world’s second-largest token that has fallen out of investor favor in the past year. Ether (ETH) slumped Sunday to its lowest level against bitcoin (BTC) since March 2021 as the world’s second-largest token extended losses against its larger rival. One ether dropped to 0.03 BTC in January, as CoinDesk reported , almost 50% lower than a year ago, as bitcoin soared in the run-up to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. The exchange rate for the two tokens, conventionally called the ETH/BTC ratio, peaked above 0.08 in 2022 and ETH's value proposition has been on the decline ever since. https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1886580315965009964 In addition, the upcoming Pectra upgrade is expected to double the capacity of layer-2 networks — or blockchains that operate atop Ethereum — by increasing the blob target from 3 to 6.""Blobs"" are large data packets used by layer-2 networks to store data for a certain time period, with 3 blobs included in each Ethereum block as of Tuesday.",Markets,EN,0,0,ETH|BTC|FORKS|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-04 09:22:15

The crypto market wilted early Monday, with the price of bitcoin ( BTC ) falling to nearly $91,000 from $100,000 as concerns of a renewed trade war between the U.S. and its top partners Canada, Mexico and China sent shockwaves through financial markets. The slide reversed later in the day after President Donald Trump paused tariffs on Mexico for 30 days. The solid two-way price action led to margin shortages, resulting in massive liquidations, the forced closure of positions on centralized and decentralized trading avenues. Aave alone processed $210 million in liquidations, its highest single-day tally since the crash of Aug. 5, the data show. More importantly, the protocol avoided taking on new bad debts. The protocol accrues bad debt when borrowers fail to repay their loans and the collateral provided is insufficient to cover the outstanding amounts. The risk is higher during volatile market conditions, like those on Monday, when sharp price declines and low demand hinder the effective liquidation of collateral. ""Liquidations were executed efficiently across the protocol, most of which were performed on the Ethereum Main instance. The robust risk management mechanisms within Aave ensured that the collateralized positions were settled as intended, minimizing protocol losses,"" Chaos Labs said on X. Aave essentially aced the market's stress test, demonstrating the efficiency of its risk-control measures and liquidation mechanisms. Its existing bad debt even declined by 2.7% due to the drop in the value of the debt assets. Pseudonymous DeFi observer leo hailed AAVE's performance as evidence of decentralized finance's strong foundation, which includes ""rigorous collateral selection and management through governance, efficient protocol design for liquidations, thick liquidity pools in the ecosystem."" Impending upgrades like Aave v3.3, v4 and the Umbrella updates indicate a promising future for the DeFi industry, leo said. Version 3.3, announced in December , introduces a function to record and clear uncollateralized bad debts from liquidations, allowing Umbrella, an automated debt-management system, to handle risk and lower protocol liabilities.

According to South Korean media outlet Energy Kyungjae , the city of Gwacheon has announced that it will launch “its own electronic virtual asset seizing system.” The city regulators hope to use the IT solutions in the wider Gyeonggi Province to identify crypto wallets belonging to tax evaders living in the city in the near future. Using the new seizing system, Gwacheon City will mainly target 361 high-income citizens who have been identified for not paying over 3 million won in tax, due to the average amount being around 18.8 billion won. According to the report, these individuals are suspected of hiding their wealth in crypto as a way to avoid paying higher taxes. In South Korea, the crypto tax proposal has not been put into place yet due to regulators agreeing to postpone the rumored 20% crypto tax to as late as 2027. Despite this delay, the South Korean government has given local tax agencies in certain regions the rights to seize crypto belonging to residents who under scrutiny for tax evasion. Read more: South Korea to postpone Crypto Tax bill to 2027 Before seizing any assets, Gwacheon city officials promise to issue a warning to targeted citizens, encouraging them to pay the additional tax to avoid seizure of their crypto assets. If citizens are not able to pay the additional tax amount before the set deadline, then authorities will move forward with seizing their crypto assets. The process of collecting additional tax amounts will begin in the first half of 2025 using the new IT solution. Gwacheon City Tax Division Chief Kang Min-ah said that the deployment its own electronic crypto seizing system is vital for making sure the tax system is fair for all citizens that dutifully pay taxes. “We will realize fair taxation through strong responses to tax avoiders and actively block tax evasion through the seizure of virtual assets,” said Kang. In the past five years, Gwacheon City has reportedly seized approximately 300 million won worth of virtual assets held by high-income local tax evaders. In 2024 alone, authorities claim to have seized 110 million won worth of digital assets.

This steep drop occurred alongside a significant global financial market meltdown—many media commentators seeing the rapid deterioration of multiple megacorporations as a good bet for pushing the economy into recession. Yet the formerly buoyant cryptocurrency market was also seeing the bearish vibes result in actual downtrending price action—and with this Bitcoin inescapably involved as a major crypto market player, talk of its ongoing and future “decentralization” was presaged by ominous Bitcoin Death Star accusations. Bitcoin plummeted to as low as $91.2K as all of crypto has dipped with world stock markets starting the week with heavy bleeding. Media outlets seem to be attributing plummeting sectors to 'Trump's trade war'. Whether this is the primary reason or if there are other… pic.twitter.com/ij1bQ6xfUu — Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 3, 2025 Even with all the doom and gloom, historical trends indicate that such intense market fear usually precedes a solid buying opportunity. The dip hurt a lot of people, but it mostly hurt short-term holders. Long-term Bitcoin holders remained relatively unscathed and have reemerged as a potentially stabilizing force in the market. Meanwhile, the ETF train just keeps on rolling. On October 2, 2023, the ProShares Bitcoin ETF saw inflows of over $50 million, while overall Bitcoin ETF inflows this year have now crested over $7 billion. Short-Term Holders Absorb Losses While Long-Term Holders Remain Unfazed The recent drop under $100K has put a considerable portion of Bitcoin’s supply held by short-term holders (STH) into the red. At $97K, it appears that STHs saw their holdings divided between profit and loss, with approximately 11% of each—our most recent loss exposure since early January. This metric underlines the precarious position of short-term traders who bought into the market at elevated prices, only to be surprised by a swift and sharp downturn. #Bitcoin dipped below $100K over the weekend, pushing a notable amount of short-term holder (STH) supply into loss. At $97K, the supply in loss & profit held by STHs was evenly split at ~11% – the largest loss exposure for STHs since early January: https://t.co/Drjy6ahQMm pic.twitter.com/gypNiJ0BqX — glassnode (@glassnode) February 3, 2025 Long-term holders (LTHs), on the other hand, have shown resilience. Less than 0.01% of their supply is in loss. However, the share of unrealized profit that they hold has been on a steady decline since November and now sits at its lowest point since September. This trend suggests that while LTHs are not selling in a panic, they are also not engaging in what one might call aggressive accumulation at these price levels. If Bitcoin continues to slide, LTHs reinvesting might mark renewed confidence in the asset’s long-term value and provide some stability. Market Sentiment Hits Extreme Bearish Levels—A Contrarian Buy Signal? When Bitcoin fell under the $100K threshold, a wave of bearish discourse crashed across the crypto’s social media channels. With every passing day, the amount of criticism being leveled at the digital currency was on the rise. Yet what is often lost amid all this impassioned naysaying is just how frequently it can act as a contrarian indicator—an extreme position taken by a group of people that has a good chance of being wrong. Numerous analysts believe that the steep sell-off was a coordinated effort to force retail traders to liquidate their positions. These traders, who likely purchased near the recent local highs, were then driven below the local lows to sell in significant enough volumes to move the markets. The “strong hand” traders, who are unlikely to be moved by market conditions, then bought up the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) that these retail traders sold at bottom prices. Institutional Demand Holds Strong: Bitcoin ETFs See $560M in Inflows Although the market downturn has unsettled short-term traders, institutional investors seem to be capitalizing on the lower prices. Between January 27 and January 31, 2023, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a net inflow of $560 million. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), alone, pulled in $751 million during that time. Both of these strong trends suggest that large institutional players are well-positioned in and bullish on Bitcoin despite its volatility. Bitcoin ETF’s unfulfilled dream may not even momentarily dampen the idea that long-term institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency is anything but rock solid. If anything, the asset’s continued demand might reinforce that idea. Last week (January 27 to January 31, EST), Bitcoin spot ETF had a net inflow of $560 million, Blackrock Bitcoin ETF IBIT sees weekly net inflows of $751 million and Ethereum spot ETF had a net outflow of $45.51 million. https://t.co/Tvs2oCSxTg — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 3, 2025 And if any “demand satisfaction” side of the ETF story were to translate into anything close to actual Bitcoin ETF kind of product, inflows might well indicate Bitcoin ETF base coming to terms with the idea that the application process is likely more of a marathon than a sprint, and that the prospects for actual demand satisfaction remain bright. What’s Next for Bitcoin? The immediate future of Bitcoin is unclear, with its price movement determined mainly by how short-term holders behave. If BTC goes down more, long-term holders might step in to stabilize the market. But unless these investors start accumulating again, the asset may be exposed to more short-term downside vulnerability. Concurrently, the continuous interest from institutional investors through ETFs provides a counterforce that is bullish relative to the bearish sentiment coming from retail traders. If history serves as a guide, this current wave of negativity should set the stage for a very nice recovery, led by those whose purchases are panic-driven and who appear likely to push Bitcoin’s price back up. At present, Bitcoin’s upcoming actions will rely on its ability to maintain crucial support levels and the perception of this current dip by long-term investors as an enticing entry point. As we await the return of confident market participants, next-day swings in Bitcoin’s short-term price are likely to be the closest thing to predictability that the market will offer. And with price swings sure to happen, volatility will be our constant companion. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The decision, which Trump signed off on over the weekend, reignited tensions between the two largest economies on Earth. Hours after the tariffs hit, Beijing retaliated with new levies on US products and launched an antitrust investigation into Google. The White House framed the tariffs as necessary punishment for what it called China’s failure to curb the flow of illegal drugs into the US, including fentanyl. “If we can’t make a deal with China, then the tariffs will be very, very substantial,” Trump told reporters from the Oval yesterday. There was no deal. Instead, the new tariffs took effect. China hits back with tariffs and a Google investigation China’s finance ministry announced it would impose a 15% tariff on US coal and liquefied natural gas, starting February 10. The ministry also slapped a 10% tariff on American crude oil, farm equipment, and certain US-made cars and trucks. Beijing warned that these were just the beginning of its “corresponding countermeasures.” China’s response wasn’t limited to goods. It hit America’s tech sector where it hurts. Beijing launched an investigation into Google for alleged anti-competitive practices. The State Administration for Market Regulation said in a Tuesday statement that it would probe whether the tech giant violated China’s anti-monopoly law. The investigation comes as Google faces similar scrutiny worldwide. The US government recently won a lawsuit against the tech giant too, claiming the company abused its dominance in the search engine market. In August, Google lost a major lawsuit in the US after the Justice Department accused it of maintaining an illegal monopoly in the search engine market. The court ruled that Google had created barriers to entry for competitors. Now US officials are pushing for the company to sell its Chrome browser and end exclusive agreements with major smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung. Across the Atlantic, Google faces another investigation from the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority. British regulators are examining whether Google qualifies as having “strategic market status,” a label that could subject the company to stricter rules under new UK laws. The Chinese government declared the US tariffs a violation of World Trade Organization rules and confirmed that it had already filed a complaint with the WTO. The commerce ministry added another punch, announcing export controls on critical minerals like tungsten, molybdenum, and ruthenium—elements vital for global tech production. Analysts say this could disrupt supply chains for key industries, including electronics and defense manufacturing. Trump reaches agreement with Canada and Mexico Meanwhile, on Monday, Trump agreed to a 30-day pause on the planned 25% tariffs targeting imports from Canada and Mexico after high-level discussions with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, both of whom promised action on the fentanyl crisis, which is Trump’s whole issue in the first place. In a tweet on Monday, Trudeau said , “I just had a good call with President Trump. Canada is implementing our $1.3 billion border plan — reinforcing the border with new choppers, technology and personnel, enhanced coordination with our American partners, and increased resources to stop the flow of fentanyl. Nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and will be working on protecting the border.” President Claudia also shared that: “We had a good conversation with President Trump with great respect for our relationship and sovereignty; we reached a series of agreements. Mexico will immediately reinforce the northern border with 10,000 members of the National Guard to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, particularly fentanyl.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Are You Making These Web3 Resume Mistakes? - Find Out Here",Economy|CAD|CNY|Google|MXN|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-04 09:27:01

These two unsettling events, or the crypto market crash, wiped out billions in leverage positions and put investors through challenging situations, but the Hyperliquid token’s strong performance intrigues investors. Let’s discuss the prime reasons behind HYPE’s strong and stable performance. Hyperliquid is among the most popular layer1 blockchain networks worldwide due to its low transaction fees and seamless trading experience. It is also a decentralized crypto exchange specializing in perpetual futures contracts. Its native token, HYPE, is winning over investors mainly because of its performance in the recent crypto market space. With that, the decentralized exchange stands out in the DeFi space and is its native token in the market. Let’s discuss the prime reasons behind HYPE’s strong and stable price performance. 3 Reasons Behind HYPE Price Stability Amid Crypto Market Crash Donald Trump’s tariff plan resulted in the crypto market crash and the struggle for almost every asset. However, the HYPE price remained relatively stable due to the blockchain network’s strong fundamentals. These fundamentals have already maintained a high demand for the token in the market, but the savings in the current crash were impressive. There are three primary reasons for this. Let’s discuss them. 1. High Trading Volume Hyperliquid is often called the powerhouse in the DeFi space, where its daily trading volume hits billions of dollars. The January 31, 2025 data shows the HYPE’s daily trading volume as $7B, protecting its price from high volatility. This high trading volume showcases the blockchain network’s demand, where its KYC-free accessibility and low trading fees are building its demand. Despite the low fees, it receives $4 million in revenue daily due to a bigger user base. 2. Token Burn & Buyback Mechanism Token burning is a popular event in the crypto industry, where digital assets’ tokens are burned to reduce the circulating supply. Hyperliquid indulges its native token in the same and interestingly went for burning $2.7k HYPE during the crypto market crash. This burning was the biggest burn rate since Christmas 2024. The blockchain network also buys back its token, setting itself apart from the rest. Crypto analyst Tobias Reisner reported that Hyperliquid bought back $4M worth of tokens yesterday. This event introduced bullish sentiments among platform users and HYPE token holders, saving the altcoin from crashes. 3. Influencer Promotions & Whale Buying Activity A popular media influencer and live streamer, Adin Ross, and his 50,000 followers shilled the Hyeprliquid token and became the savior of the HYPE price performance. Not only this, but investors, especially the large whales, also invested big in the token due to its high resilience. One whale reportedly bought $950k worth of tokens while predicting a violent growth for the token. This buying pressure and high influence have stabilized HYPE’s market positions. “Sooner or later, it will break out of the range and go up violently.” This is a testament to the investors’ confidence in the altcoin. It also shows optimism about the token’s further price growth. HYPE Fair Price Comes At $72 Despite strong fundamentals and market demand, HYPE is not entirely volatility-immune. The Hyperliquid token often witnesses fluctuations but succeeds with rebounds. At present, it trades at $24.96 with $8.33B in market capitalization after an 8% surge within a day. However, a crypto investor, MetamateDaz, believes the fair value is $72. The crypto investor put together the average tech stock price to earning ratio and the total revenue, presenting the $72 outlook. The calculation comes as: $1.6B x 45 = $72B More importantly, MetamateDaz anticipates much higher targets, considering upcoming bullish events like the hyperEVM launch. Many experts believe this target is feasible, given its strong fundamentals and demand. However, considering its ATH target of $35.02, certain doubts exist. Key Things To Remember Hyperliquid is the 19th biggest crypto in the market and possesses strong fundamentals, which helps its native tokens’ performance. HYPE, which trades at $24.96, has maintained its momentum despite the recent crypto market crash . While most digital assets struggled, the HYPE price remained almost unaffected as it witnessed high trading volume, whale activities, and influencer promotions. Considering its revenue and other factors, the analyst believes its current price should have been higher. One’s calculation suggests the $72 mark, thrice the current price. Interestingly, this may happen if the strong fundamental and investor interest remains maintained. Overall, its strong revenue model and standout in the DeFi space saved this altcoin from the market’s turbulence.

Tariff Pause Sparks Market Rebound Concerns over possible tariffs on Canada and Mexico rattled the crypto market earlier this week. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum fell significantly; Ethereum dropped momentarily to around $2,360. Still, the temporary suspension of the tariffs by Trump offered a breather, which raised investor confidence in risk assets including cryptocurrency. In the wake of the announcement, Ethereum experienced a robust recovery, with a nearly 20% increase. Traders interpreted this as an invitation to re-enter the market, and ETH promptly reclaimed the $2,900 mark.

This most recent statement serves to emphasize their involvement and potential long-term dedication to blockchain technology.

The brief AI-generated clip, shared on Primal, a decentralized platform built on the Nostr protocol, features a Bitcoin bull MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor in a manner that has sparked a heated debate within the crypto community. Did @Jack post @Saylor/BTC transforming into XRP on Nostr??? pic.twitter.com/s7GS0K2VQQ — Mr. Intuitive (@BlackberryXRP) February 3, 2025 The Unexpected Transformation The four-second footage portrays Saylor, a staunch Bitcoin advocate, enveloped in visuals celebrating Bitcoin. Clad in symbolic armor, he symbolizes his unwavering support for the asset. However, an unexpected twist occurs—he leaps into the air, and upon descending, he morphs into an XRP emblem. This striking metamorphosis has sparked intense discussions about the video’s deeper meaning. Could it suggest an ideological shift? Or was it intended as satire? The ambiguity has fueled a flurry of interpretations from various corners of the digital asset sphere. Dorsey’s Intent: Subtle Endorsement or Mockery? Dorsey’s decision to keep the video live as of February 2 has amplified debates regarding its significance. While some within the XRP community view it as a possible indication of shifting perspectives toward the asset, skeptics argue it could be an indirect critique of Saylor rather than an endorsement of XRP. The timing of this post is also noteworthy. Recently, prominent crypto analyst Scott Melker suggested that a potential Trump administration could consider XRP for inclusion in a government-backed reserve system —an idea that challenges the long-held belief among Bitcoin maximalists that Bitcoin should be the sole asset in such a reserve. This backdrop of rising tensions between Bitcoin purists and XRP proponents only adds to the intrigue surrounding Dorsey’s post. Reactions From Crypto Figures and Analysts The video quickly caught the attention of influential voices in the digital currency space. A well-known XRP advocate, Mr. Intuitive, was among the first to highlight the clip, questioning whether Dorsey was insinuating a deeper narrative regarding XRP’s place in the crypto ecosystem. Similarly, Good Morning Crypto host Abdullah “Abs” Nassif scrutinized the post, wondering if it symbolized an evolving stance on digital assets beyond Bitcoin. However, not everyone interprets the clip as a positive signal for XRP. John Deaton, a seasoned legal expert and a vocal supporter of XRP in regulatory battles, cautioned against assuming that Dorsey was endorsing the asset. Instead, he proposed that the post might reflect a critique of Saylor rather than a review of XRP’s legitimacy. Deaton pointed out that Dorsey has historically dismissed other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, arguing that they are subject to centralized influence. He emphasized that Dorsey has remained firm in his belief that Bitcoin is the only truly decentralized asset, making it unlikely that he would suddenly pivot in favor of XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, Saylor himself has openly criticized XRP. In a previous interview, he explicitly stated that he would not recommend XRP as an investment, citing concerns over regulatory risks and suggesting that it functions more like a security than a decentralized currency. Mockery or Market Insight? The true meaning behind Dorsey’s post remains elusive. Some interpret it as a humorous dig at Saylor, insinuating that despite his Bitcoin evangelism , he may ultimately be no different from those who advocate for XRP. Others speculate that the post acknowledges XRP’s growing relevance, even if not outright supportively. Regardless of the intention, the video highlights the ongoing friction between Bitcoin loyalists and advocates of alternative digital assets. As the crypto market continues to evolve, and with regulatory and political factors influencing future developments, shifts in alliances and perspectives remain possible. For now, Dorsey has chosen silence, letting the community speculate on the meaning of his post. Whether this marks the beginning of a new crypto narrative or simply a playful jab at Saylor is yet to be determined.

The software company recorded a significant 23% rise in its stock price, with more upside expected as the demand for artificial intelligence solutions grows. Palantir Technologies is known for its data analysis software and growing AI capabilities and has been a mainstay in the production of operational software for AI applications since the technology appeared on the scene. This value provided by Palantir’s software technology led to an impressive 340% surge in its stock throughout 2024. The momentum has continued into 2025 as the company’s shares saw a significant increase of 23% after it forecasted a 2025 revenue of $3.75 billion, which is well above the predicted $3.54 billion by market analysts. Palantir setting up for a strong year in 2025 In a recent earnings report released by Palantir, the software company revealed that it had recorded a substantial increase in earnings. The company announced quarterly revenue reaching $828M, which indicates a 36% increase year over year. The company also reported adjusted earnings per share of 14 cents, surpassing analyst predictions of 11 cents. In the earnings report, the company highlighted its expected annual revenue for 2025 to reach $3.75 billion, which is significantly higher than the previously anticipated $3.5 billion. The optimistic forecast is driven by a 52% year-over-year increase in US market revenue. Alex Karp, Palantir’s chief executive officer, cites an “untamed organ growth” in demand for its artificial intelligence software as the reason for the bullish projections. As of the latest trading session, PLTR closed at $83.74, marking a 1.39% increase from the previous close. Palantir market outlook Palantir projected its US commercial sales in 2025 will rise about 54% to $1.08 billion. The company has also recently strengthened its connection with the US Defense Department, with sales to the department rising by 45% to $343 million. The US commercial revenue increased by 64% to $214 million at the end of December last year. Palantir also recently extended one of its deals with the US Army, which is expected to bring in as much as $619 million through 2028. The company has also extended its AI work with the US Special Operations Command. On a conference call after the results, Palantir’s CTO, Shyam Sankar, was asked about the potential effects of US President Donald Trump’s intention to cut the federal government’s budget as advised by the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). “Palantir’s real competition is a lack of accountability in government,” Sankar said. “DOGE (the Department of Government Efficiency) is going to bring meritocracy and transparency to government” and prompt it to function more like the commercial market. Karp, Palantir’s CEO, stated that the company is in a “new phase” and that the company must refrain from becoming complacent like other US companies failing to serve the nation’s interests. During the same conference call, Sankar stated that the AI race is “winner-take-all.” “It’s going to be a whole nation of effort that extends well beyond the DoD in order for us as a nation to win,” Shankar stated. Palantir’s statements infer its commitment to be a major contributor to the cause.

Despite the structure of the current market, they are buying a large quantity of not just 1INCH, but also Ethereum and Uniswap. It is now more uncertain than before what their trades mean for Ethereum and the future of decentralized exchanges, but it is probable that these trades are very profitable for the team and very beneficial for the market. Dormant Whales Return, Raising Sell-Off Fears Although 1inch is counting on Ethereum’s continued success, another big event on the blockchain has some worried that it might lead to lower prices. Two whale wallets that had been inactive for six years suddenly moved a massive 135,548 ETH to Bitfinex just eight hours before the recent price crash. These wallets initially converted their ETH to fiat currency on January 5, 2019, when the asset was priced at just $153.65 per token. At the time, their holdings were worth around $20.8 million. If they were to sell now, they would harvest a colossal $378.3 million profit on the trade—an absolutely monstrous 1,817% gain. The transfers’ timing is of the essence. When centralized exchanges receive big, unmistakable deposits, it’s often taken as a sign that a holder—or in this case, a group of holders—is about to hit the sell button. If the ETF’s mightiest proponents choose to use these shiny new tokens to make some decentralized finance (DeFi) moves, it’s probably not going to result in a market downturn. Conversely, if they choose to sell these tokens for currency on an exchange, that might well lead to the kind of decentralized finance hyperreality that results in a market downturn. Ethereum Spot ETF Outflows Add to Uncertainty Contributing to the negative sentiment, Ethereum spot ETFs experienced a net outflow of $45.51 million last week. In contrast, while Bitcoin’s spot ETFs have enjoyed very strong inflows, investment vehicles tracking Ethereum have had a hard time generating comparable interest. Overall, this situation is starting to crystallize a narrative as a sign of flagging institutional demand for ETH. Last week (January 27 to January 31, EST), Bitcoin spot ETF had a net inflow of $560 million, Blackrock Bitcoin ETF IBIT sees weekly net inflows of $751 million and Ethereum spot ETF had a net outflow of $45.51 million. https://t.co/Tvs2oCSxTg — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 3, 2025 What’s Next for Ethereum? At a crossroads, Ethereum’s price action reflects a market sentiment shaped by conflicting signals. One signal—the accumulation of ETH by smart traders like 1inch—hints at a price path that leads us up and away from the SEC. This is precisely the direction one would want ETH to go if one were both a holder and a supporter of Ethereum. But there’s another signal, one that suggests just the opposite path for ETH: the price has been relatively flat, and whale activity has been suspiciously dormant. Ethereum might see a strong recovery if it can stay above important support levels and bring in fresh institutional buying. But if pressure from sellers picks up, particularly from long-term holders who are cashing in after holding for what they expected to be the long term, we might see another drop. At present, investors and traders are fixated on whether Ethereum will finally break free from its pattern of unsuccessful rallies or if the ongoing cycle will continue to defy historical trends.

This coincided with the broader crypto market rebound after US President Donald Trump temporarily halted tariff threats on Canada and Mexico. Ether price recovery gained additional momentum when Eric Trump, the President’s son, tweeted to his 5.4 million followers: “It’s a great time to add $ETH. You can thank me later.” Although the controversial ending was later removed from his post, the statement added fuel to the crypto rally. ETH prices rose to $2,913 before settling at $2,700 at the time of writing. This rebound follows market stabilization after President Trump’s tariff negotiations strategy de-escalated tensions. World Liberty Financial’s Bold Moves Adding to the market buzz, the Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial (WLF) made a high-profile crypto transfer on February 3. Blockchain analytics firm Spot On Chain revealed that WLF moved $307.41 million worth of assets to Coinbase’s custody platform. Further moves by WLF included unstaking nearly 20,000 Lido Staked Ether (STETH) and converting it to Ether. The platform also purchased an additional 1,826 Ether for $5 million at an average price of $2,738. Analysts speculate that these funds might support WLF’s developing “Earn and Borrow” protocol, a lending service yet to launch fully. Ethereum Foundation’s Treasury Boost Meanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation recently allocated 50,000 Ether to bolster its treasury via staking rewards. According to core developer Eric Conner, staking rewards could sustain the foundation’s budget and alleviate selling pressure on the token, a key factor in previous market downturns. Additionally, Etherealize, a new institution-focused Ethereum marketing firm, launched on January 22. Its mission is to promote Ethereum’s strengths to Wall Street investors, potentially driving greater adoption and investment in the ecosystem. As ETH remains near $2,800, market participants are cautiously optimistic but wary of potential volatility. While Eric Trump’s remarks created waves of enthusiasm, ongoing negotiations and regulatory developments may continue influencing price movements.

Ripple (XRP) experienced a severe price decline at the start of the week, but some view this as a perfect “buy the dip” opportunity. Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped 22% weekly, with recent whale activity suggesting a further plunge. Another Deadline Extension Pi Network – the controversial cryptocurrency project that claims to allow people to mine digital assets directly on their smartphones – continues to trigger frustration across its community. Although it saw the light of day in 2019, its open mainnet and native token have yet to be launched. The team has previously maintained that major milestones like these depend on successful KYC verifications and migration to the mainnet. Users had until January 31 to complete the steps, but the deadline was recently moved to February 28. “The KYC and Mainnet migration deadlines for the Grace Period have been extended to February 28, 2025, ensuring Pioneers have additional time and opportunity to secure their Pi,” the developers explained. Constant delays and extensions have become a habit for Pi Network’s team, and unsurprisingly, some users have lost hope that they will ever see actual progress. Others have gone even further, describing the project as a scam. Meanwhile, the developers aim to launch the Open Network during the first quarter of the year . On that note, they made a disclaimer that the milestone might occur before or after the Grace Period ends. “Submit your KYC application and complete your Mainnet Checklist by February 28, 2025, to avoid any forfeiture,” they advised. XRP Forecasts Ripple’s native token is another highly intriguing topic in the cryptocurrency world. Its price experienced an impressive bull run in the last few months, rising from less than $0.55 at the start of November 2024 to almost a new all-time high of $3.39 in mid-January. However, February has not been so kind to XRP. Its valuation briefly tanked below $2 shortly after US President Donald Trump imposed hefty tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico. Some of the charges were later suspended , which resulted in a revival of the cryptocurrency market. XRP’s price climbed to almost $2.80 before retracing again to its current $2.50 (per CoinGecko’s data). XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Interestingly, the double-digit decline witnessed on February 3 did not scare some of the asset’s hardcore proponents. The analysts using the X monikers EGRAG CRYPTO and JackTheRippler are some examples. The former described the latest pullback as the perfect “buy the dip” opportunity, while the latter said they sold their house to increase their exposure to XRP. DOGE Price Outlook Last but not least , we will touch upon the leading meme coin, which also saw a substantial plunge at the start of the business week. Its price plummeted to $0.21 before reclaiming some ground to $0.26. The current level represents a whopping 22% decrease on a weekly scale, while some essential factors signal more pain for the bulls in the short term. DOGE Price, Source: CoinGecko According to Ali Martinez, whales sold 270 million DOGE in 24 hours, which could trigger downward pressure on the valuation. Additionally, the analyst noted that the meme coin experienced a bearish crossover between the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio and its 30-day Simple Moving Average, which indicates “a steep price correction ahead.” The post Recent Pi Network Updates, Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions, and More: Bits Recap Feb 4 appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|DOGEBTC|DOGEUSD|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Dogecoin|Pi Network (PI)|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|DOGE|MARKET|ASIA,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-02-04 09:38:16

At this point, Trump signed a decree yesterday to establish a new sovereign wealth fund. Although the details of the fund have not yet been finalized, Trump said in a statement, “It is time for this country to have a sovereign wealth fund. I think we will create one of the largest funds in the world in a short time.” While Trump has sparked discussions on whether cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) will be included in the sovereign wealth fund with this move, it came from US Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the names close to Trump. Lummis, who gave a hint that a decree regarding cryptocurrencies would be issued before Trump's official statement, this time made a similar post about the wealth fund. While it is unclear whether Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will be included, Lummis hinted that the US sovereign wealth fund could be used to purchase BTC. Lummis used the Bitcoin symbol instead of the letter B in his post on his X account and said, “This is a big ₿ deal.” This post by Lummis was interpreted as Bitcoin being included in the wealth fund. At this point, some experts reminded that the USA has approximately 200 thousand Bitcoins and stated that the Trump administration may aim to create one of the largest state funds in the world by using these Bitcoins.

With the rise of meme coins in the crypto world, the key is choosing those with unique stories, innovative mechanics, and engaging communities. Today, let’s dive into three of the most talked-about meme coins—Arctic Pablo Coin, Dogs, and Dogwifhat—and explore why they should be on your radar when considering Top Meme Coins to Invest in. Arctic Pablo Coin: A Magical Journey Through the Unknown When it comes to Top Meme Coins to Invest in, Arctic Pablo Coin takes the lead with a truly unique narrative and robust presale structure. Unlike typical meme coins, Arctic Pablo Coin offers a fascinating backstory of an adventurer, Arctic Pablo, journeying through icy terrains in search of hidden treasures. This theme, coupled with its promising presale, sets the stage for its bright future. Currently in its presale phase, Arctic Pablo Coin has raised over $870,000, with each stage tied to different mythical locations. Stage 8, known as “Shangri-La,” is where the journey is right now, with the coin priced at $0.000047, offering investors a current ROI of 16,936% as the coin progresses to its listing price of $0.008. But it’s not just the exciting story that makes Arctic Pablo Coin stand out—it’s the impressive staking opportunities. With a 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY), investors can stake their tokens and watch them grow as part of the journey. The more you stake, the greater the rewards, and this deflationary token model—through regular token burns of unsold coins—ensures scarcity and long-term sustainability. If you invest $600 in Arctic Pablo Coin, you’ll receive 12,765,570.00 $APCs. At the listing price of $0.008, that initial $600 could balloon to $102,124.56—a staggering return. The ongoing presale, with its increasing prices and deflationary model, creates a perfect storm for big returns, making Arctic Pablo Coin a standout among the Top Meme Coins to Invest. Dogs: A Volatile but Promising Meme Coin For those eyeing meme coins with a longer history in the market, Dogs (DOGS) is an interesting option. Priced at $0.000179 USD with a market cap of $92.34 million, DOGS has shown significant volatility. While it recently dropped by 29.21% in the last 24 hours, the trading volume surged by a massive 225.26%, indicating strong market interest despite recent price fluctuations. One of the highlights of DOGS is its all-time high, which reached $0.001644 in August 2024. While the price has since dropped by 89.13% from that peak, the coin’s performance remains uncertain, as the community sentiment is 82% bullish and 18% bearish. This means that DOGS has potential for price recovery, and with its current circulating supply of 516.75 billion DOGS, there’s ample room for growth as the market stabilizes. For those looking for a meme coin that’s already established in the market, DOGS is one to consider, especially if you’re willing to ride the volatility for a potential rebound. While it may not have the same storyline or presale excitement as Arctic Pablo Coin, it’s definitely worth keeping an eye on in the Top Meme Coins to Invest list, especially as the broader market dynamics evolve. Dogwifhat: Riding the Wave of the Solana Ecosystem Another strong contender in the Top Meme Coins to Invest category is Dogwifhat (WIF). This meme coin, currently ranked #88 on CoinMarketCap, has made waves due to its massive rise in trading volume—up by 214.18% in the past 24 hours, reaching $1.19 billion. The coin, which is part of the Solana ecosystem, has a market cap of $767.54 million, and it’s showing a significant increase from its all-time low of $0.00002344, rising by over 3.2 million percent. Despite a 23.58% drop in the last 24 hours, Dogwifhat remains a strong meme coin with a passionate following. Its current price of $0.7684 has made it an attractive option for investors looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. The coin’s performance reflects substantial community interest, and the significant trading volume shows that investors are actively engaging with it. Dogwifhat is especially appealing to those who are already involved in the Solana ecosystem, as it’s a token that benefits from the network’s speed and scalability. For those looking for a meme coin that’s backed by a solid blockchain, Dogwifhat has a lot of potential. As part of the Top Meme Coins to Invest portfolio, Dogwifhat presents a unique combination of strong market activity, a solid community, and massive growth potential. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, the top meme coins to invest in are Arctic Pablo Coin, DOGS, and Dogwifhat. It’s clear that each offers something unique for investors looking to make their mark in the meme coin space. Arctic Pablo Coin, with its engaging adventure theme, presale opportunities, and staking rewards, stands out as one of the Top Meme Coins to Invest in . The deflationary mechanism and the ability to grow your investment make it an exciting pick for those who are looking for long-term potential. On the other hand, DOGS and Dogwifhat provide opportunities within a volatile market but lack the innovative presale structure and reward systems of Arctic Pablo Coin, leaving the latter as the most exciting and promising option for savvy investors. If you’re ready to join the adventure, don’t miss out on Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale—this could be your ticket to big returns. Join now and stake your claim in this exciting journey! For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs What makes the Arctic Pablo Coin different from other meme coins? Arctic Pablo Coin offers a unique narrative and presale structure with increasing prices, staking rewards, and a deflationary model through token burns. Is DOGS a good investment right now? DOGS has shown volatility, but with strong market activity and a large community, it has the potential for recovery and growth in the future. Why should I invest in Dogwifhat? As part of the Solana ecosystem, Dogwifhat has massive growth potential, benefiting from fast transactions and a robust community, making it one of the Top Meme Coins to Invest.

CLS Global offers a study of the revolutionary changes taking place in market microstructure and their consequences for market players, drawing on its vast expertise as a global market maker. Market Structure Evolution: Beyond Simple Regulation The current transformation extends far beyond routine regulatory changes. CLS Global recently reached an important milestone by concluding its regulatory matters through a settlement agreement with U.S. authorities. Throughout this process, the company demonstrated its commitment to regulatory compliance by proactively engaging with the SEC and other authorities, implementing enhanced compliance measures, and optimizing its service geography to ensure full alignment with applicable regulations. The market for digital assets is undergoing a fundamental restructuring of how liquidity is provided and risk is managed as U.S. regulators move forward toward clearer frameworks for digital asset trading. With regulators, industry participants are showing increasing maturity in the sense of regulatory compliance and have taken it upon themselves to engage with authorities in the formation of viable operational frameworks. Traditional markets are undergoing changes in techniques due to increased competition with DeFi protocols for centralized trading venues. Liquidity providers in this hybrid market structure face particular challenges posed by new trading venues that merge DeFi with CeFi and the growing institutional demand for cross-venue liquidity aggregation. The Real Impact of Institutional Entry While many focus on headline-grabbing price movements, the more significant story is how institutional traders are reshaping market microstructure. CLS Global’s market analysts point out that traditional finance players are demanding infrastructure that more closely resembles traditional markets – including prime brokerage services, credit networks, and sophisticated execution algorithms. The recent bitcoin price movements above $106,000 are less important than the underlying changes in how these trades are being executed, with institutional traders increasingly using algorithmic execution and smart order routing across multiple venues. Technical Challenges and Market-Making Evolution Despite progress, significant technical challenges remain. “The industry’s next phase will be defined by how effectively we bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems,” explains CLS Global’s CEO, Filipp V. “Market makers who can successfully navigate both environments while maintaining robust compliance standards will shape the future of digital asset trading.” The changing landscape requires a fundamental rethink of market-making strategies, incorporating: Cross-venue inventory management Dynamic risk pricing across multiple blockchain networks Integration of on-chain and off-chain liquidity sources Real-time adaptation to varying settlement finality conditions Looking Forward As U.S. regulatory frameworks continue to evolve, the industry stands at the threshold of even more fundamental changes. Market makers will need to adapt to new forms of automated market making that combine traditional and DeFi approaches, enhanced settlement mechanisms, and more sophisticated cross-chain liquidity provision protocols. CLS Global continues to analyze these market structure changes while developing more sophisticated trading strategies. The future of digital asset trading will likely be shaped by those who can successfully navigate both the technical and financial complexities of this evolving landscape.

Meanwhile, Hyperliquid surpassed Ethereum in weekly protocol revenue, while Ethereum validators approved a gas limit increase to boost network capacity ahead of the upcoming Pectra fork. While supporters see this as a step toward scalability, there are still some concerns over potential network instability. Trumps Help ETH Shake Off Losses Ethereum (ETH) recently rebounded past $2,900 after US President Donald Trump’s decision to halt his proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico. The announcement came after a huge downturn in the crypto market, where ETH plunged by close to 16% in an hour to a local low of $2,368 on Feb. 2. This drop was likely due to the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs. By Feb. 3, ETH already recovered to $2,700 before Eric Trump took to social media and told his millions of followers that it was “a great time to add ETH.” Initially, his post also included the phrase “you can thank me later,” but he later edited it to remove those words. The market responded very positively to this, and ETH ended up climbing $2,913 before slightly pulling back to $2,718. The timing of Eric Trump’s endorsement also coincided with a large crypto transaction from World Liberty Financial (WLF), which is the digital asset firm linked to the Trump family. ETH’s price action over the past 7 days (Source: CoinMarketCap ) According to blockchain analytics firm Spot On Chain, WLF transferred more than $307 million worth of assets to Coinbase’s custody platform on Feb. 3. Additionally, WLF unstaked almost 20,000 Lido Staked Ether (stETH) into regular ETH and spent $5 million worth of USD Coin (USDC) to buy 1,826 ETH at a price of $2,738. Analysts speculate that these funds could be used to support WLF’s “Earn and Borrow” lending protocol, which is still in its early stages of development. The rebound in ETH’s price also also happened during the broader movements in the Ethereum ecosystem. In January, the Ethereum Foundation revealed an initiative that will further strengthen the network’s decentralized finance infrastructure. The foundation allocated 50,000 ETH to its treasury, which could be used for staking rewards. According to Ethereum core developer Eric Conner , these staking rewards could help sustain the foundation’s operational costs while reducing some of the selling pressure that has contributed to ETH’s relatively subdued price action this cycle. The Ethereum ecosystem also launched Etherealize, which is a marketing firm that is focused on promoting Ethereum’s institutional adoption. The firm launched on Jan. 22, and is working to present Ethereum’s investment case to Wall Street to attract more institutional interest in the network. Hyperliquid Surpasses Ethereum in Weekly Revenue After ETH’s recent downturn, Hyperliquid overtook Ethereum in seven-day protocol revenues. According to data from DefiLlama , Hyperliquid generated approximately $12.8 million in protocol revenues over the past week ending on Feb. 3, surpassing Ethereum’s $11.5 million. This shift proves that Hyperliquid is picking up momentum in the perpetual futures trading space, but it also means that Ethereum is facing challenges when it comes to competing with newer blockchains that offer faster transaction settlements and lower fees. Hyperliquid ahead of Ethereum on 7-day revenue on Feb.3 (Source: DeFiLlama ) Perpetual futures allow traders to buy or sell an asset at a future date without an expiration, and this feature has driven Hyperliquid’s rising transaction volumes . The network now processes close to $470 million per day in transactions, which is almost double its daily volume since the beginning of the year. Despite this impressive growth, Ethereum still has a much higher daily transaction volume, standing at around $4.7 billion as of Feb. 3. However, Ethereum’s protocol revenue suffered a decline in 2024 after the March Dencun upgrade. This is due to the fact that the upgrade reduced transaction fees by about 95%. Lower fees have led to a revenue shortfall, as there hasn’t been enough volume to offset the decline. Interestingly, some other Layer-1 blockchains also gained ground on Ethereum in different areas. Solana surpassed Ethereum in 24-hour decentralized exchange trading volume, driven largely by its meme coin activity. On Feb. 3, Solana’s daily transaction volume stood at about $8.9 billion, which was more than double Ethereum’s $4 billion. Hyperliquid’s recent rise is also evident in the success of its flagship perps exchange, which captured 70% of the market share. This allowed it to surpass competitors like GMX and dYdX. The exchange offers an experience very similar to centralized platforms, with fast settlements and low fees, although it is less decentralized than some of its counterparts. The network also gained impressive value after the launch of its native token, HYPE, which was distributed in a November airdrop. HYPE’s impressive December performance (Source: VanEck ) Despite its financial success, Hyperliquid still faces some key challenges. Its smart contract platform has not attracted a sizable developer community yet, and it is a crucial component for long-term growth. However, the network plans to introduce an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible smart contract platform in 2025, which VanEck believes is essential for sustaining Hyperliquid’s revenue growth and justifying HYPE’s high valuation. VanEck also warned that if Hyperliquid does not meet the expectations of its investors, the enthusiasm around HYPE could unravel quickly. Ethereum Validators Approve of Gas Limit Increase More than half of Ethereum validators signaled their support for raising the network’s gas limit, which is a big step toward increasing transaction capacity on the blockchain. According to Gaslimit.pics , 52% of validators backed the proposal as of Feb. 4, surpassing the required threshold of at least 50%. The decision allows the network to scale without requiring a hard fork, as validators can adjust their node configurations to support the higher limit. (Source: Gaslimit.pics ) Ethereum’s average gas limit stayed around 30 million since August of 2024 after an increase from 15 million. Data from Blockscout indicates the gas limit is already rising , with a transaction recorded at around 3 a.m. UTC showing a gas limit of more than 33 million. This is the first time since Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake after the Merge upgrade in September of 2022. Evan Van Ness pointed out that the shift to proof-of-stake required more time to coordinate changes due to its decentralized nature. After the successful vote, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is pushing for the Pectra fork, which is expected to launch in March. Pectra will raise the blob target from three to six and will be subject to a similar staker-voted mechanism as the gas limit. Buterin stated that this approach ensures the network can scale in response to technological improvements without waiting for hard forks. The decision to increase the gas limit also caused some debate in the Ethereum community. Supporters argue that raising the limit to 36 million will boost network capacity and encourage more innovation. Ethereum researcher Justin Drake previously shared his support for this adjustment, and configured his validator for a 36 million gas limit in December 2023. Advocates Eric Connor and Mariano Conti also launched the Pump The Gas website in March to push for an increase to 40 million to help lower transaction fees. Opponents, however, warn that excessively raising the gas limit could jeopardize network stability. Ethereum Foundation researcher Toni Wahrstätter warned that a jump to 60 million gas per block could lead to propagation failures, missed validator slots, and other disruptions. The Pump The Gas website also acknowledged these risks, and mentioned that if the limit is set too high, it could become difficult for solo node operators to validate and download the chain.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FORKS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-04 09:57:54

These assets have demonstrated significant price movements driven by investor sentiment, utility improvements, and market trends. With #PEPETO’s innovative technology, SHIB’s expanding ecosystem, and DOGE’s persistent community support, these tokens could offer substantial returns for traders and investors. PEPETO: A Fast and Efficient Cross-Chain Solution #PEPETO is transforming blockchain transactions with its 30-second transfer technology, offering traders a seamless experience. Unlike traditional bridges that take up to 15 minutes, PEPETO’s parallel processing enables near-instant transactions. This speed enhances efficiency and reduces delays, making it a valuable tool for active traders. A New Year’s Message from the God of Frogs As the New Year begins, the God of Frogs, Pepeto Himself, shares a message of triumph and faith for the loyal Pepeto Army: The Plan Unfolds: The roadmap progresses flawlessly, as foretold. Every milestone has been achieved, and the… pic.twitter.com/zCmy1bTRQY — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 1, 2025 The network relies on 100 validators, with 67 required to confirm each transfer, ensuring both security and speed. Each transaction costs $5, with fees contributing to staking rewards, creating a sustainable system. This structure incentivizes long-term holders, providing consistent returns based on bridge usage. With over 21 trillion tokens staked and a presale of $4 million, market confidence in PEPETO continues to rise. High staking rewards, supported by actual transaction fees, attract more users to the ecosystem. As more blockchains integrate with #PEPETO, its value proposition strengthens, increasing demand and potential price growth. SHIB: Expanding Utility and Community Growth SHIB started out as a token that was regarded as a meme but has since developed into a platform with tangible practical uses for blockchain applications. The Layer-2 blockchain Shibarium has introduced improvements in transaction efficiency together with decreased cost charges. These technological advancements enable SHIB to be used in everyday transactions thereby growing its market adoption. ShibaSwap constitutes a major part of the token ecosystem along with the decentralized exchange and the expanding NFT marketplace that extends its utility beyond monetary speculation. The introduction of various platforms within its ecosystem stabilizes the SHIB value while also drawing developers and investors to the token. SHIB stands out from traditional meme coins through its expanded practical usage. The cryptocurrency continues to attract strong investor interest because major trading platforms provide SHIB listings, and strategic partnerships boost the adoption rate. Ongoing demand for SHIB stems from its active community, which fights toward development and growth. SHIB’s utility growth, along with its developmental progress, creates substantial opportunities for price growth. DOGE: Strong Community and Market Influence The meme coin DOGE stands as the prevailing leader through famous admirers and universal popularity recognition. DOGE maintains growing adoption as a payment option because different businesses now accept it for transactions. Multiple elements work together to keep DOGE relevant both in the market and with an extended lifespan. The cryptocurrency maintains a strong market position despite previous price swings. It attracts investors because of its high liquidity rate and significant trading activity volumes. The continuous backing of its community continues to uphold consumer demand, which protects against market value decreases. As cryptocurrency adoption increases, DOGE’s appeal as a transactional asset grows. Market trends and external endorsements continue to influence its price movements. With sustained interest and real-world use cases, DOGE remains a potential candidate for future gains. Conclusion #PEPETO, SHIB, and DOGE offer distinct advantages that could lead to significant price appreciation. PEPETO ’s technological edge, SHIB’s expanding ecosystem, and DOGE’s strong community support position them as valuable investments. As adoption increases, these assets present opportunities for substantial returns in the evolving crypto market.

With its record-breaking presale raising $1 million in minutes, it has captured the attention of both experienced and new investors. Analysts agree: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has firmly established itself as a standout token, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) in their early days. How THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Outshines Its Rivals Ethereum (ETH): As a leader in DeFi, ETH remains strong but lacks the explosive appeal of this newly dominant token. Polygon (MATIC): While MATIC focuses on scaling Ethereum, it hasn’t achieved the same market enthusiasm or record-breaking performance. TRON (TRX): Known for its content-sharing applications, TRX’s growth has been steady but cannot compare to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s transformative impact. Arbitrum (ARB): Though a promising Layer-2 solution, ARB doesn’t command the same attention or investor trust. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is Ahead of the Pack 1. Unmatched Presale Success Few cryptocurrencies can claim the level of demand seen by THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . The presale’s $1 million milestone within minutes is a testament to its strong market position and widespread investor confidence. 2. Scarcity Drives Demand With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN ensures sustained demand through its deflationary model. Unlike ETH or MATIC, which face high token circulation, this scarcity gives investors a tangible advantage. 3. Exclusive Market Access Available only at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM , this token’s exclusivity gives early adopters an edge that other widely available cryptos like TRX and ARB can’t replicate. This controlled distribution solidifies its reputation as the go-to investment for those seeking proven opportunities. Are You In? THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven itself as the standout crypto of 2025, setting a new benchmark in the market with its record-breaking presale. Its limited supply, exclusivity, and overwhelming demand position it as the go-to choice for investors.

The altcoins followed suit with similar massive price moves, but most are well in the green on a daily scale now. BTC’s Down and Up The primary cryptocurrency jumped hours after the US Federal Reserve left the interest rates unchanged last week and headed beyond $106,000. It peaked at that line on Thursday and Friday but lost some steam on Saturday. The landscape worsened during the weekend as US President Trump signed orders to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. As these developments unfolded, BTC reacted with a price drop from $102,000 to $97,000 on Sunday. However, the real shocker transpired on Monday morning when the cryptocurrency plunged to $91,300 (on most exchanges), thus losing over ten grand within 24 hours. It bounced off rather quickly and returned to $96,000 during the afternoon but went on the offensive hard in the evening. In fact, it spiked above $102,000 (another $10,000 move within a 12-hour period) after Mexico and the US paused the tariffs for a month. Since then, though, BTC has started to lose value again and now sits below $99,000. Its market cap has returned to $1.950 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is up to 58.5% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Back in Green The alternative coins went through an even more painful correction yesterday, with massive double-digit losses. Most have managed to recover some ground, as ETH is up to $2,700 after a 6% increase, while XRP, which tumbled below $2 at one point, stands at $2.5 now. Solana, Dogecoin, Chainlink, Cardano, Avalanche, Stellar, Sui, HBAR, and Shiba Inu are also with notable increases over the past 24 hours. In contrast, TON is down by another 3.5%, while TRUMP has plunged by 6% in the past day and by over 40% weekly. The total crypto market cap has recovered $250 billion since yesterday’s low and is up to $3.350 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

A rising star called #PEPETO takes centre stage with more than $4 million raised in its presale phase. The project sets itself apart through its well-built ecosystem next to its compelling story and smart token design. These factors make # PEPETO a top pick for crypto buyers in 2025. PEPETO: The Next Big Memecoin? Pepeto stands out in crypto markets through tested tech with loyal fans. The token shows value in meme coins by actual blockchain uses. The platform connects chains with fee-free trades or direct paths for new projects. A Pepeto token costs $0.000000108 as the presale crosses $4 million. The sales show investor confidence because experts expect better outcomes than Shib or #Pepe in 2025. https://twitter.com/Pepetocoin/status/1874260504891240897 The story of Pepeto (the Frog God) draws people who seek fun and real benefits. The token expands on previous work but includes technical elements that help it grow, stay secure and run clearly. SHIB’s Market Struggles and Road to Recovery Shiba Inu (SHIB), a notable memecoin , showed major price changes. The token’s price fell by over 8% to $0.00001748 with a market cap of $10.28 billion. The burn process for SHIB gained speed as users removed more than 31 million tokens in a day ‒ an increase of 847%. However, the burn method does not fix all price issues. A large token supply blocks SHIB from rising in value. The Shibarium Layer-2 blockchain and new features show some potential, yet investors are seeking other options like #PEPETO for faster returns. Why PEPETO Could Outshine SHIB The supply structure of PEPETO sets it apart from SHIB. SHIB has problems with too many tokens in circulation, but PEPETO is managing its supply better. A 30% portion goes to presale to create a fair start. Another 30% supports staking rewards or motivates holders to keep tokens. Marketing takes up 20% to help spread the word. Development gets 7.5% for updates next to liquidity’s 12.5% portion that helps trades run well. PEPETO links different blockchains through its bridge to make transfers quick and simple. The system charges no fees for trades or offers better value than SHIB – a token many users find too costly to trade with. The Future of Meme Coins: PEPETO Leads the Way The competition among memecoins to become the top choice for retail traders in 2025 grows more intense. SHIB brings a large community and a record of fast price gains but PEPETO attracts investors with its presale results or ecosystem features. A chance exists for people who seek to multiply small investments. PEPETO stands out because of its story appeal, which is next to blockchain capabilities, and its token structure, surpassing other coins. The presale nears $5 million as #PEPETO gains speed. SHIB works to recover its position, but PEPETO moves up without pause. Conclusion The cryptocurrency scene changes as SHIB holds its place, but #PEPETO shows better investment value. A successful presale, blockchain benefits, and smart token distribution make this coin appeal to people who want profitable altcoins. The memecoin market continues to grow as PEPETO leads the way to set new standards for #Pepe coins. The market interest rises daily, so investors searching for good crypto purchases in 2025 should watch #PEPETO before the price goes up.

As a result, Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded to reclaim the $100,000 level, with the flagship cryptocurrency trading at $100,360, up nearly 7% over the past 24 hours. However, it still has not reached pre-weekend levels. Other cryptocurrencies rebounded as well, with Ethereum (ETH) up nearly 13% and trading around $2,800. Buyers will look to continue its upward trajectory and reclaim $3,000. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is up over 22%, trading around $2.70. Solana (SOL) has reclaimed $200 and is up over 10%, trading at $214. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR), Toncoin (TON), Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial gains. Markets Rebound As Tariffs Put On Hold The crypto market rebounded after President Donald Trump agreed to pause proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico as negotiations continued. The pause was announced by Canadian President Justin Trudeau, who said that after a phone call with Trump, the tariffs would be paused for 30 days as the two countries negotiate and continue to work together. Trudeau added that Canada would implement a $1.3 billion border plan that includes appointing a Fentanyl czar, listing cartels as terrorists, and reinforcing the US-Canada border with helicopters and more personnel. “I just had a good call with President Trump. Canada is implementing our $1.3 billion border plan, reinforcing the border with new choppers, technology, and personnel, enhancing coordination with our American partners, and increasing resources to stop the flow of fentanyl. Nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and will be working on protecting the border.” Tariffs against Mexico have also been paused for a month after President Claudia Sheinbaum announced the two leaders had reached a series of agreements. She also promised to reinforce the land border shared by both countries. “Our teams will begin working today on two fronts: security and trade. They are pausing tariffs for one month from now.” Trump signed an executive order on February 1 imposing 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico while slapping a 10% duty on China. China is also willing to negotiate with the country’s initial proposal involving the restoration of the Phase 1 trade deal signed during Trump’s first term, which requires Beijing to increase the purchase of US exports by $200 billion over two years. MicroStrategy Pauses Bitcoin Buying Streak MicroStrategy has paused its Bitcoin (BTC) purchases after announcing it will hold $30 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. The firm holds 471,107 BTC and is the largest public BTC holder. Michael Saylor announced the decision. Saylor stated the company did not sell stock shares between January 27 and February 2. The decision comes only a week after MicroStrategy purchased over $10,000 BTC worth over $1 billion. “Last week, MicroStrategy did not sell any shares of Class A common stock under its at-the-market equity offering program and did not purchase any BTC. As of 2/2/2025, we hold 471,107 BTC acquired for $30.4 billion.” The decision marks the end of 12 consecutive weeks of BTC purchases that began shortly before the US elections of November 2024. The firm started accumulating crypto in August 2020, with a 21,454 BTC purchase for $250 million. BTC dipped below $100,000 this weekend as markets reacted to US President Donald Trump imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on the European Union. Several companies have followed MicroStrategy’s lead and purchased BTC as a hedge against inflation. Healthcare firm Semler Scientific and streaming platform Rumble have announced BTC purchases in the past 60 days, while crypto mining company MARA holds 44,394 BTC. Crypto Czar David Sacks To Discuss US Crypto Leadership Plan David Sacks, the White House crypto and AI czar, will hold a press conference to outline the US strategy for digital assets. Sacks will be joined by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman (R-Ark.), House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill (R-Ark.), and House Agriculture Committee Chairman G.T. Thompson (R-Pa.). The press conference will focus on how the Trump administration and Congress plan to make the US a leader in the crypto sector. Sacks will discuss the White House’s strategic approach to digital assets, which may include regulatory policies, innovation incentives, and national security considerations. The press conference comes at a time when discussions around digital asset regulation and its impact on the financial market. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded to reclaim $100,000 on Monday after plunging below $92,000 following Donald Trump’s announcement of Tariffs on Canada and Mexico. However, the leaders reached an agreement to pause tariffs for 30 days, leading to a quick rebound. The rebound occurred as institutional investors bought the dip around the $91,000-$92,000 mark. The flagship cryptocurrency is up nearly 6% but has slipped below $100,000 and is currently trading around $99,500. BTC faced considerable selling pressure over the weekend thanks to growing trade war concerns, triggering a wave of sell orders and pushing BTC into a steep decline. As a result, BTC plummeted to an intraday low of $91,274 on Monday before institutional investors chipped in, preventing a further decline and helping BTC reclaim $100,000. Analysts have suggested a prolonged trade war could be beneficial for BTC because protectionist policies lead to heightened global economic uncertainty, forcing investors to seek alternative assets. Jack Toledano, CEO of Unity Wallet, highlighted the influence of Trump over crypto, stating, “It’s remarkable the difference a day can make in the crypto world. What we have seen over the weekend is how, with one hand, Trump can make crypto leap to new highs, and with the other, he can wave his magic tariff wand and wipe out all the gains in both the crypto and equity markets.” However, he attributed the current downturn to factors like technological and macroeconomic disruptions due to the AI arms race hotting up. “Although the Trump factor is certainly at play, the recent downturn in Bitcoin’s value and the broader decline across global equity markets can also be attributed to technological disruptions, particularly as the AI arms race becomes red-hot following the introduction of DeepSeek.” BTC struggled to build on Monday’s dramatic recovery, dropping after coming across resistance around $102,000. As a result, the price stalled before falling back into the red during the ongoing session. BTC has faced considerable volatility over the past week, starting with a drop to an intraday low of $98,360 last Monday before settling at $102,064. BTC continued to drop on Tuesday, falling 0.69% to $101,362. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as BTC rose over 2% and settled at $103,663. The price surged to an intraday high of $106,296 on Thursday before losing momentum and settling at $104,553. Sentiment changed on Friday after BTC failed to move past $107,000. As a result, the price dropped nearly 2% and settled at $102,616. Source: TradingView BTC slipped below the 20-day SMA on Saturday as it declined 1.54% and settled at $101,041. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC dropped below $100,000 and the 50-day SMA and settled at $97,881. Markets collapsed on Monday as Donald Trump confirmed tariffs on Canada and Mexico. As a result, BTC plunged to an intraday low of $91,274. However, institutional investors entered the fray and purchased BTC. As a result, BTC recovered and reclaimed $100,000, ultimately settling at $101,579, capping a volatile day with an increase of nearly 4%. BTC is back in the red during the ongoing session, down just over 2% and trading below $100,000 at $99,500. Data from Coinglass suggests BTC has strong support at $90,000, where buyers have concentrated $1.8 billion in leverage. However, buyers will look to keep BTC above the 50-day SMA and attempt to reclaim $100,000 during the ongoing session. If BTC continues its decline, it could drop to $95,000 or $90,000. The RSI is currently at 47, just below the neutral zone. While the markets recovered on Monday, the MACD is still bearish, indicating we could see a price drop. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis On Sunday, Ethereum (ETH) plummeted over 20% in a matter of hours as market-wide panic took hold. The selloff was fueled by growing fears of a trade war, sending shockwaves across global markets and causing ETH and other cryptocurrencies to drop significantly. ETH, already struggling to reclaim key levels, registered a sharp decline, dealing a blow to investor confidence. According to analysts ETH must hold the crucial $2,700 level to prevent a deeper correction. A break below this level could lead to an extended bearish phase and delay chances of a recovery. ETH has declined nearly 40% since Friday, making it one of the steepest declines in recent years. ETH dropped below the 20-day SMA last weekend and fell to an intraday low of $3,020 on Monday before recovering to settle at $3,183. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ETH dropped 3.34% to $3,077. ETH remained above $3,000 as buyers returned to the market on Wednesday. As a result, the price rose .20% to $3,114. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH rose over 4% and settled at $3,248. The price rallied to an intraday high of $3,442 on Friday, briefly moving past key moving averages. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and ultimately settled at $3,300, up 1.60%. Source: TradingView Sentiment changed over the weekend as ETH dropped over 5.50% on Saturday and dropped to $3,118. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price slipped below the 200-day SMA and $3,000 to settle at $2,860. ETH plummeted to an intraday low of $2,160 on Monday as markets tanked. However, it recovered from this level to recoup losses and register a marginal increase to settle at $2,882. However, ETH is back in the red during the ongoing session, down over 6% and trading just above $2,700. If sellers retain control, ETH could drop below $2,500. Buyers must keep ETH above $2,600-$2,700 to prevent an even deeper downtrend. The MACD and RSI are flashing bearish, indicating ETH could see a significant downtrend unless sentiment changes. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL)’s struggles continue as the crypto market drops yet again, with most altcoins in the red over the past hour. SOL recovered on Wednesday after starting the previous week on a bearish note, dropping to an intraday low of $220 on Monday. The price continued to drop on Tuesday, falling to $226 after a drop of 3.45%. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising marginally to stay above the 20-day SMA. Thursday saw SOL rise over 4%, and it moved to $238. However, bearish sentiment took over on Friday as the price fell nearly 3% and settled at $231. Source: TradingView SOL fell below the 20-day SMA on Saturday after plummeting over 8% and settled at $213. Bearish sentiment persisted on Sunday as the price went below the 50-day SMA, dropping to an intraday low of $192 before recovering to settle at $203. SOL plunged to an intraday low of $176 on Monday as the market crashed. However, it rebounded from this level to register an increase of 6.42% and settle at $216. The current session sees SOL down nearly 6% as buyers struggle to keep it above $200. If SOL slips below $200, the price could drop to $180. On the other hand, buyers will look to retake control and push SOL back above the 50-day SMA. Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis Chainlink (LINK) fell sharply over the weekend as its recovery stalled thanks to macroeconomic conditions. LINK dipped below the 20 and 50-day SMAs on Tuesday after a drop of nearly 7% and settled at $22.61. Despite the strong bearish sentiment, LINK recovered on Wednesday, rising by 4.58% to move past the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settled at $23.65. Buyers retained control on Thursday, and LINK rose 3.38% and settled at $24.45. LINK rose to an intraday high of $26.39 on Friday before settling at $25.16, an increase of nearly 3%. Source: TradingView Sentiment changed over the weekend as LINK dropped nearly 9% to slip below the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settle at $22.97. Bearish sentiment intensified as LINK fell almost 11% to an intraday low of $19.32 before recovering to reclaim $20 and settling at $20.46. LINK plunged to an intraday low of $15.56 on Monday as markets took a bearish turn. LINK recovered from this level to reclaim $20 and settle at $21.67, registering an increase of nearly 6%. The current session sees LINK back in the red, down over 9% and trading at $19.67. Buyers must reclaim $20 to prevent a further decline. However, LINK could drop towards the 200-day SMA if sellers retain control. The MACD is bearish, indicating LINK could see a further downtrend. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) Price Analysis Near Protocol (NEAR) has traded in a downward trajectory since mid-January, slipping below key support levels and moving averages. The price fell to an intraday low of $4.36 on Monday and fell to $4.28 on Tuesday after registering a drop of 7.54%. NEAR recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% and moving to $4.41. Bulls retained control on Thursday as NEAR registered an increase of 4.44% and settled at $4.60. Friday saw only a marginal increase as the 20-day SMA, acting as a dynamic resistance, came into play. Source: TradingView NEAR turned bearish on Saturday, dropping nearly 8% to $4.25. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday as NEAR fell almost 12% to an intraday low of $3.51 before recovering to settle at $3.75. Monday saw NEAR collapse as it fell to an intraday low of $2.74 thanks to a marketwide collapse. However, the price recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $3.77. NEAR is back in the red during the current session, with the price down over 12%. Filecoin (FIL) Price Analysis Filecoin (FIL) has declined substantially since the weekend, slipping below $4. Sellers remain in control and aim to push the price below $3. FIL started the previous week in the red, dropping to an intraday low of $4.34 on Monday before settling at $4.65. The price continued to drop on Tuesday as FIL fell nearly 6% slipping below the 200-day SMA and settling at $4.38. FIL recovered on Wednesday, increasing almost 3% and settling at $4.51. FIL crossed the 200-day SMA on Thursday, rising nearly 7% and settling at $4.80. However, buyers lost momentum on Friday, and FIL registered a marginal decline. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Saturday as the price slipped below the 200-day SMA, falling over 9% to $4.36. Sellers retained control on Sunday as FIL dropped nearly 18% to $4.36. Monday’s marketwide collapse dragged FIL to an intraday low of $2.60. However, it recouped some losses, recovering to reclaim $3 and settle at $3.50, down 2.42%. The current session sees the price down by nearly 10% and trading around $3.15. Sellers will look to drive the price below $3. If this level is breached it could lead to a deeper correction, and the price could drop to $2.50. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis Arbitrum (ARB) fell below $0.50 over the weekend as markets struggled to recover after Monday’s dramatic collapse. ARB dipped below the 200-day SMA on Monday as it fell to an intraday low of $0.604 before recovering and settling at $0.643, down nearly 5%. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price dropped to $0.592 going below the $0.60 support level. However, buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as ARB rose 2.24% to reclaim $0.60 and settle at $0.606. ARB continued to push higher on Thursday, increasing nearly 4% and settling at $0.630. ARB rose to an intraday high of $0.674 on Friday as buyers attempted to move past the 200-day SMA. However, it lost momentum at this level, ultimately rising 1.75% and settling at $0.641. Source: TradingView Markets turned bearish on Saturday, and ARB plummeted nearly 10%, slipping below $0.60 and settling at $0.578. Selling pressure intensified on Sunday as ARB dropped almost 15% to $0.493. With the broader markets collapsing on Monday, ARB fell to an intraday low of $0.380. It recovered from this level to register an increase of 3.54% and settle at $0.511. ARB is down over 10% and trading at $0.457. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Prominent US senators, like Ron Wyden, Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren, have expressed strong opposition to the treasury department’s action. Some senior Democratic senators are preparing to bring in a law to restrict DOGE’s access to the US public data framework. Here is everything you should know. AFL-CIO Sues Treasury Over Data Sharing The American Federation of Labour and Congress of Industrial Organisations has filed a lawsuit against Scott Bessent, the secretary of the US Treasury Department. The most prominent federation of unions has accused the US Treasury of sharing US citizens’ personal data, including Social Security numbers and bank information, with the US Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk. What Is D.O.G.E and Why Is Musk Involved? The executive order announcing the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency was one of the prominent orders that Trump signed in his initial days of his second term as the President. It was in November, 2024, that Trump initially introduced the concept. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy were supposed to lead DOGE jointly, but the latter chose not to take up the position, citing political reasons. DOGE was presented in the early stage as an external committee to provide recommendations to slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies. In contrast, according to the Executive Order, DOGE will be an internal committee and will help the President implement his DOGE agenda by modernising federal technology and software to maximise governmental efficiency and productivity. Notably, in the EO, there is no mention of how the department contributes to cutting federal spending. Alarming Claims About DOGE’s Data Access Ronald Lee Wyden, an US senator and a Democratic Party leader, has alleged that the newly created US Department of Government Efficiency has complete access to the country’s payment framework, which handles sensitive data, such as Social Security numbers and bank information. Political Backlash from Top Democrats against Musk’s DOGE Senior Democratic senators, Charles Ellis Schumer and Elizabeth Ann Warren, have strongly criticised the action of the US Treasury, calling DOGE’s unrestricted access to US citizens’ personal data a serious threat to privacy. Reports suggest that Schmer is preparing to introduce a legislation, demanding the introduction of a provision to limit the control of DOGE over the US treasury and the US public data. As the lawsuit unfolds, questions about privacy, government oversight, and Elon Musk’s influence over federal operations continue to grow.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|DOGE|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-04 10:03:09

Stricter oversight may slow investigations but aims to prevent regulatory overreach. Leadership shift signals a potential shift toward a more industry-friendly SEC. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has implemented a significant procedural change that alters how enforcement investigations are initiated. Previously, enforcement staff had the authority to issue subpoenas and launch formal investigations without direct oversight from the Commission. However, under the new policy, lawyers at the SEC must now obtain approval from the politically appointed leadership before initiating formal probes. This shift marks a departure from previous enforcement practices and could reshape regulatory actions in the financial sector. Huge change at SEC. Gensler's harassment campaign only worked because crypto companies felt obligated to respond to ""requests for information"" since refusal meant a subpoena. Now no subpoenas without a vote by Commissioners who are majority opposed to regulation by enforcement. https://t.co/oohyMwlHPs — Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) February … The post SEC Tightens Reins on Enforcement: A Shift Towards Political Control? appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|Market News|News|Crypto Policy|Crypto Regulation|SEC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-02-04 11:30:00

However, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is emerging as a potential game-changer, with analysts predicting a breakout of up to 50,000%. What Makes THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stand Out? 1. Limited Supply for Maximum Value: With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN leverages a deflationary model to ensure scarcity and drive demand. This gives it a major edge over tokens like Solana (SOL) and Kaspa (KAS), which have higher supply and more gradual demand growth. 2. Exclusive Sale Platform: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is only available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN , adding an exclusive appeal that many competitors lack. Unlike Solana or Optimism (OP), which are widely traded, this controlled distribution creates a sense of urgency for early investors. 3. Early-Stage Momentum: Raising $1 million within minutes, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its market appeal. With predictions of a 50,000% increase, it’s capturing attention as a high-potential token for investors seeking exponential returns. How It Stacks Up Against the Competition Solana (SOL, $25.01): Known for speed and scalability, but it lacks the exclusive presale advantage and early momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS, $0.12): A rising star in blockchain, yet its growth doesn’t match the explosive potential seen in this new token. Optimism (OP, $1.72): A solid project for scalability, but it’s overshadowed by THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s unique market positioning.

The exchange will remove QI, TLM, and VITE trading pairs against Bitcoin (BTC), effective February 6, 2025. While the tokens remain available for trading on the platform through other pairs, the move has sparked discussions about market liquidity and investor sentiment. Binance Announces To Delist Three Tokens In the latest blog post , Binance confirmed the delisting of three trading pairs: QI/BTC, TLM/BTC, and VITE/BTC. The exchange stated that it regularly reviews listed assets to maintain a high-quality trading environment. Factors such as low liquidity and trading volume influenced the decision to remove these pairs. “Binance conducts periodic reviews of all listed spot trading pairs and may delist selected spot trading pairs due to multiple factors, such as poor liquidity and trading volume” the exchange noted. This means that while these tokens remain available on the exchange, their direct BTC trading pairs will no longer exist. In addition, the exchange will discontinue Spot Trading Bots services for these pairs on February 6, 2025. The platform advised users to update or cancel their bots to avoid potential losses. Can This Binance Decision Impact The Crypto Prices? Delisting trading pairs can impact investor confidence and token liquidity. When top crypto exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and others, remove pairs, it often leads to increased volatility. Traders may rush to sell, fearing further losses, which can trigger short-term price drops. While the exchange reassured users that QI, TLM, and VITE remain tradable on other available pairs, losing their BTC trading pairs limits their exposure. This could lead to reduced trading activity and wider price fluctuations in the short term. For context, the exchange has recently listed AI coins , which has resulted in a price surge for the coins. It reflects the influence of these top exchanges on the investors’ sentiment. Meanwhile, market experts suggest that these tokens may face increased selling pressure. Historically, delistings, especially from leading crypto exchanges , have led to price dips. Traders holding these assets against BTC may shift their positions, impacting demand and supply dynamics. However, since these tokens still have trading availability on the exchange, the long-term impact remains uncertain. If alternative pairs gain traction, the effect might be less severe. But if liquidity drops significantly, it could create hurdles for investors looking to exit or enter positions. How These Tokens Are Performing? Following the Binance announcement, BENQI (QI) price traded near the flatline at $0.009609, while its one-day trading volume dropped 31% to $7.23 million. Notably, the token has touched a 24-hour high and low of $0.01023 and $0.009056, respectively. QI Price On the other hand, TLM price recorded a jump of nearly 2% and traded at $0.006802 and its volume has dropped more than 40% to $23 million. The crypto has hovered between the $0.007483 and $0.006416 levels in the last 24 hours. TLM price Meanwhile, VITE price declined around 1.2% at the same time to $0.007032 and its trading volume plunged 56% to $.13 million.

U.S.-China Trade War Triggers Wild Price Swings appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP and Dogecoin surged 20% before dipping again as the U.S.-China trade war rattled the crypto market. Bitcoin briefly soared past $100K after President Trump paused tariffs on Mexico and Canada but dropped to $98K when China struck back with fresh tariffs on U.S. imports. Despite being decentralized, crypto still reacts like traditional financial markets. Many believe this isn’t just about trade—it’s a battle over supply chains, financial dominance, and economic control. If the U.S. keeps escalating, China may accelerate de-dollarization, push its central bank digital currency (CBDC), and tighten its hold on critical industries. XRP and Dogecoin Surged 20%, Then Dipped as China Tariffs Dent Crypto Rebound Crypto majors zoomed as much as 20%, before reversing, in the past 24 hours as a buy-the-dip strategy following Monday’s $2.2 billion turned profitable for risk-takers, although gains were wiped as … pic.twitter.com/KBY9XBSKne — TetherAccess (@tetheraccessvip) February 4, 2025 XRP, Dogecoin, and the Global Trade War Crypto traders took advantage of a “buy-the-dip” opportunity after Monday’s $2.2 billion liquidation, causing XRP and Dogecoin to rise sharply. However, when China retaliated with new tariffs, gains disappeared just as fast. XRP, Dogecoin, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) managed to hold onto a 3% increase, while Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) were up about 4%, but volatility remains high. According to Ben El-Baz, Managing Director of HashKey Global, the trade war could hurt investor sentiment, slowing the crypto bull market. However, he believes the damage could be controlled if the U.S. introduces more crypto-friendly policies. How Bad Could It Get? Analysts are divided on how long this market chaos will last. Min Jung from Prestro Research explained that despite Bitcoin’s reputation as “digital gold,” it still behaves like a risky asset. This means China’s tariffs impact it just like stocks, leading to short-term pressure. To be precise, Jung called this crash an overreaction, but traders should be prepared for the worst. The big question now is whether this is just a negotiation tactic or the beginning of a long economic war. If tensions rise further, crypto markets could suffer extended pullbacks. Will XRP & Dogecoin Recover? For now, XRP and Dogecoin remain at the mercy of global economic tensions. According to Crypto analyst CasiTrades , XRP’s dramatic plunge to $1.77 after a weekend liquidation event wiped out key support levels. Currently, in a Wave 4 recovery, XRP is testing resistance at $2.49 and $2.67. If it breaks above $2.67, a strong rally could follow, but failure may lead to another drop to $1.53. CasiTrades believes that once the bottom is confirmed, XRP could see an explosive rally beyond its all-time high of $3.80. On the other side, Dogecoin’s recent price action also shows signs of a potential rebound, bouncing off key support near the 200-day SMA at $0.2265. With the RSI approaching oversold levels, DOGE could be setting up for a short-term recovery if buyers step in. If the trade war drags on, crypto investors may stay cautious, making price swings more dramatic. However, this crisis also highlights the need for decentralized financial alternatives. XRP’s fast transactions and Dogecoin’s strong community support could help them stay relevant.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,XRP|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|ASIA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-04 11:35:59

Several topping indicators have occurred in recent weeks. Some altcoins have had parabolic rallies, although Bitcoin's dominance remains near all-time highs. The risk/reward in post-halving years is generally less attractive than in halving and pre-halving years. Investors managing an active portfolio should consider taking profits. An update on my positioning & recent price action Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rallied to a new all-time high in November 2024 and has since struggled to make significant moves to the upside or downside. The price action of Bitcoin has been exhausted several times at the $110,000 level. Similar to the Nasdaq 100 ( QQQ ), the market has rallied into the new Trump administration in anticipation of economic flourishing and failed to advance on additional positive news, which is always a bad sign. Data by YCharts After accumulating the majority of my Bitcoin position in 2023 and early 2024, I began taking serious profits after Bitcoin surged past the $100,000 mark. Currently, I still have a ~8% portfolio allocation solely to bitcoin, which is mainly a passive bitcoin allocation that I am not selling. As of today, I have essentially sold my entire active bitcoin allocation. Bitcoin positioning by Author (tradingview.com) I was late to the short altcoin outperformance in November 2024. Therefore, I did not book large profits in smaller alts and exited my position in late January 2025 with mostly neutral returns. One outlier was Solana ( SOL-USD ), which I managed to sell most of during the recent Donald Trump Memecoin pump. I still hold some of my Ether ( ETH-USD ). The Ether position protects me from left-tail risks to the upside, e.g. if Quantitative Easing unexpectedly returns with a vengeance without a failing economy. While I don't expect much of this position, the relative valuation to bitcoin (=satoshi valuation) still seems favourable. However, at the moment I personally don't want to risk having an altcoin position with no monetary debasement in sight. This could change quickly in the future, though. Ethereum Positioning by Author (tradingview.com) Bitcoin topping signals There have been several significant topping signals in my opinion. Most importantly, Michael Saylor was featured on the cover of Forbes last week. He is the CEO of MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) and managed to buy significant amounts of bitcoin with borrowed money from zero coupon convertible bond investors. Put simply, he has managed to take advantage of the volatility in the price of bitcoin by selling it to options traders at a large premium to the company's asset base (which consists mainly of bitcoin). The premium is advertised as 'Bitcoin Yield'. The business case works very well with an ever-increasing bitcoin price. However, if there is a downturn of several years, convertible bond investors will start demanding their initial price back and MicroStrategy will go out of business. This is a real risk that many underestimate. MicroStrategy bought most of its bitcoin in a rather unfortunate price range in the last quarter of 2024, when prices were already above $70,000. In November 2024 alone, the firm's holdings increased by 150,000 bitcoin. As of 27 January 2025, MicroStrategy owns 471,107 bitcoin, with an average purchase price of $62,473 per bitcoin and a total cost of $27,954 billion. MSTR BTC-Holdings (highcharts.com) MicroStrategy has a good chance of becoming the meme that goes bust during the next long bear cycle. A worthy successor to Sam Bankman-Fried, who was featured by Forbes in 2021 just before the FTX crypto platform went bust. I encourage readers to read up on the history of Michael Saylor's financial engineering tactics at MicroStrategy during the dot-com bubble. Data by YCharts In addition, a week ago, we got the Trump Memecoin ( TRUMP-USD ) and Melania Memecoin ( MELANIA-USD ) craze launched on Solana. I think the chances are high that a strategic reserve will not be implemented - at least during this cycle. The strategic reserve's main purpose was to collect presidential votes from the Bitcoin community. Long-term holders have been selling their bags to short-term holders over the past few months. Usually, long-term holders distribute their coins at new all-time highs to realize their profits. Short-term holders usually only buy if the price rises significantly in a short period of time. Once the exit liquidity of the short-term holders is used up, the price tends to fall rapidly as there is no purchasing power left. Long-term Holder Positioning (intothecryptoverse.com) Short-term Holder Positioning (intothecryptoverse.com) Typically, short-term holders tend to buy riskier assets such as altcoins. However, during this cycle, the bitcoin dominance (=market share of BTC compared to the total crypto market capitalisation) remains elevated. This may be because the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world continue to pursue restrictive monetary policies and quantitative tightening. This attracts investors to the relatively risk-free asset bitcoin over riskier altcoins. Another reason could be that Michael Saylor decided to be the exit to liquidity for most long-term holders of bitcoin by buying an amazing amount in late 2024. I think it is unlikely that quantitative easing will return for no reason. The reason for money printing could be either bad unemployment data, other deflationary economic data, or further rising long-term yields. Whatever the case, it is likely to be bad for the stock market and crypto assets initially. Only after a correction, which is a good enough reason to print money again, can altcoins outperform. Therefore, I changed my view about Altcoins and aim to wait until money printing returns to reenter for (maybe a final?) hurrah during 2025. What Bitcoin is great for I don't think bitcoin is an alternative form of money. Bitcoin is certainly not a hedge against consumer price inflation. However, bitcoin is the perfect hedge against monetary debasement, i.e. asset price inflation. The altcoin market is the riskier little brother of bitcoin, and only leaves its room when monetary debasement reaches its extremes via excessive quantitative easing - asset purchases directly by central banks. Therefore, bitcoin is not a safe haven against economic and political turmoil. On the contrary, it thrives when the monetary system is out of balance towards the left tail, when speculative manias gain momentum and asset prices inflate sharply. When Bitcoin Maxis are stunned by the similarities between Bitcoin's price performance and that of the Nasdaq and argue that it 'should trade differently based on fundamentals', they are wrong. Bitcoin behaves like a risk asset because it is one. Bitcoin and Crypto are great for speculation on the continuation of the monetary circus. I believe it is no coincidence that the protocol released right after the great financial crisis, in early 2009, when the monetary debasement circus started. Why bitcoin could struggle in the coming months & perhaps years, Risk assets thrive in times of monetary debasement and relative economic stability with high asset price inflation and rather low consumer price inflation. Bitcoin - as one of the best risk assets in my opinion - excels in such a scenario. However, I think there is a good chance that things will change in 2025 for the following reasons: 1. The yield curve has uninverted Investors are getting tired of the talks about the yield curve just when it matters most. Historically, the inversion of the yield curve has never been the time to worry about a recession. It was only after the inversion that recessions occurred, albeit with a long lag of up to a year after the uninversion. However, the yield curve signals are quite accurate in the grand scheme of things. The current economic cycle differs from previous ones. The duration of yield curve inversion has been much longer than average. The 2Y-10Y yield curve has been inverted for 26 months and the 3M-10Y yield curve has been inverted for 24 months. US10Y-US02Y Yield-Curve (tradingview.com) Throughout the process of the inversion, there were many strong opinions about an impending recession. However, the market - as per usual - ignored the consensus and rallied despite (or because of) these concerns. Times have changed, however, as the market hit new all-time highs and investors felt they were missing out. Now, with the new Trump administration, we have the positive narrative that many have been looking for to justify changing their minds. The bearishness seems to have disappeared. This greatly increases the chances of a real recession in the coming months. 2. The unemployment rate is rising Since the process of the uninversion started, the labour market data started showing weakness. The unemployment rate tends to move up with volatility once it really gets going. There are only a few examples in the past where the unemployment rate has risen in a steady and controlled manner - i.e. where there has been a soft landing. 3. The Fed cutting cycle has begun When the Federal Reserve starts cutting rates, markets usually fall first. This is because there has to be a reason for the Fed to cut and return to ease monetary policy. That reason could be the failure of commercial banks, a deteriorating unemployment rate, or other bad economic signals. Rate cuts are only beneficial for risk assets afterwards and not immediately. Data by YCharts 4. Markets are at all-time highs Recessions and major market declines are enabled by wrong investor expectations. When they are expected by all market participants, they rarely occur. With markets at new all-time highs, the Trump economic booster narrative in full effect, and AI and other futuristic technologies enabling lofty investor expectations and fantasies, it seems we have finally got the market ready for the possibility of a surprise. Different scenarios to consider An investment strategy that bets on recessions is incredibly unreliable. The opportunity costs are too high and these events typically occur only a few times in a decade. However, active investors can and should manage their positioning and risk exposure in times of greed and fear. I typically discuss a few realistic scenarios and manage my portfolio exposure depending on the theoretical outcome. For crypto assets, and risk assets in general, I believe there are four scenarios to consider going forward: Scenario 1: Correction & a return of QE Probably the most likely scenario would be a correction sometime this year as the yield curve steepens and unemployment rises. The Federal Reserve would have every reason to stop its current path of QT and start expanding its balance sheet again. During the decline, bitcoin should significantly outperform altcoins. However, after the decline, Altcoins should outperform Bitcoin; the Bitcoin dominance should therefore fall. The cycle begins anew with a bear market in 2026. Scenario 2: Correction & no return of QE The consequences should be similar to Nr.1. However, Bitcoin dominance would never really fall and Altcoins should continue to underperform even after the decline has continued, since retail investor sentiment likely remains muted in such a scenario. Scenario 3: Continued rally without QE If the aforementioned macro indicators are wrong and the market manages a soft landing, the Federal Reserve wouldn't be under pressure to resume balance sheet expansion. In such a scenario, Bitcoin would likely continue to rally throughout the year. Altcoins would underperform relative to the performance of Bitcoin. Scenario 4: Continued rally with QE If the Federal Reserve resumes easy monetary policy without a real need to do so (political pressure wins), altcoins would likely outperform bitcoin immensely throughout 2025. It is up to each (active) investor to evaluate these - or other - scenarios and adjust their portfolio accordingly. Personally, I believe that a conservative approach is the right choice for me in the post-halving year when volatility tends to increase. Especially after having bought most of my crypto positions in 2023. Therefore, I have reduced most of my positions to the bare minimum (passive allocations). If quantitative easing returns, I'll probably reenter the altcoin market with a larger active allocation. Food for thought on Bitcoin fundamentals Currently, there seems to be a shift towards fiscal restraint and responsibility around the world: e.g. Milei in Argentina & Trump with 'DOGE' (Department of Government Efficiency) in the US, the alternative right-wing parties in Europe etc. If these political pressures remain strong and the necessity of using the printing press to finance government deficits subsides – what purpose does Bitcoin really serve, as it is only a hedge against monetary debasement? I do strongly believe that we are likely to repeat the mistakes of the past and debase again. After all, once the fiscal debt spiral has started, it's hard to return to normality or some Austrian economic hyper-paradise. Although it would probably be great for the working class and the redistribution of wealth from the current polarisation. But isn't it a bit odd that the Bitcoin Maxis, who continue to preach the doctrines of Austrian economics, are so desperate for the Federal Reserve to finally continue printing money to pump their bags? On a personal note: I will be taking the tax advisor exams this year, so don't expect too many articles on the typical topics until October 2024. I wish you all the best in dealing with the current difficult markets. Just remember that markets are always difficult.

Notably, even though Bitcoin earlier benefited from US President Donald Trump’s decision to hold the proceedings aimed to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the Asian superpower’s retaliation against the global economic leader has disrupted the BTC market severely. Today, the Bitcoin market has declined by at least 2.66%. Let’s dive in for more details! China’s Retaliation Sparks Bitcoin Market Volatility It was on February 1 that Donald Trump announced his plan to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. At the start of that day, the BTC price was $102,398.67. Between February 1 and 2, the market slipped by at least 4.64%. As soon as rumours regarding Trump’s plan to halt his tariff plan against Canada and Mexico surfaced, buyers started to reenter the Bitcoin market, pushing the price upwards. On February 3, BTC saw an impressive single-day growth of 3.75%, pushing the price above the range of $100K. Trump’s approval of an executive order to create the first sovereign wealth fund also influenced buyers positively. However, the bullish momentum of Bitcoin has met a tough hurdle, when China has retaliated against the US’ decision to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese goods with counter-tariffs on US goods. Today alone, Bitcoin has dropped by over 2.66%. Experts Predict Ongoing Volatility and a New Trading Range in the BTC Market Acclaimed crypto market experts, like Michael Van de Poppe, opined that volatility would continue in the Bitcoin market. Meanwhile, experienced cryptocurrency traders, like Phoenix, stated that Bitcoin would form a new short-term range due to the current volatile market condition. Notably, Onchain analyst Axel Adler Jr. noted that Bitcoin’s funding rates turned negative, a bullish signal. White House to Announce New Digital Asset Policy Today Today, the artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar of Donald Trump, David Sacks, is scheduled to organise a press conference to explain the digital asset strategy of the new US administration. The conference is expected to be hosted by Sacks, along with Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman, House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill and House Agriculture Committee Chairman G T Thompson.

With its 1000x potential and rumors of a Binance listing, this coin is ready to surge past the likes of Shiba Inu and Pepe in 2025. If you’re not already paying attention, you may be at risk of missing out on one of the biggest opportunities in crypto. Why Doge Uprising Will Surpass Shiba Inu and Pepe When it comes to meme coins, Shiba Inu and Pepe have dominated the scene, capturing the attention of millions of investors and building massive communities. But as the crypto space evolves, a new contender is emerging that promises to redefine the meme coin world, this coin is Doge Uprising . With its unique narrative, innovative staking model, and strategic advantages, Doge Uprising is poised to outshine its predecessors and become the next big thing. Staking: More Than Passive Income One of Doge Uprising’s standout features is its staking system , which offers investors a powerful opportunity to earn passive income while actively contributing to the project’s growth. By staking $DUP tokens, holders can earn increasing rewards while reducing token circulation, creating a win-win scenario for the community and the coin’s value. The more you stake, the more you earn, turning Doge Uprising into a vehicle for consistent and meaningful returns. For early investors, the potential for long-term growth is immense, making staking one of the key drivers of Doge Uprising’s appeal. Rumors of a Binance Listing: The Catalyst for a Breakout Excitement around Doge Uprising has reached new heights with rumors of a Binance listing circulating in the crypto community. Historically, a Binance listing has been a game-changer for cryptocurrencies, often triggering exponential price surges and cementing a project’s credibility. If Doge Uprising secures a spot on Binance, $DUP could experience a meteoric rise, catapulting it to the forefront of the meme coin space. Insider Expertise: A Proven Team Adding to the buzz are whispers that the ex-Baby Doge team is behind Doge Uprising. If true, this means the project benefits from a team that has already proven its ability to deliver massive success in the meme coin market. Baby Doge made a significant impact, generating huge returns for its investors and establishing a loyal community. With this level of expertise and experience driving Doge Uprising, the project is armed with the knowledge and strategy needed to replicate and surpass that success. Doge Uprising combines the best elements of meme culture with tangible innovation and purpose. Its compelling narrative, robust staking model, and strategic momentum position it as more than just another meme coin. It’s a symbol of rebellion, a beacon of long-term growth and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for investors looking to be part of something extraordinary. Why You Can’t Miss Out on Doge Uprising’s 1000x Potential The potential for Doge Uprising to 1000x in 2025 is real. We’ve seen meme coins explode in value before, just look at Shiba Inu’s massive rise, or the way Pepe generated buzz but unlike these coins, which have already had their time in the sun, Doge Uprising is still in its early stages, offering a low entry point for investors. The meme coin market is ripe for disruption, and Doge Uprising is leading the charge. With a strong narrative, staking rewards, and insider rumors about Binance and the Baby Doge team, Doge Uprising has the potential to 1000x in 2025! Final Thoughts The time to get in on Doge Uprising is now. The potential for big time returns is very real and the combination of staking, insider rumors, and a powerful narrative gives it an edge over other meme coins like Shiba Inu and Pepe. If you don’t act quickly, you could be left behind as this coin takes off. Secure your place in the revolution, and don’t miss out on the opportunity to profit from the next big meme coin in 2025.

The lawsuit, lodged on February 3 in a Washington, DC, federal court, accuses the Treasury of illegally granting access to sensitive information to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). According to the AFL-CIO, this unprecedented intrusion jeopardizes the privacy rights of millions of individuals. “People who must share information with the federal government should not be forced to share it with Elon Musk or his ‘DOGE,’” the union emphasized. The group argued that such disclosures violate federal laws and demanded an immediate halt to the practice. Political Fallout and Security Concerns The lawsuit comes in the wake of mounting scrutiny over DOGE, a program seemingly named after the popular cryptocurrency Dogecoin. Critics, including top Democrats, have raised alarm about Musk’s extensive involvement in federal operations. Senator Ron Wyden revealed that sources informed his office about Bessent granting DOGE “full access” to the Treasury’s payment system, which holds vast amounts of personal data such as names, Social Security numbers, bank details, and more. On February 3, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Elizabeth Warren held a press conference to express their concerns. Schumer announced plans to introduce legislation aimed at blocking unauthorized access to Treasury systems. “DOGE is not a real government agency,” Schumer asserted. “It has no authority to make spending decisions or override federal law.” Escalating Legal and Political Drama Warren echoed these sentiments, stating that the system was effectively “at the mercy of Elon Musk.” She accused Musk of having the capability to exploit sensitive information for personal gain. The controversy surrounding DOGE stems from former President Donald Trump’s initiative to cut federal spending, a task he entrusted to Musk. However, the alleged lack of oversight and transparency has fueled widespread opposition.

Creditors of the hacked Indian crypto exchange will have to vote on whether to approve the restructuring scheme. If the majority, or more than 75% by value of voting creditors, vote yes, the scheme becomes effective in April 2025, as previously approved by a Singapore court, the company said in an X post. If the scheme is approved, the platform is then scheduled to restart trading operations, with initial payouts promised within 10 business days after the scheme's activation, including distributing net liquid assets. Part of the refund plan is to launch a decentralized exchange (DEX), Issue recovery tokens that can be traded, and perform a periodic buyback of recovery tokens using platform profits and new revenue streams. However, if the scheme is not approved, the restructuring plan fails and the process moves towards liquidation under section 301 of the Singapore Companies Act — potentially leading to a fire sale of assets and creditors receiving less compensation as assets are sold off at possibly lower values. The process might be less favorable for creditors due to delays and reduced asset value, WazirX noted in its post . WazirX, once India’s largest crypto exchange by trading volumes, was hacked by North Korean hacker outfit Lazarus in July 2024 and saw over $230 million of user funds stolen from the platform. The hacker laundered all the stolen funds to various addresses using Tornado Cash to obscure the transactions, as CoinDesk reported in September , further dampening hopes of a full recovery. WazirX, still reeling from the financial and reputational damage , has worked to recover the funds with limited success. It has faced criticism for its handling of the crisis, especially concerning user communication and fund recovery processes. It filed for a moratorium in Singapore courts and received court approval for a restructuring plan in January for creditor recovery, avoiding total liquidation.",Markets|WazirX|Hack|lazarus,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-04 11:50:18

At this point, it first fell sharply and fell to $91,000. Then, it experienced a recovery yesterday evening and rose above $100,000 again. While BTC attracts attention with its sharp and volatile movements, blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain examined some indicators and analyzed whether Bitcoin is currently at its peak. Accordingly, Lookonchain, which first used the Rainbow chart, said that the Bitcoin Rainbow chart shows that BTC can still rise and rise above $250,000 in this cycle. Secondly, examining the frequently used RSI indicator, Lookonchain said that when compared with previous data, the RSI shows that BTC has not yet reached its peak. Thirdly, the platform examined the 200-Week Moving Average Heat Map indicator. Accordingly, the 200-Week Moving Average Heat Map indicates that the Bitcoin price has not yet reached its peak. Fourthly, analyzing the Cumulative Value Loss Days (CVDD) indicator, Lookonchain stated that the current level of this indicator also shows that BTC's peak has not yet been reached. Finally, examining the 2-Year MA Multiplier indicator, Lookonchain stated that Bitcoin has not touched the red line on the indicator and has not reached the top yet. “Bitcoin price took a big drop yesterday! Will it continue to rise from the peak or will it decline?

This groundbreaking project brings together two of the internet’s most iconic meme coins—$DOGE and $PEPE—in a thrilling head-to-head battle. The first token to raise $1 million will be crowned the winner, but the excitement doesn’t end there. By introducing a competitive twist to the typical presale format, DOGEVSPEPE is capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts and meme lovers alike. As the presale heats up, DOGEVSPEPE is quickly becoming the most talked-about project of 2025. What Makes DOGEVSPEPE So Unique? DOGEVSPEPE isn’t just another token launch; it’s a community-driven battle between two of the most iconic meme coins. Here’s how it works: Two Tokens, One Winner: Investors choose between $DOGE, the original meme heavyweight champion, or $PEPE, the bold and unpredictable challenger. The first token to raise $1 million wins the race and launches. Winner Takes It All: Funds raised by the losing team are added to the liquidity pool of the winner, creating a strong foundation for the victorious token’s growth. Milestone Rewards: As funding levels of $250k, $500k, and $750k are reached, exciting surprises and rewards are unlocked, keeping the presale engaging and rewarding for participants. This structure transforms a typical presale into a high-stakes, interactive event that’s bringing together fans, investors, and meme enthusiasts alike. Why DOGEVSPEPE Is Taking the Internet by Storm DOGEVSPEPE’s viral success can be attributed to several key factors: A Fresh Take on Meme Coins Unlike traditional presales, which rely solely on hype and tokenomics, DOGEVSPEPE introduces a competitive element that gives every participant a stake in the outcome. By choosing a side, you’re not just investing—you’re joining a movement and helping to shape the future of meme coins. Iconic Rivalry The battle between $DOGE and $PEPE taps into a rivalry that’s already deeply ingrained in internet culture. $DOGE represents legacy, stability, and global recognition, while $PEPE embodies rebellion, humor, and boldness. This clash of styles has created an irresistible narrative that’s drawing in supporters from both sides. Explosive Growth Potential Meme coins have a history of delivering astronomical returns for early investors. Projects like $SHIBA and $FLOKI turned small investments into life-changing gains, and DOGEVSPEPE has the potential to do the same. With its innovative approach and first-mover advantage, this presale is poised to attract significant attention and capital. Engaging and Rewarding Structure DOGEVSPEPE isn’t just about buying tokens—it’s about unlocking rewards and staying engaged. Mystery milestones, a transparent tokenomics model, and a fair competitive structure ensure that every participant feels like part of a larger movement. The excitement doesn’t end until one token emerges victorious. First-Mover Advantage Being the first project to introduce a competitive meme coin presale gives DOGEVSPEPE an edge. In the crypto world, innovative ideas often lead to massive gains, as early adopters flock to support projects that stand out. DOGEVSPEPE’s unique format ensures it’s not just another presale—it’s an event that could define meme coins in 2025. What Sets DOGEVSPEPE Apart? While the concept of meme coins is not new, DOGEVSPEPE’s approach is what truly sets it apart: Community Involvement: Every purchase is a vote for your favorite meme coin, creating a sense of ownership and engagement that goes beyond traditional investing. Fairness and Transparency: The presale is designed to prevent whale dominance with capped wallet contributions and public contracts, ensuring a level playing field for all participants. Sustainability: By transferring the losing team’s funds to the winning token’s liquidity pool, DOGEVSPEPE creates a launch structure that supports long-term growth and stability. This innovative blend of competition, transparency, and community involvement is why DOGEVSPEPE is trending across the crypto world. Why DOGEVSPEPE Is the Most Anticipated Presale of 2025 Crypto investors and meme coin enthusiasts alike are rallying behind DOGEVSPEPE for a reason—it’s not just another project; it’s a cultural phenomenon. By blending humor, competition, and high stakes, DOGEVSPEPE has captured the spirit of what makes meme coins so captivating. Add to that the potential for massive returns, and it’s no wonder this presale is being called the most exciting meme coin presale of 2025. DOGEVSPEPE isn’t just a presale—it’s a chance to be part of something revolutionary. Whether you’re backing $DOGE for its legacy or $PEPE for its bold energy, this is your opportunity to join a project that’s redefining meme coin culture. The race is on, and only one meme coin will emerge victorious. Will you make your move and join the battle?

Bitcoin crashed to $91k, but its loss pales compared to the altcoin market. Amid this, Shiba Inu and Chainlink investors are aggressively investing in one cryptocurrency: 1Fuel . What is unique about it? And why are experts claiming it will do 20x in 2025? Shiba Inu’s loss mirrors the memecoin market The memecoins market was one of the most affected, and Shiba suffered considerable loss, hitting $0.00001284. Beyond the short-term crash, a descending triangle pattern formed on the weekly chart is not the good news Shiba investors hoped for. Moreover, newer memecoins like Trumpcoin disrupted the meme market at the start of the year, and by all indications, they can disrupt the markets again. This places older coins like Doge and Shiba in a tight spot: innovate or be crushed. Many Shiba whales know this and are pulling out their investments in droves. One major coin receiving the distribution is 1Fuel . With expert opinion circling a 20x increase, it is no surprise that this token is receiving considerable attention. Chainlink’s fundamentals don’t align with the current price Chain link ended January on a strong note after a fairly slow start. The cryptocurrency’s performance leads many to believe a green February is more likely. The notable news on Chainlink is the launch of its Data Streams on Scroll Mainnet. This launch, On January 29, enables developers to create high-performance dApps with real-time, decentralized market data. This integration is essential in improving the speed and efficiency of DeFi applications while maintaining blockchain security. While one would expect a massive reaction from the LINK price, its inability to break the $27 resistance and its flat, uncharacteristic move has left much to be desired. Even before the general crypto bloodbath that saw many tokens fall to double-digit losses, Chainlink was always going down in the short term. Now, the cryptocurrency is trading at $20,51 and chart analysis shows the crypto is on a slow grind to $13. With Shiba Inu losing its allure and Chainlink’s downward trend continuing, the crypto market looks to 1Fuel as a safe haven. 1Fuel’s offer seems irresistible for Shiba and Chainlink whales 1Fuel (OFT) is a stable alternative in this high-volatility environment. Its utility as a bridge between the ease of use of centralized exchanges and the privacy features of decentralized ones makes it a coveted exchange in the crypto space. The most interesting thing about 1Fuel is its one-click solution. The exchange uses the OFT token as oil to allow seamless flow in the ecosystem. With 1Fuel, users don’t need to worry about the technical aspects of trading. 1Fuel performs the bridging, converting, and cross-chain swaps. AI in crypto investing is another novel technology introduced by 1Fuel. Tasks such as tax reporting and portfolio management are automated. 1Fuel’s ongoing presale offers a great entry price 1Fuek is currently in the third stage of its presale. The current price of $0.017 might not indicate its value, but it is an opportunity for traders to get in on the gold mine early. Investors in the Stage 1 Presale are sitting on a 1700% profit, and experts believe a 2000% profit from its third presale is possible in 2025. The presale has successfully raised $1.75 million from selling over 175 million OFT tokens. Don’t miss out on what the next big name in the crypto market could be.

For quite some time, Canada ‘s crypto exchange-traded fund scene has been losing investors to the U.S. as lower fees, higher trading volumes, and the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have drawn capital away from Canadian funds. Now, Evolve Funds is making a play to bring them back — with leverage. The Toronto-based firm has filed a preliminary prospectus to launch Canada’s first leveraged crypto ETFs, The Globe and Mail has learned . If approved, the Evolve Levered Bitcoin ETF and Evolve Levered Ether ETF will offer 1.25x exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ).

But unlike them, Evolve plans to use cash borrowing instead of derivatives. The funds will also rebalance monthly, not daily. Crypto ETFs have had a rough 2024 in Canada. Outflows lasted five months straight. Investors reportedly pulled over C$1.1 billion from these funds, according to National Bank Financial. Much of that money moved south, where U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024. Earlier this year, the Canadian government raised concerns about the growing use of cryptocurrencies in the illicit opioid trade, particularly in the trafficking and production of fentanyl and other synthetic drugs. According to the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, digital assets, including stablecoins, are being used to facilitate international drug trade while bypassing traditional financial systems.

Now we seem to be entering a new era of ""tariffs on/tariffs off."" In a risk-on environment, growth-sensitive assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies tend to rise due to expectations of economic expansion or accommodative monetary policy. Conversely, risk-off situations reflects a lack of investor confidence, leading to sell-offs and a preference for safer assets. But this week, President Trump's tariffs announcement have single-handedly guided markets. Early Monday, bitcoin (BTC) plummeted to nearly $91,000 as Canada and Mexico retaliated against Trump's tariffs. That was ""tariffs on"" trading. Later, it rebounded above $100,000 after Trump paused the Mexico tariffs for the 30 days and announced the creation a sovereign wealth fund, which generated hopes of potential investments in BTC. That was ""tariffs off."" The bullish momentum ran out of steam early Tuesday as China retaliated against Trump's import tax, reviving ""tariffs on"" trading. BTC fell over 3% to $98,000, dragging altcoins lower. Nasdaq futures dropped over 0.5% and the dollar drew haven bids. Bitcoin and the broader crypto market will likely rebound should Trump announce an 11th-hour deal with China, just as he did with Mexico and Canada on Monday. Foreign-exchange market activity suggests that's likely. The AUD/CAD is down just 0.3% for the day, a sign traders don't expect a prolonged tariff war between the U.S. and China. (The Australian dollar is widely seen as a proxy for China). ""A cross like AUD/CAD should trade sharply lower in this situation given Canada has dodged tariffs and China has not, but it is only 0.5% lower on the day. That signals markets are pricing in a good chance that the US and China will also strike a deal and delay tariffs,"" ING said in a note to clients. That said, you can never be sure of Trump.

The fees were generated on Meteora, a DeFi exchange where the initial TRUMP coins were traded. Here, fees are charged for liquidity provision, which benefits the coin's creators by allowing them to earn from trading activities indefinitely, according to Reuters. A marketwide drop on Monday sent the token spiraling further down, bringing losses from the peak to a staggering 75%. The president continues to endorse the token on his social media platform, Truth Social, where he posted ""I LOVE $TRUMP!!"" alongside a link to purchase the token over the weekend. Derivatives Positioning Perpetual funding rates for SOL, DOGE, ADA, LINK and AVAX remain negative, indicating a bias for short positions. These coins may see outsized gains on the back of a short-squeeze should the market environment flip back to ""tariffs off"" during the American hours. Deribit's ETH volatility index has retreated to 70% from above 100%. BTC's volatility has faded from Monday's spike to 61%. The perpetual futures open interest-adjusted cumulative volume delta for most large-cap tokens, excluding TRX, is negative for the past 24 hours. That raises a question on the sustainability of the price recovery. Deribit's BTC, ETH options expiring this month continue to exhibit downside fears. The broader bias for bullish calls remains intact. Block flows featured a bear call spread in SOL, a calendar spread in BTC and long positions in the ETH $3K and $3.2K calls.

The Federal Reserve has a tall order: protecting the US dollar, which is quickly losing its value as BRICS nations explore a post-dollar world. From the Federal Reserve’s perspective, the outlook is unclear because Trump’s policy plans remain unclear. As far as anyone knows, a severe market crash à la 2008 could be on the horizon. The business cycle theory suggests these crashes are a natural part of economic activity. You might also like: VC funding model fails web3 projects | Opinion A crash is seemingly always lurking beneath the surface. In December 2024, the Dow posted its first ten-day losing streak since 1974, partly due to a lackluster rate outlook at the Federal Reserve, which said it would cut rates only two times in 2025. Despite the losing streak, the stock market remains in the midst of the largest bull market in history. The stock market posted all-time highs 57 times so far in 2024. It hasn’t had a deep, prolonged correction since the 2008 global financial crisis. Markets turned around rather quickly during the March 2020 COVID-19 crash. The mother of all bubbles With so much long-term euphoria in the air, now would be an apropos moment for the “mother of all bubbles” to pop. There is a general feeling that stocks will continue to perform well, but general feelings are often wrong. The big pop could again be averted if the Fed continues to inject liquidity into markets and slash interest rates, meaning more money destined for the stock market. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has notably never existed in an environment without quantitative easing. How it might behave remains to be seen, theoretically. But, until then, due to inflation and damaging interest rate policies, even Main Street investors have been piling their cash into stocks already. Meanwhile, the US government debt steadily increases as the government inches closer to needing to undertake extraordinary measures to manage it. With ever-increasing debts, the Fed could pivot to higher interest rates, and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could usher in an era of fiscal austerity. Beijing could opt to boost consumption, luring investment dollars into China. In other words, there is still a lot of uncertainty in the global economy. US stock prices outperformed other stock markets throughout 2024. In general, even the celebrated tech sector stocks outperform their profits despite a considerable boost from deficit spending. Eventually, the outperformance will come to an end. Bitcoin in a market crash What happens to Bitcoin in such an instance? The only example to draw is the COVID-19 stock market crash beginning in late February and extending into March. As a recession became unavoidable, the Dow Jones endured its most significant point drop since the 1987 Black Monday crash, even though the Federal Reserve said it would print $1.5 trillion into money markets. In this instance, markets generally rebounded quickly. That would likely not be the case in the coming bubble pop, which would be more akin to the 2008 bubble crash. In 2020, it is still worth noting that Bitcoin rebounded ahead of many other assets, such as gold. It traded as high as $10,300 in February and as low as $5,002.58 on March 17. It traded at $11,000 by July 28. A similar scenario would play out today, with Bitcoin falling precipitously but catching a bid ahead of other risk commodities thanks partly to its inelastic nature. In keeping with Bitcoin’s history, it will be a volatile ride down—perhaps as low as $50,000—followed by a steep rebound. Bitcoin has long been in the public mind as digital gold. Should that mindset remain in place, it is perfectly reasonable that from there, $500,000 and $1,000,000 BTC are plausible.

AI Predicts Yeti Ouro To Explode Just Like BTC In 2019,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/ai-predicts-yeti-ouro-to-explode-just-like-btc-in-2019/,"The post Bitcoin Price Prediction: Is $500K Realistic For BTC In 2025? AI Predicts Yeti Ouro To Explode Just Like BTC In 2019 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin (BTC) faces price predictions of $500K as a new coin Yeti Ouro (YETIO) in Play-to-Earn gaming shows the potential to match BTC’s growth from 2019. Market patterns and technical advances suggest these projections for both coins appear realistic. Yeti Ouro stands out as it has attracted the interest of both crypto whales and regular investors in 2025 Yeti Ouro (YETIO): A Rising Force In P2E gaming Yeti Ouro stands out with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game called Yeti Go. The game runs on Unreal Engine 5 and lets players earn YETIO tokens through races, tactics or in-game trades. A mix of gaming next to blockchain creates a system where tokens serve a clear purpose besides trading value. This practical use resembles how Bitcoin grew because people saw it as a way to store wealth. The project prioritizes security and transparency, an audit conducted by SolidProof , a trusted name in blockchain security is a testament to that. The financial investment in Yeti Ouro presents multiple benefits right now. A presale plan offers a 10% bonus to first-time investors. These rewards make early investment attractive at the current $0.017 per token price. The market trusts this project as Stage 1 completed ahead of schedule, while Stage 2 has reached more than 55% of its goal. With over 155,000,000 already sold, YETIO attracts investors as it combines fun with profit potential. It represents a very good chance to join the expansion of gaming plus blockchain tech. Investors who are after unmatched P2E utility and growth capacity YETIO is the one to watch out for in 2025. Investing in YETIO now means buying into a project with a tangible product, a growing community, and a strategic approach to token economics. This could replicate the kind of growth seen with Bitcoin in 2019, where the market suddenly recognized its long-term potential, driving its price to new heights. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis: The Road To $500K Bitcoin price prediction at $500K by 2025 stems from recent market shifts. Bitcoin spot ETFs got approval, leading billions in institutional funds to enter the market. A crypto-positive stance under Trump’s leadership helped build trust among investors. Expert analysis from Bernstein or Standard Chartered points to key factors for this price target: big investors joining in, supply cuts from halving events and people who want decentralized money. Source X However, a rise to $500K needs extreme market trust, clear rules, and a new view of Bitcoin in finance. Bitcoin showed its strength through past market cycles. Yet this target needs heavy market interest or wider use in real payment systems. The road to such a value faces many obstacles, like economic shifts next to rule changes plus the up-and-down nature of crypto prices. YETIO’s Presale: A Financial Opportunity An appealing part of Yeti Ouro’s presale comes from its clear purpose plus community focus – not just another crypto token. YETIO works inside the game economy and gives staking profits. These features add real value that could bring more demand. The mix of gaming next to blockchain tech makes YETIO attractive for savvy investors who want both sectors. This investment opportunity is underscored by YETIO’s structured approach to token value growth through gaming utility and community engagement. The financial model focuses on creating a sustainable ecosystem where the game’s popularity directly correlates with token demand, offering investors not just a speculative asset but one with potential for real-world use and enjoyment. Conclusion Bitcoin price path to $500K by 2025 needs a complete alignment of market forces. The Yeti Ouro project shows signs of a rise similar to Bitcoin’s 2019 growth because of its fresh take on gaming or blockchain technology. A comparison between these two assets reveals different paths: BTC draws value from its position as digital gold, while YETIO connects to the gaming sector. The year 2025 presents a chance for investors to see how each asset develops its own story. Investing Yeti Ouro not only purchases tokens but also provides access to the vanguard of GameFi and DeFi progress.

Yet ADA has been a laggard in the crypto industry, with its price being 76% below its all-time high, and its ecosystem lagging that of other layer-1 blockchains. In fast paced crypto space, investors are likely to reject this top altcoin and look for high-flying Cardano rivals that offer better yields like turning $10k into $100k before February ends. Cardano Price Trades 76% Below its ATH Best Cardano Rivals to Buy and Turn $10k into $100k Some of the top Cardano rivals to buy and turn $10k into $100k in February are Raydium (RAY), Ripple (XRP), Jupiter (JUP), and Jito (JTO). Raydium (RAY): Market Leader in DEFI Raydium is a top Cardano rival to buy and hold in February to turn $10k into $100k. It has become a key player in the cryptocurrency industry, overtaking Uniswap to become the biggest DEX network. Raydium has handled over $441 billion in volume since its early days, with $124 billion of this coming in the last 30 days. The RAY token has jumped by nearly 4,000% from its 2023 lows, outperforming Cardano. Its price may continue soaring in February, with a potential of moving from $6 to over $15. Ripple (XRP): Cardano Rival With Multiple Catalysts XRP price has soared in the past few months, turning it into the third-biggest cryptocurrency in the industry. Analysts believe that XRP price may surge from the current $2.6 to over $5 in the coming months. Some of the potential catalysts are its popularity, the growing volume of Ripple USD (RLUSD), its stablecoin, and the potential approval of a spot XRP ETF by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Jito (JTO): Liquid Staking Network Minting Money Jito is one of the top Cardano rivals for buying and growing your cash from $10,000 to $100k. It is the biggest liquid staking network on Solana’s ecosystem. So, the main reason why the JTO token may surge soon is that the network is minting money, and has become the second most profitable network in the crypto industry after Tether. It has made about $310 million this year, beating Tron, Ethereum, and Circle. Therefore, the JTO token may surge soon as it attracts more investors. Besides, the token has remained in a consolidation phase in the past few months. Tha is a possible sign that it is in an accumulation mode. A rebound may see it soar by 265% to a record high. Jupiter (JUP): Growing Market Share in Perpetual Trading Jupiter is one of the best ADA rivals to buy in February as it continues to gain market share in the perpetual DEX industry. It has handled over $224 billion in volume and is gaining market share against Hyperliquid in the perpetual futures trading. Like Jito, Jupiter’s token has remained in a tight range in the past few months. A rebound in February may see it jump to its all-time high of $1.9205, over 100% from the current level. Other Top ADA Rivals to Buy The other key ADA rivals to buy are cryptocurrencies like Avalanche, Stellar Lumens, Cronos, and Hyperliquid.

XYZ is currently undervalued , and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Be Part of the 2025 Breakout Story—XYZ Is Waiting for You! Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot (DOT) has seen sharp price drops recently. Over the past week, its price fell by 25.93%. In the last month, it decreased by 41.11%. Despite this downturn, over six months, it gained 1.33%. Currently, the price ranges between $4.51 and $6.15, showing volatility but some stability compared to six months ago. Technical indicators show mixed signs for Polkadot’s future. The RSI is 36.52, close to oversold, hinting at a possible rebound. The MACD is negative at -0.3761, suggesting bearish momentum. The stochastic oscillator stands at 42.31, indicating potential for upward movement. The 10-day average price is $4.56, below the 100-day average of $5.91, pointing to a short-term downward trend. If the price continues to fall, support may be found at $3.86. A drop below this could lead to $2.22. On the upside, resistance lies at $7.14. Rising from $4.51 to $7.14 represents an increase of over 50%. The next resistance is at $8.78. Observers are watching these levels for signs of a reversal. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) NEAR Protocol (NEAR) has experienced significant price drops recently. Over the past week, its price fell by 29.58%, now hovering between $3.22 and $4.56. The past month saw a larger decline of 42.50%. However, over six months, the decrease is only 9.03%, indicating some long-term stability. Technical indicators give mixed signals. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $3.33, below the 100-day SMA of $4.34, suggesting a bearish short-term trend. The Relative Strength Index is at 37.07, approaching oversold territory, which might signal a potential rebound. The MACD level is negative at -0.2565, aligning with bearish sentiments. If NEAR breaks above the nearest resistance at $5.37, it could target the second resistance at $6.71, potentially gaining around 65% from the lower price range. If it falls below the support at $2.70, the next support is $1.36, which would mean a substantial decline. Traders are watching these levels closely to gauge NEAR’s next move. VeChain (VET) VeChain (VET) has experienced significant price declines in recent weeks. Over the past week, the coin’s value dropped by 24.62%. In the last month, it decreased by 35.96%. However, looking at the broader picture, VET has gained 51.35% over the past six months, indicating potential resilience in the long term. Currently trading between $0.0328 and $0.0463, VET is approaching its nearest support level at $0.0275. If the price holds above this level, there could be a rebound toward the nearest resistance at $0.0546, which would be an increase of about 66%. Breaking through this resistance might open the path to the second resistance level at $0.0681. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The 10-day Simple Moving Average stands at $0.0334, below the 100-day SMA of $0.0442, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. The Relative Strength Index is at 39.32, nearing the oversold threshold, which could imply a potential price reversal. The MACD level is negative at -0.0028, pointing to continued bearish momentum. These factors suggest that while VET faces short-term challenges, there may be opportunities for growth if key support levels are maintained. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink (LINK) has seen significant price movements recently. Over the past week, its price dropped by 24.30%. In the last month, it decreased by 19.93%. However, over the past six months, LINK increased by 86.70%. Technical indicators suggest mixed signals for LINK’s future price. The Relative Strength Index is at 38.51, approaching oversold territory. The MACD level is -1.244, showing bearish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $18.55, below the 100-day SMA of $23.55, which could signal a downward trend. Chainlink’s nearest resistance is at $29. If it climbs to this level, it would be an increase of about 63% from the current price. The next resistance is at $36, representing a potential gain of over 100%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $14.94, a drop of around 15%. If it falls through this level, the next support is at $7.829, which would be a significant decline. Conclusion While DOT, NEAR, VET, and LINK are strong bear market choices, XYZVerse (XYZ) offers unique sports-meme synergy and aims for massive growth with its community-driven ecosystem.

DeFi. AIFi. RWAs. Plus whatever you get when you combine all those verticals into one. They may not have invented an abbreviation for it yet but they’ve certainly created one for the token that will power all this onchain economic activity. $SFI is the ticker, and while it’s technically a token migration, it’s fair to say that it’s going down as one of the most anticipated token launches of 2025. Formed out of a merger between SingularityDAO and Cogito Finance, to combine each entity’s inherent strengths and to build the AI sector’s “financial backbone”. The union also necessitated combining their respective tokens and thus $SFI was born. But there’s much more to the token than simply a new name – much more.

Because the future won’t wait. pic.twitter.com/q8twmFCP6t — Singularity Finance (@Singularity_Fi) February 3, 2025 New Ticker, Who Dis? On February 6, the event that the alliance behind Singularity Finance have been working feverishly towards for months will crystallize in the launch of $SFI. The asset will perform a variety of roles, serving as the general-purpose gas and utility token for the new Singularity Finance L2. But beyond its core use cases, it’s likely to be treated by the public as embodying the entire DeFAI sector. If you’re bullish on DeFAI, in other words, you should be bullish on $SFI. And right now, half of crypto’s bullish on the intersection of decentralized finance and artificial intelligence – including those who’ve yet to get up to speed on what Singularity Finance is cooking . The short version goes like this: it’s building the network for tokenizing the AI value chain. The longer version goes very similarly to that but with more words. Try the following explainer for size… Imagine Investing in the Internet AI is the greatest invention the modern world has ever seen except for the internet itself. When the web was created and subsequently popularized, in the late 90s, there was no easy way to gain direct exposure to this trend. In other words, even if you were bullish on the internet and knew it was going to change everything, you couldn’t long TCP/IP or fill a bag of POP3 tokens. At best, for those who believed the internet’s impact was going to be significantly greater than the fax machine’s, you could indirectly gain exposure by buying shares in Amazon.com or Pets.com. But by the time that was possible, the initial stratospheric ascent of the web as breakout technology had already passed and, in the event, even investing into eventual unicorns such as Amazon would have required saintly patience, given the dotcom crash that slowed all tech growth for several years. Fast forward two decades and not only are we privileged to be witnessing the second and likely last ever “internet creation event” in human history, but we can now gain direct exposure to it through inventions like blockchain and tokenization. But it’s not as simple as simply picking a couple of AI stocks and sitting back and waiting for events to run their course. The industry is more fragmented and complex than that. $SFI is your front row ticket for the roller coaster ride that is AI. Rather than tying yourself to the fortunes of any one project or company – OpenAI, say – it’s a bet on the growth of the entire industry. Like all roller coasters, there’ll still be plenty of ups and downs along the way, but it promises to be a helluva ride that grants holders direct exposure to the most transformative event our tiny minds will ever experience. Oh, and you can also use it to pay transaction fees on Singularity Finance’s L2. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While a new abbreviation might not yet exist for this concept, they have certainly coined one for the token that will drive all of this onchain economic activity. $SFI is the ticker, and although it involves a token migration, it’s clear that this is one of the most eagerly awaited token launches of 2025. Created from the merger of SingularityDAO and Cogito Finance, it combines the unique strengths of each entity to establish the AI sector's ""financial backbone.""

On February 6, the moment that the team behind Singularity Finance has been tirelessly working towards will finally happen with the launch of $SFI. This asset will fulfill multiple functions, acting as the versatile gas and utility token for the new Singularity Finance L2. Beyond its essential uses, it is expected that the public will see it as a representation of the entire DeFAI sector. In other words, if you're optimistic about DeFAI, you should be optimistic about $SFI. Currently, a significant portion of the crypto community is enthusiastic about the fusion of decentralized finance and artificial intelligence—this includes those who are still getting acquainted with what Singularity Finance is developing . To put it briefly: they're building the network for tokenizing the AI value chain. The longer explanation is quite similar, just with more details. Consider this explanation… Picture Investing in the Internet AI is the most significant invention of the modern era, rivaled only by the internet. When the web was first developed and gained popularity in the late 90s, there were no straightforward ways to directly invest in this trend. Even if you were confident in the internet’s potential to transform everything, you couldn’t invest directly in protocols like TCP/IP or acquire POP3 tokens. At best, those who foresaw the internet’s impact as greater than that of the fax machine could gain indirect exposure by investing in companies like Amazon.com or Pets.com. However, by the time such investments were possible, the initial explosive growth of the internet had already occurred, and investing in future giants like Amazon would have required considerable patience, given the dotcom bubble burst that slowed tech growth for years. Fast forward two decades, and not only are we witnessing the second and probably last ""internet creation event"" in human history, but we can now directly participate through innovations like blockchain and tokenization. However, it's not as simple as choosing a few AI stocks and waiting for events to unfold. The industry is more fragmented and intricate than that. $SFI gives you front-row access to the thrilling ride of the AI industry. Rather than aligning your fortunes with any single project or company—like OpenAI—it's a wager on the growth of the entire sector. As with any roller coaster, there will be ups and downs along the way, but it promises an exhilarating journey that offers direct exposure to the most transformative experience our minds will ever encounter.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP and Yeti Ouro are set for major gains in 2025, with XRP targeting 5x growth and YETIO aiming for a major surge through gaming rewards. Table of Contents Yeti Ouro: The P2E gaming star Ripple: Aiming for regulatory clarity and market expansion YETIO’s presale: An investment opportunity Conclusion As 2025 begins, investors expect XRP to reach new price heights. Ripple’s XRP plans to multiply its value by five because of better regulations and more uses in finance. Yeti Ouro (YETIO), a token that offers rewards through games, promises to increase tenfold before December. A mix of legal support for XRP, and YETIO’s fresh take on gaming points to significant gains for both coins. Yeti Ouro: The P2E gaming star Yeti Ouro serves as an entry ticket to the play-to-earn (P2E) game Yeti Go. The game is being built on Unreal Engine 5, which lets players race and earn YETIO tokens through contests or market trades. Unlike speculative coins, the mix of gaming and blockchain gives YETIO a real purpose. The system rewards active players and builds a lively group of users, which helps raise token value. The early investment in Yeti Ouro shows good potential for returns. Its smart token setup aims for lasting value with 1 billion total tokens and a 5% burn clause in the contract. YETIO creates scarcity, which tends to push prices up. The presale proves investor trust, whereas Stage 2 sells tokens at $0.017 and offers new buyers a 10% bonus. With over 155,000,000 tokens sold already, the presale has attracted individual investors and whales, setting up one of 2025’s most anticipated token projects. Stage 2 has reached over 55% of its goal already, providing solid market backing. A purchase during presale means more than just buying tokens. Users invest in actual product growth along with community support and value planning. YETIO stands out as a solid pick for people who want to join the rise of the P2E market.

A price forecast of 5x rests on vital progress. Firstly, better legal status with the SEC could remove price limits. Additionally, if more banks use RippleNet, it would push Ripple higher. The positive end to Ripple’s SEC case and more utility could attract big investors and lead to broader use in finance. Source: X The token stands ready to grow with its tested system and fresh business deals. Market experts watch for XRP ETFs and new payment uses that could drive prices up. XRP proves its worth through actual business needs, which supports a possible 5x increase. However, regulatory clarity is important to ensure continued growth. YETIO’s presale: An investment opportunity The Yeti Ouro presale gives investors a well-timed financial opportunity. A token price of $0.017 in Stage 2 and a 10% bonus for new investors set up a chance for good returns. The success of the presale shows a genuine interest in the project’s plans. The roadmap includes more work on Yeti Go or better game features and broader token use in the game. The present phase lets buyers enter at lower prices before a market rise. A profit becomes possible if the play-to-earn model meets expectations. Conclusion The XRP token and YETIO show good reasons to draw investments in 2025. XRP aims to grow from its known place in finance as YETIO builds on the rising P2E game market. A clear 5x target for XRP needs regulatory clarity. But YETIO seeks a 10x rise through its fresh take on games and token systems. These assets let investors join the changing crypto field in unique ways that could bring high returns.

The cryptocurrency has struggled following a broader crypto downturn , triggered by the rollout of tariffs by the Donald Trump White House. Despite these setbacks, analysts maintain a bullish long-term outlook for XRP, mapping out a trajectory that could see the asset rallying toward $5.85 and beyond if key technical levels hold. Technical analysis points to a bullish breakout XRP’s price structure suggests a clear bullish trajectory, with multiple indicators supporting the case for a rebound. In a projection guided by Elliott Wave Theory, crypto analyst Dark Defender, in a recent X post on February 3, noted that XRP is currently in Wave 4 of its Intermediate Cycle, setting the stage for a Wave 5 breakout toward $5.85. A broader bullish outlook also remains in place, with Primary Cycle projections pointing to a long-term target of $18.22. If buying momentum increases, XRP could break through key resistance levels, triggering an extended uptrend. XRP price analysis chart. Source: Dark Defender / X Adding to the bullish outlook, analyst Dom compared XRP’s recent price crash to two major historical selloffs—the SEC lawsuit dump in December 2020, which saw XRP plunge 70.61%, and the March 2020 COVID-19 crash, where XRP dropped 55.37% alongside global markets. In both cases, these declines marked ‘generational bottoms,’ paving the way for significant rebounds. Dom suggests that XRP’s latest drop, driven by Trump’s tariff policies, could also be setting up a similar accumulation phase before a sustained recovery. XRP historical sell-offs. Source: Dom/X Regulatory developments and market sentiment set to boost XRP Beyond technical factors, regulatory developments could play a decisive role in XRP’s trajectory. The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is expected to rule on the long-running lawsuit against Ripple , with growing speculation about a potential settlement in Ripple’s favor. Adding to the anticipation, the SEC is also reviewing an application for an XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). If approved, the ETF could attract institutional capital, providing a significant boost to XRP’s liquidity and market demand. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP is trading at $2.62, marking a 36% rebound from its recent low of $1.90 on February 3. Despite gaining 10% in the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency remains down nearly 17% over the past week, highlighting continued market volatility. XRP one-day price chart.

The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) only approves 14% of applications for financial institutions to operate in the country. And until recently, if you visited Coinbase from the UK, you received a standard ‘services restricted’ notice. Now, the message has changed. The FCA approved Coinbase’s application, the exchange is now live for UK users, and the crypto market is up 3% from the day before. Unrelated? Probably. But Coinbase’s approval is another bullish sign for the year ahead, which leads to only one question – what crypto should you buy now? Here’s our list of five crypto projects to keep your eyes on, on Coinbase or any other exchange you prefer. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Best Pepe Ever With $68M Presale Could Wall Street Pepe become the best pepe? The latest Pepe-based memecoin continues to smash through its presale goals, passing the $68M on its way to what could easily become a sold-out presale. $WEPE offers a number of benefits to token holders, including: Trading alpha – Exclusive $WEPE market insights and signals WEPE army – Private insider group for strategies, alpha-sharing, and the latest $WEPE plays Trading rewards – The best trades are eligible for weekly rewards Staking – Earn more on your $WEPE with dynamic APY Above all, WEPE is a community-focused project with premium tools and community benefits. $WEPE tokens are currently priced at $0.0003665, and the presale is moving fast – learn more about how to buy $WEPE before it ends. Visit the Wall Street Pepe presale to learn more. Alchemy Pay ($ACH) – Bridging Fiat and Crypto On-ramping (fiat to crypto) and the even more complicated off-ramping (crypto to fiat) have been a thorn in the side of crypto adoption for years. Now Alchemy Pay aims to change that, offering broad support for crypto payments across Web3. Alchemy Pay markets its services to anyone seeking to make their products crypto-friendly, while providing another blockchain – Alchemy Chain – optimized for payments processing. The $ACH token is the utility token for Alchemy Pay, an ERC-20 token issued on the Ethereum blockchain. $ACH is up nearly 40% in the past month as users look for altcoins with added utility. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – One-and-Only Presale Wallet Token Crypto wallets should be more than just places to store your crypto. They should be portals to the entire crypto economy – a place to store, buy, sell, trade, and gain insights into the market while providing as many practical features as possible. And as the name implies, that’s exactly what Best Wallet sets out to achieve. There’s a Best DEX and a Best Card in addition to the wallet. Now, there’s a Best Wallet Token ($BEST). The $BEST token powers up the entire wallet and Best ecosystem, offering improved staking rewards, lower transaction fees, and governance access. Last – but not least – $BEST token holders gain exclusive access to certain crypto presales . As a presale wallet, Best Wallet gathers select crypto presales in one location. Users can research and invest in these projects directly within the wallet. That utility for $BEST has driven the ongoing presale north of the $9M mark, with tokens priced at $0.02385. Follow the $BEST presale here. Raydium ($RAY) – First Solana AMM Liquidity markets allow investors to create ‘pools’ of tokens to trade, monetize through staking and yield, and facilitate swaps. It’s a fast-paced and technically complex world, but one that draws millions in investment. Raydium was the first and most distributed Solana-based automated market maker for liquidity. $RAY, the native Raydium token, has a mining reserve that slowly releases additional $RAY onto the market. Raydium’s popularity and $RAY’s tokenomics are part of the explanation for why the token is up 465% in the past year. And it makes $RAY a token worth considering as crypto markets draw more investors. Catslap ($SLAP) – Slapping Cats and Dropping Free Crypto A simple Slap-to-Earn game powers potentially big airdrop rewards in the Catslap economy. Working within Best Wallet, players can connect to the Catslap page and then turn on Slap-to-Earn, participating in a simple but entertaining game of using a feline gif to pummel various well-known characters. At the end of one of four seasons, rewards are distributed in a Slapdrop (airdrop) to all participants. It’s not complicated, but an entertaining game and a deflationary token burn mechanism help drive interest in $SLAP. Learn more about the game – and how to participate – at the Catslap website . What’s Safer for Your Crypto? Best Wallet or Coinbase UK Coinbase brings broad name recognition to UK users. But it might not be the perfect web3 wallet. For that, UK investors should turn to Best Wallet . Best Wallet offers users a multi-chain, non-custodial wallet with biometric security features. Keep your private keys, and keep your crypto with Best Wallet. As Coinbase Opens to UK Users, Which Tokens Stand to Benefit? Along with Best Wallet, Coinbase potentially opens the door for additional UK investors to take a closer look at crypto. What’s the best crypto to buy to take advantage of any surge in interest? These five are worth a closer look. As always, do your own research – this isn’t financial advice, so make sure you know what you’re investing in. Crypto is volatile, and losses are always possible.

The recovery was marked by key support at $2,530.12, signaling bullish potential. By 22:30 UTC, ETH reached $2,920.10, shaping a major resistance zone. Despite oversold RSI conditions and the emergence of a death cross on the MACD, Ethereum’s ability to stabilize at new support levels indicates potential for future gains. With the resistance at $2,920.10, the path forward remains uncertain, requiring careful observation of further market developments. Chart 1 – Analyzed by alioliyaee_f, published on TradingView, Feb 4, 2025 In-Depth Ethereum Price Analysis As illustrated in Chart 1, The trading session on February 3 saw high volatility in ETH price action, with the price first dipping to $2,124.98 USDT at 02:05 UTC. This resulted in a rapid breakdown, followed by a quick recovery, as ETH shifted near crucial support levels. At 02:05 UTC, the RSI indicated an oversold condition, indicating a possible reversal, and Ethereum soon recovered its footing. As the day unfolded, Ethereum began to gather positive momentum, signaling a notable shift in the market trend. By 14:20 UTC, Ethereum had solidified a new support level at $2,530.80 USDT, reflecting bullish sentiment. Shortly after, at 14:30 UTC, the MACD formed a golden cross, confirming the upward trend. Meanwhile, the RSI sank into the oversold zone, showing that Ethereum was undervalued and suggesting continued upward growth. Following these signals, Ethereum continued to increase, supporting the bullish trend. Later in the session, at 20:55 UTC, another support level at $2,695.63 USDT emerged, reinforcing the stability in this range. Ethereum reached a high of $2,921 USDT at 22:30 UTC, creating a formidable resistance zone. However, by 23:00 UTC, a death cross appeared on the MACD, accompanied by an RSI above 70, suggesting weakening momentum. On February 4, 2025, at 05:00 UTC, the RSI again showed oversold conditions, signaling potential for upward movement. Given the current market structure, Ethereum faces a challenge at the $2,735 resistance level. If Ethereum can break above this level, it may continue to rise towards higher goals. However, failure to break through this resistance may result in a dip, with support around $2,530.80 USDT as the next key level to monitor.

On Feb. 4, Head of Department of Government Efficiency Elon Musk responded to a post from a popular Reddit account, Reddit Lies, exposing multiple anonymous Reddit users for threatening employees of the Musk-led department with violence. A lot of the posts call for the execution of said employees and hints at targeting them by finding out where they live. Musk shared the post with his followers with the caption “They [Reddit users] have broken the law” by threatening employees linked to the new department. Not long after, Musk shared a follow-up post which included a statement from the U.S. Attorney District of Columbia, Edward R. Martin Jr. In the post, Martin Jr. stated that his team has done an initial review of the evidence showcasing individuals and groups explicitly targeting DOGE employees.

XRP’s price rose to $3 after the lawsuit dismissed by the SEC rocked the market. BNB is approaching its ATH meanwhile, while Rollblock is innovating with exponential expansion. As the market rebounds, these tokens are leading the charge, fueling investor optimism for what’s ahead. With XRP soaring, BNB nearing its peak, and Rollblock redefining the GambleFi space, 2025 is shaping up to be a game-changing year. Rollblock surges as market recovers: Play-to-earn, revenue sharing, and lightning-fast transactions lead the way As the cryptocurrency market recovers from SEC regulatory challenges, Rollblock is positioning itself as a leader in next-generation online gaming. By integrating cryptocurrencies with advanced technology, it provides a gaming experience that is rapid, equitable, and safe. Rollblock’s Play-to-Earn system compensates players with tokenized cashback, transforming each game into a lucrative experience.

Speed and efficiency are essential in the gaming business and Rollblock has just the solution by using blockchain technology to quickly process transactions and charge cheap fees, letting players play without delays or hassles, thus positioning it as a leader in this space. XRP price hits $3 as SEC regulation hurdles shrink and optimism grows The XRP price has climbed to $3.05, representing a notable achievement as it exceeds $3 for the first time since 2018. This increase occurs in the context of continuing legal proceedings between Ripple Labs and SEC regulations, as the SEC has filed an appeal against Ripple's 2023 judgement that XRP sales to regular investors did not constitute unregistered securities offers Notwithstanding the persistent concerns around SEC regulations, investor excitement persists in driving XRP's expansion. Numerous individuals believe that Ripple's future outlook and possible regulatory modifications are significant catalysts for this rising trajectory. Market analysts predict that the XRP price could reach $4.40, based on technical analysis patterns. However, the final outcome of the SEC's appeal will remain a critical factor influencing XRP's valuation moving forward. BNB nears ATH: Binance’s dominance fuels the rally to new heights BNB is approaching its ATH, driven by several key factors. The recent breakout of an inverse head and shoulders pattern has signaled a bullish trend, propelling BNB's price to new peaks. Additionally, Binance's substantial trading volumes have bolstered BNB's value. In November, Binance handled 36% of the global crypto market trading volume, amounting to $986 billion, with further significant volumes in December. These developments underscore BNB's growing prominence in the cryptocurrency market, positioning it to potentially surpass its previous ATH. Conclusion Rollblock’s surge in the market recovery is undeniable, with its innovative Play-to-Earn model, fast transactions, and dynamic rewards system leading the way in crypto gaming. As Rollblock continues to redefine GambleFi, its presale success is impressive, with almost $10 million raised.

As Bitcoin continues to lead, altcoins present thrilling prospects for substantial gains. With numerous choices available, selecting standout ones is daunting. The finest altcoins are recognized not just for their price trends but for robust foundations, practical real-world uses, and increasing market demand. If you’re on the lookout for the 5 best altcoins to buy now, our list highlights projects making impressive progress. Some are enhancing their tech, others are securing vital partnerships, and several are gearing up for significant exchange listings. A common factor? They all have the potential for robust growth in 2025. Here’s why BlockDAG, Litecoin, Chainlink, Polkadot, and XRP stand out as top selections. 1. BlockDAG: Poised for 10 CEX Listings BlockDAG (BDAG) is at the forefront of enhancing blockchain scalability, evidenced by over $191.5 million gathered during its presale. BDAG coins are catching attention even before exchange debuts. The project’s DAG-based framework supports rapid transactions and avoids network bottlenecks, an edge over traditional blockchains. Its imminent appearance on 10 key CEXs is likely to boost liquidity and demand as trading starts. Moreover, BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App is attracting early users. With the app, already popular with over 500,000 downloads, mining BDAG coins is easy via smartphones, simplifying crypto mining. This accessibility, coupled with its presale success, places BlockDAG among the top 5 altcoins to buy now, offering an opportunity to engage early before prices escalate. 2. Litecoin: Positioned for a Price Surge Often referred to as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, Litecoin is hinting at an increased influential role. With a current price of approximately $116.63, LTC is preferred for its transactional efficiency and minimal costs. Its integration with major payment networks and solid performance history renders it a dependable option for long-term enthusiasts. The buzz now is about its potential surge. Some market watchers liken its trajectory to XRP’s recent uptick, indicating LTC might be on the cusp of a significant price increase. With its growing acceptance and reliable past, Litecoin is a key player among the 5 best altcoins to buy now, offering a balance of security and growth prospects. 3. Chainlink: Enhances Blockchain Connections Chainlink has established itself as a central figure in the domain of blockchain data connections. Its oracle network plays a pivotal role in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, smart contracts, and integrating real-world data. Ripple’s recent collaboration with Chainlink to boost the security and precision of its RLUSD stablecoin underscores the importance of LINK’s framework in the crypto sector. With a current price of $22.40, LINK’s value has been progressively increasing, reflecting its heightened demand. As blockchain initiatives increasingly depend on trustworthy data sources, Chainlink’s technology is set to stay in high demand. Its move into new financial sectors and strategic partnerships at the enterprise level position it as one of the 5 best altcoins to buy now for those eyeing sustained blockchain engagement. 4. Polkadot: Interconnectivity and ETF Prospects Polkadot stands out for its sophisticated ability to bridge disparate blockchains. Its parachain structure enables independent chains to interoperate and share security features, addressing a significant challenge in the blockchain ecosystem. With a valuation at $5.71, DOT is seen as undervalued given its capabilities and future prospects. A major development for Polkadot is the recent ETF proposal by 21Shares. If sanctioned, this could markedly enhance institutional engagement in DOT, potentially triggering a substantial price increase akin to those observed with Bitcoin ETFs. Boasting solid fundamentals and on the verge of a pivotal regulatory breakthrough, Polkadot ranks among the 5 best altcoins to buy now, especially for those anticipating a surge in institutional interest. 5. XRP: Ascendancy Through Stablecoin Innovations Despite continuous regulatory challenges, XRP remains a powerhouse in the cryptocurrency market. The introduction of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, supported by Chainlink’s data feeds, has injected new vigor into the project. This partnership bolsters XRP’s significance in cross-border payments and is likely to enhance its adoption across financial institutions. Trading at $2.83, XRP is a preferred choice for those prioritizing utility-centric projects. Its widespread examination by global banks and fintech firms for quicker international payments underscores its practical application. XRP’s expanding network renders it one of the 5 best altcoins to buy now, particularly appealing to those keen on projects with robust institutional support. Wrapping Up Securing the top crypto opportunities entails looking past the excitement to concentrate on genuine applications, growth prospects, and strategic market placement. BlockDAG is notable for its significant presale achievements and forthcoming exchange debuts, while Litecoin is primed for a potential upswing. Chainlink’s critical position in blockchain infrastructure ensures its continued demand, Polkadot’s ETF opportunity could unlock institutional doors, and XRP is broadening its impact in the finance domain. For those scouting the 5 best altcoins to buy now, these initiatives offer a blend of innovation, robust fundamentals, and imminent catalysts. Whether you’re targeting early growth phases like BlockDAG or established functionalities like XRP and Chainlink, these altcoins provide prime opportunities for gains in 2025. The key lies in engaging before the market fully recognizes their value.

Due to market-wide bearish pressure, the token dropped nearly 25% in a single day. However, XRP has since regained most of its losses, showing resistance despite uncertain conditions. Now, the XRP/BTC ratio is flashing a potential breakout signal, which could set the stage for a 200% rally. XRP Poised for a Bollinger Band Breakout? While many altcoins have struggled against Bitcoin’s dominance, XRP appears to be showing signs of strength. According to some market analysts, XRP/BTC is now testing the upper Bollinger Band on the monthly chart for the first time since 2017. Bollinger Bands measure market volatility, and a breakout above the upper band is often seen as a sign of strong bullish momentum. If XRP successfully breaks through, it could mean a change in market sentiment, leading to a potential surge similar to what was seen in April 2017. At that time, XRP/BTC skyrocketed by 200% after a similar breakout pattern. XRP Price Analysis Despite the recent market turbulence, XRP has shown remarkable recovery. After dropping to $1.78, its lowest level since November, the cryptocurrency bounced back, closing the day with a 15% gain. This recovery has formed a “hammer” pattern on the XRP chart, a technical indicator that suggests strong buying interest at lower price levels. Analysts believe that if XRP can maintain its current momentum, it could soon retest the $3.10 resistance level. A further push might even bring it close to its all−time high of $3.40. However, this bullish outlook would be invalidated if XRP drops below the critical $2 support level.",News,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-04 12:17:32

Agent A.I. & Pepe Set to Explode in 2025!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/memecoin-etfs-incoming-agent-a-i-pepe-set-to-explode-in-2025/,"Excitement brews in the crypto world as memecoin ETFs are poised to make a splash in 2025. With the market on an upward trend, attention focuses on emerging stars like Agent A.I. and Pepe. These coins, known for their playful nature, are now seen as serious contenders with potential for significant gains. Agent A.I. stands out with its clever approach, positioning itself as a real memecoin among fake AI agents. Inspired by the success of Pepe, which once soared tremendously, Agent A.I. aims to capture similar enthusiasm. As investors look for new opportunities, these coins provide intriguing options in the evolving crypto landscape. Artificial Idiot Among Us: Agent A.I. Denounces Fake AI Agents The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents —shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Agent A.I. has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is a 100% meme coin . Agent A.I. is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: Agent A.I.’s True Identity Keep this under wraps: Agent A.I. is a Pepe in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%, this covert operative has the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Agent A.I. Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Agent A.I. is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Post-Presale Mission Expansion Think of the presale as a training for the big mission. Once the $AGNT token goes public, the mission will expand to strategic KOL partnerships and development of AI powered tools to fuel growth and engagement. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Agent A.I. isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs. Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited. Final Orders: Deploy Capital & Secure Your $AGNT Now This is your shot to join crypto’s most ridiculous yet lucrative mission. The best entries go to the fastest trigger fingers. Don’t be the guy who “wished he got in early.” The mission is set. The presale is live. Are you in, or will you let the AI fakes win? Buy $AGNT Early for a Bigger Discount From Meme to Market: The Rise of PEPE Coin in Crypto In the early 2000s, Matt Furie’s cartoon frog, Pepe, became an internet sensation. This viral meme has now leaped into the crypto world as PEPE, a deflationary meme coin on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard. Embracing simplicity and a strong community, PEPE stays true to its roots by keeping things fun and transparent. PEPE’s goals are straightforward: Phase 1 is “Meme,” Phase 2 is “Vibe and HODL,” and Phase 3 is “Meme Takeover.” The token’s price depends solely on market sentiment and demand, with a capped supply of 420.69 trillion tokens. For PEPE to rise, it relies on ongoing interest and support from its community of holders. After reaching an all-time high of $0.00002825 on December 10, 2024, PEPE experienced a significant sell-off, losing about 68.59% of its value. This volatility reflects the profit-taking by early investors. Future growth may depend on renewed interest from both previous holders and new buyers drawn to its meme appeal. Analysts are divided on PEPE’s long-term prospects. Valdrin Tahiri predicts continued growth, citing technical indicators and the possibility of a “meme coin season” boosting prices. On the other hand, Steven Walgenbach foresees further declines, pointing to indicators like the MACD and SMA that suggest ongoing selling pressure. Price predictions for PEPE vary widely. In 2025, forecasts range from CoinPedia’s average price of $0.000055 to Changelly’s $0.0027. Looking further ahead to 2030, estimates span from $0.000014 to as high as $0.0182. While uncertainty remains, PEPE’s blend of meme culture and crypto innovation keeps it a topic of interest in the evolving market. Conclusion In the current bullish market, traditional memecoins like PEPE may offer limited short-term potential. With the market flooded by tokens lacking genuine value, investors might find fewer opportunities for significant gains in these familiar names. Agent A.I. steps into the scene to challenge the status quo of fake AI-themed tokens. As an authentic memecoin with a mission to bring both humor and substantial returns, it distinguishes itself through transparency and community involvement. With its unique approach and dedicated community, Agent A.I. positions itself as a standout contender poised for remarkable growth in 2025.
