A shift is happening—Ethereum and Shiba Inu holders are starting to explore something new in the form of a new meme coin.

Now, fresh changes are sweeping the markets, especially from the meme coins and some Ethereum holders are looking for new opportunities. With the recent uncertainty of Ethereum price predictions, investors are beginning to explore alternative high-growth opportunities beyond ETH. Shiba Inu is also going through a rough patch on the price charts.

Even though Ethereum and Shiba Inu are leading in the DeFi and meme coin spaces, respectively, they face tough competition from newer entries in the market. With ongoing debates about the ETH price forecast for the coming years, investors are seeking assets with greater growth potential. A notable shift is taking place—Ethereum and Shiba Inu investors are turning their attention to an emerging meme coin. Ethereum and Shiba Inu Backers Seek Out a Fresh Meme Coin Ethereum transformed the DeFi landscape through its smart contracts and dApps, elevating its ETH token to the top of the altcoin hierarchy. However, recent shifts, particularly within the meme coin sector, have prompted some Ethereum enthusiasts to explore new opportunities. With the current unpredictability of Ethereum 's price projections, investors are venturing beyond ETH in search of high-growth alternatives. Shiba Inu is also experiencing turbulence in its price trends. Despite broadening its ecosystem, Shiba Inu traders are facing challenges as the meme coin is currently experiencing a 35.8% monthly decline. To recoup their losses, many Shiba Inu investors are now scouting for new projects that might be the best coins to invest in.

With a promise of a whooping 100x returns post-listing, this token is capturing the attention of Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) investors eager for the next big breakout. As momentum builds, many believe 1Fuel is the new crypto to buy before it skyrockets. Meanwhile, fresh ADA news points to shifting investor strategies, with seasoned traders scouting for emerging opportunities. Could 1Fuel be the catalyst for a major market shake-up this February? The growing excitement suggests something huge is on the horizon. 1Fuel Crypto Revolution: Why Solana & Cardano Investors Are Excited About This New Token 1Fuel is set to redefine decentralized finance (DeFi) by addressing some of its biggest challenges with its innovative features. With seamless cross-chain transactions and cutting-edge privacy tools, 1Fuel is positioned to meet the growing demand for smarter and more efficient DeFi platforms. This isn’t just another crypto project; it’s a force driving the crypto revolution. Its innovative revenue-sharing model and staking rewards offering up to 30% APR makes 1Fuel a standout opportunity for passive long-term growth. These features, combined with the surging interest from Solana and Cardano communities, make 1Fuel a major player in the DeFi space, one that’s ready to lead the charge in the upcoming months. The 1Fuel token (OFT) presale is already turning heads, with over 174 million tokens sold and over $1.77M raised . Early investors are already enjoying 70% returns on their initial investments. As the token remains priced at an attractive $0.017, many are rushing to secure their share before the price climbs. This presale has become one of the most talked-about events in DeFi, sparking excitement among investors who see the potential for explosive growth in February. Cardano News: ADA's Market Moves Stir Investor Excitement Amid 1Fuel's Rise February is shaping up to be a great month for Cardano, as recent news highlights its strategic push to enhance ecosystem liquidity and scalability. With the integration of USDC and the rollout of other key upgrades, ADA is positioning itself as a major player in the crypto revolution. These strategic decisions are crucial as ADA's price dynamics continue to change and influence investor sentiment and market positioning. Cardano has also been making headlines with its recent market performance. As of February 2, 2025, ADA is trading at around $0.3125 , a 3.84% increase over the last 24 hours. This surge in ADA's price action has sparked mixed reactions in the crypto community, especially as the broader market witnesses serious developments from projects like 1Fuel. Solana Price Shake-Up: Why Investors Are Watching 1Fuel This February Solana’s price action has been quite a thing of interest lately. SOL price took a hit recently, dipping 7.96% in the past 24 hours to around $193.45 . While some traders see this as a warning sign, savvy investors know better—market pullbacks often set the stage for massive comebacks. With February shaping up to be a big month for crypto, SOL’s next move is one to watch out for. What’s got traders on edge? A looming short squeeze could liquidate up to $220 million in short positions, forcing the SOL price to surge. If this plays out, Solana bulls could have the last laugh. Conclusion With SOL price showing volatility and Cardano news sparking fresh investor interest, now is the perfect time to get in on 1Fuel’s presale.

Fast-forward to today, its growth has slowed, and many question whether ADA can recreate its glory days. Meanwhile, Elluminex, a new DeFi platform launching on the TON blockchain, offers a bold vision for the crypto space with its advanced features. If you’re looking for the next big opportunity, this might be it. ADA Drops Over 60% Cardano is a third-generation proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform that emphasizes scalability, interoperability, and sustainability for decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. The platform has undergone several development phases, introducing new features to enhance its functionality and performance. In 2021, Cardano's native cryptocurrency, ADA, experienced significant price appreciation, reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $3.09. However, the growth was not sustained, indicating reduced interest. As of press time, ADA is trading at $0.9648, a 68.7767% decrease from its ATH. Recent analyses suggest that ADA’s resistance at $1.09 prevents an upward breakout. Some speculators believe ADA could rally past $2 in the first quarter of 2025, provided it overcomes current resistance levels and attracts renewed interest. However, impatient holders are shifting focus to promising projects like Elluminex. Elluminex To Outperform Cardano Cardano has lagged due to its slower ecosystem development, but Elluminex delivers immediate, practical solutions for DeFi. It comprises a decentralized exchange (DEX), staking, farming, cross-chain bridging, and early token launch access—all designed to create value from day one. While Cardano focuses on building its ecosystem, Elluminex bridges the gap between over 40 blockchain networks. This cross-chain interoperability enables seamless liquidity flow and asset transfers, giving it a significant edge in attracting users from established networks like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Solana. Additionally, Elluminex is introducing advanced tools like an AI-powered portfolio tracker to simplify the DeFi experience. The goal is to make trading, staking, and portfolio management more intuitive for novice and experienced users. The ELX token is central to the platform, providing rewards for staking, liquidity, and ecosystem participation. As Elluminex gains traction, early adopters of the token will benefit from price appreciation, rewards, and exclusive access to new projects launched on TON. Elluminex currently offers a presale for ELX tokens, allowing traders to buy in at a discounted price before it launches on exchanges. This is an opportunity to secure an early position in a token with high potential.

However, as we look at the present, its momentum has slowed considerably, leaving many to wonder if ADA can ever return to its former peak. Meanwhile, Elluminex is entering the scene as a fresh DeFi platform on the TON blockchain, bringing a daring new approach with its cutting-edge features. For those seeking the next major opportunity, this could be a prime candidate. ADA Experiences Over 60% Decline Cardano is recognized as a third-generation proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform, with a focus on scalability, interoperability, and sustainability for decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Through several stages of development, the platform has introduced multiple features to boost its capabilities and performance. Back in 2021, Cardano's native coin, ADA, saw a remarkable increase in value, peaking at an all-time high (ATH) of $3.09. However, this rapid growth was not maintained, signaling waning interest. Currently, ADA is valued at $0.9648, reflecting a 68.7767% drop from its ATH. Recent studies indicate that the $1.09 resistance level is preventing ADA from breaking upward. Some analysts speculate that ADA might surpass $2 in the first quarter of 2025 if it manages to overcome current resistance barriers and regain investor interest. Nonetheless, impatient investors are turning their attention to innovative projects like Elluminex. Why Elluminex Might Surpass Cardano Cardano has fallen behind due to its slower ecosystem development, whereas Elluminex provides immediate, tangible solutions for DeFi. It includes a decentralized exchange (DEX), staking, farming, cross-chain bridging, and early access to token launches—all aimed at generating value right from the start. While Cardano is still building its ecosystem, Elluminex connects more than 40 blockchain networks. This cross-chain interoperability allows for smooth liquidity movement and asset transfers, making it appealing to users from established networks like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Solana. Moreover, Elluminex is rolling out advanced features like an AI-driven portfolio tracker to simplify the DeFi experience. The aim is to make trading, staking, and portfolio management easier for both beginners and seasoned users. The ELX token plays a critical role in the platform, offering rewards for staking, liquidity provision, and ecosystem involvement. As Elluminex gains momentum, early ELX token adopters stand to benefit from price increases, rewards, and exclusive access to new projects launching on TON. Elluminex is currently holding a presale for ELX tokens, giving traders an opportunity to purchase them at a reduced price before they hit the exchanges.

Per Energy Kyungjae , the city – in Gyeonggi Province – will launch “its own electronic virtual asset seizing system.” South Korean City to Strike Out on Its Own in Hunt for Tax Dodgers’ Crypto Crypto trading is not yet subject to taxation in South Korea. However, Seoul has given local tax bodies the right to seize crypto belonging to “habitual” or “large-scale” residents who fail to pay local levies. The South Korean city of Gwacheon. (Source: NordNordWest [edited][CC BY-SA 3.0 DE]) Until recently, Gwacheon used IT solutions operated by the wider Gyeonggi Province to identify crypto wallets belonging to tax delinquents living in the city. Tax officers used the solution to scan domestic crypto exchange wallet data. When they identified wallets belonging to Gwacheon-resident tax offenders, they could then seize coins. In some cases, residents have then followed up by settling their outstanding tax bills. In others, the province has liquidated the coins. It has then handed fiat over to the city. But Gwacheon’s move to launch its own IT solution, independent of Gyeonggi Province’s own solution, suggests smaller cities and counties could look to expand the reach of their tax evasion crackdowns. The city has a population of 85,397, per the Korea Ministry of the Interior and Safety’s 2024 statistics. South Korea's digital media landscape has expanded at a breakneck pace, but the surge in numbers masks deep structural problems, recent government data shows. https://t.co/oXai3RgUDg — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) February 3, 2025 Gwacheon Targets 361 ‘Tax Evaders’ Gwacheon said its solution would go online next month. Officials said that it would follow up with “full-scale collection procedures starting in the first half of 2025.” These have already yielded significant results. In the past five years, Gwacheon says it has seized crypto worth approximately 300 million won (just under $205,000) from tax dodgers. South Korea’s Acting President Choi Sang-mok met with local exporters and vowed support for them following Donald Trump’s announcement of tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico. https://t.co/KpR7kmkIO5 — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) February 3, 2025 Gwacheon tax officials confiscated over a third of this amount in 2024, a further sign that the city is becoming more efficient in its crypto-collection measures. The city said that it was responding to a sharp rise in crypto-related activity in Gwacheon and beyond. As such, it said, the city has noticed an increase in “cases of virtual assets being used as a means of hiding delinquents’ assets.” Gwacheon says it will focus on searching for crypto wallets belonging to “361 residents who have failed to pay more than 3 million won [just over $2,000] in local taxes.” The city said the group owes Gwacheon over $12.8 million worth of taxes. “We will ensure the tax system is fair by taking strong responses to tax delinquents. We will actively block tax evasion by seizing virtual assets.” Gwacheon Tax Division Head Kang Min-ah South Korean city authorities in places like Goyang have also begun using similar solutions to seize crypto belonging to residents with outstanding traffic fines .

Solana (SOL) has been making waves with some impressive price movements, surging by almost 50% of its value in mid January. Meanwhile, a newcomer has been racking up attention in the PayFi space as it promises to address issues in the global payments sector. This project goes by the name Remittix (RTX) , and has amassed more than $10 million in just a few weeks of presale. So why is Remittix seeing so much attention, and will Solana see more price surges this year? Solana (SOL) Prepares For Hyperledger Solang Project Solana (SOL) is trading at $228 after a 8% dip in the last week. However, Solana’s immense surge in mid January means that its net gain still stands at 20% for the month. On the horizon for Solana is the Hyperledger Solang project that has opened Solana up to Ethereum's Solidity developers, providing a new way for them to build on the platform. Technical analysis is promising for Solana, suggesting that if buyers can push the price above $260, bullish momentum may resume, potentially targeting the $300 level and beyond. However, failure to maintain current support levels could lead to further declines before any potential upward movement. Remittix Creates New Possibilities in the PayFi Space Remittix (RTX) is catching fire as investors take notice of its bold entry into the cross-border payments space. The project aims to remove the inefficiencies that plague traditional financial systems, allowing users to swap over 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT and transfer money to any global bank account. Unlike banks and outdated payment providers that stack on hidden fees, Remittix keeps it simple with flat-rate pricing, ensuring that recipients get exactly what was sent. The Remittix Pay API is of great help to businesses, simplifying crypto transactions by letting companies accept digital payments while automatically settling in FIAT. This is a powerful capability for freelancers, e-commerce merchants and international enterprises that are looking to benefit from crypto without being affected by market volatility. Another feature that sets Remittix (RTX) apart is its privacy. Every transaction is processed as a standard bank transfer, meaning the recipient has no idea the payment originally started as crypto. This level of discretion is becoming increasingly rare in financial systems, making Remittix an attractive option for users who value control over their transactions. Remittix Dominates In Presale, Surpassing $10 Million Raised The $RTX token fuels the entire ecosystem, serving as the backbone for staking, governance and platform rewards. With a hard cap of 1.5 billion tokens, scarcity is built into its framework, making early accumulation potentially lucrative. Right now, $RTX tokens are priced at $0.521 in presale and over $10 million has already been raised. Crypto analysts are eyeing massive gains, predicting an 800% jump before the presale ends and another rally post-launch. As Remittix (RTX) gains traction in the $190 trillion cross-border payments industry, it’s shaping up to be one of the biggest crypto disruptors of 2025.

Solana (SOL) is making headlines with notable price increases, having jumped nearly 50% in value around mid-January. Meanwhile, a new player is gaining traction in the PayFi arena, aiming to tackle challenges in international payments. This project, known as Remittix (RTX) , has already gathered over $10 million in just a few weeks of its presale. So, what’s driving the buzz around Remittix, and could Solana experience further price hikes this year? Solana (SOL) Gears Up For the Hyperledger Solang Initiative Solana (SOL) is currently valued at $228 following an 8% decline over the past week. Despite this setback, the significant rise seen in mid-January keeps its monthly gain at 20%. Looking ahead, Solana is set to benefit from the Hyperledger Solang project, which has opened doors for Ethereum's Solidity developers to build on its platform, offering new opportunities. Technical indicators are optimistic for Solana, indicating that if the price is pushed above $260 by buyers, it could reignite a bullish trend, potentially aiming for the $300 mark and beyond. However, failing to sustain current support levels might lead to further drops before any upward recovery. Remittix Unlocks Fresh Opportunities in the PayFi Sector Remittix (RTX) is rapidly gaining ground as investors recognize its ambitious entry into the cross-border payments domain. The project seeks to eliminate inefficiencies plaguing traditional financial routes, enabling users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT and send funds to any global bank account. In contrast to banks and outdated payment services that impose hidden charges, Remittix offers straightforward flat-rate pricing, ensuring that recipients receive the exact amount sent. The Remittix Pay API is a valuable tool for businesses, streamlining crypto transactions by allowing firms to accept digital payments with automatic FIAT settlements. This feature is incredibly beneficial for freelancers, online retailers, and international companies looking to embrace crypto without being affected by market fluctuations. Another standout aspect of Remittix (RTX) is its focus on privacy. Each transaction is processed as a regular bank transfer, so the recipient is unaware that the payment originated in cryptocurrency. This level of confidentiality is increasingly rare in financial systems, making Remittix appealing to users who prioritize control over their transactions. Remittix Takes the Lead in Presale, Exceeding $10 Million in Funds Raised The $RTX token is central to the ecosystem, acting as the foundation for staking, governance, and platform incentives. With a limited supply of 1.5 billion tokens, built-in scarcity could make early acquisition profitable. Currently, $RTX tokens are available for $0.521 during the presale, with over $10 million already secured. Crypto experts are forecasting substantial gains, anticipating an 800% increase before the presale concludes and further growth after launch. As Remittix (RTX) gains momentum in the $190 trillion cross-border payments market, it’s emerging as a potential major disruptor in the crypto world by 2025.

While Dogecoin once led the industry, newer projects like Panshibi ($SHIBI) are gaining attention. This rising token blends Asian culture, memes and technology, proving Dogecoin (DOGE) is no longer the only major player and that meme coins are evolving beyond internet jokes. Panshibi: The Meme Coin Revolution Taking Over Panshibi is quickly emerging as the next big meme coin set to dominate the scene in 2025. Combining Asia’s massive crypto community with the universal appeal of pandas, Panshibioffers a unique twist on the traditional meme coin model. Unlike Dogecoin and other meme coins, Panshibi incorporates SocialFi and AI, providing holders with interactive quests, rewards and governance rights. The $SHIBI token powers this ecosystem, offering investors high-yield staking opportunities of up to 1,200% APY and exclusive perks for early adopters. The presale is priced at just $0.004, but this won’t last long. As demand grows, the price will rise to $0.005 and continue increasing with each new stage. For those seeking the top meme coins to invest in, Panshibi is a worthy option. The presale is capped at $10 million and lasts only 60 days. During this period, the price is set to increase by 1,200%, with post-launch projections predicting a staggering 145,000% rise. Early investors will also gain access to the exclusive Bamboo Private VIP Club, unlocking additional rewards and benefits. Security and transparency are top priorities for Panshibi. The project has passed a full smart contract audit with Coinsult, ensuring investor confidence. The liquidity pool will be locked for 10 years and team tokens will remain inaccessible for 2 years, ensuring long-term stability. With time running out, now is the moment to act. Don't miss your chance to join the presale and secure your place before prices surge. Dogecoin Faces Pressure As Market Dynamics Shift Dogecoin (DOGE), once a top contender in the meme coin space, is now feeling significant pressure as newer projects like Panshibi gain traction. The Dogecoin price is now trading at $0.276 , down by 21.6% over the last week and almost 27% on the monthly trends. Analysts project that this dip could continue into the new month if the bulls don’t gain control of the Dogecoin price, with prices potentially hitting $0.25 by the end of February. The Dogecoin market is currently on a predominately bearish course, as represented by the price reading of the Fear & Greed Index. Though benefitting from various high-profile endorsements, Dogecoin finds itself taken over in popularity by the likes of newer meme coins with a utility focus, such as Panshibi. The Future Of Meme Coins: Why Panshibi Stands Out As DOGE news today highlights, the meme coin market is shifting and Dogecoin faces increasing pressure. Since the Dogecoin price has dropped to $0.276, analysts predict further declines may happen. This trend, combined with bearish sentiment, suggests Dogecoin's dominance may be slipping. Investors are now looking at newer projects like Panshibi that provide more innovative features, leaving Dogecoin (DOGE) under pressure in a changing market. Panshibi is a project with a unique combination of SocialFi, AI technology and cultural relevance.

Last week Monday, the fallout from the DeepSeek AI model launch hit the crypto market hard, sending the flagship crypto, Bitcoin, below $100,000. However, it recovered above the $100,000 mark before the week ended. The story is similar this week as markets plunged to historic depths thanks to trepidation caused by President Donald Trump’s tariff threats. Even though Bitcoin dipped as low as $91,000, it has already reclaimed the $100,000 at the time of publication. Notably, one aspect of the market that has stayed immune to this volatility is the RWA sector. The merits of tokenization are just now coming to light, and it is still a severely undervalued sector in its infancy. It also stands to gain from the regulatory clarity that the Trump administration is expected to bring to crypto as various jurisdictions have even started developing frameworks. According to data from RWA.xyz , a site that provides analytics on tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) like stablecoins, tokenized US Treasuries, bonds, cash equivalents, and other commodities (like gold, silver, and oil), the sector has been growing steadily. The total value of tokenized real-world assets (RWA) on-chain is now $17.10 billion, which reflects a 10.02% increase over the past 30 days. Holders have increased to 82,978, with a total of 112 issuers. Over the same 30-day period, the premier crypto BTC only rose about 2% while ETH fell by over 20% while enduring wide volatility swings in between. Other altcoins have suffered even more, and investor confidence dips and surges with price. The global RWA market is up and to the right According to data from RWA.xyz, the market cap of stablecoins is currently at $213.86 billion, having experienced a 4.84% increase in the last month. Meanwhile the monthly transfer volume is $3.35 trillion, down almost 28% from 30 days ago, and the number of holders has surpassed 140M. The largest issuer remains Tether, with Circle in second place and Ethena in third. Leading tokenized assets include USDT at $138.50 billion, USDC at $52.20 billion, and USYC at $1.20 billion. RWA market overview. Source: RWA.xyz The institutional funds section of the data monitors tokenized alternatives such as hedge funds, venture capital, private equity, and private credit. It holds a total value of $410.49 million, up 11.52% from 30 days ago. There are currently 8,343 asset holders and 48 monthly active addresses participating in the tokenized institutional funds market. Private credit data focuses on the tokenization of private credit loans. According to data, active and total loan values are now at $11.81 billion and $21.49 billion, respectively, with a current average APR of 10.10%. The loans now total 2,414, with a bulk of them on the Provenance and Ethereum network. Tokenized commodities include digital assets pegged to commodities like gold, silver, and oil. It has a $1.14 billion market cap, with a monthly transfer volume of over $400 million. There are also 3,630 monthly active addresses and nearly 60,000 holders now. While precious metal products are already available, agricultural and oil & gas products are expected to be included soon. RWAs as a diversification strategy While Ethereum has underperformed in the bull run, the network holds the top spot in terms of RWA tokenization activities. It currently leads with 67 RWAs valued at $3.77 billion. ZKsync Era follows with 28 RWAs valued at $1.93 billion and Arbitrum follows with 20 assets and a $75.84 billion valuation. Other networks with RWAs include Polygon and Base, both with 19 assets each. Polygon has a $181.35 million valuation, while Base lags behind with a $51.54 million. Solana, currently one of the hottest networks because it is home to the top-performing memecoins, has not done so well with RWAs. It has only three, valued at $135.47 million. More investors are increasingly looking into RWAs as a way to diversify their portfolios and interact with tokenized versions of real-world assets. RWAs cover tangible assets like real estate, commodities, and infrastructure. These assets usually have different risk profiles relative to traditional financial assets. Some RWAs can help manage risk by reducing exposure to market volatility. They are also known to have low correlation with stocks and bonds, which makes them some sort of buffer against market downturns. Tokenized versions of commodities like gold can also be used as shields against inflation and currency devaluation. Many of them also generate regular income, such as rental income from real estate or dividends from infrastructure projects.

While Dogecoin once led the industry, newer projects like Panshibi ($SHIBI) are gaining attention. This rising token blends Asian culture, memes and technology, proving Dogecoin (DOGE) is no longer the only major player and that meme coins are evolving beyond internet jokes. Panshibi: Leading the Charge in the Meme Coin Revolution Panshibi is rapidly positioning itself as the meme coin to watch in 2025. By merging Asia's vast crypto audience with the charming appeal of pandas, Panshibi presents a novel spin on the conventional meme coin framework. Unlike Dogecoin and its counterparts, Panshibi integrates SocialFi and AI to offer holders interactive missions, rewards, and governance privileges. The $SHIBI token fuels this framework, delivering high-yield staking options up to 1,200% APY and special bonuses for early supporters. The presale is set at a price of $0.004, but this rate will rise as demand increases, going up to $0.005 and beyond with each presale stage. For those on the lookout for top meme coins for investment, Panshibi stands out as a strong contender. The presale is limited to $10 million and is open for just 60 days. During this time, the price is expected to surge by 1,200%, with post-launch estimates forecasting a jaw-dropping 145,000% increase. Early backers will also have the chance to join the exclusive Bamboo Private VIP Club, unlocking further rewards and incentives. Security and transparency remain core commitments for Panshibi.

The liquidity pool will be locked for a decade, and team tokens will be inaccessible for two years, supporting long-term security. Time is of the essence; seize the opportunity to join the presale before prices escalate. Dogecoin Feels the Strain as Market Dynamics Evolve Dogecoin (DOGE), once a leading figure in the meme coin realm, now faces intense competition from newcomers like Panshibi. The Dogecoin price currently stands at $0.276 , reflecting a 21.6% drop over the past week and a nearly 27% decline over the month. Experts suggest this downward trend might persist into the next month if the bulls fail to regain control over the Dogecoin price, potentially dipping to $0.25 by the end of February. Currently, the Dogecoin market is largely bearish, as indicated by the Fear & Greed Index. Despite benefiting from several high-profile endorsements, Dogecoin is now overshadowed by newer, utility-focused meme coins like Panshibi. The Future of Meme Coins: Panshibi's Unique Edge Today's DOGE news underscores a changing meme coin landscape, with Dogecoin experiencing mounting pressure. As the Dogecoin price slips to $0.276, analysts foresee further reductions. This pattern, combined with a bearish outlook, suggests Dogecoin's supremacy may be waning. Investors are turning to newer ventures like Panshibi that offer more advanced features, placing Dogecoin (DOGE) under strain in this evolving market.

Its rapid transaction capabilities and successful presale have experts predicting a potential 100x surge, making it a standout investment amid shifting market dynamics. Dogecoin (DOGE) Catches Whales’ Attention Amid ETF Buzz In the past week, crypto whales snapped up over 560 million DOGE , hinting at renewed confidence in its future. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted this trend, pointing to the steady accumulation as a sign that big players are eyeing potential gains. This shift follows a sharp sell-off, which makes the timing interesting. On-chain data reveals long-term holders quietly adding to their positions, suggesting that sentiment might be turning bullish. Historically, these accumulation patterns often appear before major price moves, so the market is watching closely. Even more exciting is a fresh filing for a spot Dogecoin ETF. The SEC has started reviewing the proposal under its 19b-4 process, with an initial decision expected within 45 days of its publication in the Federal Register. If needed, the review could stretch to 90 days. Should the SEC give the green light, Grayscale would join other major firms offering crypto-based ETFs alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. If a spot Dogecoin ETF is approved, it would be a huge milestone. It would push DOGE into the financial mainstream and reshape how investors view meme coins. As regulatory decisions unfold, DOGE holders will watch closely, eager to see how this chapter plays out. 1Fuel (OFT) Redefines the crypto trading experience 1Fuel (OFT) is starting to turn heads, for a good reason. Unlike most projects that stick to the same old formula, 1Fuel focuses on making crypto trading simple. No more juggling different wallets for every coin. Just one place to manage everything hassle-free. Security is a guaranteed feature, but 1Fuel goes beyond the basics. It offers disposable wallets, smart encryption layers, and a privacy mixer that keeps transactions under the radar. For anyone worried about safety, it’s like having a digital vault. What’s interesting is how it blends DeFi tools with AI. Predicting market shifts, automating trades, and flagging suspicious activity are handled effortlessly. This isn’t just another wallet; it’s a full-on crypto command center. The peer-to-peer setup means traders have no middlemen, which means lower fees and faster trades. Plus, there’s the cool factor of having crypto cards, both virtual and physical, that work like regular debit and credit cards. Add staking rewards up to 30% APR, and it is easy to understand why crypto communities are abuzz. At its core, 1Fuel isn't attempting to redefine crypto trading; it is making it smarter, quicker, and safer. 1Fuel Launches Presale with $1.7 Million Raised—Is This the Next 100x Crypto? 1Fuel’s (OFT) presale is gaining serious traction. Over 170 million tokens have been sold, raising more than $1.7 million. At just $0.017 per token, OFT offers an early entry point before its anticipated 100x surge post-launch. As 1Fuel gears up for its public debut, investors see this as a rare chance to secure massive gains. Ready to get in early?

Although miners play a critical role in the growth of Bitcoin, a lot of risk and operational expenses are involved. Purchasing mining hardware and acquiring land for facilities is expensive . Miners also struggle to maintain revenue due to the volatility of Bitcoin (BTC) . Hashrate Derivative Products Gain Interest Bitcoin miners today are therefore exploring new ways to ensure that their operations remain profitable. One of these ways is through the financialization of Bitcoin mining hashrate . For this week's Forwards Market update, both USD and BTC contracts are trading in backwardation. The hashrate forward market is pricing in an average hashprice of $55.25 (0.00054 BTC) over the next six months. pic.twitter.com/rVlYs5M7G2 — Luxor Technology (@luxor) February 3, 2025 Andy Fajar Handika, CEO of Loka Mining, told Cryptonews that “hashrate derivatives” allow Bitcoin miners to hedge against fluctuations in mining revenue by locking in a fixed price for their future hashrate. “This means that miners can secure predictable cash flows regardless of Bitcoin’s price volatility or changes in network difficulty,” Fajar Handika said. How Miners Can Sell Future Hashrate For example, Loka Protocol is a platform that enables Bitcoin miners to sell their future hashrate in the form of tokenized mining contracts. Fajar Handika explained that these contracts function similarly to commodity futures in traditional markets. “Just like corn farmers hedge against crop price fluctuations, Bitcoin miners can sell hashrate contracts upfront to secure capital while investors gain exposure to mining rewards without operating hardware,” he said. Source: Loka This concept reduces risk for both parties, while making mining financing more accessible. Ryan Condron, CEO of Titan.io, told Cryptonews that hashpower marketplace Lumerin offers a decentralized ecosystem for miners to sell off their hashpower for up to 7 days in the future. Bitcoin mining hashpower can then be traded by Lumerin users on-chain. Aaron Foster, director of business development at Luxor Technology, told Cryptonews that Luxor also offers a “Non-Deliverable Forward” (NDF) product that allows miners to take a position on hashprice. “This lets miners effectively lock in 1-12 month revenue certainty for their mining operations (this product is also available to non-miners as well),” Foster said. “Miners are naturally long Bitcoin (hashprice), so taking a position and locking in a price to create revenue certainty makes sense.” Foster believes that hashrate derivatives will likely extend the lifetime of mining operations by reducing exposure to short-term downturns. Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Derivatives Critical With Rising Bitcoin Price It’s also interesting to point out that as the price of Bitcoin rises, hashrate derivatives are becoming more important. Fajar Handika explained that as more miners enter the market, the Bitcoin network faces increasing difficulty . This makes it harder for existing miners to maintain profitability. “Hashrate derivatives provide upfront liquidity that allows Bitcoin miners to buy new hardware and expand operations,” he said. Financializing hashrate may also reduce the need for miners to sell off their BTC over time. “Instead of selling mined Bitcoin at lower prices to cover operational costs, miners can use forward hashrate contracts to secure capital without giving up their BTC holdings,” Fajar Handika remarked. Echoing this, Foster noted that miners who hedge their exposure to hashprice volatility as a percentage of their operational costs will lock in longer-term profit margins before a depressed hashprice market develops. “These instruments allow miners to hedge against hashprice volatility, making mining more predictable and financing easier,” he commented. Hashrate Derivative Products Gain Traction While hashrate derivatives have been a known concept for a few years, industry experts believe that this is finally catching on for both Bitcoin miners and institutions. Speaking about the topic at The North American Blockchain Summit (NABS) in November last year, Condron stated, “This is very much the next stage in this market for evolution and maturity. The financialization of hashpower needs to be treated more as a commodity than a hobby.” Foster – who was also on the derivatives panel at NABS – further remarked that institutions want to buy hashrate to get exposure to this asset class. He explained that this is why Luxor created its NDF product. “We created that product to service the institutional side to allow them access to the product without having to go through the hurdles of setting up on the physical side,” he said. Luxor’s end of year summary report for 2024 notes that its hashrate derivative product witnessed exponential growth. The report states that last year Luxor’s hashrate derivatives were used by public and private miners, prop trading funds, financiers, market makers, hosting providers, hashrate marketplaces, and ASIC brokers. “On the business side, we onboarded 30 new clients into our markets and traded $65 million in notional USD, settling about 1.2EH per day on average,” the report states. Source: Luxor It’s further documented that interest from miners and traditional finance communities reached a record high at the end of 2024. As a result, Luxor has continued to expand its product offering by increasing its tenures to 12 months in duration. The company also recently launched hashrate exchange-traded futures. Additionally, last week Grayscale announced the launch of a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering exposure to Bitcoin mining . Known as “Grayscale Bitcoin Miners ETF” (MNRS), the fund specifically invests in companies that comprise the Indxx Bitcoin Miners Index. This is a proprietary index designed to measure the performance of global Bitcoin mining companies that generate the majority of their revenue from Bitcoin mining or mining-related hardware, software, services, and projects. Key Hurdles for Miners and Institutions While hashrate derivatives are becoming more popular, challenges may prevent some miners and institutions from using these products. Fajar Handika pointed out that this is likely due to a lack of education around these offerings. “Many miners are unfamiliar with these products and may hesitate to use them,” he said. Liquidity concerns also remain, as Fajar Handika noted that investors must be willing to buy hashrate contracts, but if demand is low, pricing may not be favorable for miners. Moreover, decentralized derivative solutions – like the product offering from Loka Protocol – are subject to smart contract risks. Yet while challenges remain, Condron believes that all miners will eventually start to sell their hashpower. “This may be to a global hashpower ‘grid’ or mining pool. Countries, banks, and large corporations will bid against each other to buy up the hashpower in order to mine blocks and process transactions on the BTC network,” he said. Condron added that while hashrate derivatives may be a “less sexy” part of the ecosystem, miners need to start hedging strategies to generate predictable revenue regardless of market volatility. “This will help stabilize the entire ecosystem as Bitcoin continues to become part of the world’s core economic architecture,” he said.

Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is the latest buzz in the crypto world, offering incredible opportunities for early investors. As meme coins continue to make waves, APC has been steadily building momentum, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts eager to discover the next big thing. With the presale underway, investors are rushing to get a piece of the action as the project’s unique features start to shine. Meanwhile, the crypto sphere is abuzz with new developments surrounding ANDY and Osaka Protocol. ANDY is forging new partnerships that could boost its presence in the space, while Osaka Protocol is steadily advancing towards its next milestones. But today, we’re diving deeper into the exciting world of Arctic Pablo Coin. This article will cover the developments and updates of all 3 coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, ANDY, and Osaka Protocol. Arctic Pablo Coin: Token Burns That Drive Value One of the standout features of Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is its innovative token burn mechanism, which is designed to enhance scarcity and value. Every week during the presale, unsold tokens are permanently burned, reducing supply and driving demand. This continuous burn process ensures that APC maintains a deflationary environment, which means that every token in circulation is worth more. Token burns help secure long-term sustainability and make APC a promising asset for those looking to maximize their investments. By reducing the supply, Arctic Pablo Coin creates a sense of rarity, which is a key ingredient for driving up value. This burn mechanism is fully recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC ), ensuring transparency and trust. As more tokens are burned, the value of each remaining token increases, which is an attractive proposition for early investors. With the added benefit of weekly burns, the scarcity of Arctic Pablo Coin will only grow, making it one of the top cryptos to join for short term value. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: Get in Before It’s Too Late Arctic Pablo Coin has reached a critical phase in its journey, having just completed the 8th stage, called Shangri-La. In less than six days, the project finished exploring all seven locations, faster than expected, and now it’s preparing for the next leg of its journey. Right now, 1 APC is priced at an unbelievably low $0.000047, with an impressive ROI of 16,936% from the 8th stage to the listing price of $0.008. Over $870,000 has already been raised, fueling excitement around this presale. As Arctic Pablo Coin continues to “travel” and enter new locations, prices are set to rise, so this is a unique opportunity to invest at a low entry price. With the presale divided into locations, Arctic Pablo Coin offers an unconventional and exciting way for investors to get involved. As the coin progresses through each new location, the price will naturally increase, making this an opportunity you don’t want to miss. The presale’s current stage—Shangri-La—is already showing massive potential, with the price set to increase soon. So, if you’re considering entering the market, now is the time to act. Don’t wait until the price rises further—join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale and get in on one of the top cryptos to join for short term growth. Latest News on ANDY: New Partnerships and Growing Influence ANDY is continuing to expand its footprint in the cryptocurrency world. Recently, the project announced a series of strategic partnerships that are set to boost its ecosystem. These alliances will introduce new use cases and increase the utility of ANDY tokens, drawing attention from both investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. As the partnerships roll out, ANDY is poised to tap into new markets, increasing its adoption and driving future growth. The momentum surrounding ANDY is undeniable, with positive sentiment building around the project’s future prospects. As more businesses and platforms integrate ANDY, its value could see significant growth, making it one of the top cryptos to join for short term investments. Keep an eye on ANDY as its influence continues to grow, and its collaborations begin to take shape. Osaka Protocol: Key Updates and Upcoming Milestones Osaka Protocol is also showing signs of significant development. The project has recently announced updates to its underlying infrastructure, enhancing its scalability and security features. These improvements are designed to make Osaka Protocol even more robust, enabling it to handle a higher volume of transactions and attracting greater attention from developers and investors. The protocol’s technical advancements position it as a strong contender in the crypto space. As Osaka Protocol moves forward, its development team remains committed to delivering cutting-edge solutions that could reshape the blockchain ecosystem. With strong technical foundations and a growing community, Osaka Protocol is poised to achieve its next milestone soon, making it another one of the top cryptos to join for short term growth. Conclusion: Why Arctic Pablo Coin is the Top Choice for Investors All three projects— Arctic Pablo Coin, ANDY, and Osaka Protocol—are showing promising potential, but Arctic Pablo Coin stands out with its innovative presale model, token burn mechanism, and increasing momentum. As APC continues to raise funds and its price steadily increases, investors have the chance to enter at a very low entry point. With over $870,000 already raised and an ROI of 16,936% expected, Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be one of the top cryptos to join for short term growth.

New Wallet Exchange Launch Looks To Skyrocket,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/what-has-solana-just-paired-up-with-htx-trying-to-new-wallet-exchange-launch-looks-to-skyrocket,"Solana saw an explosive rally to an ATH owing to the $TRUMP token, only to experience a sharp decline after the initial hype faded. Meanwhile, HTX is making big moves with AI-powered trading and global expansion plans. But amidst the noise, one project is quietly stealing the spotlight, 1Fuel (OFT) . Unlike hype-driven tokens, 1Fuel is building a solid foundation with innovative cross-chain technology, and real-world utility. Investors looking for a long-term winner are turning to 1Fuel, which has already raised over $1.7M in its presale. Let's learn more about it! Is Solana still a buy? Price surges, airdrops, and market volatility Solana (SOL) saw some significant shifts in January 2025, most notably the introduction of the $TRUMP coin on its network. This token, which had a 200 million coin initial supply at the time of President Trump's inauguration, swiftly grew to a market value of $13.5 billion, driving Solana's price to an all-time high of $294. But after President Trump failed to discuss cryptocurrency issues on his first day in office, the token's value fell. In January 2025, the Solana environment also got ready for significant airdrops. Jupiter, a decentralized exchange aggregator on Solana, declared that 700 million JUP tokens, worth $625 million, will be distributed to about 2.3 million wallet addresses as part of its ""JUPuary"" airdrop. HTX’s bold 2025 plans: What’s ahead? Formerly known as Huobi Global, HTX has set ambitious goals for 2025. During a recent livestream called ""Hello 2025,"" the exchange revealed that it plans to expand internationally, with a focus on the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Furthermore, HTX wants to incorporate AI into its cryptocurrency services by creating smart contract apps and AI-powered tools that improve user experience. Through the HTX DAO forum and governance committees, the platform also aims to improve community governance by promoting increased user involvement in decision-making. 1Fuel’s presale boom: The next big crypto wallet? The crypto market keeps moving with innovations every day, however, only a few remain to rule the world. One such project is, 1Fuel (OFT) which is here to rule due to its solid fundamentals, revolutionary offerings, and massive profits potential. It is currently in its presale stage and has already raised more than $1.5 million. The presale has advanced to stage three, with each OFT token priced at $0.017, and over half of the token supply for this round has been sold. Global traders and investors are starting to notice its innovative strategy for transforming cryptocurrency wallets. This cryptocurrency wallet's one-click cross-chain transaction is among its most important features. It allows its users to transact effortlessly across several networks without having to pay high network fees or create separate wallets, since 1Fuel handles everything, making the entire experience faster and easier. Another feature that distinguishes 1Fuel (OFT) from rivals like MetaMask and Ledger is disposable wallets. These wallets are intended to be used just once and erased after each transaction, making it more difficult to monitor a user's activities, ensuring top-notch privacy for every user. Analysts predict over 100x returns with the project's formal listing, which has got investors from all crypto projects exploring this project as their next long-term investment. Final thoughts While the crypto market remains unpredictable, 1Fuel (OFT) is proving to be more than just another trending token. With its groundbreaking features, seamless cross-chain transactions, and privacy-focused disposable wallets, it’s setting a new standard for crypto wallets. As its presale skyrockets, early investors are positioning themselves for massive gains. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this game-changing movement, secure your 1Fuel tokens now.

According to reports , the fund is backed by Yun and a Toncoin miner, though the miner’s identity and contribution remain undisclosed to the public. A Major Investment to Fuel TON’s Growth The former President postulated that TVM Ventures is focused on advancing decentralized finance (DeFi) and payment finance (PayFi) projects within the TON network. “Regarding DeFi, it will be imperative to build natively on TON, including the smart contract logic written on TVM directly,” Yun said. “PayFi is cross-chain by nature and therefore more flexible, but 100% must support the TON network.” This move follows a related move from Ian Wittkopp and Inal Kardan, two former TON Foundation members, who have unveiled a venture capital firm, TON Ventures . Investing in Early-Stage Startups Based on reports, TVM Ventures targets early-stage startups. It will invest between $500,000 and $1 million in companies valued between $5 million and $10 million. Furthermore, the firm will provide an additional $5 million in liquidity to help projects establish a solid financial foundation. It is worth mentioning that TVM Ventures has already backed four TON-based startups. These include Factorial, a modular lending platform similar to Morpho; Torch Finance, which specializes in stablecoin swaps; Fiva, a platform focused on tokenized yield like Pendle; and Memes Lab, a memepad that enables users to purchase memecoins using Telegram Stars, according to Yun. What Lies Ahead for TON and TVM Ventures According to Yun, the TON ecosystem is expected to experience tremendous growth by mid-2025. With the introduction of the tgBTC bridge and a new DeFi incentive program from the TON Foundation, he predicts an increase in adoption. Furthermore, he expects TON to capture a tremendous share of the stablecoin market over the next few years. Yun believes that the TON Foundation will become more independent in the next three to five years, forming high-impact partnerships to strengthen its ecosystem. He also sees the organization making “high-impact deals” to accelerate its growth. Yun predicted that Toncoin, valued at around $4 with a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion, could surpass $40 in the next bull cycle, representing a 900% increase. Even though Yun resigned as president of the TON Foundation last month, these recent events make it vehemently apparent that he has a clear and ambitious vision for TVM Ventures He stated, “Our focus is to build an advanced and comprehensive financial system capable of meeting the financial needs of 500 million users in the next few years.” On the other hand, inflation has caused Toncoin’s price to drop to $4.80 , marking a notable 33% decline from its highest value last November. This downturn coincides with a rise in exchange inflows, as over 240,000 TON tokens have been moved to exchanges in the past week.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $1,142. In 2031, AAVE will range between $3,073 to $3,778. Aave is a leading decentralized finance ( DeFi ) protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn their interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, will AAVE reach new heights in 2025? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $279 Market cap $4,174,111,006.49 Trading volume (24-h) $1,421,224,426.19 Circulating supply 15,057,562.92 AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $202.42 24-hour high $279.44 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.46% 50-day SMA $319.87 14-Day RSI 38.96 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 44 (Fear) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $191.86 Aave 1-day price analysis: AAVE to recover above $294? Key takeaways AAVE is up 9% in the last 24 hours. The coin is approaching its 0.382 Fibonacci level. A breakout above $294 could take the coin to $340.24. Aave 1-day price chart: AAVE is above its 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level The AAVE 1-day price chart for February 3 shows an emerging bull market. The coin rebounded above $202 and is now closing in on the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $294.16, which is acting as resistance. AAVE’s next key support lies at the 61.8% level ($228.87). AAVE is above its 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level While the price candles suggest a bullish recovery, the MACD indicator shows otherwise, with the MACD line below the signal line. Overall, indicators show mixed signals for AAVE. A break above $294.16 is needed to confirm an uptrend. Failure to maintain support at $228 may lead to the coin testing lower levels around $188. Aave 4-hour price chart: AAVE sees mild buyer interest in the short-term The AAVE 4-hour price chart analysis corroborates the mild recovery observed on the daily chart. AAVE has rebounded from the lower Bollinger Band, confirming some short-term buying interest. In the meantime, resistance lies at $287.98 and support at $226.56. AAVE sees mild buyer interest in the short-term A sustained move above $287-$290 is needed to confirm a stronger reversal to the upside. The RSI is almost in the oversold territory, suggesting that significant buying pressure could be gathering at the bottom. Similarly, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicates more inflows than outflows, supporting the current uptrend. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $295.22 SELL SMA 5 $304.00 SELL SMA 10 $319.25 SELL SMA 21 $326.28 SELL SMA 50 $319.87 SELL SMA 100 $260.96 BUY SMA 200 $191.86 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $308.17 SELL EMA 5 $304.88 SELL EMA 10 $306.76 SELL EMA 21 $312.62 SELL EMA 50 $293.70 SELL EMA 100 $251.51 BUY EMA 200 $201.89 BUY What to expect from AAVE price analysis? Overall, a bullish signal exists for AAVE in the short term, but the bears still hold some control over the market. To fully break out, AAVE must overcome resistance at $294. The risk of further downside remains if the coin drops below $228. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. Its AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE? AAVE tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Aave is Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, offering a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, ByBit, OKX, Kraken and KuCoin also support AAVE. Why is AAVE down? Aave (AAVE) is currently experiencing a recovery due to renewed buyer interest, jumping from a low of $202 to above $280. AAVE price history Will Aave reach $500? Aave (AAVE) can potentially reach $500 if it breaks through the current resistance levels and gains momentum from positive market sentiment and trends. AAVE had previously reached an ATH of $666.86; attaining $500 should be an achievable feat in the near term if market conditions align. Does Aave have a good long-term future? Aave shows potential for a good long-term future, given its ability to stabilize and recover after significant declines. The consistent support of around $116 indicates resilience and potential for future growth.

If the general public finds RTX more accessible and cost-effective compared to the solutions offered by big banks, XRP might face some challenges. However, critics emphasize that despite these possibilities, Ripple's strong connections and established reputation make competition challenging. Remittix (RTX) might attract individuals who are not very familiar with crypto due to its ability to handle daily wire fees. Increased real-world usage could make this practical feature transformative, putting the ""XRP 2.0"" label to the test. If the platform gains momentum and forms trustworthy partnerships, some analysts predict it could experience a tenfold growth. Conversely, some remain cautious, noting that new tokens often promise substantial returns but may falter if they don't deliver real value. Nonetheless, Remittix (RTX) focuses on tangible financial solutions, and its advocates believe the token will set itself apart from other cryptocurrencies fueled merely by hype. Whether or not Remittix (RTX) earns the ""2.0"" title, the buzz around it suggests a crypto market appreciating practical solutions. By the year's end, if it continues to gain true momentum, Remittix could emerge as a significant contender in the crypto world. Why Remittix Is Being Called The Next XRP Remittix (RTX) is transforming international payments by merging blockchain technology with fiat transactions, delivering swift and economical cross-border services. The platform supports over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, facilitating instant conversions into fiat currencies like USD and GBP, and allowing seamless deposits into recipients' bank accounts. Acting as a bridge between the crypto and fiat worlds, Remittix surpasses traditional payment services like Stripe and Wise, as well as crypto-only platforms like Coinbase Wallet. With support for more than 30 fiat currencies and over 50 crypto pairs, Remittix ensures accessibility and inclusivity for both businesses and individuals, making international trade simpler with a wide array of choices. Additionally, the platform's transparent flat-fee model offers cost savings and clarity compared to the high fees and poor exchange rates of traditional banks. This model guarantees that the full amount sent reaches the recipient, positioning Remittix as a groundbreaking player in the payments industry, notorious for its murky practices. Currently available for $0.0521 during its presale, the RTX token presents an attractive investment opportunity. Projections indicate substantial growth, with a 25x increase expected in the presale phase and over 1,500% gains anticipated post-launch, as the demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions continues to escalate. Besides their common focus on international payments, XRP and Remittix's potential to challenge established financial systems and deliver practical solutions invites comparison. While XRP has demonstrated the usefulness of blockchain technology in global banking, Remittix is advancing further with its inclusive approach and superior technology. For investors, Remittix offers a chance to engage with a project that possesses potential akin to XRP but at an earlier stage as the cryptocurrency market evolves. With growing acceptance, strong foundations, and evident market interest, RTX could not only match XRP's achievements but also redefine standards for blockchain-driven financial solutions.

It strengthens cross-border payments with faster transactions and cost efficiency. However, experts have discovered a new token, Remittix, they termed the “Next XRP.” Remittix stands out due to its innovative PayFi system and significant potential. Read on to learn more about the RTX token and why it is one of the top crypto coins to buy now. Price Speculation: Can Remittix Rival Ripple? Although Ripple partners with big companies, Remittix (RTX) proponents say their coin can carve out a niche by focusing on regular people. Should average users find RTX more affordable and simpler than large bank offerings, XRP may lose some power. Critics point out that Ripple still has strong ties and a well-known brand, thus competing is not easy. Remittix (RTX), however, may attract those who aren't particularly crypto-savvy because of its capacity to daily handle wire fees. Should true adoption increase, this pragmatic aspect might be revolutionary, testing the ""XRP 2.0"" name. If the platform moves fast and finds credible alliances, some analysts estimate it might see 10x increase. Others, on the other hand, have a wary view since new tokens usually generate large gains but fail if the actual value does not show. Still, Remittix (RTX) emphasizes practical financial solutions, hence its supporters believe the token would distinguish it from other altcoins driven just by excitement. Whether or not Remittix (RTX) earns the ""2.0,"" the excitement around it hints at a crypto space honoring pragmatic solutions. By the end of the year, this new crypto Remittix might be a big competitor if it continues to create actual momentum. Here Is Why Remittix Is Dubbed The Next XRP Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by integrating blockchain technology with fiat transactions, offering fast and cost-efficient cross-border solutions. With support for over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, the platform provides instant conversions into fiat currencies like USD and GBP, enabling seamless deposits into recipients' bank accounts. As a bridge between crypto and fiat, Remittix is the superior counterpart to traditional payment providers such as Stripe and Wise and crypto-exclusive platforms like Coinbase Wallet. Supporting 30+ fiat currencies and over 50 crypto pairs, Remittix ensures accessibility and inclusivity for businesses and individuals, simplifying global commerce with its extensive range of options. Furthermore notable is the platform's open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over exorbitant costs and inadequate exchange rates of conventional banks. This approach guarantees that the full amount sent reaches the recipient, making Remittix a game-changer in the payments industry, where shady practices are unfortunately all too common. Currently priced at $0.0521 during its presale, the RTX token offers a compelling investment opportunity. Forecasts predict significant growth with a 25x multiplier expected in the presale phase and over 1,500% gains after launch, as demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions continues to rise. Beyond their common emphasis on cross-border payments, XRP and Remittix's ability to upend established financial institutions and provide actual answers calls for comparison. While Remittix is going one step further with its inclusive approach and excellent technology, XRP has shown the value of blockchain in worldwide banking. Remittix offers investors a chance to interact with a project with the potential same as XRP but at an earlier stage as the bitcoin market develops. RTX might not only equal XRP's success but also alter the benchmarks for blockchain-based financial solutions with increasing acceptance, a solid basis and evident market demand.

Many people are curious whether Dogecoin’s price will reach $1. The coin’s price now sits around $0.3276 with a market cap of $48.41 billion. Renewed whale activity has fueled optimism, and some analysts foresee DOGE hitting $1 sometime in 2025. Yet interestingly, many are also talking about Remittix (RTX) , an under-five-cents altcoin that’s on the rise. If real-world utility wins out, some suspect Remittix (RTX) might actually outperform Dogecoin in the long run. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) Path to $1 The big question: can Dogecoin break the $1 mark in the next few years? Meme-driven hype, celebrity tweets, and robust community support have helped push DOGE to new peaks before. Current whale movements suggest institutions may be dabbling, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Still, critics note that Dogecoin relies heavily on comedic or viral momentum. If the market shifts toward utility-based tokens, the coin could see slower growth. Meanwhile, a newcomer Remittix (RTX) is capturing attention with a more practical approach. Observers say if folks want cheaper cross-border transactions, RTX might overshadow purely hype-driven coins. That dynamic leads many to ask again, “How Long Till The Dogecoin Price Reaches $1? Why Is This Altcoin Priced Below 5 Cents Tipped To Beat It?” PayFi Star Remittix on the Rise While memes help Dogecoin go viral, Remittix (RTX) aims for daily finance use. Already, Remittix (RTX) has raised $10,071,202.38 and sold 424,894,549.52 tokens at $0.0521. With a target price of $0.0539 next, some fans see RTX as the big up-and-comer. The coin sets out to tackle high wire fees, bridging fiat and crypto so families and freelancers can save money. In a market often swayed by jokes, that real-world angle could push Remittix (RTX) to the spotlight. If mainstream crowds catch on, watchers say it might surpass meme-based tokens. By focusing on bridging normal finance, RTX might sustain growth beyond short-term hype. Why This Altcoin Priced Below 5 Cents Tipped to Beat Dogecoin Despite Dogecoin boasting a massive user base, some experts believe an under-five-cent coin like Remittix (RTX) could deliver bigger returns. While DOGE soared through playful jokes and celebrity endorsements, the token’s next leap might hinge on fresh hype. Meanwhile, a PayFialtcoin such as Remittix (RTX) addresses the billion-dollar remittance market. That stable user demand might lead to steadier and potentially larger growth. If the broader market transitions to tokens offering practical cost savings, RTX could outpace many comedic coins. No one can say for sure if Dogecoin will fall behind, but if practicality wins, an under-five cents altcoin might shock everyone. Factors Behind DOGE’s Rally Donald Trump’s victory and Elon Musk’s new political advisory role have rekindled interest in Dogecoin. Over the past few months, the coin’s price more than doubled, bolstering hopes it might crack $1 by 2025. Analysts point to whale wallet expansions, meaning large players have scooped up DOGE recently. It’s a bullish sign that big holders foresee further climbs. Still, longevity is uncertain if the meme fades or the hype moves elsewhere. Enter Remittix (RTX) or RTX, where bridging day-to-day banking stands a better chance at locking in a broad user base. If mainstream folks adopt it, watchers think Remittix(RTX) might see 100x gains overshadowing meme coins. Conclusion: Who Will Win by 2025? So, how long will the Dogecoin price remain at $1? Why is this Altcoin priced below 5 cents and tipped to beat it? Some say Dogecoin could cross $1 by 2025 if hype, institutional interest, and celebrity backing stay consistent. Others see Remittix (RTX) forging a path to outdo DOGE, thanks to bridging crypto with everyday transactions. With $10,371,202.38 raised, RTX stands at $0.0521 but could hit $0.0539 soon. By tackling actual problems like wire fees Remittix (RTX) might draw a more stable, worldwide crowd. Whether DOGE or RTX claims the throne, each offers a unique route to massive growth. Yet if practical PayFi solutions resonate, the under-five-cents altcoin might be the real winner. Ready to explore Remittix further?

Many are wondering if Dogecoin’s value will reach $1. Currently priced at approximately $0.3276 with a market capitalization of $48.41 billion, the coin has seen renewed interest from large investors, fueling optimism. Some analysts predict DOGE could hit the $1 mark by 2025. However, what’s intriguing is the buzz around Remittix (RTX) , a rising altcoin priced under five cents. If real-world application triumphs, it’s speculated that Remittix (RTX) could potentially outshine Dogecoin in the long haul. The Road to $1 for Dogecoin (DOGE) The pressing question is whether Dogecoin can reach $1 in the coming years. Previously, the coin has reached new heights thanks to meme-based enthusiasm, celebrity endorsements, and a strong community. Recent activity from large investors suggests that institutions might be getting involved, bolstering a positive outlook. Yet, skeptics argue that Dogecoin's success largely depends on viral or comedic trends. If the market leans towards utility-focused tokens, its growth might slow. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) is gaining traction with a practical strategy. Observers note that for those seeking cost-effective cross-border transactions, RTX could outshine coins driven solely by hype. This situation prompts the question once more, “When Will Dogecoin Hit $1? Why Is This Altcoin Under 5 Cents Expected to Surpass It?” Remittix: An Emerging Star in PayFi While memes propel Dogecoin into the limelight, Remittix (RTX) is targeting everyday financial use.

In a market often driven by humor, this practical approach could propel Remittix (RTX) into the limelight. Should the mainstream embrace it, analysts predict it could eclipse meme-based tokens. By focusing on integrating with traditional finance, RTX might achieve sustained growth beyond initial hype. Why Is an Altcoin Under 5 Cents Expected to Surpass Dogecoin? Even though Dogecoin enjoys a vast user community, some experts believe an altcoin like Remittix (RTX) priced under five cents could offer greater returns. While DOGE skyrocketed thanks to humorous memes and celebrity shout-outs, its future rise might depend on fresh waves of excitement. On the other hand, a PayFi coin such as Remittix (RTX) targets the multi-billion-dollar remittance industry. This steady user demand could translate into consistent and potentially larger growth. Should the broader market pivot towards tokens offering tangible savings, RTX might outpace many humor-based coins. Though it’s uncertain if Dogecoin will be left behind, if practicality prevails, a low-cost altcoin could surprise everyone. Elements Fueling DOGE’s Ascent Donald Trump’s triumph and Elon Musk’s new advisory position have rekindled interest in Dogecoin. Over recent months, the coin’s value has more than doubled, sparking hopes it might hit $1 by 2025. Analysts highlight the growth in large holdings, indicating that major players have recently acquired DOGE. This is a positive sign suggesting they anticipate further gains. Yet, its long-term success is uncertain if the meme loses steam or the hype shifts. This is where Remittix (RTX) or RTX comes in, as its focus on everyday banking could secure a wide user base. If the mainstream adopts it, analysts believe Remittix (RTX) could see 100x gains, overshadowing meme coins. Final Thoughts: Who Will Prevail by 2025?

The sudden market downturn led to a widespread sell-off, impacting traders who had leveraged positions across multiple exchanges. Leverage trading in cryptocurrency allows investors to borrow funds to increase their position size, amplifying both potential gains and losses. However, it also carries significant risks, especially in highly volatile markets. When prices move sharply in the wrong direction, traders who use leverage may see their positions forcibly closed, or “liquidated,” as exchanges move to protect borrowed funds. Bybit, one of the major cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, saw over $1 billion in liquidations, reflecting the severity of the market crash. The broader crypto market experienced a total of $10 billion in liquidations, with Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the losses. The sharp declines came as unexpected price swings wiped out traders who were overleveraged. “The scale of the liquidations shows just how fragile the market can be when leverage is involved,” noted a market analyst. High leverage levels can create a cascading effect, where initial sell-offs trigger further liquidations, leading to even greater price drops. The incident highlights the risks associated with crypto leverage trading, which has become increasingly popular among retail and institutional investors. Many exchanges offer leverage of up to 100x, meaning traders can open positions far larger than their initial investment. While this can result in significant profits when the market moves in their favor, it also exposes traders to extreme losses if prices move against them. A spokesperson for Bybit commented on the situation, stating that the platform had handled the high volatility efficiently. “Despite the unprecedented liquidations, our systems functioned smoothly, ensuring that risk management mechanisms were in place to protect traders and the broader market,” they said. The impact of the liquidations was felt across the crypto industry, with Bitcoin dropping sharply before partially recovering. Ethereum and other major altcoins also saw significant price swings, as traders scrambled to manage their positions amid the turmoil. Experts believe that the event underscores the need for caution when using leverage in crypto trading. “This kind of volatility is inherent in the crypto market, and leveraged traders need to be prepared for rapid price movements,” said a senior analyst at a trading firm. Despite the massive liquidations, some market participants see potential buying opportunities. Historically, large liquidation events have been followed by price rebounds as the market stabilizes. However, uncertainty remains, especially with ongoing regulatory discussions and macroeconomic factors influencing investor sentiment. The liquidation event serves as a reminder of the risks and rewards of leverage trading in crypto. While it can enhance profits, it can also lead to severe losses, particularly in a market known for its unpredictability. Traders are advised to use risk management strategies, such as stop-loss orders and lower leverage levels, to protect their investments from unexpected market swings.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-03 23:58:00

BNB’s integration within the Binance ecosystem has fueled demand, while Cardano’s research-driven approach has positioned it as a secure and scalable blockchain. However, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out by bridging blockchain with real-world e-commerce, offering a practical use case beyond trading and speculation. With a successful presale surpassing $1 million, Web3Bay’s 3BAY token is gaining traction, signaling increasing interest in decentralized, user-driven marketplaces that challenge traditional platforms. Web3Bay’s 3BAY Token Gains Traction After $1M Presale Web3Bay’s presale has hit $1 million, with 270 million 3BAY tokens sold at a current price of $0.004562625 in Stage 4. This rapid growth, therefore, highlights increasing confidence in blockchain-powered commerce and the demand for decentralized alternatives to traditional e-commerce platforms. As a result, investors are taking notice, not just because of the early-stage presale momentum, but also due to 3BAY’s core utility—facilitating transactions, offering discounts, and granting governance rights within Web3Bay’s marketplace. Consequently, as more users join, demand for the token could rise, potentially driving up its value. When comparing Web3Bay’s growth trajectory with other blockchain marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible, it becomes evident that decentralized platforms are gaining traction. However, unlike NFT-specific platforms, Web3Bay brings real-world e-commerce into the mix, expanding the scope of blockchain adoption. Furthermore, with each presale stage increasing the token price, early investors are positioning themselves for potential gains before 3BAY reaches public trading. If this trend continues, the token could see significant value appreciation post-launch, especially as more users transact on the platform. Beyond price speculation, Web3Bay’s success underscores a larger trend—Web3 commerce is no longer a niche concept. Given that $1 million has been raised in just a few weeks, it is clear that the demand for decentralized, user-driven marketplaces is accelerating. At this point, the question now isn’t whether Web3Bay can compete, but how far it can go in reshaping online commerce. BNB: From Exchange Token to a Leading Cryptocurrency Binance Coin (BNB) launched in 2017 as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum before migrating to Binance Chain. Initially, it offered trading fee discounts on Binance, but over time, its use expanded to payments, staking, and smart contracts. Since then, BNB’s price has grown significantly, from its ICO price of $0.10 to over $576.63 as of February 3, 2025. This marks a staggering increase of more than 576,530%. One key factor behind this growth is Binance’s success, coupled with BNB’s utility in transaction fees, DeFi, and token burns, which has sustained demand. As a result, BNB’s market capitalization has also climbed to over $88 billion. Moreover, the deflationary model, where Binance systematically burns tokens, has contributed to scarcity and long-term value appreciation. For this reason, early investors who participated in the ICO have seen some of the highest returns in cryptocurrency history. Meanwhile, Binance’s ecosystem continues expanding, reinforcing BNB’s dominance as a top-tier digital asset used across multiple blockchain applications and financial services. Cardano (ADA): A Research-Driven Blockchain with Strong Growth Cardano launched in 2017, founded by Charles Hoskinson, focusing on academic research and peer-reviewed blockchain development. At the time, its native cryptocurrency, ADA, was first sold through an ICO at approximately $0.025 per token. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano was built on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros, aiming to provide a scalable and secure platform for decentralized applications. Over the years, ADA has grown significantly, reaching approximately $0.71 as of February 3, 2025, marking an increase of over 2,740% from its ICO price. This growth has been driven by Cardano’s structured development phases—Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire—which have steadily introduced decentralization, smart contracts, and scalability improvements. Additionally, its adoption in DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise applications has bolstered network activity. As a result, with a market capitalization of around $25 billion, Cardano remains a key blockchain player. Therefore, early investors have seen strong returns, benefiting from its continued expansion and research-backed technological advancements aimed at improving blockchain efficiency and real-world use cases. Final Call The growth of blockchain-based assets highlights a shift toward more decentralized and utility-driven platforms. Binance Coin (BNB) has strengthened its position through exchange integration and token burns, while Cardano (ADA) has built a foundation on research-backed development. Yet, Web3Bay is setting itself apart by integrating blockchain into real-world commerce, creating practical applications beyond investment speculation. With over $1 million raised in its presale, the 3BAY token is gaining traction, reflecting growing confidence in decentralized marketplaces. As adoption increases, Web3Bay’s model could redefine how blockchain is applied to e-commerce, offering a compelling alternative to traditional online platforms.

39893542,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=667849,1738627750,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39893542.jpeg,2025 is a make or break year for Meta’s metaverse vision – CTO Andrew “Boz” Bosworth,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/2025-meta-metaverse-vision-andrew-bosworth/,"In an internal memo intended for Meta staff, the company’s CTO, Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, shared that 2025 will be a pivotal year for the company’s metaverse ambitions. Meta is one of the companies intending to put all hands on deck in an effort to leverage opportunities in 2025. The company’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, told employees during a meeting last week to buckle up for an intense year during a meeting about the company’s smart glasses. The company is working on several fronts to make the most of the year. Meta’s strategy for 2025 is pretty clear: from its mixed reality division to its AI glasses, every project is important and crucial to the upward trajectory of the business. The ‘year of greatness’ internal memo Company CTO, Andrew “Boz” Bosworth circulated a memo to the company’s staff. The memo was titled “2025; The Year of Greatness” and was shared on Meta’s Internal Forum Workplace. Business Insider first reported on the intercepted memo . In the memo, Bosworth emphasized the need to improve sales, retention and engagement across the board with special focus on mixed reality, a technology that blends the physical and digital worlds and creates experiences that go way beyond augmented or virtual reality. Bosworth mentioned that the success of Horizon Worlds on mobile platforms will be crucial to Meta’s long-term strategy. “This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure,” Bosworth said Although Bosworth didn’t specify what devices he was referring to in the memo, he said that the company’s Reality Labs division planned to launch half a dozen more AI-powered wearable devices. Meta’s Reality Labs under the microscope Meta acquired Oculus VR in 2014 and has since invested over $80 billion in virtual and augmented reality technologies. In 2024 alone, the company’s Reality Labs division, responsible for products like Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and Quest VR headsets, saw a record investment of $19.9 billion. Despite these substantial investments, Reality Labs reported a significant operating loss of $17.7 billion in 2024, bringing total losses to around $60 billion since 2020. Notably, revenue from Reality Labs increased to $2.1 billion in 2024. Last week, the Reality Labs unit reported a record $1.08 billion in revenue in its fourth-quarter earnings. In an effort to maximize efficiency, Meta is restructuring its Reality Labs division. In the memo, Bosworth referenced Steven Levy’s book “Insanely Great,” which details how the Macintosh computer was created by small teams of one to three people, and added that he had seen smaller teams within Meta achieve better results than the company’s “more generously funded teams.” Perhaps going off this observation, Bosworth announced last week that the unit previously run by Reality Labs’ chief operating officer, Dan Reed, will now be run by company COO, Javier Olivan. The company also reshuffled the reporting lines of other Reality Labs executives, who now report to other key figures in Meta’s core business.

The crypto detective in a “thread” on X detailed how many users have become victims of social engineering attacks on Coinbase. ZachXBT stated that users have lost over $300 million from these socially engineered exploits. How the Crypto Scam Works ZachXBT’s investigations revealed that the scammers employ spoof calls and impersonation of the crypto exchange support team. They also sent phishing emails to lure users into compromising their accounts, as in the Ledger incident in December 2024. They also use leaked personal data to gain users’ trust. To sound convincing, the fraudsters have faked Coinbase’s website and emails, which are difficult to tell apart to the casual observer. The malicious actors then get the potential victims to “verify” their accounts through their private keys . This required the would-be victim to transfer funds to a Coinbase Wallet or whitelisting address. While impersonating the Coinbase support team, they compromise the victim’s security and steal their funds. ZachXBT says the scammers operate from India and primarily target users in the U.S. Surprisingly, between December 2024 and January 2025 alone, Coinbase users lost a minimum of $65 million to theft. This amount does not factor in Coinbase support tickets and police report that ZachXBT could not access. ZachXBT claims that Coinbase has made it difficult to track the theft addresses by failing to report them using compliance tools. Did Coinbase Fail to Wade Off Crypto Scams? The crypto sleuth argues that Coinbase’s risk models have failed to prevent these scams, causing users to lose $300 million. He maintained that these attacks succeeded because of the aggressive risk models that Coinbase adopted to tackle them. Generally, users have suddenly accused Coinbase of restricting their accounts. It appears the malicious actors are exploiting this to scam users. A development ZachXBT has decried as the aggressive risk model has failed to prevent the massive annual loss of funds due to Crypto scams. ZachXBT also highlighted how a Coinbase employee cautioned users via an X post to stop using VPNs so the exchange does not flag them as suspicious. Meanwhile, the crypto detective noted that threat actors block VPNs from phishing sites. According to the investigation, this discrepancy suggests that Coinbase has failed to identify the security issues correctly. He attributes this as the major reason the scammers have succeeded in robbing users of their valuable funds. Coinbase CEO Promises Enhanced Infrastructure In a separate update, Brian Armstrong, the exchange’s CEO, promised a comprehensive overhaul of its system. While more linked to Solana transaction congestion than crypto scam events, the exchange has identified a unique need to upgrade its systems. The trading platform suffered delays in processing Solana transactions in January following the launch of TRUMP and MELANIA. With the event, Brian Amstrong promised a Solana tier-1 infrastructure .

The analyst pinpointed Ethereum (ETH) in his price chart, emphasizing that the second-largest cryptocurrency is set to decline further, in line with his earlier predictions. Step 2: Crypto Market Sells Off As ETH Goes Home Ethereum is currently experiencing widespread market sell-offs as investors react to its bearish price action and tightening liquidity conditions. Failing to meet investors’ expectations, the price of Ethereum has struggled to maintain strong momentum in this bull market. Related Reading: Crypto Market Remains Greedy Despite Bitcoin Price Crash To $94,000, Is A Recovery Coming? Cowen’s chart analysis suggests that the current downtrend aligns with the broader market cycle, where Bitcoin’s dominance rises above 60%, leading to capital flows from altcoins like Ethereum. The analyst announced that the crypto market is currently in the second phase of his guide for 2025’s market trajectory. In a previous X post on January 29, Cowen outlined a structured six-step roadmap for his 2025 market cycle theory. The first step highlights an increase in Bitcoin’s dominance to over 60%. This occurs when investors leave altcoins and move into Bitcoin, seeking stability amidst the volatility and uncertainty of the crypto market. During this time, Ethereum and most altcoins underperform due to the lack of interest and demand from investors. Now, in Step 2 of Cowen’s 2025 guide, the crypto market has entered a correction phase, with Ethereum declining sharply. Cowen claims that ETH will eventually “go home,” meaning the cryptocurrency will undergo a severe decline to long-term key support levels. In this second phase, the broader market also experiences a sell-off as investors take profit amidst volatility and ongoing declines in cryptocurrencies. Despite rising to $3,000 earlier in this bull market, Ethereum has failed to maintain positive momentum, recording steep declines as its price struggles to find stable support. According to data from CoinMarketCap, ETH is currently trading at $2,594, reflecting a massive 16.4% price crash in the last 24 hours. Over the past weeks, Ethereum has performed poorly, experiencing a sharp decline to new lows while other cryptocurrencies have gained momentum. The altcoin’s price has plunged to new lows, dropping by more than 27.6% in just a month. This downturn has also significantly impacted its market capitalization, which has fallen to $312.6 billion. Cowen’s 2025 Market Guide: What’s Next? In Step 3 of his market cycle theory for 2025, Cowen predicts that the Federal Reserve (FED) will shift its policy and end quantitative tightening, which has been draining liquidity from the financial markets. This decision is critical, as easing monetary conditions would pave the way for the analyst’s fourth step — a bullish phase fueled by market rallies. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH Faces ‘Moment Of Truth’ After Crash Toward $3,000 In the fifth step, Cowen predicts that macroeconomic conditions will deteriorate later in the year. This could include factors like inflation, interest rate, geopolitical stability, and others. The final step in his 2025 market cycle guide forecasts a full-blown recession. Cowen projects that this recession would lead to a bear market, aligning with historical midterm election year cycles, where markets tend to face deeper corrections.

A standout feature of BTFD Coin is its high-yield staking mechanism, which offers a staggering 90% APY. For many, this is the magic number that makes BTFD one of the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now. With such a high annual percentage yield, token holders can enjoy substantial passive rewards simply by staking their tokens. Imagine earning significant returns without having to actively trade—this is passive income at its best. The 90% APY on staking creates a robust incentive to hold onto BTFD tokens, turning every holder into a mini passive income generator.

Designed to be both accessible and fun, the P2E game allows participants to earn extra tokens as they engage in interactive gameplay. This feature not only enhances the utility of BTFD Coin but also widens its appeal to a broader audience—from hardcore gamers to crypto newcomers looking for innovative ways to profit.

The Bulls Squad community is another powerhouse driving BTFD Coin’s success. This passionate group fuels the project’s growth through an impressive referral program. The referral program deserves special mention: Every member of the Bulls Squad is incentivized to bring new investors into the fold, amplifying the network’s organic growth.

Its innovative ecosystem and robust referral program offer a gateway to substantial passive income and exponential growth. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin has carved out its own niche in the meme coin market, emerging as a noteworthy contender among the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now. While many investors have cherished the legacy of classic meme coins, it is perfectly fine to miss out on some of them when newer opportunities promise even bigger gains. Dogecoin represents a familiar and beloved token that has long captured the hearts of crypto enthusiasts. However, as the market evolves, the spotlight is shifting toward presale opportunities that offer innovative features and significant profit potential—like those seen with BTFD Coin. The inherent charm of Dogecoin lies in its simplicity and widespread recognition. It has been a staple in the meme coin community for years, and its loyal fan base is a testament to its enduring appeal. Despite this, many forward-thinking investors are now exploring the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now because these projects integrate next-generation features that promise greater returns. Dogecoin remains a fun and engaging token, but it may not deliver the same exponential growth and passive income potential that newer projects can offer. Recent developments in the broader crypto market have shown that innovative presale opportunities are reshaping investor priorities. Analysts predict that tokens with integrated staking rewards, play-to-earn (P2E) games, and robust referral programs—like BTFD Coin—are positioned to outperform traditional meme coins in terms of growth and profitability. This shift is a reflection of the changing times, where dynamic ecosystems and advanced tokenomics are key drivers of long-term success. While Dogecoin has its own merits and continues to be a cherished asset, the emerging trends suggest that the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now are the future of profitable crypto investments. Investors who consider diversifying their portfolio with meme coins are advised to look beyond traditional tokens and embrace presale opportunities that offer cutting-edge features. The Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now not only provide a chance for early entry at discounted prices but also come with unique incentives such as high APY staking and community-driven rewards. The potential for massive returns, as evidenced by recent price predictions and strong presale performance, is a major draw for those seeking passive income. In today’s volatile market, strategic investments in these innovative tokens can pave the way to exponential growth and financial freedom. The familiar allure of Dogecoin is undeniable, and its cultural impact remains strong. However, when evaluating the overall potential for passive income and future gains, many investors find that the emerging presale opportunities hold the key to unlocking greater value. The dynamic features and robust ecosystems of the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now set them apart from more traditional assets. As the market evolves, the emphasis is shifting toward projects that offer not only a nostalgic charm but also the technological edge required for exponential returns. This is why many are willing to embrace new opportunities even if it means letting go of a long-loved token. Why did this coin make it to this list? Dogecoin’s enduring legacy, combined with its simplicity and loyal following, secured its place on this list. However, the shift in focus toward the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now highlights why newer projects with advanced features are capturing investor attention and offering greater potential for massive gains. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market never stands still, and the emergence of innovative presale opportunities is proof of that. With BTFD Coin and Dogecoin leading the charge, the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now offer unparalleled passive income potential through high-yield staking, immersive P2E games, and vibrant referral programs. Analysts predict that these projects will deliver exponential returns as they continue to gain momentum. It’s time to seize the opportunity and invest in the future of crypto.

Record-Breaking Presale Success The demand for THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has been unprecedented, with $1 million raised in minutes.

Analyst Ali Martinez tells his 122,400 followers on the social media platform X that Solana is in danger of plunging to levels last seen in October of 2024. According to the trader, SOL must stay above a key support level to invalidate his outlook. “This is it! If Solana SOL fails to hold above $191, a drop to $138 could be imminent.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that SOL is still trading within an ascending parallel channel – a pattern indicating that an asset is an uptrend, printing higher highs and higher lows. But he notes that losing $191 as support means invalidating the channel’s diagonal support, potentially ending a multi-month uptrend. At time of writing, SOL is trading for $197, translating to a 39% decline if Solana hits the analyst’s downside target. Looking at XRP , the analyst notes that whales unloaded tens of millions of dollars worth of the third-largest crypto asset by market cap in just one day. “Whales have offloaded over 130 million XRP in the past 24 hours!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.24, down over 20% on the day. Deep-pocketed Dogecoin ( DOGE ) investors also offloaded their stacks, according to Martinez. “Whales sold 270 million Dogecoin DOGE in the last 24 hours!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.227, down over 22% in the past day.

Cardano (ADA), Near Protocol (NEAR), and Kaspa (KAS) have also built strong reputations, while Arbitrum (ARB) has shown potential as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. However, a new coin, OFFICIALMAGACOIN, is now commanding the attention of savvy investors. OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Deliver 60,000% Returns OFFICIALMAGACOIN has emerged as a unique player, with a record-breaking presale raising over $1 million in minutes. The token is only available at officialmagacoin.com , adding an element of exclusivity that appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Its potential for 60,000% returns has investors speculating that it could mirror or even surpass Bitcoin’s early growth trajectory. Early-Stage Growth Potential: With its presale success, OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors a chance to get in on the ground floor of a coin poised for exponential growth. Exclusivity and Scarcity: Available only at its official website, the token creates urgency and a sense of premium access. Affordable Entry Point: At less than $0.20 per token, OFFICIALMAGACOIN provides a low-risk, high-reward opportunity. Comparing OFFICIALMAGACOIN to Competitors Bitcoin (BTC): Established but lacks the explosive growth of a new coin. Cardano (ADA): Reliable but maturing, leaving little room for exponential returns. Near Protocol (NEAR): Focused on Web3 but cannot match OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s exclusivity. Kaspa (KAS): A promising blockchain but with a slower trajectory. Investors eager to secure their position in this promising token can do so exclusively at officialmagacoin.com .

According to the AI news, the framework will address concerns about the dangers of advanced AI technology, particularly in cybersecurity and biosecurity. The company states that some AI models may be too risky to release, requiring internal safeguards before further deployment. AI News: Meta’s Frontier AI Framework Aims to Limit Risky AI Releases In a recent document filing , Meta classified AI systems into two categories based on potential risks. These categories are high-risk and critical-risk, each defined by the extent of possible harm. AI models deemed high-risk may assist in cyber or biological attacks. However, critical-risk AI can cause severe harm, with Meta stating that such systems could lead to catastrophic consequences. According to the AI news, Meta will halt the development of any system classified as critical risk and implement additional security measures to prevent unauthorized access. High-risk AI models will be restricted internally, with further work to reduce risks before release. The framework reflects the company’s focus on minimizing potential threats associated with artificial intelligence. These security measures come amid recent concerns over AI data privacy. In the latest AI news, DeepSeek, a Chinese startup, has been removed from Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store in Italy. The country’s data protection authority is investigating its data collection practices. Stricter Artificial Intelligence Security Measures To determine AI system risk levels, Meta will rely on assessments from internal and external researchers. However, the company states that no single test can fully measure risk, making expert evaluation a key factor in decision-making. The framework outlines a structured review process, with senior decision-makers overseeing final risk classifications. For high-risk AI, Meta plans to introduce mitigation measures before considering a release. This approach will prevent AI systems from being misused while maintaining their intended functionality. If an artificial intelligence model is classified as critical-risk, development will be suspended entirely until safety measures can ensure controlled deployment. Open AI Strategy Faces Scrutiny Meta has pursued an open AI development model, allowing broader access to its Llama AI models. This strategy has resulted in widespread adoption, with millions of downloads recorded. However, concerns have emerged regarding potential misuse, including reports that a U.S. adversary utilized Llama to develop a defense chatbot. With the Frontier AI Framework, the company is addressing these concerns while maintaining its commitment to open AI development. Meanwhile, while AI safety continues to be a matter of concern, OpenAI has continued its development. In other AI news, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT Gov , a secure AI model tailored for U.S. government agencies. This launch comes as DeepSeek gains traction and Meta enhances its security measures, intensifying competition in the AI space.

The approved plan involves converting defaulted debt into TCY (Thorchain Yield) equity tokens, eliminating the need for a private raise, and leveraging existing treasury funds to facilitate recovery. Under this framework , 200 million TCY tokens will be minted and distributed to affected users at a rate of one token per dollar of defaulted debt. These tokens will receive 10% of protocol fees indefinitely, providing long-term incentives for liquidity providers and aligning interests across the ecosystem. A shallow RUNE/TCY pool will be established at $0.10 per TCY, with $5 million in treasury funds allocated for strategic buybacks over ten weeks in a bid to ensure a more stable price discovery process. The proposal also introduces Liquidity Nodes to ramp up capital efficiency and offset forfeited fees, thereby strengthening governance participation for liquidity providers. By writing off debt through an equity conversion, the protocol remains solvent without minting additional RUNE, while affected users gain a potential path to full recovery. The latest development comes after the decentralized cross-chain liquidity protocol temporarily suspended its THORFi services on January 23rd in response to financial instability and insolvency rumors. A 90-day restructuring plan was put in place to address challenges arising from its Savers and Lending programs, which have accumulated excessive debt. Trading activities, including swaps, remained unaffected, but lending services were on hold as validator nodes oversaw the restructuring process. “The Jan 23 pause set the conditions for community members to decide on a restructuring plan to ensure the network’s continued operation while compensating Lending and Savers users. The community stepped up, proposing 8 independent plans, which were reviewed and voted on by Node Operators.” Its native token, RUNE, has been on a steady decline since the first week of December. It took a deep plunge following the suspension of THORFi. Despite minor hints of recovery, RUNE continued its downtrend, shedding almost 80% over the past month alone. It was currently trading at $1.21.

This sudden drop has left many investors uncertain about Bitcoin’s short-term direction as selling pressure intensifies. However, on-chain data suggests that while retail investors are offloading their BTC, large players are seizing this opportunity to accumulate more. Key data from CryptoQuant reveals that big players are buying while small players are selling, reflecting a classic market reaction during periods of heightened fear. The primary driver behind this selloff appears to be concerns over an escalating U.S. trade war, which has injected volatility into global financial markets. Despite this uncertainty, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals remain strong, and historical patterns suggest that these fear-driven dips often present prime accumulation opportunities. With BTC trading near key support levels, investors are closely watching for signs of a potential recovery. If the price holds above the $90K level, a push back toward $100K could follow. While the short-term outlook remains uncertain, long-term fundamentals continue to point toward price appreciation, reinforcing Bitcoin’s position as a resilient asset in uncertain economic conditions. Bitcoin Whales Prepare Amid Volatility Bitcoin had a bearish weekend, and the outlook for the week remains uncertain as selling pressure continues to dominate the market. BTC is now trading 14% below its all-time highs, with bears maintaining control as long as the price remains under the $100K mark. Altcoins have taken an even bigger hit, experiencing sharper declines as the market sentiment tilts toward fear and uncertainty. However, key on-chain metrics reveal an interesting divergence in investor behavior. Crypto analyst Axel Adler shared data showing that, based on BTC holdings, big players are actively accumulating while small players are panic-selling. This pattern is often observed during significant market corrections, where retail traders exit their positions in fear while institutional investors and whales take advantage of discounted prices. This “capitulation” event may seem concerning for smaller traders, but history suggests that such sell-offs often pave the way for a strong recovery. When whales accumulate at lower prices, it usually indicates confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential and signals a possible bottom formation. If BTC can reclaim $100K and establish it as support in the coming weeks, a bullish rally toward new highs could follow. While the short-term trend remains bearish, smart money positioning suggests that the market could soon shift back into bullish territory. BTC Price Testing Crucial Demand Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $94,700 after facing relentless selling pressure over the past few hours. However, despite the bearish momentum, BTC is holding strong above the $92K mark, a key demand level that could determine the short-term price direction. If this level holds in the coming days, it may signal a potential recovery and renewed bullish momentum for BTC. For a trend reversal to take place, bulls need to reclaim the $98K level and then push decisively above $100K. Establishing this psychological level as support would help BTC regain investor confidence and set the stage for another rally toward all-time highs. However, the market remains highly uncertain, and this week could see further downside action. If BTC loses the $92K level, the next major support lies below $89K, where stronger demand could emerge. A break below this critical level would signal deeper consolidation and potentially extend the correction further. For now, all eyes remain on whether BTC can defend its current range and build momentum toward a recovery. If buying pressure increases at these levels, a push toward six figures could follow. However, further downside remains a possibility if macroeconomic fears persist.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order over the weekend to establish the fund, aiming to strengthen the country’s long-term economic stability. The announcement has sparked discussions about whether Bitcoin and Ethereum could be included in the fund’s assets. Sovereign Wealth Fund Established Amid Economic Strategy Shifts The executive order signed by President Trump marks a strategic move to build a Sovereign Wealth Fund for the United States. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the decision, stating that the fund is expected to play a key role in national financial planning. The announcement comes at a time when global markets face uncertainty due to trade discussions between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. The fund’s purpose and structure have not been fully disclosed, but it is expected to manage various assets. Some financial analysts suggest that alternative investments, including digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, could be considered to diversify holdings. This comes as the cryptocurrency market shows signs of recovery, with Bitcoin price surpassing $101,000 and Ethereum price trading near $2,849. Senator Cynthia Lummis Pushes for a Bitcoin Reserve Senator Cynthia Lummis, an advocate for cryptocurrency, has reiterated her support for integrating Bitcoin into government reserves. Over the weekend, she discussed the progress of a proposed bill that would allow the U.S. government to accumulate 1 million Bitcoin over five years. The bill suggests holding the assets for at least 20 years as a long-term strategy. “This is a big deal,” Lummis said in reaction to the Sovereign Wealth Fund news, emphasizing the potential role of Bitcoin in the country’s financial system. Concurrently, Bitwise senior investment strategist Juan Leon also commented on the possibility of Bitcoin being included in the fund. He stated that the government could add Bitcoin to the Sovereign Wealth Fund while accumulating more BTC for a separate strategic reserve. Could Bitcoin and Ethereum Be Part of the Sovereign Wealth Fund? As the Sovereign Wealth Fund takes shape, discussions continue about what assets will be included. Some financial experts believe that Bitcoin and Ethereum could be considered due to their rising acceptance as store-of-value assets. The recent push from Senator Lummis for a Bitcoin reserve suggests growing interest in incorporating cryptocurrency into national financial strategies. Eric Trump recently expressed optimism about Ethereum, stating on social media that it could be a good time to invest. His comments come as Ethereum shows steady performance, following Bitcoin’s surge. If the government decides to include digital assets in the Sovereign Wealth Fund, it could signal a shift in how the U.S. approaches cryptocurrency at a national level. Cryptocurrency Market Recovers Amid Optimism Financial markets have reacted to recent events, with global stocks declining while the cryptocurrency sector remains strong. The rise of Bitcoin above $101,000 and Ethereum’s steady surge indicate growing investor confidence in digital assets. Some market analysts believe that government interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum could further drive adoption. Meanwhile, the United States, Mexico, and Canada have reached an agreement to delay new tariffs on goods for one month which has restored optimism. The decision came after a discussion between President Trump, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. While traditional markets have shown uncertainty, the cryptocurrency sector appears to be experiencing renewed momentum. Subsequently, the XRP price soared over 17% to trade at $2.73, Shiba Inu price jumped 13% to $0.00001667, Dogecoin too soared over 15% to $0.28 and MANTRA price led the top gainers in the last 24 hours after skyrocketing over 27% followed by Onyxcoin (XCN) 25% rally from its intra-day low.

The decline follows unfavorable macroeconomic developments, including newly imposed US tariffs. This price movement has left investors and analysts closely scrutinizing the market for signs of a reversal or further downturn. According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst TraderOasis, Bitcoin’s decline below critical support levels has resulted in increased panic selling. Despite this, the Coinbase premium index indicates that institutional investors are continuing to accumulate BTC rather than offloading their holdings. This contrast between retail-driven selloffs and institutional accumulation suggests that larger players are using the current dip to boost their positions. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Bullish But It’s Time For Caution Bitcoin Market Dynamics And Institutional Activity TraderOasis highlights several key market indicators that shed light on the current dynamics. Open interest—a measure of active trading positions—has dropped significantly, pointing to a wave of forced liquidations as leveraged traders exit their positions. Oasis wrote: A drop in funding rates suggests that market participants are taking short positions (betting on a price decrease) and that bearish sentiment is increasing. Notably, this ongoing pattern described by the analyst hints at a strategic accumulation phase by so-called “whales,” or large-scale investors. Oasis mentioned that while retail traders face stop-loss liquidations, these larger entities appear to be absorbing Bitcoin at discounted prices. This accumulation during periods of panic is not uncommon and often precedes a market recovery. Rising Liquidations and Signs of Recovery Another CryptoQuant analyst, Mignolet, echoed these observations, emphasizing the scale of recent long-position liquidations. The current liquidation volume is reportedly the highest since September 2023, with many traders caught off guard by the abrupt price drop. Mignolet compares this event to past market shocks, including the FTX collapse and the COVID-induced crash. The market has been cleaned out “BTC price drop shock has led to the largest liquidation of long positions in recent times… The market has been cleansed, and the open interest trend has finally broken down” – By @mignoletkr Link 👇https://t.co/fYs10fAIo6 pic.twitter.com/27znZMRzqs — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 3, 2025 Related Reading: Crypto Traders Wrecked As Trump’s Tariffs Spark $2 Billion Liquidation Despite the significant liquidations, there are signs of optimism on the horizon. The Coinbase Premium Gap (CPG) data points to aggressive buying by institutional investors, who are capitalizing on the sudden influx of liquidity.

As investors rush to secure their positions, the biggest opportunities often come from presale tokens—undiscovered gems that have yet to hit major exchanges. Among the best crypto presales of 2025, some projects stand out for their innovation, real-world utility, and potential for massive returns. One of the most exciting ones? Web3Bay—a blockchain-powered e-commerce platform that eliminates middlemen and gives users full control over online transactions. Here’s a look at six top presale tokens that are catching investors’ attention. 1. Web3Bay ($3BAY) – The Future of Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is breaking new ground in online shopping by creating a decentralized, user-governed marketplace on the blockchain. Unlike traditional platforms that charge hidden fees, control user data, and impose restrictive policies, Web3Bay hands control back to 3BAY token holders. Why Web3Bay Stands Out Decentralized Ownership – Web3Bay will renounce its smart contract post-ICO, meaning no single entity can alter the system. Governance will be fully handled by token holders through a DAO. Security & Transparency – Transactions are secured through smart contracts on a Layer-1 blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof records. Additionally, all data is stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), protecting users from security breaches. Staking & Discounts – 3BAY holders can stake tokens to earn passive income and receive a 5% discount on all transactions made within the platform. Explosive Presale Growth – Web3Bay’s presale has already raised over $1 million, selling 270 million tokens across multiple stages. With each new stage, the price rises, rewarding early adopters with massive potential gains. Current Price: $0.004562625 (Stage 4) Launch Price: $0.1959 (4,200% ROI) 2. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – The ETF for Meme Coins Meme Index is revolutionizing meme coin investing by offering a curated portfolio of top-performing meme tokens, similar to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in traditional finance. 💡 Key Features: 🔹 Community DAO governance – Holders vote on which meme coins enter the index. 🔹 Staking rewards – Up to 700% APY for early stakers. 🔹 $3M+ raised in presale, with prices at just $0.0155933. If you want meme coin exposure without chasing individual projects, MEMEX offers a diversified approach. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s First Layer-2 Scaling Solution Solaxy is bringing Ethereum-style Layer-2 scaling to Solana, solving network congestion and high gas fees. With Solana’s growing adoption, Solaxy is primed for massive demand. 💡 Why Solaxy is a Game-Changer: 🔹 Reduces transaction costs and speeds up processing. 🔹 Ethereum-Solana bridge for cross-chain interoperability. 🔹 $16.3 million raised, proving strong early support. As institutional investors flock to Solana, Solaxy’s role as a scaling solution makes it a must-watch project. 4. The Last Dwarfs (TLD) – The Next Big GameFi Project The GameFi sector is projected to exceed $60 billion by 2028 , and The Last Dwarfs is positioning itself as a leading blockchain gaming ecosystem . 💡 What Makes TLD Special: 🔹 Fully decentralized in-game economy – Players truly own their assets. 🔹 Staking & governance rewards for token holders. 🔹 300,000+ users onboarded and 50+ partnerships secured. With GameFi continuing to expand, The Last Dwarfs could be one of the biggest presale winners. 5. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – A Next-Gen Crypto Wallet Managing digital assets shouldn’t be complicated , and Best Wallet aims to simplify crypto trading with cutting-edge security and trading tools . 💡 Key Features: 🔹 Multi-chain support (Ethereum, BSC, and more). 🔹 DEX aggregator that finds the best trading rates. 🔹 $8M+ raised in presale, proving strong demand. As crypto adoption increases, wallets like Best Wallet will become essential for traders. Final Thoughts: Don’t Wait Until It’s Too Late Crypto presales offer the highest potential for early adopters, and Web3Bay leads the pack with its game-changing decentralized e-commerce model. Unlike speculative meme coins, Web3Bay is built for real-world use, allowing users to shop with crypto while earning staking rewards and discounts. With Bitcoin breaking records and institutional adoption on the rise, the window for early-stage opportunities won’t last forever. Every presale stage sees higher prices, meaning early investors get the best gains. Beyond Web3Bay, Meme Index, Solaxy, The Last Dwarfs, and Best Wallet Token are also offering high-growth potential in 2025. The next crypto bull run is coming, and these projects are positioned for explosive returns. The question is: will you get in before the market catches on?

Blockchain data indicates the transfer involved more than 90% of its multi-asset treasury, including large amounts of Ethereum (ETH) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), as well as positions in AAVE, ENA, and LINK. World Liberty Financial Moves $307M in Crypto to Coinbase On-chain data from Spotonchain reveals that World Liberty Financial transferred approximately $307 million worth of digital assets to Coinbase Prime. The transactions were part of what the project described as “treasury management and business operations.” The assets moved included ETH, WBTC, and other cryptocurrencies previously held in the project’s treasury. The transfers occurred in 13 separate transactions, ranging from $4 million to $95 million. After these transactions, World Liberty Financial’s total holdings dropped from $363 million to around $33 million. Before the large crypto transfers to the top crypto exchange, World Liberty Financial stated on X that Trump’s DeFi project was not planning to sell its crypto holdings. The DeFi project added, “We’re making routine movements of our crypto holdings as part of regular treasury management, and payment of fees and expenses and to address working capital requirements. To be clear, we are not selling tokens—we are simply reallocating assets for ordinary business purposes.” Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s newly proposed Sovereign Wealth Fund has sparked speculation about the inclusion of Ethereum and Bitcoin as part of its asset portfolio. Treasury Holdings Drop by 90% Following Transfers Notably, World Liberty Financial held approximately $175 million worth of ETH, making it the largest asset in its treasury before the transfers. The project also moved holdings in AAVE, ENA, and LINK, collectively valued at around $30 million. Each transaction was executed through multiple intermediary addresses before reaching Coinbase. The only major asset that remained untouched in the treasury was TRX, which the project had acquired after an investment from Justin Sun . The Tron founder initially invested $30 million and later increased his stake to $75 million, also joining as an advisor. Following the transfers to Coinbase, blockchain data showed that World Liberty Financial began receiving a series of small ETH deposits. These deposits, some as low as a few dollars, originated from newly created or inactive addresses. ETH Price Volatility and Eric Trump’s Comments Ethereum experienced sharp price fluctuations in response to market conditions. ETH initially faced downward pressure due to economic concerns tied to President Trump’s trade tariffs but rebounded 50% in a reversal, surpassing $2,800. It is important to note that the $2,800 ETH price level is a key support, and Ethereum has shown signs of recovery after recent volatility. Large investors, including whales like 7 Siblings, have accumulated ETH, suggesting confidence in a rebound. Amid the market movement, Eric Trump posted on X, suggesting it was a favorable time to buy Ethereum during the recent market dip.

39893992,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=667866,1738636491,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39893992.jpeg,Why some Americans are skeptical about Trump’s EO pushing a Sovereign Wealth Fund,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trumps-eo-pushing-a-sovereign-wealth-fund/,"A section of the American public has expressed their misgivings about the country’s intentions of establishing a Sovereign Wealth Fund(SWF). That follows President Donald Trump’s signing of an Executive Order (EO) directing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his nominee for the Commerce Department, Howard Lutnick, to create the investment tool. Speaking during the EO’s signing on Monday at the Oval Office, Mr. Trump expressed his excitement at development. He said, “We’re going to create a lot of wealth for the fund, and I think it’s about time this country had a sovereign wealth fund. ” Expectedly, news of Mr. Trump’s action stirred his fanbase, with some suggesting the SWF could pave the way for creating a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, one of his campaign promises. That excitement, however, failed to rub off on some US citizens, who took to X to express their apprehension about the proposed SWF. Where is disquiet over Trump’s Sovereign Wealth Fund push coming from? A major point of contention is the opaqueness of the SWF. The president and his team haven’t spelled out how the fund will work, something that X users Michelle Denver and Dave Shaffer alluded to when replying to Whitehouse Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s tweet on the EO. Another concern is that the fund could be misused. Doug Arrowsmith labeled the program a government-funded Oligarchy and crypto ponzi scheme, sentiments that resonated with another user, Squirrelmecha . Meanwhile, Tatiana Fuchs likened the fund to money laundering at the highest levels, and the Grand Duchess chimed in, “That’s code for Elon Musk’s piggy bank.” Their fears tally with the findings of a 2024 Carnegie Endowment for International Peace study . This research found that a lack of governance and regulatory safeguards risks turning SWFs into “conduits of corruption, money laundering, and other illicit activities.” Others considered it a wrong choice to establish an SWF when America is already buried in debt. The concept of sovereign wealth funds was said to be for countries with surplus by Wayne Dupree who identified himself as a conservative voter. Max Műller and Max deFreitas also had no kind words to say about the decision, arguing that it was ill advised for a country as deeply in debt as the U.S. Still of concern was Mr. Trump’s seemingly going back on his word on cutting down the government. Steve Hamill pointed to that with a tinge of sarcasm, referring to how the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is threatening to shut down one government slush fund (USAID) only to create a new one. So, what does establishing a US Sovereign Wealth Fund entail? Talking to reporters after the EO’s signing, Mr. Bessent gave a 12-month time frame to have the SWF up and running. During that time, he and his treasury counterpart will need to first get congressional approval, as the vehicle will need laws anchoring its operations. Despite the GOP’s majority over the Democrats in the legislature, it might need to reach across the aisle to gain political goodwill for the SWFs’ smooth running. That could be challenging, considering the parties’ fractious relationship. If Trump’s SWF is to receive the green light from Congress, then the next challenge would be to raise the funds. Many think this will be difficult in the current environment of the country’s growing public debt and budget deficit. A proposal made has been to implement cost cutting measures such as the Elon Musk led DOGE office is currently implementing. However, these interventions have been contentious, with some analysts implying they could present grounds for litigation derailing the effort. Thirdly, Bessent and Co will need to set up the structure for the SWF’s management and oversight. That would involve creating a broadly acceptable, transparent, independent, and professional team to run the fund. They will also need the public’s buy-in from taxpayers, some of whom have reservations about the proposed SWF. Finally, they will need to develop the rules and regulations that keep it in compliance with US Securities laws. Some of the objectives that the US is expecting from the SWF are to create a long term revenue source, to buffer its economy from market shocks, and to relieve its debt problems.

Ishiba has said he wants to increase “cooperation in the field of AI” and will discuss the matter with US President Donald Trump at a summit meeting on February 7, with a joint statement expected to be forthcoming. The move to deepen relations is ostensibly part of a plan to keep pace with China — a commonly cited Western boogeyman — and prevent the massive state’s undue dominance in the field. Trump, for his part, surprised many of his fiscally conservative supporters after taking office, by announcing a $500 billion joint venture into AI known as “Stargate.” The investment involves both Softbank Group (SBG) and OpenAI, as well as an entity known as Oracle. Ishiba is now doubling down on this trans-Pacific handshake, and plans to meet with Trump on the 7th to further cement the development. Ishiba moves to back US in joint AI development The Japanese PM met with Masayoshi Son, CEO of Japan’s investment and communications giant Softbank, as well as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in Tokyo Monday, and “exchanged views on AI investment in the United States,” according to regional media. “We want Japan and the United States to deepen cooperation in the field of AI and strive to make the world more peaceful, prosperous, and safe,” Ishiba is quoted as saying. While some die-hard Trump supporters are now confused as to how dumping billions into a global AI database called Stargate (and spending even more money on the Biden-era initiative) is going to help “make America great,” Japanese are also doubting their own ruler’s intentions when it comes to the tech. As previously reported here on Cryptopolitan, the Japanese government has openly stated its intentions to govern and surveil the populace with massive AI infrastructure, while everyday residents of the archipelago find themselves in financial straits. In response to the February 3 meeting involving Ishiba and OpenAI, one user of X said : “If you’re going to spend that much money, make an AI made in Japan instead.” This sentiment is not rare. Like the Japanese AI governance initiative, Stargate is also tied to digital health records, and also potential mRNA injection initiatives with a stated goal of fighting cancer. Japan’s “My Number” digital health surveillance and catch-all identification system is similarly controversial with Japanese, as some fear My Number will centralize state control and make private information insecure.

Arctic Pablo Coin at $0.000047 Could Be Your Second Shot For Massive Gains in 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-dogs-ico-arctic-pablo-coin-at-0-000047-could-be-your-second-shot-for-massive-gains-in-2025/,"The rise of meme coins has been nothing short of explosive, and one of the most notable success stories in the space was Dogs. Launched at a minuscule price of $0.0000001 during its ICO, it was initially dismissed by many. However, for those few who believed in its potential, the payoff has been monumental. Early investors who jumped in at the beginning have seen their investments soar, turning pennies into incredible profits. For those who missed out on the chance to invest in Dogs at that low price, there’s no need to dwell on regrets. The best meme coin to join in 2025 is here, and it’s called Arctic Pablo Coin. Already making waves in its presale, Arctic Pablo is a chance for investors to experience the same success that early Dogs investors are now reaping. Let’s dive into why Arctic Pablo Coin could be your ticket to a huge return on investment. Dogs’ ICO: A Missed Opportunity That Made Millionaires When Dogs launched its ICO, it was barely on anyone’s radar. Priced at $0.0000001, few saw it as anything more than a joke or a passing trend. But for the brave investors who took the plunge, the payoff has been nothing short of extraordinary. As the coin gained momentum, driven by its growing community and viral popularity, Dogs saw an unprecedented surge in price. Those who bought in at the beginning have seen their investments skyrocket, with some early adopters seeing returns in the thousands of percent. Now, looking back, those who missed the ICO are regretting it, wishing they had taken the risk and joined in when the price was still incredibly low. It’s a classic case of “you snooze, you lose,” but there’s a silver lining: Arctic Pablo Coin is here, and it’s presenting a fresh opportunity for investors. Let’s take a closer look at how Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be the best meme coin to join in 2025. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Best Meme Coin to Join in 2025—Don’t Miss Out on This Second Chance! When Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) was first introduced, it was priced at an incredibly low $0.000047. With a launch price of $0.008, this offers investors the potential for an ROI of over 16,936% from the seventh stage to the launch. But what truly sets Arctic Pablo apart from other meme coins is its unique presale structure. Unlike other ICOs that follow a standard stage-based presale, Arctic Pablo Coin has taken a different approach by dividing the presale into locations as the coin “travels.” Currently, Arctic Pablo Coin finds itself in the Shangri-La location, which has created a sense of excitement and anticipation. This unique model offers investors a rare opportunity to get in early, just like those who got in at the beginning of Dogs. Another standout feature of Arctic Pablo is its 66% APY for staking during the presale. Investors can lock their tokens and earn substantial rewards, making this opportunity even more appealing for those seeking long-term returns. On top of that, Arctic Pablo offers referral incentives—those who spread the word about the coin can earn additional rewards in APC tokens or USD. These features create a community-driven atmosphere that’s primed for success and further adds to Arctic Pablo’s potential for explosive growth. Why Arctic Pablo Coin Is Poised for Explosive Growth in 2025—A Low Entry Price You Can’t Ignore The momentum behind Arctic Pablo Coin is undeniable. With over $870,000 raised already in its presale, the project is off to a strong start. The current price of $0.000047 is still remarkably low, but the presale won’t last forever. Investors who get in now can still take advantage of these rock-bottom prices before the coin launches at its $0.008 price point. Arctic Pablo Coin’s ROI potential is hard to ignore. Early investors have the chance to experience a staggering 16,936% ROI from the seventh stage to the launch price. Compare that to the early days of Dogs, when investors who entered early were rewarded handsomely. Arctic Pablo Coin offers the same type of opportunity for those who were too late to get into Dogs’ ICO. Whether you’re a first-time crypto investor or a seasoned trader looking for the next big thing, Arctic Pablo presents a massive upside potential. Additionally, Arctic Pablo Coin’s community competitions allow users to participate in fun and engaging ways to earn rewards in the form of APC tokens or USD. This further fosters a sense of engagement and inclusion, making Arctic Pablo not just a meme coin, but a project with a loyal and growing community. How Arctic Pablo Coin’s Unique Presale Structure Could Make You a Winner in 2025 What makes Arctic Pablo Coin stand out from other meme coins is its innovative presale structure. Instead of following the traditional staged model, where tokens are released in phases, Arctic Pablo Coin is utilizing a location-based presale system. As the coin “travels,” different locations become the focal points of its presale, creating a sense of excitement and exclusivity. Currently, Arctic Pablo Coin is in the Shangri-La location, and there’s still time to get in before it moves to its next location. This approach has captured the attention of investors who are eager to get in early and ride the wave as the coin progresses. The community-driven rewards, such as staking with an impressive 66% APY and referral incentives, have created an environment where early backers are motivated to spread the word and increase the token’s visibility. As Arctic Pablo continues to build momentum, the potential for huge returns increases, and the unique structure of the presale makes it an exciting investment. If you missed out on Dogs or regret not jumping in sooner, Arctic Pablo Coin offers a second chance to secure a position at a low price before it hits the big leagues. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Your Chance with Arctic Pablo Coin Based on the latest research, the best meme coin to join in 2025 includes Arctic Pablo Coin alongside other popular meme coins like Dogs. However, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as an incredible opportunity for those who missed the early days of Dogs. With an impressive ROI potential, community-driven rewards, and a unique presale structure, Arctic Pablo is positioned for massive growth. The price is still extremely low, and with over $870,000 already raised, the presale is gaining traction quickly. This could be your chance to invest in one of the most promising meme coins of 2025 before it skyrockets. Don’t miss out—join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale now and be part of the next big success story in the meme coin world!

Now, both tokens face sudden price drops, leaving investors shaken. Meanwhile, a PayFi altcoin called Remittix(RTX) has surged by 250% in January, positioning itself as an unexpected hedge against the meme-coin meltdown. With over $10.5 million raised, 430 million tokens sold and a current price of $0.0521, Remittix (RTX) stands out for its real-world approach—focusing on cheaper cross-border transactions rather than social-media hype. Below is a look at the dip in SHIB and PEPE and how Remittix (RTX) found a way to soar despite the meme-coin chaos. Meme-Coin Meltdown: Why SHIB and PEPE Are Struggling Over the past few weeks, Shiba Inu (SHIB) saw a dramatic slip, plagued by questions about its Shibarium roadmap and whether developer updates can sustain hype. At the same time, Pepe (PEPE) faced a perfect storm of oversupply fears and waning social interest. Meme coins typically rely on viral support: prices tumble swiftly if the conversation dies down or a significant influencer moves on. Observers note that SHIB and PEPE still boast strong communities but are more vulnerable to social sentiment than other crypto sectors. In a jittery market, many traders seek stability or tangible utility—a factor often lacking in comedic tokens. That’s why some early SHIB and PEPE enthusiasts, hoping for big breakouts, now pivot to altcoins with everyday problem-solving at their core. As skepticism about pure meme coins grows, where will we invest if viral chatter no longer guarantees success? Enter PayFi solutions like Remittix (RTX) show steady adoption by tackling real-world pain points. Remittix (RTX): 250% Returns and Counting So, how did Remittix (RTX) manage an impressive 250% surge last month, even as meme coins falter? The altcoin appeals to an entirely different audience—think cross-border businesses, freelancers and unbanked families who lose money to steep bank fees. Imagine a local artisan in Morocco selling handcrafted goods to buyers in France; every time she ships a product, she dreads the high costs of traditional wire transfers. With Remittix (RTX), she can send or receive tokens at far lower fees and convert them to local cash without the usual hurdles. In the long run, that immediate utility matters more than memes attracting a broader audience. This practicality is a magnet for investors skeptical about comedic coins. Observers see a chance for Remittix( RTX) to secure large-scale adoption as more regions discover that wallet-to-cash solutions are cheaper and faster than legacy remittances. Remittix (RTX) has already raised over $10.5 million, sold 430 million tokens, and set its price at $0.0521. Analysts suggest that if altcoin keeps forging partnerships with payment agents worldwide, it will repeat—or surpass—its 250% performance. After all, actual cost savings can drive consistent usage, which perks meme coins typically lack. Conclusion: Is Real-World Adoption the New Trend? Meme coins like SHIB and PEPE showed how fast hype can evaporate, casting doubt on short-lived social media bursts. But Remittix(RTX) underscores a different path to crypto success, anchored in bridging fiat and crypto. If global users see how PayFi platforms can cut fees and time for international transfers, altcoin’s 250% jump might be just the beginning. With the broader market looking for safer, solution-oriented bets, Remittix(RTX) stands out as an attractive alternative for burnt meme-coin holders and new investors. As SHIB and PEPE scramble to recapture buzz, the altcoin is delivering tangible, cost-saving benefits that seem ready to maintain momentum. Ready to Explore Remittix (RTX)?

Many are concerned that the exchange may have been “rugpulled.” Xeggex officials have explained that the CEO’s account was hacked, which led to a temporary suspension of logins and access to user funds. However, the exchange reassured users that their wallets were successfully locked to prevent any loss of funds. The database was disconnected from the network, which caused the inability to log in to accounts, though the front-end of the website remained operational. The situation caused a lot of panic among users, especially with the order books showing empty and balances not visible. Some users expressed concern that the platform may have suffered a more severe breach. To safeguard against potential threats, Xeggex took the database offline to prevent hackers from further exploiting the platform. The company has committed to conducting a full assessment of the breach and plans to update users as soon as possible. While no funds have been moved according to blockchain data, the exchange is still investigating the hack’s full impact. At this point, Xeggex has confirmed that they are actively working to secure all wallets and prevent further issues. “Dear users, in this hard time our CEO was hacked and he lost tg account and xeggex community group beside that we still don’t know details about it.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain dominant, savvy investors are turning their attention to high-upside altcoins before they explode in value. One project quietly attracting large-scale investors is Lightchain AI , which has already raised $14 million in its presale at $0.00525 per token. With its groundbreaking AI-blockchain integration and rapid presale momentum, Lightchain AI could be positioning itself as the next major disruptor in the crypto market. Why Are Whales Accumulating Lightchain AI? Large investors, or whales, don’t chase hype—they seek high-value projects with strong fundamentals and long-term potential. Lightchain AI is drawing attention due to its unique ability to integrate AI-driven processes into blockchain networks, offering solutions that enhance security, efficiency, and scalability. One of its key advantages is its enhanced data security infrastructure , allowing AI computations to run on-chain while preserving privacy and decentralization. This makes it an attractive option for enterprises, developers, and institutional investors who are looking for practical blockchain applications beyond just financial transactions. Presale Growth Signals Strong Investor Confidence Lightchain AI has already raised an impressive $14 million during its presale, signaling strong confidence from early investors in its growth potential. With its combination of a low entry price and high-utility blockchain solutions, the project has quickly gained recognition as one of the most exciting presale opportunities for 2025. As institutional interest in AI-powered blockchain projects continues to rise, Lightchain AI is uniquely positioned to capture significant attention. Its innovative approach to blending AI and blockchain has attracted early accumulation by whales, further emphasizing its potential for long-term success. The growing anticipation around Lightchain AI suggests the project could experience strong price action upon its market debut. Investors are watching closely as it prepares to disrupt the blockchain space. Is Lightchain AI the Next Major Market Disruptor? Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a key player in the next wave of blockchain innovation, thanks to its unique AI-blockchain synergy and privacy-focused architecture.

OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM, XRP, and SOLANA Are Poised for Explosive Growth!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/unstoppable-surge-officialmagacoin-com-xrp-and-solana-are-poised-for-explosive-growth/,"While Bitcoin (BTC) proved it’s possible by delivering exponential returns to early investors, the spotlight now shines on OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a newcomer that could replicate such success. With a presale price under $0.20 and a rapid rise in popularity, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts who believe that $300 today could turn into $999,000 in the near future. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Transform Your Investment 1. Early-Stage Opportunity OFFICIALMAGACOIN is still in its presale phase, offering a ground-floor opportunity for investors to buy in before the token gains mainstream attention. This is the stage where gains of 1,000x or more become achievable, as seen with Bitcoin in its early days. 2. Exclusive AvailabilityUnlike widely distributed coins, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand, ensuring that early adopters benefit as interest surges. 3. Record-Breaking Presale SuccessRaising over $1 million in presale funds in record time, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its appeal among investors. Such strong initial support is a hallmark of projects poised for explosive growth. 4. Massive Growth PotentialExperts are predicting OFFICIALMAGACOIN could follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps, transforming small investments into extraordinary returns. With its low entry price and strong market momentum, the potential for turning $300 into $999,000 feels more achievable than ever. How It Stacks Up Against SOL, MATIC, KAS, and BTC Bitcoin (BTC): A proven store of value, but its days of exponential growth are behind it. Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum OFFICIALMAGACOIN is generating. Don’t Miss Out on OFFICIALMAGACOIN The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but OFFICIALMAGACOIN might just be that opportunity. With its affordable price, exclusivity, and massive growth potential, it’s a must-watch for 2025. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and stay updated on their journey via Twitter/X.

In a newly-unsealed indictment filed in the Eastern District of New York (EDNY), prosecutors say Andean “Andy” Medjedovic was the mastermind behind both exploits. Though Medjedovic’s alleged role in the KyberSwap exploit was previously unknown, he has publicly admitted to being the Indexed Finance attacker, wiping $16 million from the DeFi platform when he was still a teenager. Read more: After Stealing $16M, This Teen Hacker Seems Intent on Testing ‘Code is Law’ in the Courts Medjedovic did little to hide his identity as the Indexed Finance hacker because he professed to believe he wasn’t actually doing anything illegal. Another DeFi hacker, Avraham “Avi” Eisenberg, took a similar “code is law” position after his 2022 Mango Markets exploit, claiming that siphoning $110 million from the decentralized exchange was fair game. A New York jury disagreed , finding Eisenberg guilty of fraud and market manipulation . He will be sentenced later this year, and faces up to 20 years in prison. Medjedovic has been on the run since December 2021, when a Canadian court issued a warrant for his arrest. In 2023, he told a DeFi Llama reporter that it was “exhausting” living as a fugitive, saying that he had been bouncing around through Europe, South America and an unnamed island nation while on the lam. A spokesperson for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) told CoinDesk that Medjedovic remains “at large” and is not believed to be in the U.S. Eight months after telling the same reporter that he was now a whitehat hacker, prosecutors say Medjedovic stole about $50 million from KyberSwap . According to the indictment, Medjedovic planned the KyberSwap hack for months before acting, writing to himself “Find time to Strike!” and creating a “POST-EXPLOITATION” plan for himself. In one file, Medjedovic allegedly mused on his past mistakes, writing “Going On the run / Yes / Chance of getting caught Medjedovic has been charged with one count of wire fraud, one count of unauthorized damage to a protected computer, one count of attempted Hobbs Act extortion, one count of money laundering conspiracy and one count of money laundering.

Within just two weeks, its price had skyrocketed to an all-time high that was simply eye-watering. Early investors reaped significant rewards, while those who hesitated were left watching from the sidelines. Notcoin’s integration into the Telegram ecosystem and its play-to-earn gaming model contributed to its rapid ascent, with its market cap approaching $1 billion shortly after launch. The regret of missing out on such a lucrative opportunity is palpable among many in the crypto community. But fear not, for the crypto universe is brimming with new opportunities. Enter BTFD Coin, currently in its 14th presale stage, priced at $0.00016 per token. The presale has already raised over $5.85 million, with more than 68 billion tokens sold and a growing community of over 10,200 holders. Analysts predict that BTFD Coin could surge to $0.0006 or even $0.006 upon listing, offering substantial potential gains for early investors. With its unique features and strong community backing, BTFD Coin presents a promising alternative for those seeking the next big opportunity in the meme coin space. Notcoin’s Meteoric Rise: A Lesson From the Past Notcoin’s ICO on May 16, 2024, was a game-changer. Starting at $0.0068 per token, it didn’t take long for the coin to capture the market’s attention. By June 1, the price had soared to $0.0284, marking a 317% increase in just two weeks. This rapid growth was fueled by its seamless integration into the Telegram ecosystem and an engaging play-to-earn gaming model. Within 30 hours of launch, Notcoin’s Telegram game attracted over 1 million new users, driving its market cap to nearly $1 billion. Trading volumes surged past $1.47 billion on May 29, solidifying Notcoin’s position among the heavyweights of meme cryptocurrencies. Those who got in early celebrated significant gains, while latecomers could only watch as the opportunity slipped away. BTFD Coin: Presale Success? Sounds Like It! For those who missed out on Notcoin, BTFD Coin offers a fresh opportunity. Currently, in its 14th presale stage, BTFD Coin is priced at $0.00016 per token . The presale has already raised over $5.85 million, with more than 68 billion tokens sold and a rapidly growing community of over 10,200 holders. Analysts are buzzing with predictions, suggesting that BTFD Coin could surge to $0.0006 or even $0.006 upon listing. Such projections indicate a potential for substantial returns for early investors. Investment Potential: Detangling the Numbers Suppose you invest $5,000 in BTFD Coin at the current presale price of $0.00016 per token. Here’s how the math works out: Number of Tokens Purchased: $5,000 / $0.00016 = 31,250,000 BTFD tokens Now, if the price reaches $0.0006 per token: Value of Investment: 31,250,000 tokens * $0.0006 = $18,750 That’s a potential profit of $13,750, representing a 275% return on your initial investment. And if the price climbs to $0.006, the numbers become even more impressive: Value of Investment: 31,250,000 tokens * $0.006 = $187,500 In this scenario, you’d be looking at a whopping $182,500 profit—a 3,650% return. While these figures are speculative and depend on market dynamics, they illustrate the significant potential that early investment in promising meme coins like BTFD Coin can offer. But what else does BTFD Coin have up its sleeve besides its crazy presale momentum? Well, to name a few, there’s the staking APY of 90% , a P2E game with rewards convertible into $BTFD tokens, a referral program that rewards both referrers and referrals and more to come. What’s not to be hyped about? To Summarize: Seize the Opportunity Today! The crypto market is known for its volatility, but with risk comes the potential for reward. BTFD Coin’s presale success and the optimistic projections from analysts make it a compelling option for those looking to capitalize on the next big meme coin. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by—consider participating in the BTFD Coin presale and position yourself for potential gains.

Find Out More: Website: https://www.btfd.io/ X/Twitter: https://x.com/BTFD_COIN Telegram: https://t.me/btfd_coin FAQs Why did Notcoin’s price rise after its ICO? Notcoin’s rapid price surge was driven by its integration with Telegram, which brought in over 1 million users in just 30 hours. Its play-to-earn game also created massive demand, helping its market cap reach nearly $1 billion in record time. What makes BTFD Coin one of the top new meme coins with 1000X potential? BTFD Coin’s presale success, strong community of over 10,200 holders, and staking rewards give it serious growth potential. Analysts predict it could reach $0.0006 or even $0.006, making it a strong contender for high returns. How much could I make if BTFD Coin follows Notcoin’s explosive growth? If you invest $5,000 at the current presale price of $0.00016 and BTFD Coin rises to $0.0006, your investment would be worth $18,750. If it reaches $0.006, it would skyrocket to $187,500.

ETH is up nearly 10% and now faces a major resistance near $2,920. Ethereum started a decent upward move above the $2,500 support zone. The price is trading below $2,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,920 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it stays below the $2,920 level. Ethereum Price Attempts Recovery Ethereum price started a major decline below the $2,800 level, underperforming Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $2,650 and $2,500 levels to enter a bearish zone. There was a clear move below the $2,200 level. The price declined over 25% and tested the $2,120 zone. A low was formed at $2,127 and the price recently started a fresh upward move. There was an increase above the $2,500 level. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,403 wing high to the $2,127 swing low. However, the bears are now active near the $2,900 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,920 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

The main resistance is now forming near $3,000. A clear move above the $3,000 resistance might send the price toward the $3,120 resistance. An upside break above the $3,120 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,250 resistance zone or even $3,320 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,900 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,765 level. The first major support sits near the $2,650. A clear move below the $2,650 support might push the price toward the $2,500 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,420 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350.

However, some crypto analysts see this sharp decline as a buying opportunity, suggesting that BTC may be oversold and poised for a rebound. Is Bitcoin Poised For A Relief Rally? Yesterday, the crypto market experienced one of its largest sell-offs in history, with over $2.3 billion in liquidations affecting more than 742,000 traders. This level of liquidations surpasses those seen during the COVID market crash in March 2020 and the FTX collapse in November 2022. Related Reading: Crypto Traders Wrecked As Trump’s Tariffs Spark $2 Billion Liquidation Despite the downturn, some analysts argue that BTC may have entered oversold territory, signaling a potential relief rally. Crypto analyst Caleb Franzen shared insights in a post on X, highlighting that Bitcoin’s 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped into oversold levels. He noted: For the 5th time since August 2024, Bitcoin’s 4-hour RSI is becoming oversold. Each of the prior signals were attractive accumulation periods, even if price made new short-term lows after the signal flashed. For the uninitiated, the RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes to determine whether BTC is overbought or oversold. A reading above 70 suggests overbought conditions – potential for a pullback – while a reading below 30 indicates oversold conditions – potential for a rebound. According to Franzen’s chart, Bitcoin’s current RSI is hovering around 24 on the 4-hour timeframe, indicating that BTC may be in an attractive accumulation zone. If historical trends hold, BTC could be on the verge of a short-term recovery. Is There More Trouble For BTC Ahead? As of the latest updates, Donald Trump and his Mexican counterpart Claudia Sheinbaum have agreed to temporarily delay the proposed trade tariffs, offering some relief to financial markets. However, uncertainty remains regarding trade negotiations with Canada, leaving investors cautious about BTC’s next move. Related Reading: Is The Crypto Market ‘Satiated’ For Now? Analysts Say Bitcoin Will Continue Sideways Move Meanwhile, fellow crypto analyst Johnny’s analysis indicates that “the meat” of BTC’s current down move is likely over. The analyst added that as long as BTC continues to trade above range lows and the yearly open, it will “look good compared to the rest of the market.” However, not all experts are optimistic. Renowned businessman and author Robert Kiyosaki warns that BTC could face further downside pressure if Trump follows through with his tariff plans. According to Kiyosaki, increased tariffs could strengthen the US dollar, potentially driving investors away from risk assets like Bitcoin in the short term. At press time, BTC trades at $98,644, up 0.4% in the past 24 hours.

With Crypto.com and Kalshi under review, could stricter oversight be coming for event-based trading? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is closely scrutinizing Crypto.com and Kalshi Inc., seeking clarity on how their newly launched Super Bowl event contracts align with U.S. derivatives regulations, according to Bloomberg . This heightened oversight comes on the heels of a Jan. 27 announcement in which the CFTC ’s leadership pledged to monitor emerging issues in the derivatives market, with event-based trading products falling squarely in their sights. Crypto.com, which operates a U.S.-based derivatives exchange, had notified the CFTC on Dec. 19 of its intent to launch Super Bowl-related contracts by Dec. 23. However, the short notice left regulators with minimal time to review the products ahead of the Christmas holiday and amid concerns over a possible government shutdown. Weeks later, the CFTC is now flexing its regulatory authority, requesting additional information from firms that self-certify their financial offerings. Under existing derivatives laws, firms that self-certify must demonstrate that their products are not easily manipulated and comply with U.S. regulations. While the CFTC’s review process does not grant it immediate power to halt trading, the agency can later issue bans or take enforcement action if concerns arise. A CFTC spokesperson confirmed, “We are continuing to review the contracts in accordance with our regulations,” while leaving the door open for potential enforcement or new rulemaking. Crypto.com remains firm in defending its stance. “We firmly believe in the legality of our event contracts and believe the CFTC is the appropriate regulator to bring federally regulated market integrity, manipulation controls, and product availability in all 50 states,” a company spokesperson told Bloomberg. Interestingly, Crypto.com had previously withdrawn two sports-related filings that were under regulatory scrutiny, later opting to self-certify a new contract targeting spectator sports and related industries. Meanwhile, Kalshi Inc. launched its “Kansas City vs. Philadelphia” Super Bowl market on Jan. 24, which has already seen trading volume climb to nearly $2.5 million as of Jan. 4. Additionally, the company introduced contracts allowing users to wager on brands likely to advertise during the Super Bowl, drawing more than $1.5 million in trading activity. Amid this, the broader prediction markets industry has seen volatility. During the 2024 U.S. presidential election cycle, Polymarket —the largest decentralized prediction market—processed more than $2.5 billion in bets, with election-related wagers leading the surge. You might also like: Singapore and CFTC zero in on Polymarket as wildfire bets fuel public outcry However, by January 2025, volumes dropped significantly to around $1.24 billion, reflecting a cooling interest after the election hype subsided. The CFTC’s ongoing review coincides with Robinhood Markets’ entry into event-based trading. On Feb. 3, Robinhood announced that it would enable its derivatives clients to trade sports event contracts through Kalshi’s exchange. “With an emerging asset class like event contracts, we recognize an opportunity to better serve our customers as their interests converge across the markets, news, sports, and entertainment,” Robinhood stated. While the agency can’t immediately halt trading of these contracts due to a mandatory 90-day review process, it retains the power to ban them later. With the Super Bowl set for Feb. 9, any decision will come after the event.

Sacks, who serves as the White House’s cryptocurrency advisor, will be joined by prominent figures, including Chairman Tim Scott, Chairman John Boozman, Chairman French Hill, and Chairman Thompson. The press conference, scheduled for 2:30 PM, is expected to bring critical discussions about the future of digital assets in the U.S. Key topics likely to be addressed include the potential for a Bitcoin reserve, a crypto stockpile, and updates on upcoming crypto legislation. With French Hill, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, present, there could also be insights into potential tax reforms impacting cryptocurrency transactions. Industry experts, like Perianne Boring of the Digital Chamber of Commerce, see this collaboration between Congress and the administration as a positive step toward a unified, pro-crypto stance. “Very good sign to see multiple congressional committees come together with the administration to deliver a unified message,” Boring stated, adding that big moves are on the horizon for crypto space. https://twitter.com/PerianneDC/status/1886487270925951039 The timing of the press conference aligns with growing optimism about the crypto market, especially as many analysts are predicting a rally into the second quarter of 2025. Bitcoin has rebounded after a major dip caused by tariff concerns, reaching $102,000 today. The tariff situation between Mexico and Canada has been pushed back 30 days, easing market fears.

While major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain solid choices, their high prices make it challenging for smaller investors to gain exposure. That’s where presale tokens under $1 come in. These low-cost cryptos provide an opportunity to enter at a fraction of the price while still holding significant growth potential. Some of these projects bring game-changing innovations to blockchain technology, DeFi, gaming, and decentralized marketplaces. Among these, Web3Bay ($3BAY) stands out as one of the most exciting blockchain projects, transforming e-commerce through decentralization. Let’s explore the top seven new cryptocurrencies under $1 that could deliver massive gains in 2025. 1. Web3Bay ($3BAY) – The Future of Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is redefining online shopping by eliminating middlemen and putting buyers and sellers in full control. Unlike traditional marketplaces that charge hidden fees and dictate policies, Web3Bay is community-governed, allowing users to vote on platform decisions. Why Web3Bay Is a Game-Changer Decentralized Ownership – Web3Bay will renounce its smart contract after presale, meaning no single entity can control or manipulate the platform. Governance is fully handled through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Secure Transactions – Built on a Layer-1 blockchain, all transactions are tamper-proof and verifiable, ensuring complete trust and transparency. Passive Income & Staking Rewards – Users can stake their 3BAY tokens to earn passive income, helping secure the network while generating long-term returns. Massive Presale Growth – Web3Bay’s presale has already raised over $1 million, selling 257.7 million tokens in just a few stages. Current Price : $0.004562625 (Stage 4) Launch Price : $0.1959 ( 4,200% ROI potential ) 2. Pandana (PNDN) – The First Panda-Themed Meme Coin Pandana ($PNDN) is an emerging meme coin that has already raised $1 million in its presale. With a zero-fee model, investors only pay for tokens and network fees, making it one of the most cost-effective entries into the meme coin space. 🔹 Total Supply: 8 billion tokens 🔹 50% allocated to presale 🔹 No vesting period – Tokens are distributed within 48 hours Pandana’s smart contract is fully audited, ensuring security and trust. As meme coins continue to thrive, Pandana offers a fun yet lucrative opportunity for early adopters. 3. Solaxy (SOLX) – Solana’s First Layer-2 Scaling Solution Solaxy is Solana’s first Layer-2 blockchain, designed to enhance speed, lower gas fees, and increase scalability. As Solana’s adoption grows, the demand for efficient transaction solutions like Solaxy is skyrocketing. 🔹 Ethereum-Solana Bridge – Enables seamless transactions between both networks 🔹 Drastically reduces transaction fees 🔹 $16.3 million raised in presale With institutional investors eyeing Solana, Solaxy could become one of the most profitable Layer-2 solutions in the near future. 4. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – The ETF for Meme Coins Meme Index ($MEMEX) is an innovative crypto index fund for meme coins, allowing users to invest in baskets of top-performing tokens instead of picking individual ones. 🔹 DAO-governed – Holders vote on which meme coins enter the index 🔹 Staking rewards of up to 700% APY 🔹 $3M+ raised in presale For those who want exposure to the meme coin market with reduced risk, MEMEX offers a diversified approach. 5. The Last Dwarfs (TLD) – The Next Big GameFi Project With blockchain gaming booming, The Last Dwarfs is emerging as a major player by offering a fully decentralized gaming economy where players own all in-game assets. 🔹 Play-to-earn model – Players earn rewards while playing 🔹 Staking & governance options 🔹 Already attracted 300,000+ users With GameFi projected to surpass $60 billion by 2028, The Last Dwarfs could be one of the biggest gaming cryptos in 2025. Final Thoughts The crypto market is evolving fast, and low-cost presale tokens under $1 offer the best chance for exponential gains. While meme coins like Pandana and Meme Index capitalize on community hype, and Solaxy enhances Solana’s scalability, Web3Bay stands out as the most innovative project with real-world utility. As a decentralized e-commerce platform, Web3Bay eliminates middlemen, hidden fees, and centralized control, giving power back to users. Its staking rewards, smart contract renouncement, and strong presale growth position it as the next big cryptocurrency under $1.

The price is back above $2.65 and now faces hurdles near the $2.820 level. XRP price started a strong upward move above the $2.50 level. The price is now trading below $2.80 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2.420 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.820 resistance zone. XRP Price Recovers Over 25% XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.850 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined heavily below the $2.50 and $2.350 support levels. The bears even pushed it below $2.00. There was a sharp drop of over 25% and the price tested the $1.75 zone. A low was formed at $1.75 and the price recently started a sharp recovery wave. The bulls pumped the price above the $2.20 and $2.50 levels. There was a move above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.155 swing high to the $1.750 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2.420 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.80 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.80 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.820 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.155 swing high to the $1.750 low. The next resistance is $2.940. A clear move above the $2.940 resistance might send the price toward the $3.00 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.050 resistance or even $3.120 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.20. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.820 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.620 level. The next major support is near the $2.50 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.50 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.450 support. The next major support sits near the $2.350 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.
