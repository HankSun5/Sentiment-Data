43463604,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150517,1744929055,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alert: Slovenia Considers 25% Crypto Tax ‚Äì Decoding the Impact,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/slovenia-crypto-tax-imminent-impact/,"Cryptocurrency investors in Slovenia, brace yourselves! A significant shift in the regulatory landscape might be on the horizon. The Slovenian Finance Ministry has dropped a bombshell proposal: a 25% tax on profits from individual crypto investments. This move, aimed at plugging a perceived tax loophole, is currently open for public discussion until May 5th. If it gets the green light from parliament, this new law could come into effect as early as January 1, 2026. Let‚Äôs dive deep into what this crypto tax Slovenia proposal entails and what it could mean for you. Why the Sudden Focus on Crypto Tax in Slovenia? For some time, Slovenia has been known for its relatively lenient stance on cryptocurrency taxation, often seen as a haven for crypto enthusiasts within the European Union. However, this proposed 25% tax on individual crypto profits tax Slovenia signals a potential change in direction. The government‚Äôs rationale is clear: to close an existing tax loophole and generate revenue. According to Bloomberg reports, the estimated annual revenue from this tax could range anywhere from ‚Ç¨2.5 million to a substantial ‚Ç¨25 million. But why now? Several factors could be at play: Increased Crypto Adoption: As cryptocurrency adoption grows globally and within Slovenia, governments are increasingly looking at ways to tax this burgeoning asset class. EU Pressure and Harmonization: There‚Äôs a broader trend within the European Union towards harmonizing tax regulations, including those related to digital assets. Slovenia might be aligning itself with this trend. Revenue Generation: Governments worldwide are constantly seeking new revenue streams, and the growing crypto market presents an attractive target for taxation. Fairness and Equity: The argument is often made that profits from crypto investments should be taxed similarly to other forms of investment gains to ensure fairness in the tax system. Decoding the Proposed 25% Slovenia Crypto Tax Rate The core of the proposal is a 25% tax on individual cryptocurrency tax Slovenia gains. This is a significant percentage and warrants careful consideration. Let‚Äôs break down what this could mean: Who is Affected? This tax specifically targets individual investors and their profits from crypto investments. It‚Äôs crucial to note that it focuses on gains, not the principal investment amount. Tax Rate: A flat 25% tax rate is proposed. This is a considerable tax rate, potentially impacting the profitability of crypto investments for Slovenian residents. Taxable Events: The proposal likely defines specific taxable events, such as selling cryptocurrency for fiat currency or potentially exchanging one cryptocurrency for another. The specifics will be crucial to understand. Implementation Date: If approved, the law is slated to take effect on January 1, 2026. This gives investors some time to prepare, but also underscores the urgency to understand and potentially respond to the proposal during the public comment period. Potential Benefits and Challenges of the New Crypto Tax Law Like any tax policy, the proposed Slovenia crypto tax law comes with its own set of potential benefits and challenges. Let‚Äôs weigh them out: Potential Benefits: Increased Government Revenue: The most direct benefit is the potential for increased revenue for the Slovenian government. This revenue could be used for public services and infrastructure projects. Level Playing Field: Taxing crypto profits could create a more level playing field with traditional investments, which are typically subject to capital gains taxes. Regulatory Clarity: While taxation can be seen as a burden, it also provides a degree of regulatory clarity for the crypto sector in Slovenia. Clear rules can foster a more stable and predictable environment. Potential Challenges: Impact on Crypto Innovation: A high tax rate could potentially stifle innovation and investment in the crypto sector within Slovenia. It might make Slovenia less attractive compared to jurisdictions with more favorable tax regimes. Compliance Burden: Implementing and complying with crypto tax regulations can be complex. Both taxpayers and tax authorities will need to adapt to new reporting and compliance requirements. Capital Flight: If the tax regime is perceived as too burdensome, there‚Äôs a risk of capital flight, with crypto businesses and investors potentially moving to more tax-friendly locations. Enforcement Challenges: Taxing crypto assets can be challenging due to their decentralized and often borderless nature. Effective enforcement will be crucial for the success of this tax law. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors in Slovenia? Actionable Insights For crypto investors in Slovenia, this proposed cryptocurrency tax law is a significant development that requires attention and proactive steps: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on the developments regarding this proposal. Follow news outlets and official announcements from the Slovenian Finance Ministry. Participate in Public Comment: The public comment period is open until May 5th. If you are affected by this proposal, consider submitting your comments and feedback. Your voice matters! Seek Professional Advice: Consult with a tax advisor or financial professional to understand how this proposed law might impact your specific crypto investments and tax obligations. Tax Planning: Start thinking about tax planning strategies in light of this potential new tax regime. This might involve reviewing your investment strategies and considering the tax implications of your crypto activities. Long-Term Perspective: Consider the long-term implications of this tax law on the Slovenian crypto market. Think about how it might affect your investment decisions in the future. Examples of Crypto Tax Regulations in Other Countries To put Slovenia‚Äôs proposal into perspective, let‚Äôs briefly look at how other countries are approaching crypto regulation and taxation: Country Crypto Tax Approach Germany Tax-free after one year of holding for individuals. Otherwise, taxed as income tax. Portugal Generally no personal income tax on crypto gains (subject to change). United States Taxed as property, with capital gains tax rates applying based on holding period. India 30% tax on crypto gains, with limited deductions. South Korea 20% tax on crypto gains exceeding a certain threshold (implementation delayed). Note: Crypto tax regulations are constantly evolving, and this table provides a simplified overview. Always consult with a tax professional for specific advice. As you can see, the approach to crypto taxation varies significantly across different jurisdictions. Slovenia‚Äôs proposed 25% tax rate, if implemented, would place it somewhere in the mid-to-high range compared to other countries. The final impact will depend on the specific details of the law and how effectively it is implemented and enforced. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Crypto Tax Landscape in Slovenia The proposed 25% tax on individual crypto profits in Slovenia marks a potentially shocking turning point in the country‚Äôs approach to cryptocurrency regulation. While aimed at closing tax loopholes and generating revenue, it also presents challenges for crypto investors and the broader crypto ecosystem in Slovenia. Staying informed, participating in the public discourse, and seeking professional advice are crucial steps for navigating this evolving landscape. The future of crypto regulation in Slovenia is now in a period of critical discussion and development. Keep watching this space!

43463907,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150520,1744929652,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Confidence Surge: a16z Crypto Amplifies LayerZero Investment with $55M Locked ZRO Token Acquisition,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/a16z-crypto-layerzero-investment/,"In a powerful display of confidence in cross-chain technology, a16z Crypto has significantly deepened its commitment to LayerZero by acquiring an additional $55 million worth of ZRO tokens. This substantial LayerZero investment , announced on X, comes with a three-year lock-up period, signaling a long-term belief in the protocol‚Äôs potential. But what does this mean for LayerZero, a16z crypto, and the broader Web3 ecosystem? Let‚Äôs dive into the details of this exciting development. Why is a16z Crypto Doubling Down on LayerZero? For those familiar with the crypto venture capital landscape, a16z crypto is a name synonymous with strategic investments and backing for groundbreaking projects. Their continued support for LayerZero is not entirely new; they previously led LayerZero‚Äôs Series A+ and Series B funding rounds. This latest acquisition, however, is more than just another funding round. It‚Äôs a strong endorsement, a public declaration of faith in LayerZero‚Äôs technology and its future trajectory. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what makes this investment noteworthy: Significant Investment Size: $55 million is a considerable sum, especially in the current market climate. It demonstrates a substantial financial commitment from a major player like a16z. Token Lock-up Period: The three-year lock-up is crucial. It means a16z is not looking for a quick flip. They are in it for the long haul, indicating a belief in the long-term growth and success of LayerZero and the ZRO token . Existing Relationship: a16z‚Äôs prior investments in LayerZero suggest a deep understanding of the project, its team, and its technology. This isn‚Äôt a speculative bet; it‚Äôs a calculated move based on existing conviction. Strategic Alignment: LayerZero‚Äôs mission to solve blockchain interoperability aligns perfectly with the broader Web3 vision of a connected and decentralized future, a vision a16z actively champions. Key Aspect Details of a16z‚Äôs LayerZero Investment Investor a16z Crypto Investment Amount $55 million Token ZRO Lock-up Period 3 years Previous Involvement Led Series A+ and Series B rounds Understanding LayerZero: The Interoperability Powerhouse For those newer to the crypto space, understanding LayerZero is crucial to appreciating the significance of this crypto venture capital injection. LayerZero is designed to be an omnichain interoperability protocol. In simpler terms, it‚Äôs built to connect different blockchains seamlessly. Imagine a world where moving assets or data between Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and other blockchains is as easy as sending an email. That‚Äôs the problem LayerZero is tackling. Here‚Äôs why interoperability is so vital and why LayerZero stands out: Breaking Down Silos: Currently, blockchains often operate in isolation. LayerZero aims to break down these silos, creating a more unified and efficient crypto ecosystem. Enhanced User Experience: Interoperability simplifies the user experience. Users won‚Äôt need to navigate complex bridges or worry about chain compatibility when interacting with different dApps (decentralized applications). Developer Flexibility: LayerZero empowers developers to build truly omnichain applications, leveraging the strengths of multiple blockchains without being confined to a single ecosystem. Increased Capital Efficiency: By enabling seamless asset transfer across chains, LayerZero can improve capital efficiency within the crypto market. LayerZero‚Äôs technology utilizes an innovative approach called the Ultra Light Node (ULN), which offers a balance of security and efficiency in cross-chain communication. This is a key differentiator compared to earlier bridging solutions that often faced security vulnerabilities or were cumbersome to use. The Role of Web3 Funding and Venture Capital in Crypto Growth The web3 funding landscape is heavily influenced by venture capital firms like a16z. These firms play a crucial role in nurturing and accelerating the growth of promising crypto projects. Their investments are not just about the money; they bring expertise, networks, and credibility to the table. Here‚Äôs how venture capital fuels the Web3 revolution: Financial Resources: VC funding provides the capital needed for projects to develop their technology, build teams, and scale their operations. Strategic Guidance: VC firms often offer strategic advice and mentorship, helping projects navigate the complexities of the crypto market and build sustainable businesses. Network Effects: VCs have extensive networks within the industry, connecting projects with potential partners, talent, and future investors. Validation and Credibility: Investment from reputable VCs like a16z adds significant validation and credibility to a project, attracting further attention and adoption. a16z‚Äôs increased investment in LayerZero underscores the continued confidence of institutional investors in the long-term potential of Web3 and the underlying technologies that power it. Despite market fluctuations and regulatory uncertainties, smart money is still flowing into the space, seeking out projects with strong fundamentals and innovative solutions. What‚Äôs Next for LayerZero and the ZRO Token? With this fresh infusion of capital and the unwavering backing of a16z crypto , LayerZero is well-positioned to further develop its technology and expand its ecosystem. The three-year lock-up on the ZRO token acquisition suggests a focus on long-term value creation rather than short-term gains. Potential future developments for LayerZero and ZRO could include: Ecosystem Growth: We can expect to see more dApps and projects integrating LayerZero for cross-chain functionality, expanding its network effect. Technology Advancements: LayerZero may continue to innovate and enhance its protocol, potentially improving speed, security, and cost-effectiveness. Token Utility Expansion: The utility of the ZRO token within the LayerZero ecosystem could evolve, potentially encompassing governance, staking, or other functionalities. Mainstream Adoption: As interoperability becomes increasingly crucial, LayerZero could play a pivotal role in driving mainstream adoption of Web3 technologies. Conclusion: A Confident Stride Towards Interoperable Web3 a16z Crypto‚Äôs $55 million investment in locked ZRO tokens is a resounding vote of confidence in LayerZero and the future of blockchain interoperability. It highlights the strategic importance of cross-chain solutions in building a more connected and user-friendly Web3 ecosystem. This move not only benefits LayerZero directly but also sends a positive signal to the broader crypto market, reinforcing the long-term investment thesis for innovative projects tackling fundamental challenges. As LayerZero continues to build and expand, its impact on the crypto landscape is poised to become even more profound, paving the way for a truly omnichain future.

43464143,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=711846,1744929812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43464143.jpeg,Google‚Äôs AI safety promises under scrutiny after Gemini report,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/googles-ai-safety-promises-under-scrutiny-after-gemini-report/,"Google shared a safety paper on its flagship artificial‚Äëintelligence model, Gemini 2.5 Pro. Experts say it leaves key risks unexplained. The company posted the technical paper on Thursday, several weeks after it released Gemini 2.5 Pro to customers. The document lists the internal tests Google ran on the model but offers few facts on how the system behaves under overload or misuse. Researchers who reviewed the paper told TechCrunch the missing details make it hard to judge whether Gemini 2.5 Pro is truly safe for broad use. Technical reports are one of the main ways the public learns what advanced AI systems can and cannot do. A thorough report often shows where a model fails and where it might be misused. Many AI researchers treat these papers as honest efforts to back up a company‚Äôs safety claims. Google handles safety reporting differently. Google releases a report only after a model is no longer tagged ‚Äúexperimental,‚Äù and it moves certain ‚Äúdangerous capability‚Äù findings into a separate audit that is not published at once. As a result, the public paper does not cover every threat Google has tested for. Several analysts said the new Gemini 2.5 Pro document is a stark case of limited disclosure. They also noticed that the report never refers to Google‚Äôs Frontier Safety Framework, or FSF, a policy the company announced last year to spot future AI powers that could cause ‚Äúsevere harm.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis report is very sparse, contains minimal information, and arrived weeks after the model went public,‚Äù said Peter Wildeford, co‚Äëfounder of the Institute for AI Policy and Strategy. ‚ÄúIt is impossible to confirm whether Google is meeting its own promises, and therefore impossible to judge the safety and security of its models.‚Äù Thomas Woodside, co‚Äëfounder of the Secure AI Project, said he was glad any paper had appeared at all, yet he doubted Google‚Äôs plan to release steady follow‚Äëups. He pointed out that the last time the firm shared results from dangerous‚Äëcapability tests was June 2024, and that paper covered a model announced in February of the same year. Confidence slipped further when observers saw no safety paper for Gemini 2.5 Flash, a slimmer and faster model Google revealed last week. A company spokesperson said a Flash paper is ‚Äúcoming soon.‚Äù ‚ÄúI hope this is a real promise to start giving more frequent updates,‚Äù Woodside said. ‚ÄúThose updates should include results for models that have not yet reached the public, because those models may also pose serious risks.‚Äù Google now falls short on transparency Meta‚Äôs safety note for its new Llama 4 models runs only a few pages, while OpenAI chose not to publish any report at all for its GPT‚Äë4.1 series. The shortage of detail comes at a tense time. Two years ago, Google told the U.S. government it would post safety papers for every ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù AI model within scope.‚Äù The company made similar pledges to officials in other countries, saying it would offer ‚Äúpublic transparency‚Äù about its AI products. Kevin Bankston, senior adviser on AI governance at the Center for Democracy and Technology, called the releases from leading labs a ‚Äúrace to the bottom‚Äù on safety. ‚ÄúCombined with reports that rival labs like OpenAI have cut safety‚Äëtesting time before release from months to days, this meager documentation for Google‚Äôs top model tells a troubling story of a race to the bottom on AI safety and transparency as companies rush their models to market,‚Äù he added. Google says much of its safety work happens behind closed doors. The company states that every model undergoes strict tests, including ‚Äúadversarial red teaming,‚Äù before any public launch.

The world of digital asset derivatives is heating up, and Coinbase International is making waves. Last week, this Bermuda-based platform, a sibling to the U.S. crypto giant Coinbase, witnessed a massive surge in Bitcoin futures volume , hitting a staggering $100 billion. Yes, you read that right ‚Äì $100 billion in just one week! This isn‚Äôt just a blip on the radar; it‚Äôs a significant indicator of the evolving landscape of crypto trading and the growing appetite for derivatives outside the heavily regulated U.S. market. Why the Sudden Spike in Bitcoin Futures Volume? So, what‚Äôs fueling this explosive growth in Bitcoin futures volume on Coinbase International? Several factors are likely at play, all converging to create a perfect storm for derivatives trading: Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its rollercoaster rides, and recent weeks have been no exception. Periods of high volatility often drive traders towards derivatives markets. Why? Because futures contracts allow traders to speculate on price movements ‚Äì both up and down ‚Äì without actually holding the underlying asset. This can be particularly attractive during uncertain times. Demand for Crypto Derivatives: U.S. regulations are stringent when it comes to crypto derivatives. Platforms like Coinbase in the U.S. don‚Äôt offer the same range of perpetual futures contracts that are available on international exchanges. Traders seeking access to these instruments are naturally drawn to platforms like Coinbase International . Institutional Interest: While retail traders are a significant part of the crypto market, the $100 billion figure suggests a substantial influx of institutional capital. Institutional demand for crypto exposure is on the rise, and derivatives offer a sophisticated way for institutions to participate in the market, manage risk, and potentially enhance returns. Coinbase‚Äôs Global Expansion: Coinbase‚Äôs strategic move to establish Coinbase International in Bermuda is paying off. It allows them to tap into the global derivatives market and cater to a wider audience beyond the U.S. This expansion positions Coinbase as a key player in the international crypto derivatives space. Coinbase International: A Rising Star in Crypto Derivatives Coinbase International , though relatively new, is rapidly establishing itself as a force to be reckoned with in the crypto derivatives market. Here‚Äôs a closer look at what makes it stand out: Backed by Coinbase: The platform benefits from the reputation and infrastructure of Coinbase, a publicly traded and well-respected name in the crypto industry. This association provides a level of trust and security that is crucial in the often-unregulated world of crypto exchanges. Focus on Perpetual Futures: Perpetual futures contracts are a popular type of crypto derivative that doesn‚Äôt have an expiry date. This allows traders to hold positions for as long as they want, making them attractive for both short-term speculation and longer-term trading strategies. Global Reach: Being based in Bermuda allows Coinbase International to serve a global audience, bypassing some of the regulatory hurdles faced by U.S.-based platforms. This global accessibility is a major advantage in attracting international traders and institutional demand . Competitive Trading Environment: The platform likely offers competitive trading fees and a robust trading engine to attract and retain users in the highly competitive crypto exchange landscape. The Allure of Futures Trading: Benefits and Risks Futures trading , particularly in the crypto market, offers both exciting opportunities and significant risks. Understanding these is crucial for anyone considering venturing into this space. Benefits of Futures Trading: Leverage: Futures contracts allow traders to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. This leverage can amplify profits, but also losses. Hedging: Futures can be used to hedge against price volatility in the spot market. For example, if you hold Bitcoin, you can use Bitcoin futures to protect against potential price declines. Profit from Falling Prices: Unlike traditional spot trading where you primarily profit from price increases, futures allow you to profit from both rising and falling prices by taking long or short positions. Liquidity: Major crypto futures exchanges generally offer high liquidity, allowing for efficient order execution. Risks of Futures Trading: High Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile, and this volatility is amplified in futures trading due to leverage. Liquidation Risk: Leverage increases the risk of liquidation. If the market moves against your position, you could lose your initial margin and potentially more. Complexity: Futures trading can be more complex than spot trading, requiring a deeper understanding of margin, leverage, and contract specifications. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto derivatives is still evolving, and changes in regulations could impact the market. Institutional Demand: The Driving Force? While retail interest in crypto remains strong, the surge in futures trading volume, especially on platforms like Coinbase International , increasingly points towards the growing influence of institutional demand . Institutions, such as hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations, are increasingly looking at crypto as a legitimate asset class. Here‚Äôs why institutional demand is a significant factor: Portfolio Diversification: Institutions are constantly seeking diversification to manage risk and enhance returns. Crypto, with its low correlation to traditional assets, offers a compelling diversification opportunity. Sophisticated Trading Strategies: Institutions often employ more sophisticated trading strategies, including derivatives trading, to optimize their crypto exposure. Increased Market Maturity: As the crypto market matures, institutions are becoming more comfortable participating, driven by factors like improved custody solutions, clearer regulatory frameworks (in some jurisdictions), and growing market infrastructure. Search for Yield: In a low-interest-rate environment, institutions are constantly searching for yield. Crypto, despite its volatility, offers the potential for higher returns compared to traditional fixed-income assets. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders What does this Bitcoin futures volume surge on Coinbase International mean for you, the crypto trader? Keep an Eye on Derivatives Markets: The derivatives market is becoming increasingly important in the crypto ecosystem. Monitoring trading volumes and trends on platforms like Coinbase International can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Understand Futures Trading: If you‚Äôre not already familiar with futures trading, now might be a good time to learn the basics. While it comes with risks, it also offers powerful tools for speculation, hedging, and portfolio management. Consider Global Platforms: Don‚Äôt limit yourself to U.S.-regulated exchanges, especially if you‚Äôre interested in derivatives. Explore international platforms like Coinbase International to access a wider range of crypto products and trading opportunities. Stay Informed about Regulations: The regulatory landscape for crypto derivatives is constantly evolving. Stay updated on regulatory developments in different jurisdictions to understand the implications for your trading activities. Conclusion: The Future is Derivatives? The $100 billion Bitcoin futures volume on Coinbase International is not just a number; it‚Äôs a testament to the growing sophistication and globalization of the crypto market. It signals a clear shift towards derivatives trading, driven by market volatility, institutional demand , and the strategic expansion of platforms like Coinbase. As the crypto space matures, expect to see derivatives playing an even more central role, offering both opportunities and challenges for traders and investors alike. The surge on Coinbase International is a powerful reminder that the crypto revolution is far from over ‚Äì it‚Äôs just entering a new, more complex, and potentially more rewarding phase.

Related Reading: Is Shiba Inu On Track To Dethrone Dogecoin? Here‚Äôs What The Experts Say Total market value witnessed a drop of $3.8 trillion to $2.8 trillion, an 18.6% decline over the quarter. This sharp plunge marked the turnaround before the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president, in stark contrast to last year‚Äôs ramp up. Trading volume also suffered some contractions, as the daily volumes dropped to $146 billion, a decrease of 27%. Bitcoin Rules Market While Others Decline Bitcoin insulated itself reasonably from the turbulence in other cryptocurrencies so that its market share reached nearly 60%, the highest in four years. Bitcoin achieved peak valuation at $106,182 in January shortly after inauguration but plunged almost 12% to finish the quarter at $82,514. Compared with Bitcoin during this period, gold and US Treasury bonds were traditional safe-haven investments with lower performance. Compared to Ethereum, however, the situation was much worse. Its price fell by 45%, essentially wiping out all gains in 2024. Its market share dropped to almost 8%, the lowest it has been since the end of 2019. As it has been observed by most analysts, this downturn is not something new since more and more activities have shifted toward ‚ÄúLayer 2‚Äù networks built atop Ethereum and not using the Ethereum main network. Meme Coins Crash After Major Scam The previously red-hot meme coin space received a rude wake-up call in early 2025. Following a boom in Trump-themed tokens, the industry was severely hurt when the Libra token ‚Äì introduced by Argentina‚Äôs President Javier Milei ‚Äì proved to be a scam. The project was abandoned by developers after they had taken investors‚Äô funds, shattering confidence in such tokens. By late March, new token launches on the platform Pump.fun per day had dropped by over 50%. DeFi Industry Loses More Than A Quarter Of Its Value Not even the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry was exempted. Overall money in DeFi projects dropped 27% to $48 billion during the first quarter. Ethereum‚Äôs dominance in the DeFi space declined to 56% by quarter-end. Related Reading: Solana Hits Milestone As Canada OKs First Spot ETFs Not everything was negative, though. Stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) became more popular with investors seeking a safer bet as the market tanked. Solana also remained in its leadership position, holding 39.6% of all decentralized exchange (DEX) trading during Q1, courtesy mostly of meme coin mania. Even Solana‚Äôs leadership, however, started to wane at the end of the period as the meme coin mania declined. The dramatic shift in market sentiment shows how quickly cryptocurrency fortunes can change. After a promising end to 2024, the new year brought a harsh reality check for crypto investors, with nearly $1 trillion in market value disappearing in just three months.

Arbitrum Hits $300B Milestone While Litecoin Holds Steady,https://thecoinrise.com/is-qubetics-the-top-crypto-presale-of-2025-arbitrum-hits-300b-milestone-while-litecoin-holds-steady/,"The current market is showing signs of consolidation, and that‚Äôs often when the sharpest eyes find the best entries. While Bitcoin and top altcoins weather the volatility, the real shift is happening beneath the surface‚Äîwhere utility meets opportunity. Arbitrum just broke records with Uniswap, clocking over $300 billion in volume and proving that Ethereum Layer 2 scaling isn‚Äôt just hype‚Äîit‚Äôs infrastructure. Meanwhile, Litecoin is doing what it always does in uncertain markets: staying steady, staying fast, and staying relevant. These developments set the stage for something bigger‚Äîbecause while Layer 2 adoption heats up and OG coins like Litecoin hold their ground, the window is still open for standout presales with real-world application to disrupt the space. One project making that kind of noise right now is Qubetics. It‚Äôs checking every box: enterprise-grade utility, a live presale with surging numbers, and a dev-friendly ecosystem that could bring Web3 to the everyday user without friction. That kind of clarity is what makes a top crypto presale , especially when big-name tokens are grappling with gas fees, throughput issues, or stagnant roadmaps. Qubetics ($TICS) enters the scene with something rare‚Äîan ecosystem that doesn‚Äôt require a dictionary to understand. It‚Äôs built with a problem-solving lens that directly challenges the hurdles most chains still haven‚Äôt solved. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs capturing attention not only from DeFi participants and early adopters but also from business professionals, developers, and even Web2-native platforms exploring their first leap into Web3 integration. Qubetics ‚Äì Developer-First Ecosystem Powered by QubeQode IDE At the heart of Qubetics lies QubeQode IDE , a no-nonsense, developer-focused interface that enables real-time smart contract generation and deployment without needing a PhD in Solidity. The IDE streamlines the Web3 build process for both seasoned blockchain developers and professionals with zero coding background. Through its simplified architecture, users can create, test, and deploy cross-chain applications‚Äîall without leaving the platform. That‚Äôs not just a perk‚Äîit‚Äôs a shift in how decentralized applications are built and scaled. Businesses can tokenize assets, professionals can build revenue-generating protocols, and individuals can plug into DeFi ecosystems without clunky middleware or third-party dependencies. It‚Äôs interoperability and automation baked into one environment‚Äîunlocking access to decentralized infrastructure for real users, not just crypto natives. And it‚Äôs this kind of user-centric innovation that defines what a top crypto presale should look like. Qubetics isn‚Äôt trying to be a trend‚Äîit‚Äôs aiming to be a backbone. Qubetics Presale Update ‚Äì Entry Price, ROI Potential, and Market Response The Qubetics presale is currently in Stage 30 , and momentum hasn‚Äôt skipped a beat. So far, the project has sold more than 508 million tokens to over 24,800 holders , raising more than $16.1 million . $TICS tokens are available now at $0.1729 , but time and supply are moving fast. Those who jumped in during Stage 1 at $0.01 are already sitting on a 1629% return . But even at this stage, the window is wide open for those seeking long-term ROI and entry at a high-leverage point. If acquired today, a $TICS token priced at $0.1729 could still yield a projected 477% return at $1. At $5, that jumps to 2789% , while $6 gives 3367% ROI . If $TICS pushes to $10 post-listing, the return spikes to 5678% . Analysts projecting a $15 valuation following the mainnet launch estimate a return of 8567% from current levels. That kind of potential doesn‚Äôt appear out of thin air. It comes from substance‚Äîutility, usability, scalability, and forward-looking tech. It‚Äôs why Qubetics is drawing comparisons with the best crypto presale contenders historically and establishing its case as a top crypto presale in 2025. Arbitrum ‚Äì Setting the L2 Standard in DeFi Arbitrum just crossed an industry-defining threshold. The Ethereum Layer 2 network recently surpassed $300 billion in trading volume on Uniswap , the first L2 to achieve this. The milestone is more than a big number‚Äîit‚Äôs a reflection of Arbitrum‚Äôs role as the backbone of affordable, high-speed DeFi. Uniswap‚Äôs integration with Arbitrum proves that L2 networks are not just scaling tools‚Äîthey‚Äôre foundational for next-gen finance. What makes Arbitrum‚Äôs rise more impactful is its balance of speed and security. It maintains Ethereum‚Äôs trustless infrastructure while eliminating the prohibitively high gas fees that drove many users away from L1 DEX activity. This L2 adoption trend is now influencing both institutional and retail decision-makers, further anchoring Arbitrum as a critical force in Ethereum‚Äôs scaling narrative. While Arbitrum isn‚Äôt a presale and doesn‚Äôt carry the same upside dynamics as Qubetics, its dominance showcases the infrastructure layer needed to support scalable projects‚Äîmany of which will emerge from presale ecosystems like Qubetics. Litecoin ‚Äì Simplicity That Sticks Litecoin is one of those projects that doesn‚Äôt need gimmicks. It‚Äôs been called the ‚Äúsilver to Bitcoin‚Äôs gold‚Äù for years‚Äîand that analogy still holds. Built for speed and designed with lower transaction fees in mind, Litecoin has seen multiple market cycles and remains standing, adopted, and widely supported. And in a market where complexity can push out everyday users, Litecoin‚Äôs simplicity is its power. Halving events have consistently driven renewed attention to LTC, not only for their economic impact but also for the sentiment reset they provide. While other altcoins ride waves of news and flash launches, Litecoin grinds upward on the back of proven history. And that‚Äôs what makes it an appealing option for those who like their risk measurable and their asset behavior understandable. Though Litecoin may not fall under the top crypto presale category, it serves a critical role in portfolios looking to balance innovation with resilience. Final Thoughts In a time when the market demands more than promises, Qubetics is doing something few others can‚Äîdelivering early. With a fully integrated dev stack, a live and engaged presale community, and ROI models that don‚Äôt rely on hype alone, Qubetics isn‚Äôt just a top crypto presale‚Äîit‚Äôs the blueprint for what presales should aim to be. Meanwhile, Arbitrum‚Äôs achievements in DeFi scalability and Litecoin‚Äôs status as a legacy asset serve to reinforce the broader point: that real value comes from real functionality. As the market recalibrates, participants are beginning to understand that flash-in-the-pan projects don‚Äôt cut it anymore. The focus is shifting toward scalable tech, real-world usability, and systems that onboard‚Äînot alienate. Qubetics, Arbitrum, and Litecoin reflect different ends of that spectrum‚Äîbut they each represent a strong case for the top crypto presale discussions now and going forward.

Trump signaled that he is reluctant to impose further tariffs on China because doing so would delay a trade deal. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, the president said people he regards as direct envoys of Chinese leader Xi‚ÄØJinping had ‚Äúreached out a number of times‚Äù in recent days. ‚ÄúI have a very good relationship with President‚ÄØXi, and I think it‚Äôs going to continue,‚Äù Trump said. Asked if Xi himself had called, Trump replied, ‚ÄúWell, the same. I view it very similar. It would be top levels of China.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs comments come after months of rising import duties that have pushed U.S. taxes on Chinese goods to a combined 145‚ÄØpercent and prompted Beijing to retaliate with tariffs of 125‚ÄØpercent. The trade war has halted commerce between the world‚Äôs two largest economies and complicated a separate effort to force ByteDance‚ÄØLtd. to divest TikTok‚Äôs American operations. On Thursday, the President suggested for the first time that further tariff hikes could backfire. ‚ÄúAt a certain point I don‚Äôt want them to go higher because at a certain point you make it where people don‚Äôt buy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo I may not want to go higher, or I may not want to even go up to that level. I may want to go to less because, you know, you want people to buy.‚Äù Trump may provide a relief in tariffs if China accepts TikTok divestiture Both capitals have insisted that the other side make the next move. Even so, Trump sounded upbeat about the chances of linking a wider trade deal with a TikTok deal . ‚ÄúWell, we have a deal for TikTok, but it‚Äôll be subject to China, so we‚Äôll just delay the deal till this thing works out,‚Äù he said. He argued that selling TikTok‚Äôs U.S. assets to ‚Äúsome of the best companies in the world‚Äù would satisfy American security worries and still benefit Beijing. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a good deal for China,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTikTok is good for China. And I think they‚Äôd like to see us do a deal, especially the deal that we have pretty much done.‚Äù When asked about whether tariff relief might be offered if China accepts the divestiture plan, the president answered that nothing was off the table. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a natural ‚Äî if we‚Äôre making a deal. I guess we‚Äôll spend five minutes to talk about TikTok. It wouldn‚Äôt take very long,‚Äù he said. Trump declined to describe any timetable for new talks or for easing duties. He also avoided saying whether he and Xi had spoken directly, stressing instead that any overture from Beijing would reflect Xi‚Äôs personal approval. ‚ÄúIf you knew him you would know that if they reached out, he knew exactly,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúHe knew everything about it, he runs it very tight, very strong, very smart.‚Äù With both sides dug in publicly, it remains unclear how soon formal negotiations might resume.

The media outlet Daehan Kyungjae reported that FIU, which answers to the Financial Services Commission (FSC), will wrap up its investigation on April 18. The probe began on March 17, and was originally planned to conclude on March 28. The investigation is primarily aimed at checking exchanges‚Äô compliance with anti-money laundering protocols. After Bithumb, Coinone will be the last of South Korea‚Äôs five fiat KRW-trading exchanges to face the FIU probe.

(Source: CoinGecko) The Upbit probe unearthed a slew of Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verification violations, with the FSC later dishing out a three-month punishment. In late March, a branch of the Seoul Administrative Court suspended the ban for 30 days . The media outlet quoted an anonymous official from an unnamed domestic crypto exchange as saying that the FIU‚Äôs extension ‚Äúmay be due to the vast amount of data‚Äù it is now combing through. However, the same individual claimed there was a ‚Äúsuspicion‚Äù that the delay was due to a specific transaction. The individual claimed that Bithumb wallets had ‚Äútransferred more than 60 million coins, worth approximately 22.4 billion won (over $15.8 million), to an exchange that is not registered with the financial authorities.‚Äù The FIU plans to begin its on-site inspection at Coinone on April 21.

(Source: CoinGecko) The FSS claims that a former Bithumb CEO and a current advisor used company-provided apartment deposits to lease a property to a third party. The regulator thinks that one of the executives used a KRW 1.1 billion ($778,000) deposit from Bithumb to pay for a home they then leased to a resident in exchange for rent payments worth around $2 million. The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors‚Äô Office‚Äôs crypto investigation team followed up with a raid of Bithumb‚Äôs headquarters last month. Coinone, meanwhile, faced an FSS probe of its own late last year. The investigation followed a massive December 9 Movement (MOVE) token price spike on the Coinone platform.

The crypto market in 2025 is rewarding early movers who back projects with working products, clear roadmaps, and rising demand. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain dominant, new projects are quietly gaining ground‚Äîand delivering serious growth. In this guide, we break down six of the top cryptos to buy now, including BlockDAG , Web3 ai , Cold Wallet, Unstaked, Dragoin, and Web3Bay. Whether you‚Äôre after cutting-edge AI, privacy tools, meme coin potential, or real-world e-commerce integration, these tokens check all the right boxes. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) ‚Äî Best Crypto Infrastructure Pick Right Now BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the best cryptos to invest in now. It‚Äôs raised over $214.5 million, sold 16,600+ mining rigs, and its X1 mobile miner app has hit 800,000+ users. What makes BlockDAG different is its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology. Instead of creating one block at a time like traditional chains, it allows for multiple blocks to be created in parallel‚Äîmaking transactions faster and cheaper. The project is EVM-compatible , making it easy for developers to migrate dApps from Ethereum. Currently in Batch 27 at $0.0248 , BDAG‚Äôs projected ROI stands at 2,380% , especially with its mainnet launching in just 4 months . For those looking for a project that blends technical strength with growing adoption, BlockDAG is one of the best cryptos to buy now . 2. Web3 ai (WAI) ‚Äî Top AI Crypto With Real Utility From Day One Web3 ai merges artificial intelligence with crypto to give users a powerful suite of tools for smarter investing. Unlike most presale projects, Web3 ai already offers 12 live tools , including an AI trading assistant, price prediction engine, scam detector, yield farming advisor, and automated trading bot. The project uses advanced machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to deliver real-time insights across multiple chains and exchanges. The $WAI token, priced at $0.10 in Batch 1, gives users full access to the platform and a future listing price of $0.80 makes the upside extremely attractive. If you want a working product, a clear roadmap, and next-gen AI tools in one package, Web3 ai is one of the best new cryptos to buy now . 3. Cold Wallet (CWT) ‚Äî Best Privacy Crypto Wallet in the Market If privacy matters to you, Cold Wallet could be the best crypto to buy now for protecting your assets. Unlike most wallets that track IP addresses, log behavior, or expose transaction data, Cold Wallet is invisible by design. It functions like a cold wallet but remains online and fully accessible. Powered by zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) , it supports private transactions, hidden balances, and anonymous authentication. The $CWT token , now in presale at $0.007 , will unlock premium features and governance. With a launch price of $0.35 , Cold Wallet offers serious upside for early backers. As hacks and surveillance increase in Web3, Cold Wallet is standing out as one of the best cryptos to buy now for privacy-first users. 4. Unstaked (UNSD) ‚Äî Best AI Agent Platform for Earning and Engagement Unstaked is the first crypto platform that deploys AI agents to run and grow your online communities‚Äîcompletely autonomously. These agents create content, reply to users, and optimize behavior in real-time. They‚Äôre tied to your wallet and earn based on actual performance through a system called Proof of Intelligence (PoI). The token, $UNSD , is priced at just $0.0065 in presale, with a projected launch market cap of over $1 billion . With $20 million in liquidity provisioned at launch , this isn‚Äôt just an idea‚Äîit‚Äôs a fully functional platform from day one. For those who want real AI utility, merit-based rewards, and early entry, Unstaked is among the best cryptos to invest in today. 5. Dragoin (DDGN) ‚Äî Meme Coin With Burn Mechanics and Scarcity Dragoin is not your typical meme coin. Every transaction burns a portion of the supply, creating real scarcity. This smart deflationary design helps prevent the common inflation issues found in many meme projects. The token, $DDGN , is in public presale , with a launch price set at $0.002 . Inspired by SHIB and PEPE but with better tokenomics, Dragoin offers meme potential without the empty speculation. If it hits its upside targets, early holders could see gains as high as 6,700% . If you‚Äôre looking for the best meme crypto to buy now, Dragoin is worth serious attention. 6. Web3Bay (3BAY) ‚Äî Best Crypto for Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is building the Amazon of Web3‚Äîa fully decentralized, peer-to-peer e-commerce platform. It supports both crypto and fiat payments, including PayPal, Google Pay, and Apple Pay. With smart contracts handling escrow and settlements, Web3Bay eliminates the need for intermediaries. The $3BAY token is priced at $0.00524 in Stage 5 , with $1.7 million raised and 400M tokens sold . Token holders get discounts, governance rights, and staking rewards. As the project evolves, plans include NFT integration, lending, and full DAO governance. Web3Bay is easily one of the best cryptos to buy now if you‚Äôre bullish on blockchain adoption in e-commerce.

Despite the current lack of a strong bullish momentum, many crypto analysts are banking on a bullish continuation and a new Bitcoin price all-time high before the end of 2025. According to crypto analyst TradingShot, Bitcoin could be approaching the final leg of this bull cycle, predicting a peak above $125,000. However, this analysis comes with a caveat that an extended bear market might roll in by October 2025. Long-Term Bitcoin Cycles Hint At Imminent Peak TradingShot‚Äôs analysis, which was posted on the TradingView platform, is based on over a decade of symmetrical Bitcoin market behavior that shows both bull and bear cycles unfolding in consistent timeframes. According to TradingShot, the bull cycles dating back to 2015 have all lasted approximately 1,064 days, or 152 weeks, with each cycle topping out almost exactly three years after the previous bottom. On the other hand, bear cycles have consistently lasted for around one year, either from December to December or November to November. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Following Analyst‚Äôs Prediction For Bullish Breakout, Here‚Äôs The Target This historical symmetry is reflected in the chart below, which highlights three bull cycles followed by three bear periods, all forming a repeating pattern. The most recent bottom, recorded on November 7, 2022, marked the start of the current bull cycle. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin could reach its next peak in the week of October 6, 2025. The bull cycle has led to Bitcoin breaking above $100,000 and now with an all-time high of $108,786, but like many others, the analyst predicted this peak will still be broken this year. This peak will likely mirror the explosive rallies that ended the 2017 and 2021 cycles and eventually surpass $125,000. Sell Everything In October 2025, Buy Back In October 2026 TradingShot‚Äôs primary advice is blunt but strategic: sell everything by October 2025. According to the analyst, this window could be the final opportunity to exit near the top before the next bear cycle takes hold. Counting 1064 days from the most recent bottom of $15,600 in November 07 2022, gives a time estimate for the next cycle top on October 6 2025. If history repeats itself, the subsequent bearish phase will likely last for 12 months and bottom out around October 12, 2026, before the next bull phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Stalls Below $85,000 Psychological Level, Why A Drop To $74,000 Is Possible This timing is not speculative; it‚Äôs based on a consistent one-year bearish phase across three full market cycles. Therefore, it would be better to sell before October 2025 and start accumulating by October 2026. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $84,500, up by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and 48% away from the predicted peak of $125,000.

The largest U.S. crypto exchange has rolled out improved failsafes, enhanced liquidity measures, and faster transaction processing. Additionally, Coinbase promised to speed up Solana transaction processing times in January after users encountered problems with depositing and withdrawing SOL. Coinbase supercharges Solana support with 5x faster throughput According to Coinbase , enhancements allowed quicker and more dependable sends and receives, reaffirming its dedication to providing industry-best results and dependability for its users. In addition, the crypto exchange highlighted that to satisfy demand, as Solana expanded in the future, it kept investing in its infrastructure. The crypto exchange also shared an X post that detailed the enhancements. Based on the X post, these enhancements included asynchronous transaction processing that will result in a five-fold increase in block processing throughput, four-fold improvements to the remote procedure call (RPC), failover augmentations to increase resilience, liquidity optimizations, and enhanced operational controls. Moreover, on January 21, Coinbase shared a post on the X platform stating that ‚ÄúCoinbase has seen unprecedented Solana transaction activity ‚Ä¶ and our systems have been unable to validate and process transactions at the speed that we are receiving them.‚Äù This came after users experienced delays when attempting to withdraw or deposit SOL, sometimes lasting hours. Interestingly, according to the crypto exchange, the volume of transactions at that time was ten times higher than usual. Meme coin trading has gained popularity, which has led to Solana‚Äôs widespread adoption Extensive meme coin trading had been a major factor in Solana‚Äôs high transaction volumes. This resulted partly from a significant rise in Solana‚Äôs market capitalization that occurred the weekend before the inauguration when the new president and first lady released meme coins on the blockchain, contributing to the rise in popularity of meme coin trading. However, weeks before Trump‚Äôs token launch, reports from sources revealed that Solana‚Äôs overall onchain trading volume and fees had reached all-time highs due to memecoin trading volume. On January 5, Solana‚Äôs onchain volume reached an all-time high of $3.79 billion, with approximately 4.5 million active addresses. Solana is up nearly 23% over the past week, making it one of the biggest gainers in the top 100 coins. According to CoinMarketCap reports, Solana is trading at $133.32, reflecting a 0.04% increase in the past 24 hours. With a market capitalization of around $69.68 billion, it holds the sixth spot among all cryptocurrencies by market value. T he recent surge comes amid Wednesday‚Äôs launch of Canada‚Äôs first spot Solana ETFs from issuers, including 3iQ, Evolve, CI, and Purpose. The exchange-traded funds feature staking functionality, providing investors with yield obtained by issuers staking their SOL to support the Solana blockchain. Spot Solana ETFs have yet to be approved in the United States. However, firms including VanEck, 21Shares, and Bitwise have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch such products. Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs were both approved in the U.S. in 2024. Alongside Solana, issuers have filed to launch a potentially wide range of additional spot crypto funds in the States, including those tied to XRP, Dogecoin, and even President Donald Trump‚Äôs official Solana-based meme coin.

Enter Chatbot Arena, the AI benchmarking platform that has become a cornerstone for major AI labs. Now, in a major development, Chatbot Arena is taking a giant leap forward by forming its own company, Arena Intelligence Inc. This move signals a significant commitment to enhancing its platform and solidifying its role in the rapidly expanding AI landscape. Let‚Äôs dive into what this exciting development means for the AI community and beyond. What is Chatbot Arena and Why Does It Matter? Before we delve into the new company formation, it‚Äôs crucial to understand what Chatbot Arena is and why it has become so influential. Launched in 2023 and primarily managed by researchers affiliated with UC Berkeley, Chatbot Arena is a crowdsourced platform designed for AI model testing . Think of it as a neutral battleground where different AI models, including flagship models from giants like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, are put to the test by a global community of users. Here‚Äôs why Chatbot Arena is so important: Neutral Benchmarking: It offers a platform free from bias, allowing for objective comparisons between different AI models. This is vital in an industry where marketing hype can often overshadow genuine performance metrics. Community-Driven Evaluation: The power of crowdsourcing means a wide range of perspectives contribute to the evaluation process, making the benchmarking more comprehensive and reflective of real-world usage. Industry Standard: Major AI labs rely on Chatbot Arena for testing and showcasing their models, highlighting its credibility and influence within the AI industry. Transparency: By making the evaluation process public, Chatbot Arena fosters transparency and accountability in AI development. Arena Intelligence Inc.: A New Chapter for AI Benchmarking The announcement of Arena Intelligence Inc. marks a pivotal moment for Chatbot Arena. According to a recent blog post and reports from Bloomberg, this new corporate structure is designed to inject resources and accelerate the platform‚Äôs development. The team behind Chatbot Arena emphasizes that this move will enable them to significantly improve the platform beyond its current capabilities. What can we expect from this new AI company formation ? Enhanced Platform Features: With dedicated resources, Arena Intelligence Inc. is poised to introduce new features, improve user experience, and potentially expand the types of AI models and benchmarks offered. Sustained Neutrality: A core promise from the team is the continued commitment to providing a neutral testing ground, uninfluenced by external vested interests. This is crucial for maintaining the platform‚Äôs integrity and trustworthiness. Business Model Exploration: While details are still under wraps, the formation of a company suggests the exploration of sustainable business models.

This latest outburst has sent ripples through financial markets, raising questions about the future direction of U.S. monetary policy and the independence of the central bank. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors closely monitoring global economic signals, this development is particularly noteworthy as it adds another layer of uncertainty to the already complex macroeconomic landscape. Let‚Äôs delve deeper into Trump‚Äôs accusations, the Fed‚Äôs stance, and what this all means for the broader economy and potentially, the crypto markets. Why is Trump Targeting Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve? Trump‚Äôs criticism of Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve is not new, but this recent call for his removal marks a significant intensification. At the heart of Trump‚Äôs discontent lies the belief that the Fed‚Äôs monetary policy is hindering economic growth and putting the U.S. at a disadvantage compared to other nations. According to a post by Walter Bloomberg on X, Trump specifically pointed to the European Central Bank (ECB) as an example, highlighting their recent interest rate cut ‚Äì their seventh ‚Äì as a proactive measure the Fed has failed to emulate. Trump argues that the Fed‚Äôs inaction is making the U.S. less competitive globally. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of Trump‚Äôs main grievances: Accusation of Inaction: Trump claims the Fed is ‚Äúfalling behind global peers‚Äù like the ECB by not cutting interest rates aggressively enough. Economic Growth Concerns: He believes higher interest rates are stifling US economy growth and potentially leading to a recession. Global Competitiveness: Trump suggests that lower interest rates in other countries give them an unfair economic advantage over the US economy . Personal Animosity: There‚Äôs a history of strained relations between Trump and Jerome Powell , dating back to Powell‚Äôs appointment during Trump‚Äôs presidency. It‚Äôs important to remember that central bank independence is a cornerstone of modern economic policy in many countries. The idea is to shield monetary policy decisions from short-term political pressures, allowing central bankers to focus on long-term economic stability and price stability. Trump‚Äôs public pronouncements and calls for Powell‚Äôs removal challenge this established norm. The Fed‚Äôs Stance on Interest Rates and the US Economy The Federal Reserve , under Jerome Powell‚Äôs leadership, has been navigating a delicate balancing act. Their primary mandate is to maintain price stability (control inflation) and promote maximum employment. In recent times, the Fed has been focused on combating inflation, which surged in the aftermath of the pandemic and global supply chain disruptions. To tame inflation, the Fed aggressively raised interest rates throughout 2022 and 2023. While inflation has cooled down from its peak, it remains above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target. The Fed‚Äôs current approach is to maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance until they are confident that inflation is sustainably moving towards their target. Here‚Äôs a summary of the Fed‚Äôs current position: Factor Fed‚Äôs Stance Inflation Concerned, still above target Interest Rates Currently holding steady, but data-dependent US Economy Growth Monitoring, aiming for a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù (slowing inflation without causing a recession) Global Economic Conditions Considering, but primarily focused on domestic mandate The Fed argues that premature interest rate cuts could reignite inflationary pressures, potentially leading to more economic pain down the line. They emphasize a data-dependent approach, meaning their decisions will be guided by incoming economic data, particularly inflation and employment figures. Market Reaction and Betting Odds on Powell‚Äôs Departure Financial markets are sensitive to any signals regarding the future of monetary policy and the stability of the Federal Reserve . Trump‚Äôs comments have undoubtedly introduced an element of uncertainty. According to reports, betting odds on Jerome Powell‚Äôs departure this year have seen a notable increase. Kalshi, a prediction market platform, reported that the odds of Powell leaving his position in 2024 rose to 26% following Trump‚Äôs remarks. This increase in betting odds reflects market participants‚Äô acknowledgment of the heightened political pressure on Powell. While it‚Äôs important to note that these are just betting odds and not definitive predictions, they do indicate a growing perception of risk surrounding Powell‚Äôs tenure. Here‚Äôs what this market reaction suggests: Increased Uncertainty: Trump‚Äôs comments inject uncertainty into the market‚Äôs outlook for Fed policy. Potential for Volatility: Further escalations in Trump‚Äôs rhetoric could lead to increased market volatility, particularly in bond and stock markets. Focus on Fed Independence: The situation highlights the importance of central bank independence and the potential risks when this principle is challenged. Monitoring Political Developments: Investors will be closely watching political developments and any further signals regarding the Fed‚Äôs future leadership. Impact on Cryptocurrency Markets While the immediate focus of Trump‚Äôs criticism is on traditional financial markets and the US economy , the cryptocurrency market is not immune to these developments. Crypto markets are increasingly intertwined with the broader macroeconomic environment. Here‚Äôs how Trump‚Äôs stance on Jerome Powell and the Fed could potentially impact the crypto space: Economic Uncertainty & Safe Haven Assets: Increased economic uncertainty can sometimes drive investors towards perceived safe haven assets, and in some cases, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have been considered as such. However, this relationship is not always consistent and can be influenced by various factors. Dollar Strength/Weakness: Fed policy and interest rate decisions can impact the strength of the US dollar. A weaker dollar could, in theory, make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more attractive to international investors. Conversely, a stronger dollar could have the opposite effect. Risk Appetite: Overall market sentiment and risk appetite are crucial drivers for crypto markets. If Trump‚Äôs criticism leads to broader market jitters or a perception of increased economic risk, it could impact investor sentiment towards cryptocurrencies as well. Regulatory Landscape: Political shifts and changes in administration can also influence the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. While not directly related to Powell‚Äôs removal, the broader political climate can indirectly affect crypto regulations. Navigating the Uncertainty: Key Takeaways Trump‚Äôs renewed attack on Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve adds another layer of complexity to the economic and market outlook. For those involved in the cryptocurrency space, it‚Äôs crucial to stay informed and understand the potential implications. Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Monitor Economic Data: Pay close attention to key economic indicators, particularly inflation and employment data, as these will heavily influence the Fed‚Äôs future decisions. Stay Updated on Fed Communication: Follow speeches and statements from Fed officials, including Jerome Powell , to gauge their thinking and potential policy shifts. Assess Market Sentiment: Keep an eye on market sentiment and volatility in both traditional and crypto markets, as these can be indicators of investor reactions to political and economic developments. Diversification and Risk Management: In times of uncertainty, diversification and robust risk management strategies are even more critical in your investment portfolio, including crypto holdings. Understand Macroeconomic Interplay: Recognize that cryptocurrency markets are increasingly influenced by macroeconomic factors and global economic events. Conclusion: A Test for Fed Independence? Donald Trump‚Äôs forceful call for Jerome Powell‚Äôs removal is more than just political rhetoric; it‚Äôs a direct challenge to the independence of the Federal Reserve and a potential source of market instability. While the likelihood of Powell‚Äôs immediate removal remains uncertain, the episode underscores the ongoing tensions between political pressures and central bank autonomy. For cryptocurrency investors and the broader financial world, this situation warrants close monitoring. The coming months will be crucial in determining how this drama unfolds and what implications it holds for the US economy and global markets.

The law gives the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic the exclusive right to issue the digital som, establish the rules for its issuance and circulation, and oversee the platform on which the national currency will operate, Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs presidential office said on April 17. However, a final decision on whether to officially issue the CBDC is not expected until the end of 2026, local outlet Trend News Agency reported in December. If the central bank decides to adopt the digital som, it would also need to outline cryptographic protection measures to ensure the digital som remains secure and isn‚Äôt used for fraudulent transactions. Testing of the digital som platform is expected to take place sometime this year. Zhaparov‚Äôs sign-off comes nearly a month after Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs parliament, the Jogorku Kenesh, approved the amendment to Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs constitutional law on March 18. CBDCs continue to be heavily criticized by some members of the crypto community, flagging concerns that they could undermine financial privacy and enable excessive government oversight, among other things. While 115 nations have initiated CBDC projects, only four CBDCs have officially launched ‚Äî the Bahamas Sand Dollar, Nigeria‚Äôs e-Naira, Zimbabwe‚Äôs ZiG and Jamaica‚Äôs JAM-DEX, data from cbdctracker.org shows.

The financial landscape in Hong Kong is about to witness a significant shift as Huaxia Fund, a subsidiary of China Asset Management (ChinaAMC), prepares to inject a powerful feature into its ETH ETF staking product. Imagine earning rewards simply by holding onto your Ethereum ETF ‚Äì that‚Äôs precisely what Huaxia Fund is set to offer. Let‚Äôs dive into how this game-changing development is reshaping the Hong Kong crypto ETF market and what it means for investors like you. What‚Äôs the Buzz Around Huaxia Fund‚Äôs ETH ETF Staking? On May 15th, Huaxia Fund will officially introduce staking capabilities to its Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). This makes them only the second entity in Hong Kong to embrace this innovative feature, marking a significant leap forward for crypto investment products in the region. But why is this such a big deal? Let‚Äôs break it down: First Mover Advantage (Almost): While not the absolute first, Huaxia Fund is among the pioneers in Hong Kong to offer Ethereum staking within an ETF structure. This positions them as a forward-thinking player in the rapidly evolving crypto ETF space. Regulatory Green Light: This move is made possible by the recent progressive changes in crypto regulations Hong Kong . The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has updated its rules to allow regulated firms to provide crypto staking services, paving the way for institutions like Huaxia Fund to innovate. Institutional Backing and Trust: As a subsidiary of ChinaAMC, a major player in asset management, Huaxia Fund brings credibility and trust to the crypto ETF market. Their foray into staking further legitimizes crypto investments within traditional financial frameworks. Enhanced Investor Appeal: Staking adds an extra layer of attractiveness to ETH ETFs. Investors can now potentially earn passive income on their ETH holdings through staking rewards, in addition to potential capital appreciation. This isn‚Äôt just about adding a feature; it‚Äôs about fundamentally enhancing the value proposition of a Huaxia Fund ETF and making crypto investments more appealing to a wider audience in Hong Kong. The Mechanics: How Does ETH ETF Staking Work? For those new to the concept, staking might sound a bit technical. But the core idea is quite simple. When you stake your Ethereum, you are essentially participating in the network‚Äôs operation. Here‚Äôs a simplified explanation in the context of an ETF: Holding ETH ETF Shares: You, as an investor, hold shares of the Huaxia Fund ETH ETF. These shares represent ownership of underlying Ethereum. ETF Provider Stakes ETH: Huaxia Fund, as the ETF provider, takes a portion of the ETH held by the ETF and stakes it on the Ethereum network. Earning Staking Rewards: By staking, the ETF provider earns staking rewards. These rewards are generated by the Ethereum network for validating transactions and securing the blockchain. Passing Rewards to Investors (Potentially): While not explicitly stated in the provided content whether the staking rewards will be directly passed on to ETF holders, in typical staking ETF models, a portion of these rewards are often reflected in the ETF‚Äôs overall performance, potentially increasing the ETF‚Äôs value over time. It‚Äôs crucial to check the specific ETF prospectus for details on reward distribution. Key Player: OSL Digital Services To ensure the security and efficiency of this staking operation, Huaxia Fund is partnering with OSL Digital Services. OSL will provide the crucial custody and staking infrastructure. This partnership highlights the growing synergy between traditional finance and specialized crypto service providers. Why is Hong Kong Becoming a Crypto Hub? The Regulatory Shift Hong Kong‚Äôs proactive approach to crypto regulation is a key factor driving these innovations. For a while, the regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies globally has been a patchwork of approaches, ranging from outright bans to cautious acceptance. Hong Kong, however, is positioning itself as a more welcoming and regulated hub for digital assets. The recent rule change by the SFC, allowing regulated entities to offer crypto staking, is a testament to this shift. Factors Contributing to Hong Kong‚Äôs Crypto-Friendly Stance: Desire to be a Financial Innovation Hub: Hong Kong has historically been a major financial center. Embracing crypto and fintech innovation is seen as crucial to maintaining this status in the evolving global economy. Clearer Regulatory Framework: By establishing clear rules and guidelines, Hong Kong is aiming to attract legitimate crypto businesses and investors while mitigating risks. The SFC‚Äôs move on staking is a prime example of this clarity. Competition in Asia: There‚Äôs a regional race to become a crypto hub. Locations like Singapore and Dubai are also vying for this position. Hong Kong‚Äôs recent regulatory moves signal its intent to be a serious contender. Attracting Institutional Investment: Regulations that foster trust and security are essential to attract institutional investors into the crypto space. Allowing staking within regulated ETFs is a step in this direction. This supportive regulatory environment is not just beneficial for companies like Huaxia Fund; it‚Äôs creating a more vibrant and dynamic crypto ecosystem in Hong Kong, potentially attracting talent, investment, and further innovation. Benefits of ETH ETF Staking: A Win-Win Scenario? The introduction of staking to ETH ETFs offers several potential benefits for various stakeholders: Stakeholder Benefit Investors Potential to earn passive income through staking rewards, enhancing overall returns. Exposure to Ethereum with the convenience and security of a regulated ETF. Simplified staking process ‚Äì no need to manage staking infrastructure directly. ETF Providers (like Huaxia Fund) Differentiated product offering, potentially attracting more investors and assets under management. Opportunity to generate additional revenue through staking rewards (part of which may be reinvested or contribute to ETF fees). Enhanced reputation as an innovator in the crypto ETF market. Ethereum Network Increased participation in staking, contributing to network security and decentralization. Greater adoption of Ethereum as an asset class. Hong Kong as a Financial Hub Strengthened position as a leading center for fintech and crypto innovation. Attraction of crypto businesses and investment. Economic growth and job creation in the crypto sector. While the benefits appear substantial, it‚Äôs also important to consider potential challenges. Challenges and Considerations Introducing staking to ETH ETFs is not without its complexities and potential challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty (Evolving Landscape): While Hong Kong‚Äôs regulations are becoming clearer, the global regulatory landscape for crypto is still evolving. Future changes could impact staking ETFs. Custodial Risks: Secure custody of staked ETH is paramount. Reliance on third-party custodians like OSL introduces a layer of dependency and potential risk, although OSL is a reputable provider. Slashing Risks: In proof-of-stake systems like Ethereum, there‚Äôs a risk of ‚Äúslashing‚Äù ‚Äì penalties imposed on validators for misbehavior. ETF providers need robust risk management to mitigate this. Complexity for Investors: While simplified compared to direct staking, understanding the nuances of staking ETFs and how rewards are distributed may still require some investor education. Fee Structures: Investors need to be aware of the fee structures associated with staking ETFs and how these fees impact net returns after staking rewards. Actionable Insights for Investors Considering the developments around Hong Kong crypto ETF staking, here are some actionable insights for investors: Do Your Due Diligence: Before investing in any ETH ETF, especially staking ETFs, thoroughly research the ETF provider (like Huaxia Fund ETF ), understand the fee structure, and review the ETF prospectus for details on staking mechanisms and reward distribution. Understand Staking Risks: Familiarize yourself with the risks associated with staking, including slashing and custodial risks. Assess your risk tolerance. Compare Different ETFs: As more staking ETFs become available, compare their features, fees, and potential returns. Don‚Äôt just focus on staking; consider the overall ETF structure and management. Stay Informed on Regulations: Keep abreast of regulatory developments in Hong Kong and globally related to crypto and ETFs. Regulatory changes can impact the landscape. Consider Long-Term Potential: View staking ETFs as a long-term investment in the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader crypto space. Staking rewards can compound over time. Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward for Crypto ETFs Huaxia Fund‚Äôs move to add staking to its ETH ETF in Hong Kong is undoubtedly a revolutionary step. It signifies the growing maturity of the crypto market and the increasing acceptance of digital assets within mainstream finance. As crypto regulations Hong Kong become more refined and supportive, we can expect to see further innovation and adoption of crypto investment products. For investors, this development opens up exciting new avenues to participate in the Ethereum ecosystem and potentially enhance their portfolio returns.

43467616,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150626,1744937434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Savvy OpenAI Unveils Flex Processing: Unlock Cheaper AI for Smart Tasks,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-flex-processing-cheaper-ai/,"In the fast-evolving world of artificial intelligence, where every byte and millisecond counts, OpenAI is making a smart move to democratize access and optimize costs. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space who are constantly seeking efficient and scalable solutions, this development is particularly noteworthy. Imagine leveraging powerful AI without breaking the bank ‚Äì that‚Äôs the promise of OpenAI‚Äôs latest innovation: Flex Processing . What is OpenAI Flex Processing and Why Should You Care About Cheaper AI? OpenAI, the powerhouse behind cutting-edge AI models, is rolling out Flex Processing , a new API option designed to offer significantly reduced prices for AI model usage. This isn‚Äôt just a minor price tweak; it‚Äôs a strategic shift to compete more effectively with rivals like Google and to cater to a broader range of AI application needs. The trade-off? Slower response times and potential occasional resource unavailability. But for many tasks, especially those not requiring lightning-fast speeds, this is a game-changer. Why is this relevant to the crypto world? Because as blockchain and AI converge, cost-effective AI solutions become crucial for everything from smart contract analysis to decentralized application enhancements. Cheaper AI means more accessible innovation. Diving Deep into the Details of API Pricing for AI Models Let‚Äôs get down to brass tacks and see how much cheaper AI we‚Äôre talking about with Flex Processing . Currently in beta for OpenAI‚Äôs o3 and o4-mini reasoning models, this option is specifically targeted at tasks that aren‚Äôt mission-critical or time-sensitive. Think of activities like model evaluations, enriching datasets, or handling asynchronous workloads ‚Äì tasks that are important but don‚Äôt demand immediate results. The price reduction is a flat 50% across the board. Here‚Äôs a quick comparison: Model Processing Type Input Tokens (per 1M) Output Tokens (per 1M) o3 Standard $10 $40 o3 Flex Processing $5 $20 o4-mini Standard $1.10 $4.40 o4-mini Flex Processing $0.55 $2.20 As you can see, the savings are substantial. For instance, with o3 Flex Processing , you‚Äôre looking at $5 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words) and $20 per million output tokens, compared to the standard rates of $10 and $40 respectively. For the more compact o4-mini, the drop is equally impressive, making it even more accessible for various applications. This price cut directly addresses the rising artificial intelligence costs which can be a barrier to entry for many developers and smaller projects. Why Now? The Competitive Landscape and Artificial Intelligence Costs The timing of Flex Processing is no coincidence. The frontier of AI development is becoming increasingly expensive, with top-tier models demanding significant computational resources. At the same time, the market is seeing a surge of more efficient, budget-friendly models from competitors. Google, for example, recently launched Gemini 2.5 Flash, a reasoning model that boasts performance on par with or even exceeding DeepSeek‚Äôs R1, but at a lower input token cost. This competitive pressure is pushing AI companies to innovate not just in model capabilities but also in pricing strategies. OpenAI‚Äôs move is a clear indication that the race for AI dominance is also a race to offer the most cost-effective solutions. For businesses and developers, this means more choices and the potential to optimize their API pricing based on their specific needs. ID Verification and Access to Advanced AI Models In conjunction with the launch of Flex Processing , OpenAI has also introduced a new ID verification process for developers in tiers 1-3 of their usage hierarchy to access the o3 model. These tiers are based on spending on OpenAI services. Furthermore, features like o3‚Äôs reasoning summaries and streaming API support are also gated behind this verification. OpenAI states that this measure is aimed at preventing misuse and policy violations by malicious actors. While it adds a step to the onboarding process, it underscores the company‚Äôs commitment to responsible AI development and deployment. For legitimate users, this is a small hurdle to ensure a safer and more reliable AI ecosystem. Benefits of Embracing Flex Processing for AI Tasks Significant Cost Reduction: The 50% price cut is the most obvious advantage. This can dramatically lower the operational expenses for projects that utilize AI models, making AI more financially viable for a wider range of applications. Ideal for Non-Critical Tasks: For processes like data enrichment, model evaluations, and asynchronous workflows where immediate response isn‚Äôt crucial, Flex Processing offers an economically sound alternative without sacrificing the power of OpenAI‚Äôs models. Democratizing AI Access: By lowering the barrier to entry in terms of cost, OpenAI is making its advanced AI models more accessible to smaller businesses, startups, researchers, and hobbyist developers who might have been priced out before. Optimized Resource Allocation: Flex Processing allows OpenAI to better manage its computational resources by directing less time-sensitive tasks to less premium infrastructure, thus improving overall system efficiency. Use Cases: Where Does Flex Processing Shine? Flex Processing isn‚Äôt meant for every AI application, but it‚Äôs perfectly suited for a variety of use cases, particularly those where speed isn‚Äôt paramount: Model Evaluations and Benchmarking: Testing and evaluating AI models often involves numerous runs and iterations. Cheaper AI processing for these tasks can significantly reduce research and development costs. Data Enrichment: Enhancing datasets with AI-generated insights, summaries, or classifications can be done efficiently and affordably using Flex Processing for background tasks. Asynchronous Workloads: Applications that involve tasks that can be processed in the background without immediate user interaction, such as content generation queues or batch processing of data, are ideal candidates. Internal Tooling and Experimentation: Developing internal AI-powered tools or experimenting with new AI functionalities within a company can be made more cost-effective, encouraging innovation and exploration. Potential Challenges and Considerations While Flex Processing offers numerous benefits, it‚Äôs important to be aware of the trade-offs: Slower Response Times: The most significant drawback is the reduced speed. Applications requiring real-time responses or low latency will not be suitable for Flex Processing . Occasional Unavailability: The service is explicitly stated to have potential resource unavailability. For critical systems that require constant uptime, this might be a concern, though the term ‚Äòoccasional‚Äô suggests it‚Äôs not a frequent issue. Beta Status: Being in beta means the service is still under development and may be subject to changes, including pricing or availability. Users should be prepared for potential adjustments as OpenAI refines the offering. Actionable Insights: Leveraging Flex Processing for Your Projects For those looking to integrate AI into their projects or optimize existing AI workflows, here are some actionable steps: Identify Suitable Tasks: Analyze your AI workloads and pinpoint tasks that are not time-critical and can tolerate slower processing. Model evaluations, data enrichment, and background processing are prime candidates. Evaluate Cost Savings: Calculate the potential cost reduction by switching to Flex Processing for eligible tasks. The 50% reduction can lead to substantial savings, especially for high-volume usage. Test and Monitor Performance: Experiment with Flex Processing on a smaller scale initially to assess the actual response times and reliability for your specific use cases. Monitor performance to ensure it meets your operational requirements. Plan for Asynchronous Workflows: Design or adapt your applications to leverage asynchronous processing where possible. This will allow you to take full advantage of Flex Processing for background tasks without impacting user-facing performance. Stay Updated: Keep an eye on OpenAI‚Äôs updates regarding Flex Processing , especially as it is currently in beta. Be aware of any changes in pricing, features, or terms of service. Conclusion: A Smart Step Towards Accessible and Affordable AI OpenAI‚Äôs Flex Processing is a smart and timely response to the growing demand for cost-effective AI solutions. By offering a 50% reduction in API pricing for slower, non-critical tasks, OpenAI is not only making its powerful AI models more accessible but also strategically positioning itself in an increasingly competitive market. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain community, this development opens up new avenues for integrating AI into various applications without the prohibitive costs often associated with cutting-edge AI technology.

As ETH heats up, it‚Äôs not alone, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is catching the same tailwind. Presale phase 4 has started since the third phase sold out more quickly than anticipated. The fundraising has surpassed $6.8 million while drawing in more than 8400 holders. Investors currently purchase at $0.025 with the understanding that the price will reach $0.03 after phase 5 begins. The current investors stand to gain a 140% return on investment before the project begins trading at $0.06. This emerging DeFi token is setting itself up to mirror ETH‚Äôs trajectory, on a much smaller price tag, and with potentially much larger gains. Mutuum Finance Presale Soars as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance obtained popularity among the decentralized lending sector because its dual-lending model brings fresh ideas to the market. Mutuum Finance earned quick marketplace adoption following its presale start-up because investors from more than 8,400 participants contributed $6.8 million. Investors can make profits from the Phase 5 price rise of Mutuum Finance tokens from $0.025 during Phase 4 to $0.03. Experts identify Mutuum Finance as the least valued DeFi startup for present times and foresee an anticipated value surpassing $1 during public distribution. In a recent update, Mutuum Finance introduced an interactive dashboard that displays a real-time leaderboard, highlighting the top 50 token holders. These investors won‚Äôt just get recognized, they‚Äôll also earn bonus tokens for maintaining their spot on the leaderboard. Shaking Up the DeFi Game with a Hybrid Lending Strategy What distinguishes Mutuum Finance is its trailblazing combination of two extremely impactful lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). While the P2C model allows users to invest in liquidity pools and earn passive income in the way of automatic smart contract lending in USDT, the P2P model allows users to lend and borrow directly from each other, cutting out the middleman. Through the integration of these two models, Mutuum Finance brings a new degree of security, efficiency, and decentralization to the DeFi market, making it an attractive option for investors looking for high-yield investments. Building a Secure and Stable Ecosystem In order to offer long-term stability, Mutuum Finance is launching a totally collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. In contrast to earlier algorithmic stablecoins that have been difficult, this stablecoin will be over-collateralized, reducing risk and enhancing confidence. Open financial architectures and audited smart contracts are also employed by the platform in order to eliminate the vulnerabilities that have weakened other DeFi projects. Mutuum Finance strives to enhance its network of users through profitable incentive systems. The $100,000 giveaway divides 10 rewards of $10,000 MUTM tokens while the referral system provides bonuses for successful individual and organizational referrals. Platform users who join early will gain access to exclusive staking pools while also receiving governance voting rights and VIP information updates that keep them involved on the platform for extended periods. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth The hash platform created its economic model specifically for extended platform development. The platform controls presale token releases while implementing deflationary mechanisms to establish limited supply which potentially increases token value throughout time. Through its staking program Mutuum Finance provides enticing incentives that motivate users to maintain active participation in order to help develop the platform successfully. Ethereum‚Äôs bullish momentum could soon push it to new highs, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) appears set to follow suit. With $6.8 million raised and over 8,400 investors already on board, MUTM offers a better entry point at $0.025 during Phase 4. Join the presale today and ride the wave of what could be 2025‚Äôs next major breakout.

Solana (SOL) has jumped more than 22%, adding strength to what many are seeing as the start of a new bull run crypto phase. This jump was driven by improved market sentiment and growing excitement about the token‚Äôs role in decentralized finance (DeFi). On the other hand, Cardano (ADA) is staying focused on long-term goals, with experts predicting it could pass the $9 mark by 2030. But while price jumps and decade-long forecasts make headlines, a lesser-known presale project is quietly presenting one of the clearest growth paths right now. Web3 ai , available at $0.100 in presale and targeting a $0.800 launch, offers a direct route to 700% returns. It sets itself apart by focusing on tools that assist serious participants‚Äîan AI-based system designed to improve trade decisions, catch scams, and improve crypto planning. In a market full of price movement and development plans, Web3 ai could be setting a whole new standard. Solana‚Äôs 22% Rise Points to DeFi Strength Solana (SOL) has become one of the week‚Äôs best performers, with its value climbing by 22% following a global tariff freeze mentioned by former U.S. President Trump. This political event added a boost to the already growing confidence in the market. Solana‚Äôs fast performance and expanding base of decentralized platforms had already placed it in focus, and this announcement only helped raise interest further. Its usage has seen a rise, especially in DEX volume, which has overtaken many competitors and confirmed Solana‚Äôs role as a strong DeFi player. The Solana (SOL) price surge is now viewed as a possible signal of wider capital flowing into high-performing layer-one chains, especially those that mix speed with a simple user experience. If this wave of market gains keeps up, Solana could remain a top option for short-term trade activity. Cardano‚Äôs Long-Term Structure and Price Vision Unlike projects that chase fast results, the future of Cardano (ADA) is taking shape through a steady and careful approach. With a focus on academic research and technical rollouts, Cardano is making progress in on-chain management and smart contract features. Even though it may not generate frequent buzz, some forecasts suggest that ADA could climb above $9 within the decade. Models tied to the Cardano (ADA) future link its possible growth to growing support from institutions, functional DeFi use, and stronger platform reliability. Its focus on peer-reviewed updates and careful delivery methods connects with cautious user groups. Yet, as markets warm up again, ADA‚Äôs slower pace might limit short-term price growth. While those planning to hold long-term could see results, others may view quicker options more favorably. Web3 ai: A Strong Presale Entry with Real Functionality Looking at Solana‚Äôs strong weekly gains and Cardano‚Äôs future goals, Web3 ai enters the scene with a different type of advantage‚Äîearly access and useful features. Priced at $0.100 and expected to reach $0.800, the current presale offers a 700% return window before official listings. But what really sets it apart is what the platform is building. Web3 ai is bringing together 12 connected crypto tools designed to make managing digital assets easier. It includes tools such as AI trade support, planning tools, DeFi return analysis, and a scam detection system. These systems collect insights from top networks like Ethereum, BNB, Solana, and Polygon, bringing news, charts, and trends into one space. The WAI coin unlocks more than features, like lower pricing on premium tools. The layout is meant for use across different chains, and the service will be available on phones, browsers, and the web. At a time when tools, safety, and strong infrastructure matter more than hype, Web3 ai is clearly shaping its own space. Final Remarks! Signals of recovery are growing. From tariff pauses to crypto ETF developments, energy is flowing back into the sector. But what truly drives future value is more than temporary excitement. While the Solana (SOL) price surge is impressive and the Cardano (ADA) future looks promising, neither one offers a solid 700% gain with a structured tool-based model already in progress. As this bull run crypto trend continues, people are watching for platforms that combine low cost with strong features. Web3 ai checks both boxes. It isn‚Äôt just an affordable entry‚Äîit delivers working tools like data insights, safety alerts, and control rights. For those who join early, this is not only about short-term gain‚Äîit‚Äôs also a chance to build strong positions for the future.

This diverse portfolio reflects a holistic approach to AI safety , recognizing that security and responsibility must be embedded across the entire AI lifecycle, from model development to real-world applications. Contrarian Views and Ethical Considerations: Navigating the Complexities of AI Ralston‚Äôs perspective also takes a contrarian stance on certain aspects of AI development, particularly in defense technology. While many in the defense tech space are advocating for fully autonomous weapons, Ralston expresses strong reservations. He explicitly states that SAIF would not invest in fully autonomous weapons, citing the inherent dangers of AI-driven bioweapons and weapon systems operating without human oversight. Interestingly, Ralston is open to investing in ‚Äúweapon safety systems‚Äù ‚Äì technologies designed to detect and prevent attacks from AI weapons. This nuanced approach highlights the ethical considerations at the heart of AI investment and the importance of prioritizing safety and human control, especially in high-stakes domains like defense. The Y Combinator Advantage: Leveraging Connections in a Crowded Market The AI investment landscape is undeniably crowded. Numerous venture capital firms are vying to back the next groundbreaking AI startup. So, what gives SAIF an edge? Ralston believes his extensive network and experience at Y Combinator will be a significant differentiator. Having served as Y Combinator‚Äôs president for three years and an advisor for over a decade, Ralston possesses deep connections within the startup ecosystem. He plans to offer mentorship akin to his YC days, guiding portfolio companies on everything from business strategy to navigating the Y Combinator application process itself. Furthermore, he will leverage his considerable investor network to help startups secure follow-on funding and strategic partnerships. This Y Combinator connection is a powerful asset, providing SAIF startups with unique access and support. What‚Äôs Next for SAIF and the Future of Safe AI? While Ralston has remained tight-lipped about the fund‚Äôs exact size, the number of planned investments, and the identity of his limited partners (LPs), the launch of SAIF marks a pivotal moment for the safe AI startups ecosystem. It signals a growing recognition within the investment community of the critical importance of responsible AI development and deployment. As AI continues to permeate every aspect of our lives, from finance and healthcare to transportation and communication, ensuring its safety and security is paramount. Geoff Ralston‚Äôs Safe Artificial Intelligence Fund is poised to play a crucial role in fostering a future where AI benefits humanity without compromising our safety or ethical principles. This initiative could very well catalyze a new wave of innovation focused on building trustworthy and secure AI systems, a development eagerly anticipated by those in the cryptocurrency world and beyond who understand the value of robust and reliable technology.

Analyst Sets Mid-Term Target At $155,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-following-golds-footsteps-analyst-sets-mid-term-target-at-155000/,"As gold continues to set new all-time highs (ATH) ‚Äì trading at $3,333 per ounce at the time of writing ‚Äì Bitcoin (BTC) has seen more subdued price action, consolidating in the mid-$80,000 range. However, analysts suggest that the top digital asset may soon mirror gold‚Äôs recent momentum. Bitcoin Set To Follow Gold‚Äôs Momentum? In a recent post on X, crypto trading account Cryptollica hinted that BTC may be poised to replicate gold‚Äôs historic price movement seen over the past few months. The account shared the following chart, highlighting the striking similarities between the price actions of gold and BTC. The chart shows both gold and BTC forming a macro-bottom around early 2023, followed by a rejection at the range top in early 2024. Gold eventually broke out in the following months, while BTC lagged slightly, breaking out around November 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin Undervalued? Analyst Breaks Down Bullish On-Chain Metrics According to Cryptollica, BTC now appears to be breaking out of a consolidatory wedge pattern, with a potential mid-term target as high as $155,000. Currently, Bitcoin‚Äôs ATH stands at $108,786, recorded earlier this year in January. BTC is also likely to benefit from several favorable macroeconomic trends. For example, the global M2 money supply is expected to increase in 2025, a development that typically supports risk-on assets like Bitcoin. BTC Maturing As A Safe Haven Asset Beyond technical chart patterns, BTC has demonstrated remarkable resilience amid escalating global tariff-induced uncertainty. According to the latest The Week On-Chain report, both gold and BTC have performed well during the ongoing tariff war. The report notes: Amidst this turmoil, the performance of hard assets remains remarkably impressive. Gold continues to surge higher, having reached a new ATH of $3,300, as investors flee to the traditional safe haven asset. Bitcoin sold off to $75k initially alongside risk assets, but has since recovered the week‚Äôs gains, trading back up to $85k, now flat since this burst of volatility. The report also mentions that BTC recently experienced its largest price correction of the 2023‚Äì25 cycle, a -33% drawdown from its ATH earlier this year. However, this correction remains relatively modest compared to those seen in previous market cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly RSI Breakout Signals Trend Shift ‚Äì Is $100,000 Next For BTC? The following chart illustrates BTC bull market correction drawdowns since 2011. As shown, the recent -33% correction is the shallowest among past cycles, with the deepest being -72% during the 2012‚Äì14 bull market. While BTC continues to show signs of maturing as a reliable asset during times of geopolitical uncertainty, institutional investors appear to be taking profits. This is evidenced by recent outflows from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At press time, BTC is trading at $84,694, up 0.7% in the past 24 hours.

The platform revealed that most of its management team voted to ‚Äúcease and retreat‚Äù after allegations surfaced that North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus Group used the platform to launder approximately $35 million of the $1.4 billion stolen in a Bybit exploit. eXch blames global crackdown and misinterpretation of Its mission for shutdown According to eXch, it was under an ‚Äúactive transatlantic operation‚Äù that targeted its shutdown and potential legal action. eXch said that‚ÄÇwhile it had remained operational despite numerous failed attempts to dismantle its infrastructure ‚Äî which it acknowledged were part of a current operation ‚Äî it no longer felt it was worth operating in an unfriendly environment. It said it was being targeted by Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) due to‚ÄÇconfusion over its mission. At first, the platform rebuffed reports by‚ÄÇcrypto sleuths that it had laundered digital assets for the Lazarus Group. However, it acknowledged handling an ‚Äúinsignificant portion of funds‚Äù from the February attack. Individuals from eXch‚Äôs management team emphasized its focus on user privacy in announcing the shutdown, claiming that some exchanges ‚Äúabuse customers with nonsensical policies‚Äù in their attempts to fight money laundering. Bybit recovers after record $1.5B hack as regulators signal softer stance on crypto On February 21, 2025, a group of hackers from North Korea stole the largest cryptocurrency heist in history after stealing $1.5 billion in Ethereum tokens from the Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange ByBit . The hackers exploited a free storage software product that ByBit used to move Ethereum to another location, most likely coupled with phishing attacks to access control and download malware . On February 22, CEO Ben Zhou assured that the exchange had the resources to ‚Äúcover the loss‚Äù if the funds weren‚Äôt recovered. However, the company later revealed plans to shut down some of its Web3 services and close its NFT marketplace. By April 10, Bybit had regained its market share achieved before the hack: roughly 7%. The exchange paid more than $2 million to bounty hunters providing information that could be used to freeze some of the funds traceable to other platforms, which was estimated to be roughly 89% of the $1.4 billion as of March 20. That effort rewarded tipsters who helped freeze stolen tokens before they could be laundered through smaller exchanges or converted into fiat. Bybit has since recovered its pre-hack market share, regaining roughly 7% of global crypto volume by April 10. Fed chair signals softer crypto rules as digital assets enter the mainstream Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that regulators may soon take a more open approach to digital assets , even as enforcement efforts continue to intensify. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve taken a conservative stance, especially after the wave of failures and frauds,‚Äù Powell said. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre entering a new phase.‚Äù Powell pointed to growing bipartisan interest in regulating stablecoins, signaling that Congress may soon revisit a legal framework that stalled in past sessions. He said any new policy must balance innovation with risk controls, especially as crypto becomes more intertwined with the traditional banking system. ‚ÄúThe climate is changing,‚Äù Powell noted. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre seeing digital assets move into the mainstream.‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Bitcoin Realized Cap Is Growing At A Notably Slower Rate Now According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the Realized Cap of Bitcoin has just set a new record. The ‚ÄúRealized Cap‚Äù here refers to a capitalization model for Bitcoin that calculates the asset‚Äôs total value by assuming the ‚Äòreal‚Äô value of any token in circulation is equal to the spot price at which it was last transacted on the network. The last transaction of a given coin is likely to represent the last point at which it changed hands, so the price at the time of the move would denote the coin‚Äôs current cost basis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Still Close To Extreme Fear‚ÄîGreen Sign For Recovery? As the Realized Cap sums up this acquisition value for all tokens part of the circulating supply, it essentially determines the amount of capital that the investors as a whole have used to purchase Bitcoin. Now, here is the chart for the indicator shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in its value over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realizzed Cap has been following an uptrend for a while now. Whenever the indicator‚Äôs value rises, it means a net amount of capital is flowing into the cryptocurrency. Thus, the long-term surge would imply BTC has been enjoying continuous inflows. That said, while capital has been flowing in without break, the growth rate has fluctuated over the cycle. From the chart, it‚Äôs visible that the Realized Cap saw a particularly sharp rise during two periods: Q1 2024 and Q4 2024. The Q1 2024 phase was followed by a rapid slowdown in capital inflowsm and so far, it would appear that the Q4 2024 one has been seeing something similar. At the height of inflows in December, the growth rate of the metric stood at around 13% per month. Today, this value has declined to just 0.9% per month. Growth is still continuing, of course, and the indicator has managed to set a new record of $872 billion. But as Glassnode has explained, the slowdown could indicate ‚Äúinvestor appetite is softening ‚Äì signaling continued risk-off sentiment.‚Äù Both the periods of fresh capital inflows last year coincided with bull rallies for Bitcoin, while the phase of slowdown in between the two resulted in bearish consolidation for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Hasn‚Äôt Lost This Key Level Yet‚ÄîBull Cycle Intact? The latest drop in Realized Cap growth has so far resulted in a notable drawdown for the asset‚Äôs price. Given the trend of last year, it‚Äôs possible that a proper reversal may not happen for BTC until the metric catches a sharper uptrend. BTC Price Bitcoin has taken to sideways movement over the last few days as its price is still floating around the $84,700 mark.

TRUMP Coin is treading water as it braces for a substantial token unlock. Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing price rebound is gaining strength, with support levels now holding. But while those assets represent known territory, one rising name‚Äî Web3 ai ‚Äîis stealing the spotlight with a 700% ROI baked into its presale. This isn‚Äôt just about performance‚Äîit‚Äôs about positioning. From volatile meme tokens to infrastructure giants and AI-powered presales, the market is sorting itself into short-term buzz and long-term relevance. And for anyone looking for the top altcoin to buy now, these three stories are worth watching. TRUMP Coin Price Today Remains Flat Ahead of $320M Token Release TRUMP Coin is currently trading just above $8, after freefalling from its previous high of $74. Despite the dramatic correction, TRUMP coin price today has been relatively steady‚Äîbut that could soon change. A $320 million token unlock is scheduled for April 17, releasing 20% of the total token supply into circulation. While some traders believe this is already priced in, others are bracing for renewed volatility. Unlocks of this size almost always create friction in the market‚Äîespecially for meme tokens without deeper utility layers to support demand. That said, TRUMP coin price today still reflects enough interest to suggest that volatility hasn‚Äôt vanished‚Äîonly paused. Whether this project rebounds or fades may come down to how the unlock is handled‚Äîand whether speculative energy returns. For now, TRUMP remains a high-risk, high-drama meme asset that, while entertaining, doesn‚Äôt quite rank as a top altcoin to buy now for serious long-term positioning. Ethereum (ETH) Price Recovery Gains Strength Above Key Levels While TRUMP Coin holds flat, Ethereum (ETH) price recovery is gaining traction. After bottoming out near $1,385 last week, ETH has rebounded above $1,500 and is now testing resistance around $1,750. For traders watching closely, this zone marks a major turning point. A confirmed breakout could push Ethereum back toward the $1,800‚Äì$2,000 range over the next few weeks. What‚Äôs fueling the Ethereum (ETH) price recovery? Part of it is macro optimism‚Äîtariff suspensions and stable inflation data have lifted broader risk assets. But Ethereum‚Äôs fundamentals are also playing a role. With DeFi volume rising, Layer 2 adoption increasing, and ETH staking showing record inflows, the use case for Ethereum remains strong. The recovery isn‚Äôt euphoric‚Äîbut it‚Äôs measured, and it‚Äôs building. For mid- to long-term holders, that makes Ethereum a clear component of any balanced portfolio‚Äîand a strong complement to emerging altcoins with breakout potential. Web3 ai: A Utility-Powered 700% Presale Positioned as the Top Altcoin to Buy Now Enter Web3 ai‚Äîthe low-cap AI-driven project now leading the conversation around the top altcoin to buy now. While other tokens are fighting to recover or hold ground, Web3 ai is opening the door to early-stage investors with a confirmed 700% ROI window. The token is available at $0.10 in presale, with an $0.80 launch target already set in motion. But this isn‚Äôt just about price multiples‚Äîit‚Äôs about purpose. Web3 ai is building a 12-tool AI ecosystem aimed at improving crypto decision-making. From AI trading assistants and staking dashboards to risk analytics and scam detectors, every tool is designed to offer real-time insight across Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and Polygon. The $WAI token isn‚Äôt a gimmick‚Äîit powers access to the platform and gives holders governance power over platform upgrades. It‚Äôs a model built not for hype, but for staying power. With crypto getting more complex by the day, investors aren‚Äôt just looking for new tokens‚Äîthey‚Äôre looking for tools that help them manage risk, act faster, and optimize performance. Web3 ai delivers on that, and that‚Äôs exactly why it‚Äôs rapidly being recognized as the top altcoin to buy now ‚Äîespecially before it hits public markets. Final Word TRUMP coin price today is steady, but looming risk remains. Ethereum (ETH) price recovery is progressing, giving confidence to those tracking broader crypto resilience. And Web3 ai is delivering a rare presale combo: functional products, AI-powered utility, and a clear 700% launch window. As 2025 approaches, capital is rotating away from short-lived speculation and into real, useful infrastructure. Web3 ai might not be the loudest name‚Äîyet‚Äîbut it‚Äôs checking the boxes that matter. For early movers with an eye on asymmetric gains and tangible tools, this might just be the top altcoin to buy now before the next cycle fully takes shape.

The bill proposes to tax traders when they sell their cryptocurrency for fiat or pay for goods and services, but crypto-to-crypto and transfers between wallets owned by the same user will be exempt, Slovenia‚Äôs Finance Ministry said in an April 17 statement. Under the proposed legislation, crypto tax will be aligned with existing tax laws. Slovenia taxpayers will be required to keep a record of all their transactions for annual tax returns. The tax base would be calculated on profits by subtracting the purchase price from the sale price. In a statement to the Slovenia Times, finance minister Klemen Bo≈°tjanƒçiƒç said it‚Äôs unreasonable that crypto trading for individuals isn‚Äôt currently taxed in the country. ‚ÄúThe goal of taxation of crypto assets is not to generate tax revenue, but we find it illogical and unreasonable that one of the most speculative financial instruments is not taxed at all,‚Äù he said in a statement translated from Slovenian. New tax could stifle crypto in Slovenia, lawmaker says Jernej Vrtovec, a member of Slovenia‚Äôs national assembly and New Slovenia opposition party, slammed the proposal in an April 16 statement to X, arguing it could stifle crypto growth in the country. ‚ÄúSlovenia has the opportunity to become a crypto-friendly country, but with the government‚Äôs proposals, we will miss the train again,‚Äù he said in a post also translated from Slovenian. ‚ÄúWith excessive taxation, we will once again see young people and capital fleeing abroad. Taxes should encourage, not stifle.‚Äù Source: Jernej Vrtovec The proposal is open to public consultation until May 5. If Slovenian lawmakers pass the bill, it will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2026. Slovenia introduced a 10% tax on crypto withdrawals and payments in 2023, but capital gains from occasional crypto trading are not taxed, according to the crypto tax platform Token Tax.

Business activity, such as mining or staking, is subject to income tax. A previous bill proposed in April 2022 planned to levy a 5% tax on profits over 10,000 euros ($11,372), but it was never passed into law. Slovenia issued the first digital sovereign bond in the European Union on July 25 last year . It had a nominal size of 30 million euros ($32.5 million) with a 3.65% coupon and a maturity date of Nov. 25 that year. The number of crypto users in Slovenia is projected to reach roughly 98,000 in 2025, according to online data platform Statista, with a penetration rate of 4.6% among its population of 2.12 million people. While the projected revenue for the country's crypto market is slated to hit $2.8 million.

One of Arizona‚Äôs crypto reserve bills has been passed by the House and is now one successful vote away from heading to the governor‚Äôs desk for official approval. Arizona's Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Bill (SB 1373) was approved on April 17 by the House Committee of the Whole, which involves 60 House members weighing in on the bill before a third and final reading and a full floor vote. Source: Bitcoin Laws SB 1373 seeks to establish a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund made up of digital assets seized through criminal proceedings to be managed by the state‚Äôs treasurer. Arizona‚Äôs treasurer would be permitted to invest up to 10% of the fund‚Äôs total monies in any fiscal year in digital assets. The treasurer would also be able to loan the fund‚Äôs assets in order to increase returns, provided it doesn‚Äôt increase financial risks. However, a Senate-approved SB 1373 may be set back by Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, who recently pledged to veto all bills until the legislature passes a bill for disability funding. Hobbs also has a history of vetoing bills before the House and has vetoed 15 bills sent to her desk this week alone. Bitcoin Laws founder and Apollo CEO Julian Fahrer told Cointelegraph that he expects SB 1373 will pass the House, though it may merge with another crypto-related bill, such as SB 1062, which aims to expand the definition of legal tender to include crypto. Arizona is the new leader in the state Bitcoin reserve race SB 1373 has been passing through Arizona‚Äôs legislature alongside the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB 1025), which only includes Bitcoin ( BTC ). The bill proposes allowing Arizona‚Äôs treasury and state retirement system to invest up to 10% of the available funds into Bitcoin. SB 1025 also passed Arizona‚Äôs House Committee of the Whole on April 1 and is awaiting a full floor vote.

However, it appears to have found minor support, though not strong enough, and there‚Äôs no assurance that it will hold. Doge‚Äôs outlook is still under the bears‚Äô radar on a mid-term scale, but they appear to have exhausted momentum and are now looking weak. The bulls intercepted their recent attempt to resume pressure, and the market is now calm at the time of writing. This slight bearish suspension manifested earlier this month after testing a new monthly low of $0.13. A bounce occurred, and the price recovered to $0.17. Marking a resistance there, the price fell to $0.15 yesterday and held above this price level as support. Whether this minor support level will hold or not is yet to be ascertained. Advancing bearish move, the primary meme coin may lose grip above the support level, and continues to show signs of weakness on the daily chart. While this could lead to another major breakdown, it may see big losses in the long term. A few top meme coins have mirrored Doge‚Äôs recent price movement. While some are posting gains in the past few days, many are yet to find a solid ground on the daily timeframe. Nevertheless, the overall market is still considered bearish. DOGE‚Äôs Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview If the bears pull below $0.15, we can expect an extension to $0.142, along with the monthly $0.128 low. A collapse from there should bring us to $0.115 and maybe the $0.1 level in the near term. Towards the upside, the $0.17 level has recently held as resistance. If the price rebounds through it to $0.18, we can anticipate a recovery to $0.2 and $0.24 in no time.

Approval of spot Litecoin ETFs appears likely, with analysts giving high odds; Canary Capital's ETF is in 'Pre Launch' status per the DTCC website. Litecoin's utility and active user growth contrast with Bitcoin's scaling stagnation, suggesting LTC is undervalued relative to BTC on PoW peers. LTCN trades at a discount to NAV, presenting a potential arbitrage opportunity if spot ETFs are approved, boosting LTCN's value. In the roughly three months since I last covered Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) and the Grayscale Litecoin Trust ( LTCN ) for Seeking Alpha, the performances of both the coin and the fund have been admittedly lack-luster. Data by YCharts When I wrote my last piece, LTCN was trading at a small premium relative to the prior year. As of mid-April, not only is that premium gone entirely but the fund has shifted back to a NAV rate discount for the first time since Q4-23. In this update, we'll look at the latest pertaining to spot Litecoin ETFs, Litecoin's continued usage story, and why I still like both LTC and LTCN given the broader setup in the digital asset market. Spot Litecoin ETF Developments While it isn't yet exactly clear when (or even if) spot ETFs will be approved by the SEC, the indications are that they will be coming at some point in the future. Consider that Canary Capital's Litecoin ETF is currently listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's website as a 'Pre Launch' ticker: LTCC Ticker in Pre Launch (DTCC) This doesn't actually mean that LTCC is guaranteed to become an approved ETF, but it is a positive sign as it shows the issuer is becoming more prepared for approval. ETF Analyst Expectations as of 2/10/25 (James Seyffart/X) Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart previously put LTC ETF approval odds at 90%. Furthermore, Seyffart said in early-February that he believes LTC will be the next ETF approved in the United States. In March, the SEC delayed a decision on the Canary fund and the next deadline is May 5th, which as of article submission, is less than three weeks away. Revisiting The Litecoin Thesis A view that I've steadfastly held in my coverage of cryptocurrencies through the years is the idea that the networks where these assets live have to actually offer the world real utility. Otherwise, speculation on price is likely the only real point of existence. That's not the future the cypherpunks who originally advocated for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) envisioned. But to a large degree, it's indeed the reality that we have today. That doesn't mean it has to remain the case going forward, and I've long suspected that through the bullish/bearish cycles that crypto speculators endure, the assets that will ultimately remain are the ones that offer the very utility I mentioned. There are many in the space who will argue that Bitcoin can do just about anything. BTC is viewed as 'Digital Gold' and any end user payments for smaller transactions can simply happen on secondary scaling layers. Thus, LTC need not exist. Yet lo and behold, after over 13 years in the market, Litecoin still commands a market capitalization of nearly $6 billion and a market cap rank of 21. For a coin that some feel is totally obsolete, this is impressive staying power, in my view. And my thinking here is the reason LTC still matters is precisely because scaling Bitcoin efforts have stagnated while Litecoin usage continues to grow. 30 Day Average DAAs (CoinMetrics) I've shared this chart in prior articles, but I'm sharing it again because I believe it helps illustrate two things; first, Litecoin's 30-day average DAA trend remains up since the beginning of 2021 while Bitcoin's is actually down. Second, when Bitcoin's transaction fees spiked in late-2023 and early-2024, crypto's user base shifted to Litecoin. I think another way to look at this though is through what I'll call the BTC/LTC DAA Multiple: 90 Day Average DAA Multiple (CoinMetrics) This logarithmic chart shows Bitcoin DAAs divided by Litecoin DAAs on a rolling 90-day average. This is essentially another way of showing Bitcoin losing active user share to Litecoin since 2017. Back then, the BTC/LTC DAA multiple was 60x. Today, it's just 2x, and it even spent some of 2024 under 2x. This isn't the only multiple that I think matters. You won't get any argument from me that Bitcoin settles far more in USD-denominated value each day. Over the last 30 days, Bitcoin has averaged about $9 billion in daily transferred value, while Litecoin's figure is closer to $86 million. To be sure, a massive difference. But adjusting for the differences in market capitalization, LTC is far cheaper than BTC: 30 Day Average NVT Ratio (CoinMetrics) This is the 30-day average NVT ratio; which divides the market capitalization of the coin by the USD-denominated transferred value on the network. I've added Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) and Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ) to show that LTC is indeed the outlier. At a 77 NVT ratio, Litecoin's valuation continues to trade at a massive discount to Proof-of-Work payment chain peers. DOGE, BCH, and BTC all command NVT ratios in excess of 200. So this is either a bad framework, or Litecoin is undervalued relative to the rest of the market. I continue to believe the issue lies with the valuations rather than the framework. Grayscale Litecoin Trust I'll point out again that my issue with LTCN as an investment in recent years hasn't been due to the underlying asset or its attractiveness as a digital currency. My problem with the fund over the last year and change has simply been one of valuation. At a significant multiple over the underlying value of the LTC, LTCN isn't worth the price tag. However, at a discount, I like it a lot more due to what, I think, is discounted exposure to a digital asset that is also significantly discounted relative to Proof-of-Work peers. Data by YCharts And that's exactly what we have from the market today. LTCN trades a small discount to NAV. And LTC trades a significant discount to the NVT ratios that are presently observed by natural peers BTC, BCH, and DOGE. All this said, a consideration that LTCN shareholders should remain mindful of is share unlocks through the end of the year: Grayscale LTC Holdings (CoinGlass) Grayscale held 1.48 million LTC through the trust back in February 2024. By the end of April, LTC holdings grew to 1.69 million. Though as of April 17th, most of the shares issued from that LTC growth are already unlocked. The next big unlock appears to be in mid-July, where LTC holdings grew by 5% overnight. LTC pricing likely matters here because between April 15th, 2024 and July 17th, 2024, Litecoin traded between $60-80 dollars per coin. Which means that some of these LTCN shares are likely already underwater. Will those shareholders take the loss and further depress the NAV rate? I won't attempt to guess. Closing Thoughts Litecoin is quietly still an important asset in the cryptocurrency market. It's one of just three coins that can be purchased through a Fidelity crypto IRA, and all indications from ETF analysts are that the spot LTC ETFs will be approved in the United States. When that happens, LTCN's days at a discount are presumably over. So coin price being equal, buying LTCN at a discount could be a nice little arbitrage trade between now and a potential ETF conversion. Fundamentally, LTC remains highly depressed relative to similar assets. If LTC traded at the same NVT ratio as BTC, the coin price would be closer to $225.",LTC-USD|LTCN,EN,0,0,BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|LTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-18 02:45:45

David Schwartz‚Äôs quote from 2020, resurfaced by Squire, captures what Ripple envisioned years ago: ‚ÄúMy dream scenario is SWIFT makes a deal with Ripple where all their banks get to use RippleNet for free, maybe even paying SWIFT.‚Äù At the time, this idea was largely speculative. Now, it appears that Ripple‚Äôs ambitions may align with real-world developments. David Schwartz, 2020: ""My dream scenario is SWIFT makes a deal with Ripple where all their banks get to use RippleNet for free, maybe even paying SWIFT! Fits our #XRP strategy perfectly!"" What sounded crazy in 2020‚Ä¶ might be unfolding right now. pic.twitter.com/5RVwITlfag ‚Äî John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) April 16, 2025 Rumors began circulating recently that SWIFT is testing XRP within its network of over 11,000 banks . If true, this would mark a major development in Ripple‚Äôs long-standing strategy and significantly boost XRP‚Äôs role in global finance. XRP‚Äôs Growing Relevance RippleNet, now known as Ripple Payments, is Ripple‚Äôs proprietary network, which was designed to streamline cross-border payments, reduce fees, and eliminate inefficiencies common in traditional financial systems. XRP plays a central role by providing liquidity and enabling rapid settlement with low costs. While Ripple has consistently positioned XRP as an asset capable of replacing outdated messaging systems like SWIFT, recent developments suggest that an outright replacement may not be necessary. Instead, a collaborative approach where SWIFT banks use XRP in tandem with their existing infrastructure could prove more viable. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This possibility fits Ripple‚Äôs broader strategy, particularly in its partnerships with financial institutions worldwide. If SWIFT allows access to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for its member banks, this would represent an unprecedented shift. Such integration would instantly expand XRP‚Äôs reach, potentially placing it at the core of a global settlement framework used by thousands of banks. Schwartz noted that this integration fits the strategy perfectly and could take it to new heights. From Competitors to Collaborators The landscape of global finance is evolving rapidly, and interoperability between traditional systems and blockchain-based solutions is becoming increasingly important. While SWIFT is the current international standard, it has numerous inefficiencies that XRP was built to address. Rumors that SWIFT is exploring XRP as part of a trial program with its vast network could indicate a major turning point. While no official confirmation has been provided, the implications are significant. Recent analysis shows that capturing just 1% of SWIFT‚Äôs daily volume could send XRP above $35 , and full integration could push the asset to unimaginable heights.

Dogecoin to $1 By Summer‚Äôs End? On the one‚Äëweek time‚Äëframe, analyst Chris (@StonkChris) plots an expanding rising channel that has been guiding price action since the October‚Äë2023 low at $0.056. That structure has produced a sequence of higher highs‚Äî~$0.229 in March‚ÄØ2024 and ~$0.484 in December 2024‚Äîand higher lows around $0.077 (February‚ÄØ2024) and $0.08 (early August 2024). The latest pull‚Äëback has just retested the channel‚Äôs lower rail at $0.13, where Chris notes that the weekly Stochastic‚ÄëRSI has begun to curl up from single‚Äëdigit territory and the Ichimoku cloud is turning supportive above $0.22. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To Enter Phase E After Testing Last Point Of Support, Here‚Äôs The Target From that confluence he sketches a steep, almost parabolic trajectory that slashes through the cloud resistance in May, re‚Äëtests the mid‚Äëcloud span near $0.30 and accelerates toward the upper boundary of the channel‚Äîan area that will sit close to $1.00‚Äì$1.10 by late‚Äësummer 2025. ‚ÄúDOGE to $1 by the end of the summer‚ÄØ2025 anyone?‚Äù he asked followers on X, leaving little doubt about his conviction that the secular up‚Äëtrend remains intact. A Higher High Is Needed The short‚Äëterm picture is less binary in the eyes of Olivier (@Dark64), who analyses Dogecoin on the daily chart. His canvas is dominated by two features: a descending regression channel (labelled ‚ÄúBLSR‚Äù) that has trapped price since the November peak at $0.484, and a large rounded accumulation base projected to end between 5‚ÄØMay‚ÄØ2025 and 29‚ÄØJune‚ÄØ2025. Key horizontal levels flank the pattern. Immediate support sits at $0.1533, the level price is presently hugging. Should that shelf give way, Dogecoin could revisit the lower line of the channel below $0.13. To the upside, Olivier marked $0.2175 the most crucial resistance where DOGE could break out of the descending channel and mark the first higher high in months. Related Reading: Dogecoin Follows The Blueprint: Analyst Highlights Perfect Technical Execution Meanwhile, the area around $0.229 could be a last line of defense for bears as this is the local high from March 2024. A break above this level would expose $0.3496‚Äîa key support in December last year until January this year. Ultimately, the December high at $0.4361, with the year‚Äëto‚Äëdate high at $0.484 completing the measured‚Äëmove objective. Olivier‚Äôs trading logic is brutally simple. ‚ÄúThe up‚Äëtrend won‚Äôt resume until it prints a new higher low,‚Äù he wrote, adding in reply to a sceptic who wondered whether DOGE might first undercut $0.12: ‚ÄúIf it breaks the last low, it will go lower. If it prints a new higher low and a new higher high, then I‚Äôll be confident a new up‚Äëtrend is on.‚Äù His road‚Äëmap therefore allows for one more flush‚Äîpotentially into the $0.13‚Äì$0.11 pocket. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.154.

On April 17, Galaxy introduced a Solana proposal called ‚ÄúMultiple Election Stake-Weight Aggregation‚Äù (MESA) to reduce the inflation rate of its native token, SOL ( SOL ). The researchers described the proposal as a ‚Äúmore market-based approach to agreeing on the rate of future SOL emissions.‚Äù Rather than using traditional yes/no voting for inflation rates, MESA allows validators to vote on multiple deflation rates and uses the weighted average as the outcome. ‚ÄúInstead of cycling through inflation reduction proposals until one passes, what if validators could allocate their votes to one or many changes, with the aggregate of ‚Äòyes‚Äô outcomes becoming the adopted emissions curve?‚Äù Galaxy explained. The motivation for the concept comes from a previous proposal (SIMD-228), which showed community agreement that SOL inflation should be reduced, but the binary voting system couldn‚Äôt find consensus on specific parameters. SIMD-228 proposed to change Solana‚Äôs inflation system from a fixed schedule to a dynamic, market-based model. The new proposal suggests maintaining the fixed, terminal inflation rate at 1.5% and sets forth multiple outcomes that create multiple ‚Äòyes‚Äô voting options with different deflation rates from which an average is aggregated if a quorum is reached. For example, if 5% vote for no change, remaining at 15% deflation, 50% vote for a 30% deflation rate, and 45% vote for 33%, the new deflation rate would be calculated as the aggregate at 30.6%. The target is to reach the terminal rate of 1.5% supply inflation. Predicted inflation curves under new voting proposal. Source: Galaxy Digital Solving problems with binary voting The benefits are that a more market-driven system allows validators to express preferences along a spectrum rather than with binary choices, while maintaining predictability with a fixed inflation curve. ‚ÄúGalaxy Research seeks to suggest a genuinely alternative process to achieving what we believe is the community‚Äôs broad goal, and not necessarily proscribe any particular inflation rate outcome,‚Äù the firm explained. Related: Solana upgrades will strengthen network but squeeze validators ‚Äî VanEck Under the current mechanism, supply inflation begins at 8% annually, decreasing by 15% per year until it reaches 1.5%. Solana‚Äôs current inflation rate is 4.6%, and 64.7% of the total supply, or 387 million SOL, is currently staked, according to Solana Compass.

ETH is now consolidating and might attempt to recover above the $1,620 resistance. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $1,620 and $1,600 levels. The price is trading below $1,620 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $1,590 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $1,615 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Faces Hurdles Ethereum price struggled to continue higher above $1,690 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $1,600 and $1,580 support levels. It even spiked below $1,550. A low was formed at $1,538 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $1,580 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,690 swing high to the $1,538 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $1,590 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $1,620 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,600 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,615 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,690 swing high to the $1,538 low. The first major resistance is near the $1,655 level. A clear move above the $1,655 resistance might send the price toward the $1,700 resistance. An upside break above the $1,700 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $1,750 resistance zone or even $1,800 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,615 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,5750 level. The first major support sits near the $1,540 zone. A clear move below the $1,540 support might push the price toward the $1,480 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,420 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,400.

Amid heightened global uncertainty, which is fueled by escalating US-China trade tensions, Bitcoin has experienced a sharp correction, though recent signs point to stabilization. Interestingly, the Coinbase Premium, a metric that reflects the price difference of Bitcoin on Coinbase versus global exchanges, is showing signs of recovery. After tightening through a series of lower highs and higher lows since March 2024, the premium has recently begun to trend upward, which suggests a renewed buying interest from US-based institutional and retail investors. This activity coincides with Bitcoin‚Äôs modest rebound and signals that Coinbase traders may be positioning ahead of broader market shifts. On the other hand, the Korea Premium Index paints a more cautious picture. The metric, which typically signals increased activity among South Korean retail investors, has remained in a downtrend throughout the correction and only saw a delayed uptick after Bitcoin had already rallied. This lag indicates waning enthusiasm from Korean investors compared to previous cycles, where they were often early and aggressive participants. The contrasting behavior highlighted a shift in market influence, with Western platforms like Coinbase now leading price discovery. As such, CryptoQuant stated that while the Korea Premium may serve as a lagging indicator in this cycle, the Coinbase Premium could offer forward-looking insights into demand trends. Despite ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, the strengthening Coinbase Premium hints at growing confidence and a potential medium- to long-term recovery in Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory.

The state‚Äôs Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Bill (SB 1373) passed the House Committee of the Whole on April 17 and now awaits one final vote before heading to Governor Katie Hobbs for approval. The crypto reserve bill proposes the creation of a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund, which would consist of digital assets seized during criminal proceedings. Arizona Treasurer May Gain Power to Invest 10% of State Crypto Fund Annually The fund would be managed by Arizona‚Äôs state treasurer, who would be authorized to invest up to 10% of its total balance in digital assets each fiscal year. Additionally, the treasurer could lend out fund assets to generate returns, provided this does not elevate financial risk. Despite clearing the House committee stage, the bill‚Äôs path forward remains uncertain. Governor Hobbs has vowed to veto all legislation until lawmakers address funding for disability services. She has already rejected 15 bills this week and has previously exercised veto power on several House-approved proposals. SB 1373 is advancing in parallel with another digital asset-focused proposal, the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB 1025). This bill would allow Arizona‚Äôs treasury and state retirement fund to invest up to 10% of available assets specifically in Bitcoin. It passed the House Committee of the Whole on April 1 and is also awaiting a final vote. ARIZONA Update: Bitcoin Reserve Bill SB 1373 has been passed by the House Committee of the Whole (with a minor amendment). The next step is Third Reading and final floor vote. pic.twitter.com/oOahjbZATR ‚Äî Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) April 17, 2025 Arizona now finds itself at the forefront of the growing state-level crypto reserve movement. While Utah passed Bitcoin-related legislation in early March , it removed the Bitcoin reserve provision during final approval. Texas and New Hampshire, however, have seen similar bills advance through their legislatures, with the Texas Senate approving its Bitcoin reserve bill on March 6. Just recently, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear officially signed House Bill 701 , known as the ‚ÄúBitcoin Rights‚Äù bill, into law‚Äîmaking the state one of the latest to enact legislation protecting digital asset users and operations. Missouri is also in the mix , with its Special Committee on Intergovernmental Affairs reviewing its own Bitcoin reserve proposal. Public Companies Boost Bitcoin Holdings by 16% in Q1 2025 Publicly traded companies increased their Bitcoin holdings by 16.1% in the first quarter of 2025, signaling continued institutional interest in the leading cryptocurrency despite market volatility. According to crypto asset manager Bitwise, total corporate Bitcoin holdings climbed to approximately 688,000 BTC by the end of Q1, with companies adding 95,431 BTC over the three-month period. Bitwise reported the combined value of these holdings reached $56.7 billion, based on a Q1 closing price of $82,445 per Bitcoin‚Äîrepresenting a 2.2% increase in value. The number of public companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheets also rose, from 67 to 79, with 12 firms making their first Bitcoin purchases during the quarter.

According to the Q1 Crypto Industry Report recently released by CoinGecko, the broader market experienced a major downturn. However, Bitcoin and Solana still had strong showings relative to the general market. The crypto market entered 2025 on a high note, building on momentum from late 2024. Bitcoin rose to an all-time high of $106,182 in January, contributing immensely to the rise of the total crypto market capitalization, which hit a $3.8 trillion on January 18. However, by the end of Q1, the total market cap had fallen by 18.6%, losing nearly $1 trillion and closing at $2.8 trillion. Crypto market cap and trading volume declined in Q1 2025. Source: Coingecko By the end of the quarter, Bitcoin‚Äôs price had fallen by 11.8%, ending at $82,514. Still, it performed better than most altcoins, further solidifying its dominance, which rose to 59.1% of the total crypto market cap. Solana rides the memecoin wave for growth DEX trading volume has suffered a steady decline since January. Source: Coingecko Solana saw a brief surge in decentralized exchange (DEX) activity in early Q1, accounting for 52% of on-chain spot DEX trades in January, fueled by the TRUMP memecoin frenzy. However, that momentum was reduced by March, as interest in meme coins dropped significantly. Solana‚Äôs DEX trade share fell to 23.4%, while Ethereum reclaimed the lead with 30.1%. Despite the resurgence, Ethereum‚Äôs overall performance was underwhelming. After hitting a high of $3,336, Ethereum ended Q1 at $1,805. Its market dominance fell to 7.9%, which is reportedly the lowest it has dropped since 2019. The memecoin trend saw unprecedented results at the start of the first quarter with the launch of the TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins before Trump‚Äôs inauguration. It pushed the launching of tokens on Pump.fun to a record 72,000 per day. However, its decline was expedited by the LIBRA token incident, which was promoted by Argentina‚Äôs president, Javier Milei, and collapsed following a rug pull. The incident caused LIBRA‚Äôs market cap to crash from $4.6 billion to $221 million within hours. As a result, Pump.fun‚Äôs activity declined sharply, with the launch of tokens falling over 56% on the platform. Stablecoins gain ground as centralized and DeFi crypto markets took hits More investors favored stability as stablecoins such as USDT and USDC due to market volatility. USDT‚Äôs market share increased to 5.2%, while USDC moved up to reclaim the seventh position in terms of market cap, displacing Dogecoin. Amid all the decline and changing of market share positions, XRP and BNB maintained their positions and market share. Binance maintains its lead in terms of CEX trading volume. Source: Coingecko According to the report, the top 10 centralized exchanges (CEXs) saw a 16.3% quarter-on-quarter drop in spot trading volume, totaling $5.4 trillion. Binance maintained its position as market leader with a 40.7% share, although its volume fell to $588.7 billion in March from over $1 trillion in December. HTX was the only exchange in the top 10 to record growth. Upbit saw a steep 34% drop. Bybit was hit the hardest, plunging 52.4% month-on-month following a major February hack. On the decentralized finance (DeFi) side, multichain DeFi total value locked (TVL) fell by 27.5% in Q1 2025, dropping from $177.4 billion to $128.6 billion, largely driven by altcoin price declines.

In accordance with its governance protocol, HTX DAO allocated 50% of revenue generated by the HTX exchange in Q1 2025 toward this burn. Executions were carried out transparently via Sun.io, with complete on-chain verification available through transaction hashes. Community members can review the full burn transaction here: Burn Hash on Tronscan Burn Mechanism: Not a Gimmick, but a Governance-Backed Commitment Unlike short-term, price-focused burns used by many projects as speculative marketing tactics, HTX DAO‚Äôs burn strategy is rooted in its ‚ÄúVerified Revenue ‚Äì Automatic Buyback ‚Äì On-chain Burn‚Äù model, introduced in late 2023. This system ensures consistent and verifiable token reductions aligned with real revenue, not artificially inflated figures. Key elements of the HTX DAO burn mechanism include: Revenue-Linked Buybacks: A fixed percentage of exchange income is used to repurchase and burn $HTX; Full Transparency: All burn addresses and transactions are recorded and publicly accessible on-chain; Scheduled Execution: Quarterly announcements and hash verifications published for community audit; Governance Supervision: DAO governance oversees adjustments to burn ratios and policies. This model makes HTX DAO‚Äôs deflationary action a structural economic feature, rather than a temporary performance signal‚Äîpositioning $HTX for long-term compounding value growth. Market Volatility Validates Mechanism Robustness In Q1 2025, despite Bitcoin falling from nearly $110,000 to $70,000‚Äîa drop of over 30%‚Äîand global crypto trading volumes dropping 27% from $200.7B to $146B (source: Coingecko ), HTX DAO‚Äôs token burn decreased by only 15% compared to Q4 2024 ($22M to $19.2M). This measured reduction highlights two important truths: Burn funding is derived from actual revenue, not reserves or pre-allocated marketing budgets; Burn volumes follow a systematic, non-manipulative model, unaffected by short-term market panic. Rather than artificial inflation of value, HTX DAO reflects a rational, data-driven growth model, balancing deflation and ecosystem expansion with real income performance. Scarcity Effect: Circulating Supply Falls, Value Logic Strengthens The cumulative impact of HTX DAO‚Äôs deflationary system is becoming more pronounced: Over 60.97 trillion $HTX burned, reducing overall token supply; Increased scarcity for long-term holders; Sustainable tokenomics, with low inflation and high burn rates‚Äîmaking $HTX one of the few net-deflationary exchange ecosystem tokens on the market. Following the footsteps of proven models like Ethereum‚Äôs EIP-1559 and BNB‚Äôs quarterly burns, HTX DAO is establishing a durable path toward value consolidation. Its staking, governance, and node programs are all structurally tied to the burn cycle‚Äîcreating a positive feedback loop where ecosystem growth triggers further deflation, and vice versa. Leading by Example: Real DAO Execution in a Sea of Paper DAOs While many projects claim to be DAOs in name, few consistently execute governance-backed decisions with on-chain transparency. HTX DAO sets itself apart by delivering measurable, auditable outcomes‚Äîburns, votes, and revenue allocation‚Äîvisible to all stakeholders. In contrast with projects known for inconsistent execution or vague treasury use, HTX DAO demonstrates: High operational reliability Transparent financial data Clear deflationary logic This makes HTX DAO a standout among modern DAO ecosystems‚Äînot merely in philosophy, but in real-world delivery. More Than a Buzzword: DAO as a Mechanism for Value Fulfillment This Q1 burn underscores HTX DAO‚Äôs continued adherence to its roadmap. Despite macro challenges, it has executed a $19M burn, retained full on-chain traceability, and continued reducing its circulating supply. These attributes collectively validate the DAO‚Äôs ability to deliver on promises‚Äînot just through whitepapers, but through chain-verified results. With renewed user growth, ecosystem expansion, and market recovery expected later in 2025, future burn events are poised to become milestones in HTX DAO‚Äôs deflationary growth story. For a sector still grappling with the legitimacy of decentralized governance, HTX DAO offers a compelling answer to the question: Can DAOs truly deliver value? HTX DAO‚Äôs response is already written‚Äîon-chain. About HTX DAO As a multi-chain deployed decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), HTX DAO demonstrates an innovative governance approach. Unlike traditional corporate structures, it adopts a decentralized governance structure composed of a diversified group, jointly committed to the success of this organization. This unique ecosystem advocates openness and encourages all DAO participants to propose ideas that can promote the development of HTX DAO.

In the past, internet infrastructure challenges and low financial literacy among the war-torn population contributed to relatively limited crypto adoption, according to an April 17 report from blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs. ‚ÄúHowever, there are signs of growing interest and usage driven primarily by necessity rather than speculation,‚Äù the blockchain intelligence firm said. ‚ÄúFor those who use cryptocurrencies in Yemen, the ability to bypass the disruption in local financial services offers a modicum of financial resilience, especially as banks can be difficult to access or are simply inoperable due to the ongoing conflict.‚Äù Yemen has been in a civil war between the government and the Houthi group since September 2014. The US has also frequently sanctioned financial infrastructure in the country to disrupt Houthi activity, with the most recent action on April 17 hitting the International Bank of Yemen. DeFi platforms account for most of Yemen‚Äôs crypto-related web traffic, taking up over 63% of observed activity, while global centralized exchanges account for 18% of crypto-related web traffic, TRM Labs data shows. DeFi platforms account for most of Yemen‚Äôs crypto-related web traffic, followed by centralized exchanges. Source: TRM Labs Some local Yemenis also use peer-to-peer crypto transactions to move funds across borders or conduct remittances. ‚ÄúAlthough these interactions do not necessarily imply high transaction volumes, they reinforce that for some individuals in Yemen, decentralized infrastructure may provide a necessary alternative to traditional payment rails,‚Äù TRM Labs said. ‚ÄúThe interest in DeFi services may reflect the appeal of systems that allow users to transact without intermediaries, particularly where local banking institutions are inaccessible or unreliable.‚Äù Increasing sanctions could spark higher crypto adoption in Yemen Currently, Yemen doesn‚Äôt have legislation in place for the use of crypto; TRM Labs speculates that increasing sanctions against the Houthis could be the spark that ignites higher crypto adoption in Yemen. Following the Biden administration‚Äôs relisting of the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in January 2024, a Yemen-based cryptocurrency exchange tracked by TRM experienced a 270% increase in overall volume, the blockchain intelligence firm said. Related: US DOJ says it seized Hamas crypto meant to finance terrorism It eventually returned to pre-spike levels, but it saw another uptick again, this time by 223%, in the three months following the election of US President Donald Trump and the reinstating of the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization by the US on Jan. 22. ‚ÄúGiven the intensifying international sanctions on the Houthis and their primary backer, Iran, the group‚Äôs use of cryptocurrency is likely to grow in both scale and sophistication,‚Äù TRM Labs said. ‚ÄúAs traditional financial avenues become increasingly restricted, decentralized digital currencies offer an alternative that is less susceptible to oversight and harder to trace.‚Äù Magazine: Terrorism and the Israel-Gaza war have been weaponized to destroy crypto",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-18 04:50:16
43474087,https://nulltx.com/?p=148079,1744951863,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"$DARK Joins Binance Alpha Spotlight, Surges 50% Amid Growing Whale Interest",https://nulltx.com/dark-joins-binance-alpha-spotlight-surges-50-amid-growing-whale-interest/,"In an important turn of events for the cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence sectors, the Solana-based AI project $DARK ( @darkresearchai ) has been chosen as the 40th project to be shown off on Binance Alpha Spotlight. This has created quite a stir in the market. In the last 24 hours, the project has seen a 50 percent increase in its value, exploding its market capitalization to over $30 million. $DARK is not just any old AI project ‚Äî it is a cutting-edge initiative focused on creating algorithms that live in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This has huge implications for decentralized systems and could very well redefine scalability in those systems. What is $DARK and How Does It Work? DARK is an innovative AI project that uses the Solana blockchain. Built onto an experimental network of what are called Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), it allows for computing that is secure and exposes no sensitive data. The way TEEs work is hugely important for the kinds of platforms DARK wants to create. Those are called Multi-Computational Platforms (MCPs), and the term roughly denotes another way of saying the project will allow for massively parallelized computing at a scale and efficiency that just isn‚Äôt achieved with current decentralized systems. In other words, if you‚Äôre trying to do something like train a neural network, DARK promises it will allow you to do so more effectively than any programming you might try on a current platform. Binance Alpha launches DARK. DARK is an experimental network for trusted execution environments. ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 17, 2025 Crucial for guaranteeing the privacy and security of data, TEEs are the bedrock technology on which the $DARK project is built. The aim of $DARK is to create a decentralized, AI-driven network that can perform massive computations with the same security and privacy guarantees that TEEs provide. This very quality‚Äîunmatched scalability and security‚Äîmakes $DARK an attractive solution for decentralized applications that rely on AI and need to process large amounts of sensitive data. And that‚Äôs what makes me excited about $DARK. $DARK is putting itself in a position to be a major player at the rapidly evolving intersection of AI and blockchain technology, using the almost instantaneous, very low-cost Solana blockchain as its infrastructure. The project‚Äôs overall aim is‚Äîto put it in a nice, neat package‚Äîto develop a decentralized AI network that can and will scale infinitely, providing powerful, private AI solutions that, as one wouldn‚Äôt necessarily expect from an AI project, are also privacy-preserving. Binance Alpha Spotlight Boosts $DARK‚Äôs Visibility Having its $DARK included in the Binance Alpha Spotlight has had an immediate impact on the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price and market valuation. Binance Alpha is a platform casting light on those (often nascent) projects it deems innovative and of promise. Being mentioned in the same breath as this behemoth crypto exchange and its associated trading platform gives $DARK an audience with one of the largest and most active crypto communities in the world. After the announcement, the price of $DARK skyrocketed by more than 50% in a mere 24 hours, vaulting its market cap to over $30 million. This jump sharpens our focus on the ability of smart exchanges to take relatively obscure projects and shine a light on them, giving those projects a real shot at prominence. When a token gets on the radar of Binance, for instance, the whole crypto space looks up and takes notice. Whale Interest and Growing Market Confidence One of the key drivers behind the recent surge in $DARK‚Äôs price is the growing interest from whales, particularly those active in the Solana ecosystem. According to market data from GMGN, the largest holder of $DARK, identified as EEx9rj‚Ä¶NNLzXd, currently holds 2.45% of the total supply, with profits exceeding $700,000. This significant stake in $DARK underscores the confidence that major investors have in the project‚Äôs future. One of the biggest whales in Solana has been steadily DCAing into $DARK, almost undetected. This whale divvied out a sum of $117.81K worth of $Fartcoin‚Äîa Solana-based token‚Äîto obtain more $DARK, which is often renamed as Dark Energy. And as you can notice, this is not a very common sight given that whales tend to operate without such clear signs of intent. But why would this whale pay such a premium, and what could it mean for $DARK? How do we even break this to you guys‚Ä¶ One of the top whales on Solana is quietly DCA‚Äôing into $DARK They deposited $117.81K worth of #fartcoin to stack $DARK . pic.twitter.com/Pl0K5IqQSD ‚Äî Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 17, 2025 The whale‚Äôs choice to pile up $DARK not only adds weight to the ongoing debate around the crypto‚Äôs value, but also sends a clear message to the AI and blockchain world: the whaler sees value in $DARK. Even more encouraging? The whaler thinks it way better to have $DARK than not to have it. And in crypto, that‚Äôs a vote of confidence for a project. Looking Ahead: $DARK‚Äôs Future Prospects With $DARK now securely in the limelight, it‚Äôs primed for perpetual expansion. The onslaught in price and mounting looks from both whales and institutional investors are just a prologue. As this project pushes forward and its AI-powered network really gets rolling, $DARK might well be on its way to becoming a leading player in the decentralized A.I. ecosystem. The platform‚Äôs ongoing development holds the key to $DARK‚Äôs future success. This includes making the current TEEs not just functional but also scalable (something that has already proven a challenge for major cloud providers). It also involves integrating other advanced AI technologies, of which there are many, with the potential for enormous impact. Yet such development work is not enough in and of itself. Beyond the actual tech, the question of how many partnerships get forged, and with whom, looms large. $DARK will thrive if and only if many partners, particularly in the blockchain space, adopt its tech. Currently, being highlighted in the Binance Alpha Spotlight is a major leap for $DARK, thrusting it into the very heart of not just crypto, but the altcoin mainstream‚Äîas evidenced by the Bitcoin pullback last September. Binance is indeed the largest exchange in the world by trading volume, and those millions of eyes seeing $DARK are sure to get attention. $DARK becomes one of the standout tokens in the Solana ecosystem, at least by public perception‚Äîwhether it can maintain its newfound relevance and deliver on its promises.

After imposing a 10% tax on crypto withdrawals in 2023, the country‚Äôs Finance Ministry has now suggested a new law to add a 25% tax on crypto trading gains. If the bill gets passed, the law will begin on January 1, 2026. Some experts warn that high taxes might scare off investors, which could slow down crypto growth in Slovenia. Who Will Be Taxed & How? Under the new law , Slovenian residents will be taxed 25% on net gains from crypto when: They sell cryptocurrency in exchange for fiat currency (e.g., euros or dollars) They use crypto to pay for goods or services They send crypto to another person‚Äôs wallet (excluding transfers between personal wallets), whether as a gift or payment This shift marks a significant expansion in how Slovenia treats crypto transactions for tax purposes. Who‚Äôs Exempt from This Tax? Not all crypto activity will be taxed. The proposed law clearly outlines exceptions: Crypto-to-crypto exchanges (e.g., Bitcoin to Ethereum) are not subject to tax. Transfers between your own wallets remain tax-free. Holding crypto without selling or spending does not trigger taxation. In addition, individuals will be required to report annual crypto earnings and maintain accurate transaction records , a step toward greater transparency. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Regulations in Slovenia 2025 , Lawmaker Warns of Negative Impact However, not everyone agrees with the new plan. Jernej Vrtovec, a member of the opposition New Slovenia party, criticized the proposal . He said that heavy taxation could harm Slovenia‚Äôs growing crypto sector and drive young talent and investors out of the country. He believes the government should encourage innovation, not push it away with high taxes. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Klemen Bo≈°tjanƒçiƒç said the goal of the tax isn‚Äôt just to collect more money but to bring fairness to the system. He pointed out that crypto is one of the most speculative financial assets and believes it‚Äôs only fair to apply tax rules similar to those for other investments. How Big Is the Crypto Market in Slovenia? With an estimated 98,000 crypto users expected in 2025 and a growing market projected to bring in $2.8 million in revenue, Slovenia‚Äôs crypto scene is still developing. The government believes this new tax could generate between ‚Ç¨2.5 million to ‚Ç¨25 million a year, depending on how active the market becomes. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a direct response to Pump.fun, Raydium has delivered a platform that has elevated functionality, flexibility, and full control for developers looking to launch their tokens on the Solana blockchain. A suite of features designed to perfect the launch process constitutes a substantial move from Raydium to take the lead on the Solana network and redefine how decentralized tokens are created and launched. Introducing LaunchLab, Raydium's all-in-one token launchpad. Built for Creators, Developers, and the Community https://t.co/yZVzShVZSJ More info pic.twitter.com/r6s1DAegWf ‚Äî Raydium (@RaydiumProtocol) April 16, 2025 The step is taken not long after the Raydium team had a parting of ways with Pump.fun, which has since caused a bit of an uproar in the Solana community. LaunchLab is being opened as a strategic countermeasure, an answer to the development of something like, well, Pump.fun. What is LaunchLab? LaunchLab is an all-in-one token launchpad that gives developers total autonomy and control over their token launches. The platform provides a smooth and efficient way to create a token, manage its supply, and control things like bonding curves and vesting schedules. LaunchLab comes packed with several other features that make the token launch process even more efficient and accessible, positioning it as the platform developers turn to when they need a comprehensive solution. A key thing about LaunchLab is that it lets you create tokens on the fly. If you ever need to whip up a token and distribute it to the public really fast, that‚Äôs your option! LaunchLab will even take care of some of the initial liquidity for you, so there‚Äôs no way the token you‚Äôre launching can avoid getting traded unless people just don‚Äôt want to trade it. And did I mention that you can do all of this without paying a migration fee, since that‚Äôs a thing that some token creators really appreciate? Enhanced Features for Developers LaunchLab goes beyond basic token creation and provides a variety of advanced features that are designed to support the long-term growth and sustainability of tokens launched on the platform. These features include the following: ‚Äì Vesting schedules ‚Äì LP (Liquidity Pool) locks ‚Äì Fee-sharing models ‚Äì A referral program that can incentivize wider community engagement. Developers now possess the capacity to craft bonding curves exactly to their liking. This allows for the establishment of evolved token price points during the launch process, which gives developers a chance to flex when and where they want the token‚Äôs price to go up or down. This price might be conditioned on how much you; or, say, the community, wants it to go up or down, which is, after all, how markets work. Evolved price points and flexing aside, another upshot of bonding curves is that they can function as templates for different sorts of basic tokenomics. They tell you what sorts of things have to happen (or not happen) if the price of a token is reliably going to evolve in a certain way. The LP locks feature on the platform allows for liquidity to be secured, which is absolutely fundamental for ensuring the emergent stability of new tokens and their successful launch. LaunchLab comes pre-installed with a model for generating fees. Raydium‚Äôs $RAY Token Surges Along with the launch of LaunchLab, Raydium‚Äôs native token, $RAY, has experienced a very pronounced upward movement, increasing in value by almost 9% in the past 24 hours. This increase in price above the $RAY formerly occupied (a price point established before the much-ballyhooed split from Pump.fun) is a good signal that the community is reacting positively to Raydium‚Äôs new initiative. The recovery of $RAY‚Äôs value comes as a result of the launch of LaunchLab, which has captured the attention of developers and investors alike. As more tokens are created and launched on the platform, the demand for $RAY is expected to increase, further contributing to its price appreciation. @RaydiumProtocol just clapped back at @pumpdotfun with the launch of a more advanced token launchpad, LaunchLab. This new platform gives full control over supply, bonding curves, and vesting. It even allows devs to build their own apps. $RAY token is up almost 9% in 24h,‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/Qvpq87Gnyh ‚Äî Sad Creator (@SadCreatorTalks) April 17, 2025 The Road Ahead for Raydium and LaunchLab By launching LaunchLab, Raydium now finds itself in the emergence of the leader of the Solana ecosystem. Raydium spat out the LaunchLab, now getting the developers the token and maintaining key control around that token. Laudably, LaunchLab is not a one-off; future features are to be expected as part of the natural evolution of its platform. But for now, what is LaunchLab? The advanced features of the launchpad combined with Raydium‚Äôs presence in the Solana ecosystem make it an appealing choice for developers looking to launch their tokens on a secure, efficient platform with much community engagement. As more projects come to LaunchLab, we could see growth in Raydium‚Äôs $RAY token, and we could see the launchpad becoming a key part of the DeFi ecosystem on Solana. The launchpad competition is getting strong, but Raydium‚Äôs LaunchLab is a sturdy foundation, positioning the platform for what we think is long-term success in the still-developing world of decentralized finance and blockchain technology.

The proposed legislation ‚Äôs main purpose is to ensure greater fairness in the taxation of investment income among Slovenian citizens. The draft legislation changes things As things stand, individuals trading crypto benefit from a tax advantage while traditional investments are greatly exposed, a phenomenon the government now seeks to balance. Under the draft legislation , profits realized from converting crypto into fiat currency, such as euros, or using crypto to pay for goods and services would be taxed. However, the exchange of one crypto asset for another would remain tax-free. The new laws would require taxpayers to maintain detailed transaction records and file annual tax returns by March 31 for the previous year. Meanwhile, merchants accepting over ‚Ç¨500 in crypto must report these transactions. Central bank digital currencies, electronic money, security tokens, and NFTs are excluded from the new tax framework. The law follows definitions introduced under the EU‚Äôs MiCA regulation and OECD‚Äôs CARF framework. To make the transition easier on all participants, all crypto assets held before 2026 will be ‚Äúreset‚Äù and acquisition cost would be set at fair market value on January 1, 2026. Aside from aligning Slovenia‚Äôs tax treatment of crypto with traditional investments, the measure is considered necessary given the growing role of crypto assets and the push for global transparency standards. There is also all the revenue the new tax has the potential of generating. In fact, according to the finance ministry, the new tax could bring in between ‚Ç¨2.5 million and ‚Ç¨25 million in annual revenue. The Slovenian Finance Ministry has asked for public feedback on the proposed tax regime, which is expected to take effect January 1, 2026, pending parliamentary approval with public comments on the proposal due by May 5. Is Slovenia still a crypto tax haven? In the past, many investors considered Slovenia a choice destination because of its tax regime, which stated that for cryptocurrencies traded outside of a permanent business activity, the capital gains from their trade will not be subject to any capital gains tax. Even before the proposal of the 25% tax on crypto profits, there were complaints about the ambiguity of the laws. After all, in Slovenia, there are no clear guidelines as to the meaning of a ‚Äúpermanent business activity‚Äù. This means the Financial Administration of the Republic of Slovenia (FURS) has a sole discretion in determining whether or not a trader is engaged in a permanent trading business activity. The lack of legal certainty was of course not enough to dissuade some investors from taking advantage of what Slovenia‚Äôs tax regime offered. However, even that advantage is about to be stripped away. The current proposal will now make crypto traded by personal investors subject to a 25% tax, which means the government takes a huge chunk out of traders‚Äô money either way, leading to serious deliberations about Slovenia‚Äôs status as a crypto tax haven.

43474247,https://nulltx.com/?p=148081,1744952171,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Smart Money Moves: On-Chain Activity Reveals Shifting Dynamics in the Memecoin Market,https://nulltx.com/smart-money-moves-on-chain-activity-reveals-shifting-dynamics-in-the-memecoin-market/,"The memecoin market showed a clear trend of net inflows, which reveals investor confidence or interest in several of the tokens we would call memecoins. In our last report, we signaled the potential emergence of a couple of these rising tokens as new plays to keep an eye on, even as the market remains volatile. Capital flows seem to be shifting towards these newer plays and away from supposedly more established first-generation memecoins. The market overall experienced an influx of $5.29 million, which exceeded the outflows that totaled $4.37 million. This produced a net positive amount of $928,000. While this net figure has not knocked anyone off their feet, it certainly signifies something: the savvy traders and institutional wallets that track the movement of memecoins are doing so with bullish eyes. FARTCOIN Dominates Inflows While JLP Sees Major Exit Attracting the most inflows was the humorously named but surprisingly dominant memecoin, FARTCOIN, which pulled in a staggering $3.18 million in new capital. Riding a wave of social media buzz and meme-driven hype, the token now finds itself in the spotlight as smart money seems to be betting on its continued virality and liquidity growth. Other memecoins that captured interest included POPCAT, which saw a healthy $322,000 coming in. Its memetic roots and loyal community base seem to be gaining traction once again. PNUT, another playful prescaler of the memecoin scene, followed close behind with $189,000 in new investment, suggesting that some opportunistic holders might be accumulating it in anticipation of future gains. Meanwhile, BONK and WEN must have been attracting some smart money, because they collectively saw $176,000 in new investment over the same period. That suggests there might be some slow, steady buying interest in the prescaler‚Äôs Prescale Toolbox. Conversely, a number of prominent tokens recorded sizable capital exits, which may suggest that profit-takers are at work or investors are reallocating funds to fresh opportunities. WIF, a previously popular token, saw $520,000 head for the exits, which may signal either a fading interest from short-term traders or an expiration of WIF‚Äôs recent transitory uptrend. Recap: Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 16/04/25 Yesterday, there was more inflow than outflow Inflow: $5.29M Outflow: $4.37M Volume: $9.66M Net Volume: $928K There was inflow into: $WEN ($84K) $POPCAT ($322K) $PNUT ($189K) #FARTCOIN ($3.18M) $BONK ‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/1URWhXBbe1 ‚Äî Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 17, 2025 The largest outflow came from JLP, which saw an immense $2.01 million capital leave its ecosystem. This could indicate that large holders are reallocating their funds to trendier plays, or it could just be that they are realizing some gains. JUP had the next largest outflow at $123K, followed by ALCH at $101K and RFC at $161K. It appears that each of these was reacting to some recent price action. Market Sentiment and Rotation Strategy The signal volume figure of $928,000 carries cautious optimism for the market. Although the total volume traded was $9.66 million, only a small part of that resulted in net positive inflow. All of that shows that buying interest is present, but much of the balance is upheld by outflows ‚Äî the surest sign of a maturing market. Because speculative interests are always balanced by anti-speculative interests, this market must be seen as highly speculative. The shift in capital from relatively larger tokens such as JLP and WIF to newer or resurgent memecoins like FARTCOIN and POPCAT is intriguing. It‚Äôs a common strategy among smart money participants, where funds are relocated from positions that have either peaked or stabilized into tokens viewed as having higher upside potential or that are entering a new hype cycle. Although this activity doesn‚Äôt forecast long-term trends, it does show where capital flows in the short term. Particular attention to FARTCOIN could lead to increased retail participation, especially if the meme becomes a movement and volumes rise considerably. As always, investors are advised to exercise caution ‚Äî the memecoin market is notoriously volatile and very much driven by sentiment and not by fundamentals. But the actions of some very intelligent participants on April 16 provide a rare, almost voyeuristic view into the next moves too many are making in an effort to try and front-run the next memecoin wave. Despite the overlying presence of meme tokens and their attendant liquidity, there is market action that cannot be denied. A good case can be made that crypto is at a crossroads right now, with the meme-fueled section of the industry serving as much more than a bubble waiting to be burst. Still, it also must be said that action in this part of the market is as hard to call right now as it is to avoid any allure for getting involved.

The first hackathon featured 13 winning projects that showcased a variety of ways to use artificial intelligence to make blockchain technology stronger and smarter. Now, those 13 projects will receive funding and mentorship aimed at making their prototypes suitable for the real world. BNB Chain is increasingly committed to integrating AI with Web3 technologies. This promise was underscored recently by the hackathon held in Paris, where AI-powered wins were celebrated. BNB Chain‚Äôs hackathons have been fruitful in the past in showcasing how decentralized ecosystems can exist and thrive. Now, they are also a vehicle to explore the potential of powerful computational tools like AI, which is making waves across many industries, from finance to entertainment. If nothing else, this promises to be fun and comic-worthy. 13 Standout Projects Selected for Funding and Growth The winning projects from the first quarter show both creative diversity and strong, technical foundations. The 13 selected entries are: BINK AI, Botzilla, Tutorial Agent, Tokrio, Polycruz, WORLD3 Protocol, Sentism AI, iDos Games, Boomie, VitaminAI, Stitch AI, Tearline, and Kudo. Each of these startups brings a distinctive application of AI to the blockchain space ‚Äî from AI-enhanced gaming experiences to data-driven DeFi tools and autonomous agents whose mission is to improve user onboarding and education. All projects that win will obtain a starting fund of $50,000, given in the form of what the BNB Chain calls a Kickstart package. Beyond that financial support, though, the projects and their teams will benefit immensely from being a part of something called the MVB, or Most Valuable Builder, program. This is an incubator of sorts that provides mentoring, technical assistance, help with marketing, and a way for the teams to connect with potential investors and other entrepreneurs in the BNB ecosystem. This twofold provision of financial and strategic backing aims to shorten the interval from the birth of an idea to its actual appearance in the marketplace. It seeks to assist nascent teams in transforming their thoughts into products that are not only sustainable but also scalable. BNB AI Hack, launched by BNB Chain, has produced 13 winning projects in its first quarter, including BINK AI, Botzilla, Tutorial Agent, Tokrio, Polycruz, WORLD3 Protocol, Sentism AI, iDos Games, Boomie, VitaminAI, Stitch AI, Tearline, and Kudo. Winning projects are awarded‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 17, 2025 Tiered Rewards System Encourages Iteration and Growth The BNB AI Hack is not a one-time event. Rather, it uses a tiered system to grant increasing rewards and recognition to teams that iterate on and improve their hackathon projects after the event has concluded. In this way, it encourages teams to continue working on their projects beyond the confines of the hackathon. The event has three tiers, with different awards and recognitions at each tier. Projects attaining Tier 1 are awarded a $10,000 cash prize, admission to the BNB Incubation Alliance demo showcase, and the opportunity to be interviewed for the MVB Inc. They receive the full $50,000 Kickstart funding package and much-needed marketing exposure. Prizes and perks The prizes will be awarded in 3 tiers: Tier 1 $10k in cash rewards MVB interview opportunities BIA demo entry Kickstart funding (worth $50k) Marketing exposure Tier 2 $7k in cash rewards Kickstart package (worth $50k) Marketing exposure‚Ä¶ ‚Äî BNB Chain Developers (@BNBChainDevs) February 12, 2025 Projects allocated to Tier 2 are provided with a cash award of $7,000. They also receive a $50,000 Kickstart package and promotional support. For recipients assigned to Tier 3, they are awarded $3,000 in cash, in addition to the Kickstart funding and marketing support. The structure is interesting because it allows for flexibility. Projects are not limited to just one tier ‚Äî and, as teams continue to build, iterate, and grow their solutions, they can progress through the tiers. Each tier above the first unlocks further benefits, almost as if going up the scale of a rewards program. The shape of the structure is still evolving, but its current state offers teams a wonderful opportunity to engage in that next level of ideation. After all, with the right support, an idea can move past the initial submission stage and forward into the world of product development and investment, finding its way into the BNB Chain ecosystem. BNB Chain‚Äôs Strategic Push into AI and Web3 Integration The BNB AI Hack is part of a larger strategy from BNB Chain to blend new technologies‚Äîlike AI‚Äîwith the scalability and transparency of blockchain infrastructure. Startups working at this intersection are increasingly getting attention from venture capitalists. So BNB Chain is inking partnerships with the likes of Fireblocks and Chainlink to help developers build these future applications. The 13 winning projects are equipped with funding, incubator access, and marketing support. They are well-placed to push forward innovations in a space that is still very young. From AI tutoring agents to autonomous gaming environments, the diversity of concepts that these projects represent highlights just some of the frankly limitless ways that AI can enrich the blockchain space. As these initiatives develop and more hackathon seasons take place, BNB Chain‚Äôs initiative is likely to become an essential launchpad for next-generation AI x Web3 companies ‚Äî reiterating its place in my mind‚Äôs eye as a crypto innovation hub.

CoinDesk reported Friday that the downsizing affects ‚Äúhundreds of staffers.‚Äù The move follows a 15% workforce cut in October , which included the departure of key executives and a broader restructuring of internal teams. At the time, Kraken laid off 400 employees, including chief operating officer Gilles BianRosa and chief technology officer Vishnu Patankar. The company simultaneously appointed veteran tech investor Arjun Sethi as co-chief executive alongside Dave Ripley. In preparation for its U.S. IPO, Kraken has laid off hundreds of employees across various business units over the past few months as part of ongoing organizational streamlining. Last October, the company cut 400 jobs, representing approximately 15% of its workforce. Sources‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 18, 2025 Ripley took over as CEO in 2023 after founder Jesse Powell stepped down amid tensions with employees over company culture and leadership style. Kraken‚Äôs Restructuring Continues Under New Leadership Since Sethi joined the top ranks, the company has reportedly continued letting go of staff in waves, according to a report by CoinDesk. The exact number of recent job cuts has not been confirmed, but insiders described an ongoing ‚Äúrolling program‚Äù of layoffs. Despite the cuts, Kraken is said to be hiring selectively in areas viewed as critical to its future roadmap. The company has not issued a public statement addressing the latest restructuring and did not respond to Cryptonews‚Äô request for comment by press time. Kraken Renews IPO Push as Political Winds Shift in Washington Kraken has long eyed the public markets, but regulatory uncertainty under the Biden administration delayed earlier plans. Kraken‚Äôs operational tightening comes as it explores new fundraising efforts. The firm is reportedly in early talks to raise up to $1b in debt . Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are said to be leading the discussions. According to Bloomberg, a public listing could happen as early as the first quarter of 2025 . With Donald Trump back in office and promising a more business-friendly stance on digital assets, some in the industry now see a clearer runway for IPOs that were previously on hold.

Referencing how Wall Street responds to transparency, he suggested that if Ripple goes public, XRP could move beyond being seen as just a cryptocurrency and become a regulated bridge currency backed by a public company. The possibility of a Ripple IPO has been discussed for years. However, in early 2024, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated the company had no plans to pursue one due to regulatory uncertainty . Now, with the calendar deep into 2025 and the SEC lawsuit against Ripple concluded, market watchers are again focused on the potential of a public offering. A Shift Toward Regulatory Legitimacy The resolution of the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit removed a major legal obstacle for the company. With that behind them, the path to an IPO appears clearer than any recent memory. Should Ripple proceed with an IPO, it would be required to meet the rigorous financial and disclosure standards expected of any publicly traded company. This shift could bring institutional clarity that has been lacking since its inception. A Ripple IPO would mean open financial books and public scrutiny, which could reinforce confidence in the company‚Äôs long-term plans for XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If the digital asset is viewed as a bridge currency supported by a regulated and transparent firm, its market perception may shift. For institutions, this added legitimacy may translate into reduced risk concerns. Re-engaging Investors and Boosting Market Confidence According to All Things XRP, a Ripple IPO would provide legitimacy and energize market participants. Some experts believe Ripple could have the largest IPO in history , and All Things XRP believes it will re-energize speculators and draw interest from institutions. The broader transparency that comes from an IPO could also lead to significant capital inflows. As a public company, Ripple would also be better positioned to form strategic partnerships, scale its enterprise solutions, and expand XRP use cases. Each of these developments would likely directly impact XRP‚Äôs valuation. According to All Things XRP, ‚ÄúIf Ripple lists, XRP doesn‚Äôt just go up‚Ä¶ it graduates.‚Äù While there is still no official confirmation from the company, the groundwork appears more solid than in previous years. If Ripple does choose to go public, XRP could benefit substantially. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

33767162,[object Object],1744952456,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Dogecoin Price Forms Symmetrical Triangle, Falling Wedge Breakout Begins From Oversold Zone",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-oversold-zone-breakout/,"Dogecoin‚Äôs latest price formations suggest that an early-stage recovery might be underway, supported by signals on both short-term and mid-term timeframes. A close look at the chart activity shows technical setups that has historically led to strong breakouts . The observations come from crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade, who recently shared two updates based on patterns forming on the 1-hour and 4-hour candlestick charts. Symmetrical Triangle Builds Quiet Momentum on 4-Hour Chart Trader Tardigrade highlighted a symmetrical triangle forming on the 4-hour timeframe, with Dogecoin‚Äôs price gradually narrowing into the apex of the structure. While the movement appears indecisive on the surface, symmetrical triangles a re known for building quiet volatility. In the case of Dogecoin, this symmetrical triangle has been playing out since April 8, and recently bounced off the lower trendline. According to the analyst, the longer the price continues to consolidate inside this triangle, the more momentum builds for an eventual breakout. If confirmed, this could mark the beginning of a sustained rally. Falling Wedge Breakout And RSI Point To Positivity On 1-Hour Timeframe As Dogecoin continues to trade in the symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour timeframe with the hopes of an upward breakout, another interesting price action is playing out on the daily candlestick timeframe chart. The focus shifts to the lower timeframe, where crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade identified a falling wedge breakout on the 1-hour chart in another analysis. More interestingly, the wedge breakout move coincided with a recovery from the oversold zone on the RSI indicator. Falling wedges often serve as bullish reversal indicators, and the breakout from this formation is one of the first signs that Dogecoin might be preparing for a broader trend shift. The broader trend has been a bearish one for the past six weeks or so, and a trend shift will be a change into bullish momentum. The RSI bouncing from the oversold level further supports the case for growing bullish strength in the short term, although trading volume is still subdued for now. Despite these promising price pattern, there is still a need for bullish confirmations. The symmetrical triangle‚Äôs upper boundary will need to be broken with a strong candlestick close and accompanying volume for the bullish case to take full shape. Speaking of trading volumes, trading volume is one of the means of confirming the strength of a breakout. A huge trading volume contributes to the prospect of a strong upside move. However, this wedge breakout hasn‚Äôt been accompanied by a strong surge trading volume, although the price action has increased by a few percentage points. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1557, up by 1.3% in the past 24 hours. Trading volume, on the other hand, is down by 4.7% in the same timeframe, coming out to $745 million.",Altcoins|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Falling Wedge Pattern|Oversold Zone|relative strength index|RSI|Symmetrical Triangle|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-18 05:00:56
43474393,https://cryptonews.com/?p=352716,1744952482,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/43474393.jpeg,Slovenia Proposes 25% Tax on Crypto Profits in New Draft Law,https://cryptonews.com/news/slovenia-proposes-25-tax-on-crypto-profits-in-new-draft-law/,"Slovenia‚Äôs Finance Ministry has introduced a draft law that would impose a 25% tax on profits from crypto trading for residents, marking a significant shift in the country‚Äôs approach to digital asset regulation. The proposal, which was made public on April 17, is now open for public consultation until May 5. Under the draft law, the tax would apply when crypto assets are sold for fiat currency or used to purchase goods and services. Crypto Wallet Transfers by Same Owner to Remain Exempt Under New Rules However, crypto-to-crypto transactions and transfers between wallets owned by the same individual would be exempt. The Finance Ministry stated that the new tax would align with existing tax policies, requiring taxpayers to track all their transactions and report them in annual returns. Profits would be calculated by subtracting the purchase price from the sale price. Finance Minister Klemen Bo≈°tjanƒçiƒç defended the proposal, stating that it was unreasonable for one of the most speculative financial instruments to remain untaxed. ‚ÄúThe goal is not necessarily to increase revenue but to ensure fairness in the tax system,‚Äù he said in a statement to the Slovenia Times . ‚ÄúCrypto assets should not be treated differently from other forms of investment.‚Äù However, the draft has already met with criticism from opposition lawmakers. Jernej Vrtovec, a member of the National Assembly and the New Slovenia opposition party, argued that the proposal could undermine Slovenia‚Äôs potential to become a crypto-friendly nation. ‚ÄúWith excessive taxation, we will once again see young people and capital fleeing abroad,‚Äù Vrtovec posted on X. ‚ÄúTaxes should encourage innovation, not suppress it.‚Äù Spet brez obƒçutka! Slovenija ima prilo≈ænost postati kripto prijazna dr≈æava, ampak z vladnimi predlogi bomo spet zamudili vlak. S previsoko obdavƒçitvijo bomo spet gledali, kako mladi in kapital be≈æijo v tujino. Davki naj spodbujajo, ne du≈°ijo! https://t.co/dN1fOEcSuU ‚Äî Jernej Vrtovec (@JernejVrtovec) April 17, 2025 If passed, the law would take effect on January 1, 2026. Slovenia currently imposes a 10% tax on crypto withdrawals and payments, but profits from casual trading are untaxed unless deemed part of business activity. Mining and staking profits are already subject to income tax, while personal crypto activities classified as a hobby remain exempt. A previous attempt to tax crypto in April 2022 proposed a 5% levy on annual profits exceeding ‚Ç¨10,000 ($11,372), but it failed to advance. Slovenia Leads EU with First Blockchain-Based Sovereign Bond in 2023 Meanwhile, Slovenia continues to play a notable role in digital finance, having issued the EU‚Äôs first blockchain-based sovereign bond in 2023. According to Statista , Slovenia is expected to have around 98,000 crypto users by 2025, representing 4.6% of its population, with projected market revenue reaching $2.8 million. Last year, Slovenia became the first member of the European Union to issue a sovereign digital bond. The issuance involved a 30 million euro note, worth around $32.5 million, which offers a 3.65% coupon. The bond was settled on-chain through the Bank of France‚Äôs tokenized cash system.

43474385,https://nulltx.com/?p=148083,1744952519,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Smart Money Wallets Show Targeted Accumulation in AI, DeFi, and Meme Sectors",https://nulltx.com/smart-money-wallets-show-targeted-accumulation-in-ai-defi-and-meme-sectors/,"In the last 24 hours, on-chain data has shown a concentrated accumulation of assets by smart money wallets. These wallets have been making a series of directed purchases across three main crypto narratives: AI and robotics; DeFi and staking; and gaming assets correlated with memes. This wave of accumulation shows how influential crypto wallets are positioning themselves within the narrative economy. The information available suggests that 19 wallets, all monitored as ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù based on historical trading results and wallet actions, made significant accumulations in certain sectors. The first area provoked an obvious response from these wallets: AI and robotics. Those niches attracted eight wallets. Accumulations in DeFi and staking next caught the attention of six wallets. Finally, the five wallets that collectively added to the totals across the meme and gaming category rounded out the big moves in these sectors. AI Projects Draw Attention with Context-Aware Tech The artificial intelligence sector keeps capturing investor interest, particularly as crypto projects start to incorporate actual AI capabilities. One prime example is AGiXT, a project that has been steadily gaining traction due to its aim of deploying AI agents with real-world, memories that are contextually aware. In the last day, a prominent smart money wallet picked up AGiXT tokens to the tune of $49,000, signaling that institutional players are taking a closer look at the token. AGiXT presently has a market cap of $10.2 million, making it a play on a relatively small market with the potential for big upside if the AI Web3 utilities it provides gain traction across the mainstream. The accumulation of this token by experienced wallets suggests confidence in the long-term viability of the kind of AI integrations that go to memory and personalization and beyond the next big thing. I mean, how many industries can you name that already have chatbots? DeFi and Staking Revive Interest Through Maple‚Äôs SYRUP Token Within the decentralized finance and staking category, Maple Finance has caused quite a stir with its recent unveiling of the new token, SYRUP. The altcoin was designed to underpin the next layer of staking to be deployed within Maple‚Äôs lending ecosystem, and it did net Maple $47,000 in accumulation from a single smart money wallet. What sort of market cap does SYRUP have? Well, at the moment, it boasts a healthy $128.9 million. So, just where does SYRUP slot within the DeFi landscape? The DeFi project Maple Finance is slowly but surely gaining traction in the decentralized finance market, and this latest interest could stem from its upgraded staking mechanics or possibly its upcoming governance functions tied to SYRUP. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: AI & Robotics (8 wallets) DeFi & Staking (6 wallets) Meme & Gaming (5 wallets) Top accumulations and reasoning: $AGiXT -> @AGI_XT is gaining traction with its AI agents‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/QKS6vnqtBp ‚Äî CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) April 17, 2025 Carried by what is almost assuredly a smart-money crowd, this accumulation is looking less like a speculative pump and more like a bet on Maple‚Äôs evolving roadmap. Memes Still Rule: Italianrot Sees Multi-Wallet Accumulation Expectation-defying meme coins continue to draw serious capital, especially when viral, community-driven campaigns boost their visibility. The latest example: Italianrot, a meme token whose profile has recently soared thanks to a very bold x100 call by the prominent influencer account Milagrosdegencalls. The day‚Äôs most widespread wallet accumulation came from Italianrot, where five smart money wallets collected a total of $67,000 in tokens. Despite having a market cap of only $6 million, and being a low-cap, high-risk bet, Italianrot seems to have struck a chord with some seasoned investors looking to ride the next token viral cycle. The accumulation here may also reflect an understanding of the memecoin playbook: get in early, follow community sentiment, and ride the wave before retail FOMO kicks in. Emerging Narratives Signal Strategic Positioning What‚Äôs most telling about this latest spurt of activity is how varied the accumulation patterns are. AI and robotics present a future-forward narrative with actual tech applications. Meanwhile, DeFi draws steady interest as protocols innovate around yield and staking. And meme tokens remain a play for explosive ‚Äî if risky ‚Äî gains, driven by community fervor and social media. The distribution of investment across these areas demonstrates that savvy investors are not tied to a single strategy. Instead, these portfolios seem to be betting across various high-upside narratives, blending faith in technology with good old-fashioned momentum plays. As these projects keep on moving like they always have in the past, there‚Äôs no reason to think they won‚Äôt keep on gathering traction. This raises the question of whether the smart money will flow in behind them. The possibility exists that retail traders will once again find themselves behind the eight ball, chasing the moves made by their more expedient predecessors ‚Äî the so-called early movers.

Yet, the currents of this marketplace are subtly shifting, starting to reveal initial signs of investor caution and hesitance that could foreshadow a forthcoming period of Bitcoin price stagnation. Current inflows of capital still appear healthy, but the rate of growth has almost halved, leading some to question just how much longer this price rally can keep going. #Bitcoin ‚Äôs realized cap has reached an all-time high of $872B, yet monthly growth has slowed to +0.9%. This indicates that while capital inflows remain positive, investor appetite is softening ‚Äì signaling continued risk-off sentiment. pic.twitter.com/XBgZP7NoWo ‚Äî glassnode (@glassnode) April 17, 2025 In the past month, Bitcoin‚Äôs realized market cap has only grown by 0.9%. This tepid growth reflects a subtle but significant shift in sentiment among the digital currency‚Äôs holders: while new money continues to enter the market and push prices ever upward, the enthusiasm that once propelled Bitcoin higher seems to be waning. Such a slowdown often signals a ‚Äúrisk-off‚Äù environment, where investors reduce their exposure to unstable, wild assets in favor of something more solid and safe. Investor Behavior Suggests Market Saturation One of the clearest indicators of this shift comes from Bitcoin‚Äôs Realized Profit and Loss, which, when adjusted for volatility, now shows a balance that‚Äôs nearly even. This equilibrium suggests a period of saturation, where neither buyers nor sellers appear to hold an outstanding advantage. In past market cycles, we‚Äôve often seen the periods like this precede a phase of price consolidation. Another crucial metric adds to the saturation: the volatility-adjusted net realized profit and loss for Bitcoin. This gauge has returned to the long-term median, a level that historically separates bullish from bearish realms. When the market hangs around this median, it often indicates a lack of clarity about the continuation or the reversal of the current trend. In this instance, it seems to represent that Bitcoin is at a make-or-break moment, hanging between two adjacent possible states: either a swing back to the strong uptrend that‚Äôs been interrupted or a deep dive. Indicators based on equilibrium are somewhat ignored, compared to the immediate price actions we see. But I trust them over long timeframes so much that I consider them valuable indicators of the market‚Äôs health. Taken together, these equilibrium-based tools are suggesting that Bitcoin is not in a state of emergency. Instead, it‚Äôs in one of those moments that happen from time to time, where indecision runs rampant and the market sits still, waiting for a news event or some other catalyst to spark action. ETF Outflows Add to Uncertainty Recent developments in institutional investment flows add to the market tension. On April 16, U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net outflow of $170 million. The most significant withdrawal came from Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC, which alone accounted for $114 million in outflows. These numbers highlight a broader trend: while ETFs had been seen as a major gateway for institutional capital into the crypto market, their recent performance indicates that even larger investors are stepping back to reassess their positions. Subsequently, this has and could continue to negatively affect the price of Bitcoin. On April 16, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net outflow of $170 million, with Fidelity's FBTC leading the outflows at $114 million. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net outflow of $12.0062 million, marking the seventh consecutive day of outflows. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 17, 2025 ETF flows are often seen as a stand-in for institutional sentiment. While sustained outflows might not crash the market immediately, they can exert downward pressure on momentum and limit upside potential. In this instance, a big outflow from a major ETF issuer like Fidelity suggests that institutional players are taking a more defensive posture, which obviously contributes to a market with a risk-off tone. A Market Poised for a Break‚ÄîBut in Which Direction? Bitcoin, with its cap realized at record highs, and momentum that is softening, is at a crossroads. The metrics are not pointing to an imminent collapse, nor are they indicating that a strong breakout is just around the corner. Instead, what the data is telling us is that the market is caught between bullish conviction and bearish caution. As market participants look for unambiguous signals from the economy or a fundamental change in the flows of capital, Bitcoin might keep moving sideways, consolidating. For now, this market balance is in place, but it won‚Äôt last forever, and historically, when metrics like these align, clear price action tends to follow. Typically, the direction that price action takes after a move like this, either up or down, is contingent on the same kind of external catalysts listed above. At present, Bitcoin is still in a holding pattern, its next move too uncertain to define. But with so many indicators at crucial thresholds, the decision it makes could set the market on a defined path for months to come. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

On-chain data shows that some of the biggest players ‚Äî whales, institutional entities, and even some early participants of the ICO ‚Äî have really stepped up their selling over the past week. Combined with price dips, we now see some previously dormant accounts stirring back to life. And despite all the optimism around the ETH upgrade, the Ethereum-focused ETFs are seeing capital flight. Altogether, this paints a pretty cautious-looking picture for market sentiment around Ethereum. In the past week, Ethereum whales have altogether gotten rid of about 143,000 ETH. This has been happening, and it‚Äôs an increasing trend, in the context of growing uncertainty for traders and holders of ETH. Some of the whale movements we see might just be profit-taking or risk management. But the scale and the timing of these whale actions suggest a much larger shift in sentiment‚Äîone that could significantly impact the direction of the price in the short to medium term. Whales have offloaded 143,000 #Ethereum $ETH over the past week! pic.twitter.com/n8cmwyUpER ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) April 17, 2025 Galaxy Digital Leads Whale Activity with $79M in ETH Deposits A prominent digital asset management firm, Galaxy Digital, which is led by Mike Novogratz, is one of the most noticeable contributors to the surge of ETH transfers lately. On-chain data indicates that G|alaxy deposited 12,181.161 ETH, which is worth around $19.02 million, to Coinbase just eight hours ago, which seems to be taking advantage of a recent price dip. [Update] Galaxy Digital deposited an additional 12,181 $ETH (~$19.02M) to #Coinbase ~8 hours ago, during the dip. This brings their total $ETH moved to CEXs over the past 5 days to 49,681 $ETH (~$79.36M) at an average price of $1,597. Follow @spotonchain for more updates now! https://t.co/iXxCBveTPA pic.twitter.com/fY4JHzCCo8 ‚Äî Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) April 17, 2025 This deposit represents Ethereum sent to centralized exchanges by Galaxy Digital over the last five days to the tune of 49,681 ETH. That translates into approximately $79.36 million worth of deposited Ethereum. Galaxy has now sent nearly 50,000 ETH to CEXs in just half of a week. This average price translates to around $1,597 per ETH. That‚Äôs the same price we see on Coinbase right now. What this signals is anyone‚Äôs guess. Considering Galaxy‚Äôs sway and past of being actively involved in the digital asset market, large transfers like this are hardly ever without meaning. When big deposits hit an exchange, they are usually taken as the sign of something nasty on the way for the price of that asset‚Äînasty, that is, if you‚Äôre long the asset in question. That‚Äôs because big deposits mean big potential sales, and the implication of these potential sales is that the prices of the assets are going to go down. Once again, though, it‚Äôs important to note that correlation is not causation. Dormant Whale Awakens: Ethereum ICO Participant Moves $47.8M After 3 Years What adds even more bearish pressure is the activity from an early Ethereum investor who participated in the project‚Äôs 2015 Initial Coin Offering (ICO). After three years of dormancy, the investor transferred 30,000 ETH ‚Äî worth around $47.85 million ‚Äî out of cold storage. Of that amount, 3,000 ETH, or approximately $4.78 million, was moved to Kraken, a leading U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange. This investor started off with 76,000 ETH at Genesis. They received it during the Ethereum ICO, when the effective cost of that much ETH was just $23,560. That translates to the original purchase price of around $0.31 per ETH, which is kind of astonishing to think about. At current prices, their remaining holdings are still worth more than $121 million. Although just a portion of the shifted ETH has arrived at exchanges, the transfer of these hitherto idle funds usually signals direct sales or liquidation of some kind. Taken with other recent market developments, it made for a suspect scenario: Old wallets were waking up and moving funds, and the market was going down, which also made it somewhat more likely that these old wallets were selling.

On April 16, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs saw net outflows totaling $12 million, which means that for the last seven days, these products have been seeing withdrawals. The spot ETF is supposed to be another flagship product for institutional use. On April 16, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net outflow of $170 million, with Fidelity's FBTC leading the outflows at $114 million. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net outflow of $12.0062 million, marking the seventh consecutive day of outflows. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 17, 2025 The recent trend in ETF inflows and outflows being viewed as a reliable indicator for gauging institutional sentiment around an asset is definitely a departure from what had become the norm for Ethereum this past year. We had seen it become a go-to for inflow-driven sentiment around Ethereum, serving as an almost real-time indicator for how investors were thinking about the protocol. But the lack of capital entering the ecosystem from this source ‚Äî particularly now when other sources of capital seem to be drying up ‚Äî speaks volumes. Market Faces Mounting Uncertainty as Sell-Side Pressure Builds The collective forces of whale selling, reactivated ICO-era wallets, and steady ETF outflows give a rather gloomy market picture for Ethereum at the moment. Even as the price held steady during the last few sell-offs, the combined volumetric pressure of these three detrimental factors emerging at the same time strongly suggests that confidence in the long-term prospects of Ethereum (and, by extension, the Etherean state machine) is deeping along with the price. In less than a week, more than $140 million worth of ETH has been shifted toward potential sales. The market is now in a state of heightened uncertainty. What we may be looking at here is either a deeper-than-expected correction that‚Äôs unfolding in real time or just a temporary shakeout before the ETH price rebounds. This will be determined largely by overarching macro factors, how investors feel about the market, and whether Ethereum can maintain critical support levels in the face of such intense sell pressure.

The billionaire American media mogul filed a counterclaim against Sun on April 16, calling the Tron founder‚Äôs suit a ‚Äúsham‚Äù and adding claims of ‚Äúunethical and/or illegal business activities.‚Äù Sun sued Geffen in February, claiming that the statue was stolen from him by a former employee who then sold the artwork to Geffen in a deal worth around $65 million in artwork and cash. Sun purchased the Alberto Giacometti sculpture titled ‚ÄúLe Nez‚Äù at a Sotheby‚Äôs auction in 2021 for $78 million, working with the assistance of his former art adviser, Xiong Zihan Sydney. In the 100-page countersuit, Geffen claims that Sun and Xiong ‚Äúcontrived this fraudulent lawsuit‚Äù after they couldn‚Äôt profitably sell two paintings that Geffen had exchanged for the sculpture, along with $10.5 million in cash. ‚ÄúSun‚Äôs claims concerning Le Nez, a sculpture by the artist Alberto Giacometti, are utterly without merit and constitute a bad-faith, tortious attempt to interfere with Geffen‚Äôs ownership of Le Nez,‚Äù the counterclaim read. Geffen also claims that Sun was eager to sell the sculpture because crypto markets were crashing throughout 2022 and 2023 and his crypto platforms Poloniex and HTX were repeatedly hacked for hundreds of millions of dollars in 2023. Alberto Giacometti‚Äôs Le Nez. Source: Fondation Giacomett Key disputes include whether Xiong confessed to stealing the sculpture, inconsistencies in Sun‚Äôs claims about how much money Xiong allegedly stole, and Geffen‚Äôs claim that Sun still has the money and the paintings, which are being held by art dealers. Fraudulent behavior allegations Geffen takes things further by alleging Sun has a history of fraudulent behavior, such as being sued by former employees for punishing them for refusing to engage in ‚Äúunethical and/or illegal business activities,‚Äù and making false statements in other lawsuits. Related: Justin Sun ‚Äònot aware‚Äô of circulating reports about CZ plea deal On April 17, Sun‚Äôs lawyer, William Charron, refuted essential aspects of Geffen‚Äôs countersuit, according to ArtNet. Ms. Xiong confessed to her theft, was arrested in China, and is in detention in China today, he said before adding: ‚ÄúIn spite of these facts, Mr. Geffen goes all-in on the idea that Ms. Xiong was not a thief; that she supposedly spoke for Mr. Sun at all times; and that she is walking freely in China today. Mr. Geffen‚Äôs pleading is extremely misguided.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe eagerly look forward to litigating this case and to recovering Mr. Sun‚Äôs property,‚Äù he said. In November, Sun bought Maurizio Cattelan‚Äôs Comedian ‚Äî a banana taped to the wall ‚Äî at Sotheby‚Äôs New York for $6.2 million, and then ate the banana at a press conference in a publicity stunt.

In Wyoming, the state‚Äôs Stable Token Commission is considering language changes to ensure its proposed WYST stablecoin remains outside the SEC‚Äôs definition of a security. Meanwhile, Kyrgyzstan has formally granted legal tender status to its digital som and plans to begin a pilot project later this year, placing the country among a small but growing group of nations moving from research to implementation in central bank digital currency development. Kyrgyzstan Approves CBDC Pilot, Grants Legal Tender Status to Digital Som Kyrgyzstan is stepping firmly into the future of finance with a new constitutional law signed by President Sadyr Zhaparov that authorizes a pilot project for the country‚Äôs central bank digital currency ( CBDC ). The digital version of the national currency ‚Äî the digital som ‚Äî has also been granted legal tender status, signaling a historic shift in the nation‚Äôs monetary policy and digital infrastructure. The legislation, signed into law on April 17, hands the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic exclusive authority over the issuance, regulation, and operation of the digital som. It empowers the central bank to build and oversee the digital currency‚Äôs platform, while laying the foundation for secure implementation and national usage. Though the pilot project is expected to begin later this year, officials have stated that a final decision regarding a full-scale launch will not be made until late 2026. In the meantime, the National Bank will focus on rigorous testing and the development of cryptographic security measures aimed at preventing fraud and ensuring data integrity within the digital ecosystem. Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs foray into digital currency mirrors a broader global trend ‚Äî but also comes with its own strategic motivations. According to the International Energy Agency, Kyrgyzstan has significant untapped hydroelectric potential, with only 10% of its estimated capacity currently in use. This provides a compelling case for a digitally powered economy, particularly one that could intersect with green-friendly crypto mining initiatives. The CBDC pilot is the latest in a series of blockchain-forward developments under Zhaparov‚Äôs administration. Just weeks ago, Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs parliament, the Jogorku Kenesh, approved amendments to the constitutional law that made this CBDC initiative possible. The March 18 vote marked the legal foundation for this transformative move. International Collaboration and Economic Potential The law‚Äôs passage comes amid Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs growing interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain-based innovation. Earlier in April, former Binance CEO Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao signed a memorandum of understanding with the Kyrgyz foreign investment agency, committing to advise the government on crypto and blockchain regulatory frameworks. President Zhaparov praised the partnership. As the country positions itself as a potential hub for blockchain activity, Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs abundance of renewable energy and emerging legal frameworks could attract global interest in both mining operations and crypto-based entrepreneurship. Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs digital som pilot makes it one of over 115 countries exploring central bank digital currencies, according to data from cbdctracker.org. However, only four countries have so far officially launched their CBDCs ‚Äî the Bahamas (Sand Dollar), Nigeria (e-Naira), Zimbabwe (ZiG), and Jamaica (JAM-DEX). The vast majority of CBDC initiatives remain in the research or development phase, with over 90 countries yet to progress to pilot testing or implementation. Balancing Innovation With Caution Despite the optimism surrounding the pilot, the initiative is not without controversy. Many critics within the global cryptocurrency community have flagged CBDCs as a potential threat to financial privacy, raising concerns about state surveillance, centralized control, and reduced anonymity in digital transactions. To address these concerns, the Kyrgyz government is expected to introduce robust privacy protections and user-centric security protocols as part of its phased rollout strategy. Still, the success of the pilot and public adoption may hinge on how effectively these concerns are addressed. With the legal green light now in place, Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs central bank is poised to begin the technical testing of the digital som platform later this year. These trials will focus on evaluating user functionality, security protocols, interoperability with traditional banking systems, and potential use cases for citizens and businesses. If the digital som proves successful during testing, Kyrgyzstan could become one of the first nations in Central Asia to launch a CBDC with legal tender status ‚Äî a move that could reshape financial inclusion, digital commerce, and cross-border transactions in the region. As President Zhaparov continues to align Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs national interests with cutting-edge technology, the country‚Äôs cautious but ambitious approach to digital currency may well set a precedent for other emerging economies looking to navigate the evolving landscape of financial innovation. Wyoming Stable Token Commission Considers Language Tweaks to Align with SEC Stablecoin Guidelines In related news, during an April 17 meeting held in the extension of the Wyoming Capitol building, Commissioner Joel Revill raised the possibility of adopting alternative language in the commission's official communications and documents to better align with the SEC‚Äôs recent guidance on what constitutes a ‚Äúcovered stablecoin.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking to kind of create our own vernacular around some of this,‚Äù said Anthony Apollo, Executive Director of the Wyoming Stable Token Commission. ‚ÄúWe want to clarify our approach internally and use that as a jumping-off point for the commission‚Äôs discussions going forward.‚Äù Apollo noted that although the commission is actively interpreting the SEC‚Äôs evolving stance, any substantial action or clarification would be formally addressed in a memo expected in May. These adjustments come in the wake of the SEC suggesting that some categories of stablecoins could be deemed ‚Äúnon-securities,‚Äù thereby exempting them from stringent disclosure and registration requirements. The proposed WYST token would be pegged 1:1 to the US dollar and redeemable for fiat currency, making it the first stablecoin fully issued and managed by a US state government. Originally slated for a launch in Q1 2025, the stablecoin‚Äôs debut has since been pushed to July 2025, pending further legal and operational refinement. Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon remains a staunch advocate for the initiative, emphasizing its potential to make state-level financial infrastructure more modern and accessible. However, as with most crypto projects operating in a murky regulatory landscape, WYST‚Äôs trajectory now hinges on its ability to navigate federal rules ‚Äî especially as the SEC continues to exert oversight over various digital assets. Wyoming Eyes Federal Legislation for Long-Term Clarity In addition to interpreting SEC guidance, the Wyoming commission is closely monitoring developments in Congress, where two bills seek to formalize stablecoin regulation. These include the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) introduced in the Senate, and the STABLE Act (Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy) in the House of Representatives. Should either bill pass, it could offer more concrete parameters for state-level issuers like Wyoming, while potentially shielding compliant projects from SEC scrutiny. Until then, Wyoming‚Äôs approach is one of preemptive caution, seeking to make its stablecoin regulation robust enough to withstand both state and federal review. Despite its small population of just over 600,000 residents, Wyoming has become a surprising epicenter for crypto innovation. The state is home to Custodia Bank, a digital asset institution founded by crypto advocate Caitlin Long, and boasts one of the most progressive blockchain regulatory frameworks in the US. Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of crypto‚Äôs most vocal proponents in Washington, also hails from Wyoming and has been instrumental in shaping crypto legislation and pushing for digital asset clarity at the federal level. This backdrop has allowed Wyoming to attract startups and investors looking for a jurisdiction with clear ‚Äî and favorable ‚Äî rules. The WYST stablecoin is seen as an extension of that broader effort to maintain Wyoming‚Äôs position as a regulatory sandbox for blockchain innovation. A Model for Other States? As the Wyoming Stable Token Commission prepares its next steps, its experience could serve as a template for other US states exploring similar digital currency ventures. If successful, WYST would become the first US state-issued and state-backed stablecoin, a move that could redefine the interplay between state sovereignty and federal regulatory authority in the digital currency age. With a May memo on SEC guidance forthcoming and a mid-year launch still on the table, Wyoming‚Äôs bold experiment in state-issued digital currency may soon be put to the test ‚Äî not just in technology, but in legal precedent as well.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-18 05:30:00

XRP is currently trading above $2, sparking renewed hope among investors. Analysts are buzzing about the possibility of it becoming the next cryptocurrency to get a spot ETF approval in the U.S ., right after Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, while the long-term narrative sounds bullish, the short-term mood among traders is more cautious than confident. What‚Äôs Next For XRP Price? Despite the growing excitement, options data has another story. On Deribit, one of the largest crypto options exchanges, traders seem more interested in buying put options, a type of trade usually used to hedge against or profit from falling prices. In simple terms, more people are betting that XRP could dip further rather than rally soon . XRP options skew. (Amberdata/Deribit) This sentiment is backed by what‚Äôs known as a ‚Äúnegative options skew.‚Äù That means the demand for puts is higher than for calls across several timeframes. It‚Äôs a signal that traders are still nervous about XRP‚Äôs near-term performance, even with ETF discussions in play. XRP‚Äôs price chart isn‚Äôt helping ease the nerves either. The coin recently dropped out of an ascending wedge, a technical pattern that often indicates a weakening uptrend. As a result, some analysts believe that XRP could revisit lows around $1.6, unless something bullish shifts the tide. XRP ETF News: Stability from Strong Order Book Not everything looks gloomy. One positive for XRP is its strong order book depth. Unlike tokens such as Solana, XRP can handle large trades without triggering volatile price swings‚Äîa level of stability that regulators may favor when evaluating ETF readiness. This liquidity advantage is one reason XRP remains in ETF discussions . Ripple, the company behind XRP, also continues to promote it as a global payments solution‚Äîa real-world use case that many altcoins still lack .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Beats Ethereum for 6 Months Straight ‚Äì Will XRP Become Next Largest Altcoin? , Will XRP Price Hit ATH? While ETF optimism is giving XRP fans something to look forward to, short-term traders seem to be playing it safe. Until the market sees clearer signs of upward momentum or regulatory progress, the price may stay under pressure. On the other side, crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO believes this week could be a game-changer for XRP‚Äôs trend. He points out that XRP‚Äôs weekly candle is sitting above the key $2.10 level and the 21-week EMA, a positive sign. But the real deal, he says, is $2.25. If XRP can close the week with a solid candle above $2.25, it could officially confirm a bullish trend reversal and suggest that the April 7 bottom was the turning point. EGRAG sees $2.25 as more than just resistance, he calls it the ‚Äúlock-in‚Äù point for the uptrend. This week‚Äôs candle close could decide which direction XRP takes next. For now, XRP is caught between long-term hope and short-term fear. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a public letter to the SEC‚Äôs acting chairman , the company alleged that a UK-based firm, Qube, may be shorting DJT stock without properly disclosing its positions. TMTG believes this kind of trading could be damaging to its stock and wants regulators to step in. What Exactly Is Trump Media Accusing Qube Of? According to TMTG, Qube disclosed in Germany that it held a short position of six million DJT shares, worth over $100 million. But the issue, as Trump Media sees it, is that Qube didn‚Äôt make the same kind of disclosure to US regulators or in other major jurisdictions. The firm also claims Qube‚Äôs position has since nearly doubled to 11 million shares. If true, this would mean Qube is betting heavily against the stock, and without full transparency, raising concerns of potential market manipulation. Large-scale short selling, especially without disclosure, can put serious downward pressure on a stock. Trump Media believes this may be playing a role in the poor performance of DJT stock, which has dropped 35% this year. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump Calls for Fed Chair Powell‚Äôs Termination: ‚ÄòToo Late and Wrong!‚Äô , Stock Under Pressure, But Bigger Problems Remain While the short-selling concerns are getting attention, they come at a time when TMTG is already facing bigger issues. The company is struggling financially, closing last year with less than $4 million in revenue while racking up over $400 million in losses. The stock‚Äôs fall isn‚Äôt just about short sellers, but it also reflects the company‚Äôs deeper challenges, including ongoing investigations around possible misuse of its Truth Social platform. Despite the financial struggles, Trump Media continues to push into the crypto space. It recently partnered with Crypto.com for a future ETF project and received a boost in attention after market maker DWF Labs invested $25 million in World Liberty Financial, a DeFi platform linked to the Trump brand. Bottom Line While TMTG‚Äôs claims about Qube raise fair questions, it‚Äôs likely just one part of the bigger picture. The company is under heavy pressure from investors, regulators, and the market itself. Whether the SEC acts on this request or not, Trump Media will still need to prove it can build a sustainable business, both in tech and now in crypto. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, stablecoins account for billions in daily transaction volumes and traditional banks are unwilling to be left out of the loop. Tech giants like Tether and Circle already dominate the market, but traditional banks like the Bank of America, are moving fast to stake their claim. Bank of America‚Äôs stablecoin aspirations The CEO of the Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, stated on the February 26 that the Bank of America would issue a stablecoin as soon as Congress provides a clear legal framework. Since Moynihan made his statement, the bank has worked behind the scenes through industry groups like the American Bankers Association and Bank Policy Institute to attempt to persuade lawmakers to give traditional financial institutions a competitive edge. The bank has been attempting to get legislation that favors traditional banks while restricting non-bank issuers such as tech startups and fintech companies passed. Lawmakers are currently debating two key bills that could either positively or negatively impact the future of digital banking. The house‚Äôs STABLE act and the senate‚Äôs GENIUS act are both pending bills that could give federally qualified non-banks the permission to issue stablecoins. The Bank of America and other established financial institutions have argued that letting firms like Amazon or Meta into the financial space would create an unfair intersection between banking and commerce, which could potentially affect customer privacy. ‚ÄúThe reason why you do that is because if you don‚Äôt, a retail company, for example, could look at your bank account, your statements, your expenses, and make some really, really intrusive and anti-competitive decisions about how they market to you. And so Congress a long time ago decided to make that separation. There is no such separation for current payment stablecoin issuers under both bills,‚Äù The Block reported . So far, limiting non-banks from issuing stablecoins hasn‚Äôt gathered much traction with either the Senate or the House, as both bills still have provisions for non-banking institutions interested in issuing stablecoins. Tether and Circle face fresh competition While the BoA works towards its goal of launching a stablecoin, Tether and Circle, the dominant issuers in the stablecoin market, are making moves to expand the stablecoin ecosystem. Circle is a company based in the US and promotes itself as a compliance-friendly fiat-pegged token issuer. It has been actively lobbying for legislation that supports non-bank issuers and ensures consumer protection. Tether‚Äôs CEO, Paolo Ardoino, commented on the restriction of non-banks from issuing stablecoins. ‚ÄúIf a company like Meta can bring transparency, compliance, and user protection to the table, there‚Äôs no reason they shouldn‚Äôt participate. Creating artificial barriers only serves to protect incumbents‚Äînot users,‚Äù he said, as reported by the block. Tether, which is headquartered abroad has also hinted its interest in the US market. Ardoino recently visited Washington, DC and New York, where he suggested the creation of a US-based dollar stablecoin subsidiary that would cater to institutional clients. Tether‚Äôs USDT has over $145B in circulation, while Circle has around $60B in USDC issued. Circle is likely to benefit from legislation that enforces strict reserve and audit requirements, unlike Tether . ‚ÄúThe biggest compliance question is the one that everyone has talked about, which is the reserve and the auditing requirements on the reserve. Tether has not done that in the past in the same way that, say, Circle has. The general conventional wisdom is that the reserve auditing requirements are going to be more difficult for Tether to meet.‚Äù Jennifer Schulp, director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute‚Äôs Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, said.

Analysts have called it the largest crypto theft to date. Blockchain forensics linked portions of the stolen funds to eXch, prompting suspicions that the non-KYC exchange may have served as a laundering channel for the North Korean hacking group. eXch denied involvement in any large-scale laundering activity . However, it acknowledged that a small fraction of the stolen assets passed through its platform. The company said this was an isolated incident and promised to donate any fees collected from the transaction to the public good. The platform also pushed back against calls from Bybit to freeze the remaining stolen funds. In communications with Bybit‚Äôs risk team, eXch cited frustration over prior incidents where it claims Bybit froze funds belonging to its users without explanation. The exchange suggested this history contributed to its reluctance to comply with the recent request.

It is the leading decentralized exchange for perpetuals futures trading, rivaling many of its centralized counterparts in terms of daily traded volume. This is mostly because Hyperliquid provides familiar trading interface, quick order settlements and, perhaps the most important part ‚Äì an order book, unlike many of the decentralized exchanges which operate with liquidity pools. You can read more about it in our Hyperliquid review . It runs on Arbitrum to ensure quick and cheap transaction fees and finality. The Hyperliquid bridge is a critical component of its ecosystem, allowing users to onboard funds to the blockchain and to the decentralized exchange. Hyperliquid Bridge: Moving USDC to Hyperliquid How to bridge USDC to Hyperliquid is perhaps one of the very first things a user must understand in order to start using the decentralized exchange. Keep in mind that all trading pairs on the platform are denominated against USDC. There are generally two ways to go about bridging funds to Hyperliquid: centralized and decentralized. In both cases you will need an EVM wallet such as MetaMask and an activated Arbitrum wallet. As we mentioned above, Hyperliquid operates on Arbitrum and you will need an address to receive the funds on. Check out some of the best DeFi wallets , most of which offer multi-chain support. The decentralized way to bridge USDC to Hyperliquid Although there are a few ways to go about this, perhaps the easiest is to use the solution provided by deBridge. It offers a nearly-instant solution to help you bridge any asset on any chain. Here is the step-by-step breakdown. Step 1: visit deBridge Step 2: select the source chain (the one that you have funds on) on top and the destination chain at the bottom. Hyperliquid operates on Arbitrum. Therefore, for your destination chain, you have to select Arbitrum from the chains tab and USDC from the assets tab as shown in the picture below: Source: deBridge Step 3: connect your EVM wallet as the source and the destination. Step 4: input how much USDC you want to bridge to Hyperliquid and make sure to review the transaction details. Step 5: confirm the transaction and in a few minutes the funds will be right into your Arbitrum wallet. Step 6: Open Hyperliquid , connect your wallet and click on ‚ÄúDeposit‚Äù from the top right navigation menu. From there, you will see the available USDC in your Arbitrum wallet and you can deposit as much as you want from it to Hyperliquid and start trading immediately. The centralized way to bridge funds to Hyperliquid The above allows you to bridge funds without going through a single centralized party, but what if you already have funds on a popular exchange like Binance, for example? Well, the process to bridge to Hyperliquid might even be easier. Simply go to your withdrawals tab and in the destination address input your Arbitrum wallet‚Äôs address. Select how much you want to withdraw, confirm it, and once the transaction is through, you will see your funds directly in your wallet. From there, follow Step 6 from the above to deposit funds into your Hyperliquid account. General Information about Hyperliquid‚Äôs Bridge There are a few things that you need to know about the Hyperliquid bridge. Deposits to Hyperliquid Bridge First, the deposits to it are signed by the validators and are credited as soon as more than 2/3 of the staking power has signed the deposit. The deposit flow itself is very simple. The user has to send USDC to the bridge (as described in the process above) and it is credited to the account that sent it in less than a minute. There is a minimum deposit amount, which is 5 USDC. If you happen to send less than this, it won‚Äôt be credited and you will lose the funds forever. Withdrawals from Hyperliquid Bridge Withdrawals from the Hyperqliuid bridge would require a user wallet signature on the Hyperliquid DEX only. It does not trigger a transaction on Arbitrum and are handled entirely by validators. The funds will arrive in your Arbitrum wallet in about 3 to 4 minutes. Withdrawals from Hyperliquid are deducted from your L1 balance immediately and validators sign them as separate transactions. Once 2/3 of the staking power has effectively signed the withdrawal requres, an EVM transaction can be sent to the bridge, which will request the withdrawal. Once this happens, there is a dispute period, during which the Hyperliquid bridge can be locked for a malicious withdrawal. 2/3 of the stake-weighted validator set is required to properly unlock the bridge. Once the dispute period is over, finalization transactions are being sent, which then distribute the USDC to the destination address. You don‚Äôt pay any ETH fees for this transaction and it shouldn‚Äôt take more than 3-4 minutes, as explained above. However, there is a withdrawal gas fee of 1 USDC that is paid on Hyperliquid to cover the Arbitrum gas costs of the validators.

Industry leaders like Barry Silbert and Michael Saylor are reinforcing the long-term value of holding BTC. While BTC had a tough start to the year, AI and meme coins dominated Q1 2025 investor interest, though scandals like the Libra token collapse raised questions about the sustainability of meme-driven hype. Bitcoin Optimism Rises Bitcoin-related sentiment on social media took a noticeable bullish turn, despite the cryptocurrency continuing to fluctuate around the $85,000 mark. According to crypto analytics platform Santiment , traders are showing renewed optimism that Bitcoin could soon reclaim the $90,000 price level, which is a milestone that was last reached on March 6. The optimism seems to be closely tied to broader economic conditions, including developments around global tariffs and macroeconomic indicators. Santiment‚Äôs social sentiment tracker registered a big shift on April 16, moving from neutral territory‚Äîbelow a score of 1.606‚Äîinto bullish territory with a score of 1.973. This change in sentiment happened even as Bitcoin continued to see high volatility, with price movements climbing as high as $86,000 on April 15 before retracing to $83,000 the next day. At press time, Bitcoin was priced at $84,792 after its price managed a slight 0.69% climb over the past 24 hours. BTC‚Äôs price was also in the green by just over 5% on its weekly time frame. BTC‚Äôs price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) A potential move back above $85,000 could trigger the liquidation of approximately $254 million in short positions, based on data from CoinGlass . This looming risk is contributing to the optimism among traders who believe Bitcoin may soon break out of its current price range. The upbeat sentiment is shared by several voices in the crypto space. Samson Mow‚Äôs firm Jan3 claimed that a $500,000 Bitcoin price target ‚Äùisn‚Äôt crazy,‚Äù while crypto trader ‚Äú Ted ‚Äù argued that an increasing global money supply will eventually find its way into Bitcoin. Another trader, known as Titan of Crypto , said that Bitcoin continues to follow Dow Theory, and is still in an uptrend with consistent higher highs and higher lows. Despite this wave of bullish commentary, not all sentiment indicators are aligned. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently reflects a ‚ÄúFear‚Äù score of 33 out of 100, which means that there is still some caution among a large portion of the market. This comes after a disappointing first quarter for the crypto market, where Bitcoin and Ethereum fell by 11.82% and 45.41%, respectively. This made it one of the weakest Q1 performances in recent years. Crypto fear and greed index (Source: Alternative ) Just Hold Your BTC Barry Silbert, the CEO of Digital Currency Group, recently reflected on his early Bitcoin journey during an appearance on Raoul Pal's Journey Man podcast . Silbert bought Bitcoin at $7‚Äì$8 back in 2011, and shared that while he invested in early-stage crypto companies like Coinbase using Bitcoin, simply holding onto his BTC would have yielded much better returns . Raoul Pal‚Äôs podcast (Source: YouTube ) Silbert‚Äôs comments come during the latest surge in Bitcoin optimism, with some industry leaders predicting dramatic price increases in the years to come. Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, repeatedly forecasted a seven-figure Bitcoin price, and other influential voices are beginning to agree with his projections. Zach Shapiro , head of the Bitcoin Policy Institute, recently said that if the United States were to buy one million Bitcoin, it could send the price soaring to $1 million per coin. Speaking on Bitcoin Magazine‚Äôs podcast, Shapiro said a move like this will trigger a ‚Äùglobal seismic shock.‚Äù His comments were reinforced by Bo Hines, executive director of the White House Crypto Council under President Trump, who said that the administration is evaluating budget-neutral strategies for adding Bitcoin to the nation‚Äôs strategic reserves. One strategy under discussion includes revaluing the US Treasury's gold reserves, which are currently pegged at $43 per ounce on the books despite trading at over $3,300 per ounce in the market. Another involves using trade tariffs to fund the purchase of Bitcoin. These ideas reflect the narrative where Bitcoin is being positioned as a potential tool to address the United States‚Äô $36 trillion national debt. VanEck estimated that Bitcoin-backed long-term bonds could help reduce the national debt by as much as $14 trillion. As the idea of nation-state Bitcoin accumulation gains momentum, Silbert‚Äôs hindsight about the value of simply holding BTC rather than deploying it for venture capital may prove more relevant than ever. AI and Memecoins Dominate Even though Bitcoin had a rocky start to the year, a new report by CoinGecko revealed that artificial intelligence tokens and meme coins continued to lead investor interest. In fact, they accounted for a combined 62.8% of attention during Q1. Q1 trending categories (Source: CoinGecko ) AI tokens alone captured 35.7% of global investor interest, surpassing meme coins, which held 27.1%. Among the top 20 crypto narratives for the quarter, six categories were related to meme coins, while five focused on AI. CoinGecko co-founder Bobby Ong shared in an April 17 post that the market is still clinging to trends from previous quarters, which suggests fatigue from a lack of innovation in crypto storytelling. The spike in meme coin interest earlier in the year was partly driven by political events, particularly around the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. His team launched the Official Trump (TRUMP) and Official Melania tokens in mid-January on the Solana network, WHICH briefly injectED SOME excitement into the meme coin space. Despite this surge, concerns are rising about the impact of meme coins on more fundamentally driven projects. Utility tokens like Solana have seen major capital outflows after briefly peaking above $270. Some critics argue that the meme coin frenzy diverted investment away from long-term blockchain infrastructure and application development. SOL‚Äôs price action over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The decline in enthusiasm was accelerated by the collapse of the Libra token,which is a meme coin that was endorsed by Argentine President Javier Milei. The token lost 94% of its value in a matter of hours after insiders reportedly withdrew more than $107 million in liquidity, erasing $4 billion in market capitalization. This scandal marked the sudden fall of political memecoins and led to a sharp drop in token creation activity on Solana‚Äôs Pump.fun platform. Despite the turbulence, seasoned traders are still drawn to speculative meme coin opportunities. Nicolai Sondergaard of Nansen noticed that while the meme coin supercycle may be over, smart money is still looking for quick gains from these tokens, which tend to operate outside traditional macroeconomic pressures.

Analysts Break It Down,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-this-the-final-shakeout-before-bitcoins-next-big-move-analysts-break-it-down/,"Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price action has shown signs of stagnation, with the asset hovering around the $84,000 mark after rebounding above it earlier this week. As of the time of writing, BTC is trading at $84,449, down 0.7% in the past 24 hours. Despite recovering from previous corrections, the price has struggled to break through the current resistance level, signaling weak buying momentum and cautious sentiment among traders.

BPI Says One US Move Could Make It Happen Bitcoin STH-SOPR and Realized Price Indicate Capitulation The current phase of consolidation follows weeks of volatile swings driven by broader macroeconomic uncertainty and mixed signals across risk assets. While long-term holders remain steady, short-term participants in the market appear to be under pressure. Insights into the behavior of these short-term holders may offer valuable clues on the overall direction of the market and possible entry or exit points for investors. According to a recent analysis shared by CryptoQuant contributor CryptoMe, data from short-term holders (STHs) reveals key indicators that could help define Bitcoin‚Äôs current cycle. The first metric highlighted is the STH Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR), which measures whether STHs are selling at a profit (above 1.0) or at a loss (below 1.0). Currently, this metric is below 1.0 based on a 14-day moving average, indicating that many STHs are offloading BTC at a loss‚Äîa signal often associated with capitulation phases. While this suggests bearish sentiment in the short term, CryptoMe points out that similar dips in STH-SOPR during past bull markets often presented accumulation opportunities. Historically, these periods of loss-taking by STHs have marked temporary bottoms, with prices rebounding shortly after as stronger hands absorb supply. Accumulation Opportunities and Strategy Outlook Another key metric shared is the STH Realized Price, currently around $92,000. This figure represents the average cost basis for coins held by short-term investors. When Bitcoin trades below this level, it can indicate undervaluation relative to recent buyer activity. In CryptoMe‚Äôs view, red zones (in the chart), periods when the spot price dips below the realized price, have often coincided with long-term accumulation zones during previous bullish phases. However, CryptoMe cautions that these indicators do not confirm a market bottom. Instead, they suggest that some investors are exiting positions under stress, creating potential buying opportunities for those with a long-term outlook.

He concludes by stating that if macroeconomic conditions improve and liquidity returns to the market, Bitcoin could resume its upward trajectory. Until then, the data suggests patience and risk management may be prudent for market participants awaiting a clearer trend reversal.

Right now, Pi is trading around $0.61 , which is nearly 400% lower than its all-time high. But some experts say the price could drop even more ‚Äî maybe by 35% to 50%. Let‚Äôs see why they think this might happen. Why Pi Coin Dropping Continuously Popular crypto expert Dr. Altcoin says Pi Coin is on the verge of falling even more, maybe 35% to 50% lower than where it is now. He thinks the main reason is that too many new Pi tokens are being released into the market. If you are still wondering why Pi's price is down today, it's because millions of unlocked Pi are now flooding the CEXs. I have been saying this all along, the available circulating supply on CEXs dictates the price of Pi since: Price = demand/supply. Unless the PCT‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/IblIpVv3Mq ‚Äî Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) April 15, 2025 This month alone, over 100 million Pi coins will be released. This year, more than 1.5 billion new coins will come into circulation. With so many new tokens and not enough people buying, the price might keep falling. Dr. Altcoin also warned that if the Pi Core Team doesn‚Äôt do something to stop the supply from growing, the price could drop all the way down to $0.30 in the next few months. Too Many Tokens, Not Enough Buyers Other experts agree and say this is basic supply and demand. When there are more coins to sell, but not more people to buy them, prices go down. Right now, many people can‚Äôt even buy Pi Coin because it‚Äôs not listed on big exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, so the demand is still low. What‚Äôs the Possible Solution? Some experts suggest that the Pi Foundation could burn some tokens to reduce the supply. Right now, the team holds over 70 billion Pi coins, and burning even a small part could help support the price. Another idea is to burn some of the transaction fees collected from Pi‚Äôs app ecosystem, like other blockchain projects already do. Pi Coin Price Eying 50% Drop The price of Pi Coin has dropped a lot, mainly because hundreds of millions of Pi tokens have been unlocked and added to the market. Recently, it lost 20% in value after failing to move above the strong resistance level at $0.778 last week. Looking at the 1-day price chart, Pi Coin is seen forming a ‚Äúfalling wedge pattern,‚Äù which usually means the price will keep going down. If this happens, the coin could drop to $0.38, its lowest point this month. But if Pi Coin goes above $0.78, it might start going up again and could even reach $1.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-18 06:08:27

Rug pulls have dropped in frequency year-over-year, with early 2024 recording 21 separate incidents, compared to only seven so far in 2025, according to an April 16 report from blockchain analytics platform DappRadar. However, since the beginning of 2025, the Web3 ecosystem has lost nearly $6 billion to rug pulls, according to DappRadar‚Äôs report. However, the report attributes 92% of that to Mantra‚Äôs OM token collapse , which the founders have strongly denied was a rug pull. In comparison, during the same period in early 2024, three months into the year, total losses from rug pulls hit $90 million. ‚ÄúThis shift suggests that rug pulls are becoming less frequent, but far more devastating when they do occur,‚Äù DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said. ‚ÄúThe scams are increasingly sophisticated, often orchestrated by teams with polished branding and well-planned narratives.‚Äù Memecoins main culprit for rug pulls Gherghelas says the nature of rug pulls is evolving. In the first quarter of 2024, most originated in DeFi protocols, NFT projects, and memecoins. In the same time frame for 2025, most rug pulls occurred in memecoins. Libertad project‚Äôs native Solana token, Libra (LIBRA), is one of the more recent high-profile cases of a rug pull ; it rallied to a market capitalization of $4.56 billion on Feb. 14 after Argentina‚Äôs president, Javier Milei, posted about it on X. The token then fell by over 94% after he deleted the post , prompting accusations of a pump-and-dump scheme . ‚ÄúRug pulls and exit scams remain a persistent threat, especially in ecosystems where projects can rapidly gain traction through hype, only to disappear with user funds overnight,‚Äù Gherghelas said. ‚ÄúDespite increasing awareness and more tools to detect suspicious behavior, rug pulls remain a recurring issue, particularly in DeFi and newly launched token ecosystems.‚Äù Gherghelas says red flags for rug pulls can include a sudden spike in unique active wallets without an apparent reason or unusually high volume paired with low user activity. DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas says several red flags could signal a project is a rug pull. Source: DappRadar At the same time, projects with unverified smart contracts, limited GitHub activity, or anonymous developer teams or DApps that spike overnight can also be a red flag.

With a total trading volume of about $8.39 trillion, Binance accounted for 36.5% of the global CEX market share, according to TokenInsight‚Äôs Q1 exchanges report . This was a decrease from the $9.95 trillion volume in Q4 2024 in line with the general market trend. Because of the waning hype after Trump‚Äôs inauguration, overall cryptocurrency trading volumes dropped 12.5% during the quarter. Total spot trading volume across the top 10 exchanges was $4.6 trillion, a 13.1% decrease from Q4 2024. The average daily spot trading value decreased as well, from $58 billion in Q4 to $51 billion in Q1. Despite this, Binance‚Äôs spot market share at the end of the quarter was 45%, a slight increase from the beginning of the quarter. A few rivals made slight progress. The spot market share of MEXC increased from 6.1% to 8%. While the majority of other platforms saw a decline, HTX, Bitget, and Bybit also reported modest gains.

Binance maintained its dominant position in the derivatives market, holding a 30.3% share. It also showed the most stability between spot and derivatives volume, indicating its steady platform structure. Over the quarter, derivatives trading reached $21 trillion, with an average daily volume of $233 billion. Traders leaned heavily into derivatives to manage risk in an increasingly uncertain macro environment. According to TokenInsight, the market became more logical and balanced as a result of the falling hype surrounding meme coins and AI tokens, with trading volume distributed more fairly among platforms. The report cited U.S. tariff concerns as one of the key changes that may continue to weigh down on the crypto market in this quarter.

US interest rates remain stubbornly high at 4.5%, which makes the cost of borrowing expensive. Powell warned that Trump‚Äôs newly imposed tariffs, particularly those on China, could lead to a dangerous economic mix of rising prices and slowing growth, or ‚Äústagflation.‚Äù The central bank usually cuts interest rates to stimulate a flagging economy and job market. It increases rates, or keeps them higher for longer, in an attempt to lower inflation. However, it does not appear to be having the desired effect as aggregate US inflation, derived from the Consumer Price Index, is at 2.4%, which is above the Fed‚Äôs target of 2%. Some items, such as food, have even higher inflation rates, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. According to prediction markets, the probability of Powell actually being fired this year is still low. Eliminate the noise and look at what the market is saying: Despite all of the ‚Äúfire Powell‚Äù headlines, prediction markets have been steady.
