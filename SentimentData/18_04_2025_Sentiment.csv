43463604,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150517,1744929055,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alert: Slovenia Considers 25% Crypto Tax ‚Äì Decoding the Impact,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/slovenia-crypto-tax-imminent-impact/,"Cryptocurrency investors in Slovenia, brace yourselves! A significant shift in the regulatory landscape might be on the horizon. The Slovenian Finance Ministry has dropped a bombshell proposal: a 25% tax on profits from individual crypto investments. This move, aimed at plugging a perceived tax loophole, is currently open for public discussion until May 5th. If it gets the green light from parliament, this new law could come into effect as early as January 1, 2026. Let‚Äôs dive deep into what this crypto tax Slovenia proposal entails and what it could mean for you. Why the Sudden Focus on Crypto Tax in Slovenia? For some time, Slovenia has been known for its relatively lenient stance on cryptocurrency taxation, often seen as a haven for crypto enthusiasts within the European Union. However, this proposed 25% tax on individual crypto profits tax Slovenia signals a potential change in direction. The government‚Äôs rationale is clear: to close an existing tax loophole and generate revenue. According to Bloomberg reports, the estimated annual revenue from this tax could range anywhere from ‚Ç¨2.5 million to a substantial ‚Ç¨25 million. But why now? Several factors could be at play: Increased Crypto Adoption: As cryptocurrency adoption grows globally and within Slovenia, governments are increasingly looking at ways to tax this burgeoning asset class. EU Pressure and Harmonization: There‚Äôs a broader trend within the European Union towards harmonizing tax regulations, including those related to digital assets. Slovenia might be aligning itself with this trend. Revenue Generation: Governments worldwide are constantly seeking new revenue streams, and the growing crypto market presents an attractive target for taxation. Fairness and Equity: The argument is often made that profits from crypto investments should be taxed similarly to other forms of investment gains to ensure fairness in the tax system. Decoding the Proposed 25% Slovenia Crypto Tax Rate The core of the proposal is a 25% tax on individual cryptocurrency tax Slovenia gains. This is a significant percentage and warrants careful consideration. Let‚Äôs break down what this could mean: Who is Affected? This tax specifically targets individual investors and their profits from crypto investments. It‚Äôs crucial to note that it focuses on gains, not the principal investment amount. Tax Rate: A flat 25% tax rate is proposed. This is a considerable tax rate, potentially impacting the profitability of crypto investments for Slovenian residents. Taxable Events: The proposal likely defines specific taxable events, such as selling cryptocurrency for fiat currency or potentially exchanging one cryptocurrency for another. The specifics will be crucial to understand. Implementation Date: If approved, the law is slated to take effect on January 1, 2026. This gives investors some time to prepare, but also underscores the urgency to understand and potentially respond to the proposal during the public comment period. Potential Benefits and Challenges of the New Crypto Tax Law Like any tax policy, the proposed Slovenia crypto tax law comes with its own set of potential benefits and challenges. Let‚Äôs weigh them out: Potential Benefits: Increased Government Revenue: The most direct benefit is the potential for increased revenue for the Slovenian government. This revenue could be used for public services and infrastructure projects. Level Playing Field: Taxing crypto profits could create a more level playing field with traditional investments, which are typically subject to capital gains taxes. Regulatory Clarity: While taxation can be seen as a burden, it also provides a degree of regulatory clarity for the crypto sector in Slovenia. Clear rules can foster a more stable and predictable environment. Potential Challenges: Impact on Crypto Innovation: A high tax rate could potentially stifle innovation and investment in the crypto sector within Slovenia. It might make Slovenia less attractive compared to jurisdictions with more favorable tax regimes. Compliance Burden: Implementing and complying with crypto tax regulations can be complex. Both taxpayers and tax authorities will need to adapt to new reporting and compliance requirements. Capital Flight: If the tax regime is perceived as too burdensome, there‚Äôs a risk of capital flight, with crypto businesses and investors potentially moving to more tax-friendly locations. Enforcement Challenges: Taxing crypto assets can be challenging due to their decentralized and often borderless nature. Effective enforcement will be crucial for the success of this tax law. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors in Slovenia? Actionable Insights For crypto investors in Slovenia, this proposed cryptocurrency tax law is a significant development that requires attention and proactive steps: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on the developments regarding this proposal. Follow news outlets and official announcements from the Slovenian Finance Ministry. Participate in Public Comment: The public comment period is open until May 5th. If you are affected by this proposal, consider submitting your comments and feedback. Your voice matters! Seek Professional Advice: Consult with a tax advisor or financial professional to understand how this proposed law might impact your specific crypto investments and tax obligations. Tax Planning: Start thinking about tax planning strategies in light of this potential new tax regime. This might involve reviewing your investment strategies and considering the tax implications of your crypto activities. Long-Term Perspective: Consider the long-term implications of this tax law on the Slovenian crypto market. Think about how it might affect your investment decisions in the future. Examples of Crypto Tax Regulations in Other Countries To put Slovenia‚Äôs proposal into perspective, let‚Äôs briefly look at how other countries are approaching crypto regulation and taxation: Country Crypto Tax Approach Germany Tax-free after one year of holding for individuals. Otherwise, taxed as income tax. Portugal Generally no personal income tax on crypto gains (subject to change). United States Taxed as property, with capital gains tax rates applying based on holding period. India 30% tax on crypto gains, with limited deductions. South Korea 20% tax on crypto gains exceeding a certain threshold (implementation delayed). Note: Crypto tax regulations are constantly evolving, and this table provides a simplified overview. Always consult with a tax professional for specific advice. As you can see, the approach to crypto taxation varies significantly across different jurisdictions. Slovenia‚Äôs proposed 25% tax rate, if implemented, would place it somewhere in the mid-to-high range compared to other countries. The final impact will depend on the specific details of the law and how effectively it is implemented and enforced. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Crypto Tax Landscape in Slovenia The proposed 25% tax on individual crypto profits in Slovenia marks a potentially shocking turning point in the country‚Äôs approach to cryptocurrency regulation. While aimed at closing tax loopholes and generating revenue, it also presents challenges for crypto investors and the broader crypto ecosystem in Slovenia. Staying informed, participating in the public discourse, and seeking professional advice are crucial steps for navigating this evolving landscape. The future of crypto regulation in Slovenia is now in a period of critical discussion and development. Keep watching this space!

43463907,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150520,1744929652,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Confidence Surge: a16z Crypto Amplifies LayerZero Investment with $55M Locked ZRO Token Acquisition,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/a16z-crypto-layerzero-investment/,"In a powerful display of confidence in cross-chain technology, a16z Crypto has significantly deepened its commitment to LayerZero by acquiring an additional $55 million worth of ZRO tokens. This substantial LayerZero investment , announced on X, comes with a three-year lock-up period, signaling a long-term belief in the protocol‚Äôs potential. But what does this mean for LayerZero, a16z crypto, and the broader Web3 ecosystem? Let‚Äôs dive into the details of this exciting development. Why is a16z Crypto Doubling Down on LayerZero? For those familiar with the crypto venture capital landscape, a16z crypto is a name synonymous with strategic investments and backing for groundbreaking projects. Their continued support for LayerZero is not entirely new; they previously led LayerZero‚Äôs Series A+ and Series B funding rounds. This latest acquisition, however, is more than just another funding round. It‚Äôs a strong endorsement, a public declaration of faith in LayerZero‚Äôs technology and its future trajectory. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what makes this investment noteworthy: Significant Investment Size: $55 million is a considerable sum, especially in the current market climate. It demonstrates a substantial financial commitment from a major player like a16z. Token Lock-up Period: The three-year lock-up is crucial. It means a16z is not looking for a quick flip. They are in it for the long haul, indicating a belief in the long-term growth and success of LayerZero and the ZRO token . Existing Relationship: a16z‚Äôs prior investments in LayerZero suggest a deep understanding of the project, its team, and its technology. This isn‚Äôt a speculative bet; it‚Äôs a calculated move based on existing conviction. Strategic Alignment: LayerZero‚Äôs mission to solve blockchain interoperability aligns perfectly with the broader Web3 vision of a connected and decentralized future, a vision a16z actively champions. Key Aspect Details of a16z‚Äôs LayerZero Investment Investor a16z Crypto Investment Amount $55 million Token ZRO Lock-up Period 3 years Previous Involvement Led Series A+ and Series B rounds Understanding LayerZero: The Interoperability Powerhouse For those newer to the crypto space, understanding LayerZero is crucial to appreciating the significance of this crypto venture capital injection. LayerZero is designed to be an omnichain interoperability protocol. In simpler terms, it‚Äôs built to connect different blockchains seamlessly. Imagine a world where moving assets or data between Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and other blockchains is as easy as sending an email. That‚Äôs the problem LayerZero is tackling. Here‚Äôs why interoperability is so vital and why LayerZero stands out: Breaking Down Silos: Currently, blockchains often operate in isolation. LayerZero aims to break down these silos, creating a more unified and efficient crypto ecosystem. Enhanced User Experience: Interoperability simplifies the user experience. Users won‚Äôt need to navigate complex bridges or worry about chain compatibility when interacting with different dApps (decentralized applications). Developer Flexibility: LayerZero empowers developers to build truly omnichain applications, leveraging the strengths of multiple blockchains without being confined to a single ecosystem. Increased Capital Efficiency: By enabling seamless asset transfer across chains, LayerZero can improve capital efficiency within the crypto market. LayerZero‚Äôs technology utilizes an innovative approach called the Ultra Light Node (ULN), which offers a balance of security and efficiency in cross-chain communication. This is a key differentiator compared to earlier bridging solutions that often faced security vulnerabilities or were cumbersome to use. The Role of Web3 Funding and Venture Capital in Crypto Growth The web3 funding landscape is heavily influenced by venture capital firms like a16z. These firms play a crucial role in nurturing and accelerating the growth of promising crypto projects. Their investments are not just about the money; they bring expertise, networks, and credibility to the table. Here‚Äôs how venture capital fuels the Web3 revolution: Financial Resources: VC funding provides the capital needed for projects to develop their technology, build teams, and scale their operations. Strategic Guidance: VC firms often offer strategic advice and mentorship, helping projects navigate the complexities of the crypto market and build sustainable businesses. Network Effects: VCs have extensive networks within the industry, connecting projects with potential partners, talent, and future investors. Validation and Credibility: Investment from reputable VCs like a16z adds significant validation and credibility to a project, attracting further attention and adoption. a16z‚Äôs increased investment in LayerZero underscores the continued confidence of institutional investors in the long-term potential of Web3 and the underlying technologies that power it. Despite market fluctuations and regulatory uncertainties, smart money is still flowing into the space, seeking out projects with strong fundamentals and innovative solutions. What‚Äôs Next for LayerZero and the ZRO Token? With this fresh infusion of capital and the unwavering backing of a16z crypto , LayerZero is well-positioned to further develop its technology and expand its ecosystem. The three-year lock-up on the ZRO token acquisition suggests a focus on long-term value creation rather than short-term gains. Potential future developments for LayerZero and ZRO could include: Ecosystem Growth: We can expect to see more dApps and projects integrating LayerZero for cross-chain functionality, expanding its network effect. Technology Advancements: LayerZero may continue to innovate and enhance its protocol, potentially improving speed, security, and cost-effectiveness. Token Utility Expansion: The utility of the ZRO token within the LayerZero ecosystem could evolve, potentially encompassing governance, staking, or other functionalities. Mainstream Adoption: As interoperability becomes increasingly crucial, LayerZero could play a pivotal role in driving mainstream adoption of Web3 technologies. Conclusion: A Confident Stride Towards Interoperable Web3 a16z Crypto‚Äôs $55 million investment in locked ZRO tokens is a resounding vote of confidence in LayerZero and the future of blockchain interoperability. It highlights the strategic importance of cross-chain solutions in building a more connected and user-friendly Web3 ecosystem. This move not only benefits LayerZero directly but also sends a positive signal to the broader crypto market, reinforcing the long-term investment thesis for innovative projects tackling fundamental challenges. As LayerZero continues to build and expand, its impact on the crypto landscape is poised to become even more profound, paving the way for a truly omnichain future.

43464143,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=711846,1744929812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43464143.jpeg,Google‚Äôs AI safety promises under scrutiny after Gemini report,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/googles-ai-safety-promises-under-scrutiny-after-gemini-report/,"Google shared a safety paper on its flagship artificial‚Äëintelligence model, Gemini 2.5 Pro. Experts say it leaves key risks unexplained. The company posted the technical paper on Thursday, several weeks after it released Gemini 2.5 Pro to customers. The document lists the internal tests Google ran on the model but offers few facts on how the system behaves under overload or misuse. Researchers who reviewed the paper told TechCrunch the missing details make it hard to judge whether Gemini 2.5 Pro is truly safe for broad use. Technical reports are one of the main ways the public learns what advanced AI systems can and cannot do. A thorough report often shows where a model fails and where it might be misused. Many AI researchers treat these papers as honest efforts to back up a company‚Äôs safety claims. Google handles safety reporting differently. Google releases a report only after a model is no longer tagged ‚Äúexperimental,‚Äù and it moves certain ‚Äúdangerous capability‚Äù findings into a separate audit that is not published at once. As a result, the public paper does not cover every threat Google has tested for. Several analysts said the new Gemini 2.5 Pro document is a stark case of limited disclosure. They also noticed that the report never refers to Google‚Äôs Frontier Safety Framework, or FSF, a policy the company announced last year to spot future AI powers that could cause ‚Äúsevere harm.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis report is very sparse, contains minimal information, and arrived weeks after the model went public,‚Äù said Peter Wildeford, co‚Äëfounder of the Institute for AI Policy and Strategy. ‚ÄúIt is impossible to confirm whether Google is meeting its own promises, and therefore impossible to judge the safety and security of its models.‚Äù Thomas Woodside, co‚Äëfounder of the Secure AI Project, said he was glad any paper had appeared at all, yet he doubted Google‚Äôs plan to release steady follow‚Äëups. He pointed out that the last time the firm shared results from dangerous‚Äëcapability tests was June 2024, and that paper covered a model announced in February of the same year. Confidence slipped further when observers saw no safety paper for Gemini 2.5 Flash, a slimmer and faster model Google revealed last week. A company spokesperson said a Flash paper is ‚Äúcoming soon.‚Äù ‚ÄúI hope this is a real promise to start giving more frequent updates,‚Äù Woodside said. ‚ÄúThose updates should include results for models that have not yet reached the public, because those models may also pose serious risks.‚Äù Google now falls short on transparency Meta‚Äôs safety note for its new Llama 4 models runs only a few pages, while OpenAI chose not to publish any report at all for its GPT‚Äë4.1 series. The shortage of detail comes at a tense time. Two years ago, Google told the U.S. government it would post safety papers for every ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù AI model within scope.‚Äù The company made similar pledges to officials in other countries, saying it would offer ‚Äúpublic transparency‚Äù about its AI products. Kevin Bankston, senior adviser on AI governance at the Center for Democracy and Technology, called the releases from leading labs a ‚Äúrace to the bottom‚Äù on safety. ‚ÄúCombined with reports that rival labs like OpenAI have cut safety‚Äëtesting time before release from months to days, this meager documentation for Google‚Äôs top model tells a troubling story of a race to the bottom on AI safety and transparency as companies rush their models to market,‚Äù he added. Google says much of its safety work happens behind closed doors. The company states that every model undergoes strict tests, including ‚Äúadversarial red teaming,‚Äù before any public launch.

The world of digital asset derivatives is heating up, and Coinbase International is making waves. Last week, this Bermuda-based platform, a sibling to the U.S. crypto giant Coinbase, witnessed a massive surge in Bitcoin futures volume , hitting a staggering $100 billion. Yes, you read that right ‚Äì $100 billion in just one week! This isn‚Äôt just a blip on the radar; it‚Äôs a significant indicator of the evolving landscape of crypto trading and the growing appetite for derivatives outside the heavily regulated U.S. market. Why the Sudden Spike in Bitcoin Futures Volume? So, what‚Äôs fueling this explosive growth in Bitcoin futures volume on Coinbase International? Several factors are likely at play, all converging to create a perfect storm for derivatives trading: Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its rollercoaster rides, and recent weeks have been no exception. Periods of high volatility often drive traders towards derivatives markets. Why? Because futures contracts allow traders to speculate on price movements ‚Äì both up and down ‚Äì without actually holding the underlying asset. This can be particularly attractive during uncertain times. Demand for Crypto Derivatives: U.S. regulations are stringent when it comes to crypto derivatives. Platforms like Coinbase in the U.S. don‚Äôt offer the same range of perpetual futures contracts that are available on international exchanges. Traders seeking access to these instruments are naturally drawn to platforms like Coinbase International . Institutional Interest: While retail traders are a significant part of the crypto market, the $100 billion figure suggests a substantial influx of institutional capital. Institutional demand for crypto exposure is on the rise, and derivatives offer a sophisticated way for institutions to participate in the market, manage risk, and potentially enhance returns. Coinbase‚Äôs Global Expansion: Coinbase‚Äôs strategic move to establish Coinbase International in Bermuda is paying off. It allows them to tap into the global derivatives market and cater to a wider audience beyond the U.S. This expansion positions Coinbase as a key player in the international crypto derivatives space. Coinbase International: A Rising Star in Crypto Derivatives Coinbase International , though relatively new, is rapidly establishing itself as a force to be reckoned with in the crypto derivatives market. Here‚Äôs a closer look at what makes it stand out: Backed by Coinbase: The platform benefits from the reputation and infrastructure of Coinbase, a publicly traded and well-respected name in the crypto industry. This association provides a level of trust and security that is crucial in the often-unregulated world of crypto exchanges. Focus on Perpetual Futures: Perpetual futures contracts are a popular type of crypto derivative that doesn‚Äôt have an expiry date. This allows traders to hold positions for as long as they want, making them attractive for both short-term speculation and longer-term trading strategies. Global Reach: Being based in Bermuda allows Coinbase International to serve a global audience, bypassing some of the regulatory hurdles faced by U.S.-based platforms. This global accessibility is a major advantage in attracting international traders and institutional demand . Competitive Trading Environment: The platform likely offers competitive trading fees and a robust trading engine to attract and retain users in the highly competitive crypto exchange landscape. The Allure of Futures Trading: Benefits and Risks Futures trading , particularly in the crypto market, offers both exciting opportunities and significant risks. Understanding these is crucial for anyone considering venturing into this space. Benefits of Futures Trading: Leverage: Futures contracts allow traders to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. This leverage can amplify profits, but also losses. Hedging: Futures can be used to hedge against price volatility in the spot market. For example, if you hold Bitcoin, you can use Bitcoin futures to protect against potential price declines. Profit from Falling Prices: Unlike traditional spot trading where you primarily profit from price increases, futures allow you to profit from both rising and falling prices by taking long or short positions. Liquidity: Major crypto futures exchanges generally offer high liquidity, allowing for efficient order execution. Risks of Futures Trading: High Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile, and this volatility is amplified in futures trading due to leverage. Liquidation Risk: Leverage increases the risk of liquidation. If the market moves against your position, you could lose your initial margin and potentially more. Complexity: Futures trading can be more complex than spot trading, requiring a deeper understanding of margin, leverage, and contract specifications. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto derivatives is still evolving, and changes in regulations could impact the market. Institutional Demand: The Driving Force? While retail interest in crypto remains strong, the surge in futures trading volume, especially on platforms like Coinbase International , increasingly points towards the growing influence of institutional demand . Institutions, such as hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations, are increasingly looking at crypto as a legitimate asset class. Here‚Äôs why institutional demand is a significant factor: Portfolio Diversification: Institutions are constantly seeking diversification to manage risk and enhance returns. Crypto, with its low correlation to traditional assets, offers a compelling diversification opportunity. Sophisticated Trading Strategies: Institutions often employ more sophisticated trading strategies, including derivatives trading, to optimize their crypto exposure. Increased Market Maturity: As the crypto market matures, institutions are becoming more comfortable participating, driven by factors like improved custody solutions, clearer regulatory frameworks (in some jurisdictions), and growing market infrastructure. Search for Yield: In a low-interest-rate environment, institutions are constantly searching for yield. Crypto, despite its volatility, offers the potential for higher returns compared to traditional fixed-income assets. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders What does this Bitcoin futures volume surge on Coinbase International mean for you, the crypto trader? Keep an Eye on Derivatives Markets: The derivatives market is becoming increasingly important in the crypto ecosystem. Monitoring trading volumes and trends on platforms like Coinbase International can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Understand Futures Trading: If you‚Äôre not already familiar with futures trading, now might be a good time to learn the basics. While it comes with risks, it also offers powerful tools for speculation, hedging, and portfolio management. Consider Global Platforms: Don‚Äôt limit yourself to U.S.-regulated exchanges, especially if you‚Äôre interested in derivatives. Explore international platforms like Coinbase International to access a wider range of crypto products and trading opportunities. Stay Informed about Regulations: The regulatory landscape for crypto derivatives is constantly evolving. Stay updated on regulatory developments in different jurisdictions to understand the implications for your trading activities. Conclusion: The Future is Derivatives? The $100 billion Bitcoin futures volume on Coinbase International is not just a number; it‚Äôs a testament to the growing sophistication and globalization of the crypto market. It signals a clear shift towards derivatives trading, driven by market volatility, institutional demand , and the strategic expansion of platforms like Coinbase. As the crypto space matures, expect to see derivatives playing an even more central role, offering both opportunities and challenges for traders and investors alike. The surge on Coinbase International is a powerful reminder that the crypto revolution is far from over ‚Äì it‚Äôs just entering a new, more complex, and potentially more rewarding phase.

Related Reading: Is Shiba Inu On Track To Dethrone Dogecoin? Here‚Äôs What The Experts Say Total market value witnessed a drop of $3.8 trillion to $2.8 trillion, an 18.6% decline over the quarter. This sharp plunge marked the turnaround before the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president, in stark contrast to last year‚Äôs ramp up. Trading volume also suffered some contractions, as the daily volumes dropped to $146 billion, a decrease of 27%. Bitcoin Rules Market While Others Decline Bitcoin insulated itself reasonably from the turbulence in other cryptocurrencies so that its market share reached nearly 60%, the highest in four years. Bitcoin achieved peak valuation at $106,182 in January shortly after inauguration but plunged almost 12% to finish the quarter at $82,514. Compared with Bitcoin during this period, gold and US Treasury bonds were traditional safe-haven investments with lower performance. Compared to Ethereum, however, the situation was much worse. Its price fell by 45%, essentially wiping out all gains in 2024. Its market share dropped to almost 8%, the lowest it has been since the end of 2019. As it has been observed by most analysts, this downturn is not something new since more and more activities have shifted toward ‚ÄúLayer 2‚Äù networks built atop Ethereum and not using the Ethereum main network. Meme Coins Crash After Major Scam The previously red-hot meme coin space received a rude wake-up call in early 2025. Following a boom in Trump-themed tokens, the industry was severely hurt when the Libra token ‚Äì introduced by Argentina‚Äôs President Javier Milei ‚Äì proved to be a scam. The project was abandoned by developers after they had taken investors‚Äô funds, shattering confidence in such tokens. By late March, new token launches on the platform Pump.fun per day had dropped by over 50%. DeFi Industry Loses More Than A Quarter Of Its Value Not even the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry was exempted. Overall money in DeFi projects dropped 27% to $48 billion during the first quarter. Ethereum‚Äôs dominance in the DeFi space declined to 56% by quarter-end. Related Reading: Solana Hits Milestone As Canada OKs First Spot ETFs Not everything was negative, though. Stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) became more popular with investors seeking a safer bet as the market tanked. Solana also remained in its leadership position, holding 39.6% of all decentralized exchange (DEX) trading during Q1, courtesy mostly of meme coin mania. Even Solana‚Äôs leadership, however, started to wane at the end of the period as the meme coin mania declined. The dramatic shift in market sentiment shows how quickly cryptocurrency fortunes can change. After a promising end to 2024, the new year brought a harsh reality check for crypto investors, with nearly $1 trillion in market value disappearing in just three months.

Arbitrum Hits $300B Milestone While Litecoin Holds Steady,https://thecoinrise.com/is-qubetics-the-top-crypto-presale-of-2025-arbitrum-hits-300b-milestone-while-litecoin-holds-steady/,"The current market is showing signs of consolidation, and that‚Äôs often when the sharpest eyes find the best entries. While Bitcoin and top altcoins weather the volatility, the real shift is happening beneath the surface‚Äîwhere utility meets opportunity. Arbitrum just broke records with Uniswap, clocking over $300 billion in volume and proving that Ethereum Layer 2 scaling isn‚Äôt just hype‚Äîit‚Äôs infrastructure. Meanwhile, Litecoin is doing what it always does in uncertain markets: staying steady, staying fast, and staying relevant. These developments set the stage for something bigger‚Äîbecause while Layer 2 adoption heats up and OG coins like Litecoin hold their ground, the window is still open for standout presales with real-world application to disrupt the space. One project making that kind of noise right now is Qubetics. It‚Äôs checking every box: enterprise-grade utility, a live presale with surging numbers, and a dev-friendly ecosystem that could bring Web3 to the everyday user without friction. That kind of clarity is what makes a top crypto presale , especially when big-name tokens are grappling with gas fees, throughput issues, or stagnant roadmaps. Qubetics ($TICS) enters the scene with something rare‚Äîan ecosystem that doesn‚Äôt require a dictionary to understand. It‚Äôs built with a problem-solving lens that directly challenges the hurdles most chains still haven‚Äôt solved. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs capturing attention not only from DeFi participants and early adopters but also from business professionals, developers, and even Web2-native platforms exploring their first leap into Web3 integration. Qubetics ‚Äì Developer-First Ecosystem Powered by QubeQode IDE At the heart of Qubetics lies QubeQode IDE , a no-nonsense, developer-focused interface that enables real-time smart contract generation and deployment without needing a PhD in Solidity. The IDE streamlines the Web3 build process for both seasoned blockchain developers and professionals with zero coding background. Through its simplified architecture, users can create, test, and deploy cross-chain applications‚Äîall without leaving the platform. That‚Äôs not just a perk‚Äîit‚Äôs a shift in how decentralized applications are built and scaled. Businesses can tokenize assets, professionals can build revenue-generating protocols, and individuals can plug into DeFi ecosystems without clunky middleware or third-party dependencies. It‚Äôs interoperability and automation baked into one environment‚Äîunlocking access to decentralized infrastructure for real users, not just crypto natives. And it‚Äôs this kind of user-centric innovation that defines what a top crypto presale should look like. Qubetics isn‚Äôt trying to be a trend‚Äîit‚Äôs aiming to be a backbone. Qubetics Presale Update ‚Äì Entry Price, ROI Potential, and Market Response The Qubetics presale is currently in Stage 30 , and momentum hasn‚Äôt skipped a beat. So far, the project has sold more than 508 million tokens to over 24,800 holders , raising more than $16.1 million . $TICS tokens are available now at $0.1729 , but time and supply are moving fast. Those who jumped in during Stage 1 at $0.01 are already sitting on a 1629% return . But even at this stage, the window is wide open for those seeking long-term ROI and entry at a high-leverage point. If acquired today, a $TICS token priced at $0.1729 could still yield a projected 477% return at $1. At $5, that jumps to 2789% , while $6 gives 3367% ROI . If $TICS pushes to $10 post-listing, the return spikes to 5678% . Analysts projecting a $15 valuation following the mainnet launch estimate a return of 8567% from current levels. That kind of potential doesn‚Äôt appear out of thin air. It comes from substance‚Äîutility, usability, scalability, and forward-looking tech. It‚Äôs why Qubetics is drawing comparisons with the best crypto presale contenders historically and establishing its case as a top crypto presale in 2025. Arbitrum ‚Äì Setting the L2 Standard in DeFi Arbitrum just crossed an industry-defining threshold. The Ethereum Layer 2 network recently surpassed $300 billion in trading volume on Uniswap , the first L2 to achieve this. The milestone is more than a big number‚Äîit‚Äôs a reflection of Arbitrum‚Äôs role as the backbone of affordable, high-speed DeFi. Uniswap‚Äôs integration with Arbitrum proves that L2 networks are not just scaling tools‚Äîthey‚Äôre foundational for next-gen finance. What makes Arbitrum‚Äôs rise more impactful is its balance of speed and security. It maintains Ethereum‚Äôs trustless infrastructure while eliminating the prohibitively high gas fees that drove many users away from L1 DEX activity. This L2 adoption trend is now influencing both institutional and retail decision-makers, further anchoring Arbitrum as a critical force in Ethereum‚Äôs scaling narrative. While Arbitrum isn‚Äôt a presale and doesn‚Äôt carry the same upside dynamics as Qubetics, its dominance showcases the infrastructure layer needed to support scalable projects‚Äîmany of which will emerge from presale ecosystems like Qubetics. Litecoin ‚Äì Simplicity That Sticks Litecoin is one of those projects that doesn‚Äôt need gimmicks. It‚Äôs been called the ‚Äúsilver to Bitcoin‚Äôs gold‚Äù for years‚Äîand that analogy still holds. Built for speed and designed with lower transaction fees in mind, Litecoin has seen multiple market cycles and remains standing, adopted, and widely supported. And in a market where complexity can push out everyday users, Litecoin‚Äôs simplicity is its power. Halving events have consistently driven renewed attention to LTC, not only for their economic impact but also for the sentiment reset they provide. While other altcoins ride waves of news and flash launches, Litecoin grinds upward on the back of proven history. And that‚Äôs what makes it an appealing option for those who like their risk measurable and their asset behavior understandable. Though Litecoin may not fall under the top crypto presale category, it serves a critical role in portfolios looking to balance innovation with resilience. Final Thoughts In a time when the market demands more than promises, Qubetics is doing something few others can‚Äîdelivering early. With a fully integrated dev stack, a live and engaged presale community, and ROI models that don‚Äôt rely on hype alone, Qubetics isn‚Äôt just a top crypto presale‚Äîit‚Äôs the blueprint for what presales should aim to be. Meanwhile, Arbitrum‚Äôs achievements in DeFi scalability and Litecoin‚Äôs status as a legacy asset serve to reinforce the broader point: that real value comes from real functionality. As the market recalibrates, participants are beginning to understand that flash-in-the-pan projects don‚Äôt cut it anymore. The focus is shifting toward scalable tech, real-world usability, and systems that onboard‚Äînot alienate. Qubetics, Arbitrum, and Litecoin reflect different ends of that spectrum‚Äîbut they each represent a strong case for the top crypto presale discussions now and going forward.

Trump signaled that he is reluctant to impose further tariffs on China because doing so would delay a trade deal. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, the president said people he regards as direct envoys of Chinese leader Xi‚ÄØJinping had ‚Äúreached out a number of times‚Äù in recent days. ‚ÄúI have a very good relationship with President‚ÄØXi, and I think it‚Äôs going to continue,‚Äù Trump said. Asked if Xi himself had called, Trump replied, ‚ÄúWell, the same. I view it very similar. It would be top levels of China.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs comments come after months of rising import duties that have pushed U.S. taxes on Chinese goods to a combined 145‚ÄØpercent and prompted Beijing to retaliate with tariffs of 125‚ÄØpercent. The trade war has halted commerce between the world‚Äôs two largest economies and complicated a separate effort to force ByteDance‚ÄØLtd. to divest TikTok‚Äôs American operations. On Thursday, the President suggested for the first time that further tariff hikes could backfire. ‚ÄúAt a certain point I don‚Äôt want them to go higher because at a certain point you make it where people don‚Äôt buy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo I may not want to go higher, or I may not want to even go up to that level. I may want to go to less because, you know, you want people to buy.‚Äù Trump may provide a relief in tariffs if China accepts TikTok divestiture Both capitals have insisted that the other side make the next move. Even so, Trump sounded upbeat about the chances of linking a wider trade deal with a TikTok deal . ‚ÄúWell, we have a deal for TikTok, but it‚Äôll be subject to China, so we‚Äôll just delay the deal till this thing works out,‚Äù he said. He argued that selling TikTok‚Äôs U.S. assets to ‚Äúsome of the best companies in the world‚Äù would satisfy American security worries and still benefit Beijing. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a good deal for China,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTikTok is good for China. And I think they‚Äôd like to see us do a deal, especially the deal that we have pretty much done.‚Äù When asked about whether tariff relief might be offered if China accepts the divestiture plan, the president answered that nothing was off the table. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a natural ‚Äî if we‚Äôre making a deal. I guess we‚Äôll spend five minutes to talk about TikTok. It wouldn‚Äôt take very long,‚Äù he said. Trump declined to describe any timetable for new talks or for easing duties. He also avoided saying whether he and Xi had spoken directly, stressing instead that any overture from Beijing would reflect Xi‚Äôs personal approval. ‚ÄúIf you knew him you would know that if they reached out, he knew exactly,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúHe knew everything about it, he runs it very tight, very strong, very smart.‚Äù With both sides dug in publicly, it remains unclear how soon formal negotiations might resume.

The media outlet Daehan Kyungjae reported that FIU, which answers to the Financial Services Commission (FSC), will wrap up its investigation on April 18. The probe began on March 17, and was originally planned to conclude on March 28. The investigation is primarily aimed at checking exchanges‚Äô compliance with anti-money laundering protocols. After Bithumb, Coinone will be the last of South Korea‚Äôs five fiat KRW-trading exchanges to face the FIU probe.

(Source: CoinGecko) The Upbit probe unearthed a slew of Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verification violations, with the FSC later dishing out a three-month punishment. In late March, a branch of the Seoul Administrative Court suspended the ban for 30 days . The media outlet quoted an anonymous official from an unnamed domestic crypto exchange as saying that the FIU‚Äôs extension ‚Äúmay be due to the vast amount of data‚Äù it is now combing through. However, the same individual claimed there was a ‚Äúsuspicion‚Äù that the delay was due to a specific transaction. The individual claimed that Bithumb wallets had ‚Äútransferred more than 60 million coins, worth approximately 22.4 billion won (over $15.8 million), to an exchange that is not registered with the financial authorities.‚Äù The FIU plans to begin its on-site inspection at Coinone on April 21.

(Source: CoinGecko) The FSS claims that a former Bithumb CEO and a current advisor used company-provided apartment deposits to lease a property to a third party. The regulator thinks that one of the executives used a KRW 1.1 billion ($778,000) deposit from Bithumb to pay for a home they then leased to a resident in exchange for rent payments worth around $2 million. The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors‚Äô Office‚Äôs crypto investigation team followed up with a raid of Bithumb‚Äôs headquarters last month. Coinone, meanwhile, faced an FSS probe of its own late last year. The investigation followed a massive December 9 Movement (MOVE) token price spike on the Coinone platform.

The crypto market in 2025 is rewarding early movers who back projects with working products, clear roadmaps, and rising demand. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain dominant, new projects are quietly gaining ground‚Äîand delivering serious growth. In this guide, we break down six of the top cryptos to buy now, including BlockDAG , Web3 ai , Cold Wallet, Unstaked, Dragoin, and Web3Bay. Whether you‚Äôre after cutting-edge AI, privacy tools, meme coin potential, or real-world e-commerce integration, these tokens check all the right boxes. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) ‚Äî Best Crypto Infrastructure Pick Right Now BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the best cryptos to invest in now. It‚Äôs raised over $214.5 million, sold 16,600+ mining rigs, and its X1 mobile miner app has hit 800,000+ users. What makes BlockDAG different is its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology. Instead of creating one block at a time like traditional chains, it allows for multiple blocks to be created in parallel‚Äîmaking transactions faster and cheaper. The project is EVM-compatible , making it easy for developers to migrate dApps from Ethereum. Currently in Batch 27 at $0.0248 , BDAG‚Äôs projected ROI stands at 2,380% , especially with its mainnet launching in just 4 months . For those looking for a project that blends technical strength with growing adoption, BlockDAG is one of the best cryptos to buy now . 2. Web3 ai (WAI) ‚Äî Top AI Crypto With Real Utility From Day One Web3 ai merges artificial intelligence with crypto to give users a powerful suite of tools for smarter investing. Unlike most presale projects, Web3 ai already offers 12 live tools , including an AI trading assistant, price prediction engine, scam detector, yield farming advisor, and automated trading bot. The project uses advanced machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to deliver real-time insights across multiple chains and exchanges. The $WAI token, priced at $0.10 in Batch 1, gives users full access to the platform and a future listing price of $0.80 makes the upside extremely attractive. If you want a working product, a clear roadmap, and next-gen AI tools in one package, Web3 ai is one of the best new cryptos to buy now . 3. Cold Wallet (CWT) ‚Äî Best Privacy Crypto Wallet in the Market If privacy matters to you, Cold Wallet could be the best crypto to buy now for protecting your assets. Unlike most wallets that track IP addresses, log behavior, or expose transaction data, Cold Wallet is invisible by design. It functions like a cold wallet but remains online and fully accessible. Powered by zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) , it supports private transactions, hidden balances, and anonymous authentication. The $CWT token , now in presale at $0.007 , will unlock premium features and governance. With a launch price of $0.35 , Cold Wallet offers serious upside for early backers. As hacks and surveillance increase in Web3, Cold Wallet is standing out as one of the best cryptos to buy now for privacy-first users. 4. Unstaked (UNSD) ‚Äî Best AI Agent Platform for Earning and Engagement Unstaked is the first crypto platform that deploys AI agents to run and grow your online communities‚Äîcompletely autonomously. These agents create content, reply to users, and optimize behavior in real-time. They‚Äôre tied to your wallet and earn based on actual performance through a system called Proof of Intelligence (PoI). The token, $UNSD , is priced at just $0.0065 in presale, with a projected launch market cap of over $1 billion . With $20 million in liquidity provisioned at launch , this isn‚Äôt just an idea‚Äîit‚Äôs a fully functional platform from day one. For those who want real AI utility, merit-based rewards, and early entry, Unstaked is among the best cryptos to invest in today. 5. Dragoin (DDGN) ‚Äî Meme Coin With Burn Mechanics and Scarcity Dragoin is not your typical meme coin. Every transaction burns a portion of the supply, creating real scarcity. This smart deflationary design helps prevent the common inflation issues found in many meme projects. The token, $DDGN , is in public presale , with a launch price set at $0.002 . Inspired by SHIB and PEPE but with better tokenomics, Dragoin offers meme potential without the empty speculation. If it hits its upside targets, early holders could see gains as high as 6,700% . If you‚Äôre looking for the best meme crypto to buy now, Dragoin is worth serious attention. 6. Web3Bay (3BAY) ‚Äî Best Crypto for Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is building the Amazon of Web3‚Äîa fully decentralized, peer-to-peer e-commerce platform. It supports both crypto and fiat payments, including PayPal, Google Pay, and Apple Pay. With smart contracts handling escrow and settlements, Web3Bay eliminates the need for intermediaries. The $3BAY token is priced at $0.00524 in Stage 5 , with $1.7 million raised and 400M tokens sold . Token holders get discounts, governance rights, and staking rewards. As the project evolves, plans include NFT integration, lending, and full DAO governance. Web3Bay is easily one of the best cryptos to buy now if you‚Äôre bullish on blockchain adoption in e-commerce.

Despite the current lack of a strong bullish momentum, many crypto analysts are banking on a bullish continuation and a new Bitcoin price all-time high before the end of 2025. According to crypto analyst TradingShot, Bitcoin could be approaching the final leg of this bull cycle, predicting a peak above $125,000. However, this analysis comes with a caveat that an extended bear market might roll in by October 2025. Long-Term Bitcoin Cycles Hint At Imminent Peak TradingShot‚Äôs analysis, which was posted on the TradingView platform, is based on over a decade of symmetrical Bitcoin market behavior that shows both bull and bear cycles unfolding in consistent timeframes. According to TradingShot, the bull cycles dating back to 2015 have all lasted approximately 1,064 days, or 152 weeks, with each cycle topping out almost exactly three years after the previous bottom. On the other hand, bear cycles have consistently lasted for around one year, either from December to December or November to November. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Following Analyst‚Äôs Prediction For Bullish Breakout, Here‚Äôs The Target This historical symmetry is reflected in the chart below, which highlights three bull cycles followed by three bear periods, all forming a repeating pattern. The most recent bottom, recorded on November 7, 2022, marked the start of the current bull cycle. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin could reach its next peak in the week of October 6, 2025. The bull cycle has led to Bitcoin breaking above $100,000 and now with an all-time high of $108,786, but like many others, the analyst predicted this peak will still be broken this year. This peak will likely mirror the explosive rallies that ended the 2017 and 2021 cycles and eventually surpass $125,000. Sell Everything In October 2025, Buy Back In October 2026 TradingShot‚Äôs primary advice is blunt but strategic: sell everything by October 2025. According to the analyst, this window could be the final opportunity to exit near the top before the next bear cycle takes hold. Counting 1064 days from the most recent bottom of $15,600 in November 07 2022, gives a time estimate for the next cycle top on October 6 2025. If history repeats itself, the subsequent bearish phase will likely last for 12 months and bottom out around October 12, 2026, before the next bull phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Stalls Below $85,000 Psychological Level, Why A Drop To $74,000 Is Possible This timing is not speculative; it‚Äôs based on a consistent one-year bearish phase across three full market cycles. Therefore, it would be better to sell before October 2025 and start accumulating by October 2026. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $84,500, up by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and 48% away from the predicted peak of $125,000.

The largest U.S. crypto exchange has rolled out improved failsafes, enhanced liquidity measures, and faster transaction processing. Additionally, Coinbase promised to speed up Solana transaction processing times in January after users encountered problems with depositing and withdrawing SOL. Coinbase supercharges Solana support with 5x faster throughput According to Coinbase , enhancements allowed quicker and more dependable sends and receives, reaffirming its dedication to providing industry-best results and dependability for its users. In addition, the crypto exchange highlighted that to satisfy demand, as Solana expanded in the future, it kept investing in its infrastructure. The crypto exchange also shared an X post that detailed the enhancements. Based on the X post, these enhancements included asynchronous transaction processing that will result in a five-fold increase in block processing throughput, four-fold improvements to the remote procedure call (RPC), failover augmentations to increase resilience, liquidity optimizations, and enhanced operational controls. Moreover, on January 21, Coinbase shared a post on the X platform stating that ‚ÄúCoinbase has seen unprecedented Solana transaction activity ‚Ä¶ and our systems have been unable to validate and process transactions at the speed that we are receiving them.‚Äù This came after users experienced delays when attempting to withdraw or deposit SOL, sometimes lasting hours. Interestingly, according to the crypto exchange, the volume of transactions at that time was ten times higher than usual. Meme coin trading has gained popularity, which has led to Solana‚Äôs widespread adoption Extensive meme coin trading had been a major factor in Solana‚Äôs high transaction volumes. This resulted partly from a significant rise in Solana‚Äôs market capitalization that occurred the weekend before the inauguration when the new president and first lady released meme coins on the blockchain, contributing to the rise in popularity of meme coin trading. However, weeks before Trump‚Äôs token launch, reports from sources revealed that Solana‚Äôs overall onchain trading volume and fees had reached all-time highs due to memecoin trading volume. On January 5, Solana‚Äôs onchain volume reached an all-time high of $3.79 billion, with approximately 4.5 million active addresses. Solana is up nearly 23% over the past week, making it one of the biggest gainers in the top 100 coins. According to CoinMarketCap reports, Solana is trading at $133.32, reflecting a 0.04% increase in the past 24 hours. With a market capitalization of around $69.68 billion, it holds the sixth spot among all cryptocurrencies by market value. T he recent surge comes amid Wednesday‚Äôs launch of Canada‚Äôs first spot Solana ETFs from issuers, including 3iQ, Evolve, CI, and Purpose. The exchange-traded funds feature staking functionality, providing investors with yield obtained by issuers staking their SOL to support the Solana blockchain. Spot Solana ETFs have yet to be approved in the United States. However, firms including VanEck, 21Shares, and Bitwise have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch such products. Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs were both approved in the U.S. in 2024. Alongside Solana, issuers have filed to launch a potentially wide range of additional spot crypto funds in the States, including those tied to XRP, Dogecoin, and even President Donald Trump‚Äôs official Solana-based meme coin.

Enter Chatbot Arena, the AI benchmarking platform that has become a cornerstone for major AI labs. Now, in a major development, Chatbot Arena is taking a giant leap forward by forming its own company, Arena Intelligence Inc. This move signals a significant commitment to enhancing its platform and solidifying its role in the rapidly expanding AI landscape. Let‚Äôs dive into what this exciting development means for the AI community and beyond. What is Chatbot Arena and Why Does It Matter? Before we delve into the new company formation, it‚Äôs crucial to understand what Chatbot Arena is and why it has become so influential. Launched in 2023 and primarily managed by researchers affiliated with UC Berkeley, Chatbot Arena is a crowdsourced platform designed for AI model testing . Think of it as a neutral battleground where different AI models, including flagship models from giants like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, are put to the test by a global community of users. Here‚Äôs why Chatbot Arena is so important: Neutral Benchmarking: It offers a platform free from bias, allowing for objective comparisons between different AI models. This is vital in an industry where marketing hype can often overshadow genuine performance metrics. Community-Driven Evaluation: The power of crowdsourcing means a wide range of perspectives contribute to the evaluation process, making the benchmarking more comprehensive and reflective of real-world usage. Industry Standard: Major AI labs rely on Chatbot Arena for testing and showcasing their models, highlighting its credibility and influence within the AI industry. Transparency: By making the evaluation process public, Chatbot Arena fosters transparency and accountability in AI development. Arena Intelligence Inc.: A New Chapter for AI Benchmarking The announcement of Arena Intelligence Inc. marks a pivotal moment for Chatbot Arena. According to a recent blog post and reports from Bloomberg, this new corporate structure is designed to inject resources and accelerate the platform‚Äôs development. The team behind Chatbot Arena emphasizes that this move will enable them to significantly improve the platform beyond its current capabilities. What can we expect from this new AI company formation ? Enhanced Platform Features: With dedicated resources, Arena Intelligence Inc. is poised to introduce new features, improve user experience, and potentially expand the types of AI models and benchmarks offered. Sustained Neutrality: A core promise from the team is the continued commitment to providing a neutral testing ground, uninfluenced by external vested interests. This is crucial for maintaining the platform‚Äôs integrity and trustworthiness. Business Model Exploration: While details are still under wraps, the formation of a company suggests the exploration of sustainable business models.

This latest outburst has sent ripples through financial markets, raising questions about the future direction of U.S. monetary policy and the independence of the central bank. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors closely monitoring global economic signals, this development is particularly noteworthy as it adds another layer of uncertainty to the already complex macroeconomic landscape. Let‚Äôs delve deeper into Trump‚Äôs accusations, the Fed‚Äôs stance, and what this all means for the broader economy and potentially, the crypto markets. Why is Trump Targeting Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve? Trump‚Äôs criticism of Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve is not new, but this recent call for his removal marks a significant intensification. At the heart of Trump‚Äôs discontent lies the belief that the Fed‚Äôs monetary policy is hindering economic growth and putting the U.S. at a disadvantage compared to other nations. According to a post by Walter Bloomberg on X, Trump specifically pointed to the European Central Bank (ECB) as an example, highlighting their recent interest rate cut ‚Äì their seventh ‚Äì as a proactive measure the Fed has failed to emulate. Trump argues that the Fed‚Äôs inaction is making the U.S. less competitive globally. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of Trump‚Äôs main grievances: Accusation of Inaction: Trump claims the Fed is ‚Äúfalling behind global peers‚Äù like the ECB by not cutting interest rates aggressively enough. Economic Growth Concerns: He believes higher interest rates are stifling US economy growth and potentially leading to a recession. Global Competitiveness: Trump suggests that lower interest rates in other countries give them an unfair economic advantage over the US economy . Personal Animosity: There‚Äôs a history of strained relations between Trump and Jerome Powell , dating back to Powell‚Äôs appointment during Trump‚Äôs presidency. It‚Äôs important to remember that central bank independence is a cornerstone of modern economic policy in many countries. The idea is to shield monetary policy decisions from short-term political pressures, allowing central bankers to focus on long-term economic stability and price stability. Trump‚Äôs public pronouncements and calls for Powell‚Äôs removal challenge this established norm. The Fed‚Äôs Stance on Interest Rates and the US Economy The Federal Reserve , under Jerome Powell‚Äôs leadership, has been navigating a delicate balancing act. Their primary mandate is to maintain price stability (control inflation) and promote maximum employment. In recent times, the Fed has been focused on combating inflation, which surged in the aftermath of the pandemic and global supply chain disruptions. To tame inflation, the Fed aggressively raised interest rates throughout 2022 and 2023. While inflation has cooled down from its peak, it remains above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target. The Fed‚Äôs current approach is to maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance until they are confident that inflation is sustainably moving towards their target. Here‚Äôs a summary of the Fed‚Äôs current position: Factor Fed‚Äôs Stance Inflation Concerned, still above target Interest Rates Currently holding steady, but data-dependent US Economy Growth Monitoring, aiming for a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù (slowing inflation without causing a recession) Global Economic Conditions Considering, but primarily focused on domestic mandate The Fed argues that premature interest rate cuts could reignite inflationary pressures, potentially leading to more economic pain down the line. They emphasize a data-dependent approach, meaning their decisions will be guided by incoming economic data, particularly inflation and employment figures. Market Reaction and Betting Odds on Powell‚Äôs Departure Financial markets are sensitive to any signals regarding the future of monetary policy and the stability of the Federal Reserve . Trump‚Äôs comments have undoubtedly introduced an element of uncertainty. According to reports, betting odds on Jerome Powell‚Äôs departure this year have seen a notable increase. Kalshi, a prediction market platform, reported that the odds of Powell leaving his position in 2024 rose to 26% following Trump‚Äôs remarks. This increase in betting odds reflects market participants‚Äô acknowledgment of the heightened political pressure on Powell. While it‚Äôs important to note that these are just betting odds and not definitive predictions, they do indicate a growing perception of risk surrounding Powell‚Äôs tenure. Here‚Äôs what this market reaction suggests: Increased Uncertainty: Trump‚Äôs comments inject uncertainty into the market‚Äôs outlook for Fed policy. Potential for Volatility: Further escalations in Trump‚Äôs rhetoric could lead to increased market volatility, particularly in bond and stock markets. Focus on Fed Independence: The situation highlights the importance of central bank independence and the potential risks when this principle is challenged. Monitoring Political Developments: Investors will be closely watching political developments and any further signals regarding the Fed‚Äôs future leadership. Impact on Cryptocurrency Markets While the immediate focus of Trump‚Äôs criticism is on traditional financial markets and the US economy , the cryptocurrency market is not immune to these developments. Crypto markets are increasingly intertwined with the broader macroeconomic environment. Here‚Äôs how Trump‚Äôs stance on Jerome Powell and the Fed could potentially impact the crypto space: Economic Uncertainty & Safe Haven Assets: Increased economic uncertainty can sometimes drive investors towards perceived safe haven assets, and in some cases, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have been considered as such. However, this relationship is not always consistent and can be influenced by various factors. Dollar Strength/Weakness: Fed policy and interest rate decisions can impact the strength of the US dollar. A weaker dollar could, in theory, make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more attractive to international investors. Conversely, a stronger dollar could have the opposite effect. Risk Appetite: Overall market sentiment and risk appetite are crucial drivers for crypto markets. If Trump‚Äôs criticism leads to broader market jitters or a perception of increased economic risk, it could impact investor sentiment towards cryptocurrencies as well. Regulatory Landscape: Political shifts and changes in administration can also influence the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. While not directly related to Powell‚Äôs removal, the broader political climate can indirectly affect crypto regulations. Navigating the Uncertainty: Key Takeaways Trump‚Äôs renewed attack on Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve adds another layer of complexity to the economic and market outlook. For those involved in the cryptocurrency space, it‚Äôs crucial to stay informed and understand the potential implications. Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Monitor Economic Data: Pay close attention to key economic indicators, particularly inflation and employment data, as these will heavily influence the Fed‚Äôs future decisions. Stay Updated on Fed Communication: Follow speeches and statements from Fed officials, including Jerome Powell , to gauge their thinking and potential policy shifts. Assess Market Sentiment: Keep an eye on market sentiment and volatility in both traditional and crypto markets, as these can be indicators of investor reactions to political and economic developments. Diversification and Risk Management: In times of uncertainty, diversification and robust risk management strategies are even more critical in your investment portfolio, including crypto holdings. Understand Macroeconomic Interplay: Recognize that cryptocurrency markets are increasingly influenced by macroeconomic factors and global economic events. Conclusion: A Test for Fed Independence? Donald Trump‚Äôs forceful call for Jerome Powell‚Äôs removal is more than just political rhetoric; it‚Äôs a direct challenge to the independence of the Federal Reserve and a potential source of market instability. While the likelihood of Powell‚Äôs immediate removal remains uncertain, the episode underscores the ongoing tensions between political pressures and central bank autonomy. For cryptocurrency investors and the broader financial world, this situation warrants close monitoring. The coming months will be crucial in determining how this drama unfolds and what implications it holds for the US economy and global markets.

The law gives the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic the exclusive right to issue the digital som, establish the rules for its issuance and circulation, and oversee the platform on which the national currency will operate, Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs presidential office said on April 17. However, a final decision on whether to officially issue the CBDC is not expected until the end of 2026, local outlet Trend News Agency reported in December. If the central bank decides to adopt the digital som, it would also need to outline cryptographic protection measures to ensure the digital som remains secure and isn‚Äôt used for fraudulent transactions. Testing of the digital som platform is expected to take place sometime this year. Zhaparov‚Äôs sign-off comes nearly a month after Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs parliament, the Jogorku Kenesh, approved the amendment to Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs constitutional law on March 18. CBDCs continue to be heavily criticized by some members of the crypto community, flagging concerns that they could undermine financial privacy and enable excessive government oversight, among other things. While 115 nations have initiated CBDC projects, only four CBDCs have officially launched ‚Äî the Bahamas Sand Dollar, Nigeria‚Äôs e-Naira, Zimbabwe‚Äôs ZiG and Jamaica‚Äôs JAM-DEX, data from cbdctracker.org shows.

The financial landscape in Hong Kong is about to witness a significant shift as Huaxia Fund, a subsidiary of China Asset Management (ChinaAMC), prepares to inject a powerful feature into its ETH ETF staking product. Imagine earning rewards simply by holding onto your Ethereum ETF ‚Äì that‚Äôs precisely what Huaxia Fund is set to offer. Let‚Äôs dive into how this game-changing development is reshaping the Hong Kong crypto ETF market and what it means for investors like you. What‚Äôs the Buzz Around Huaxia Fund‚Äôs ETH ETF Staking? On May 15th, Huaxia Fund will officially introduce staking capabilities to its Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). This makes them only the second entity in Hong Kong to embrace this innovative feature, marking a significant leap forward for crypto investment products in the region. But why is this such a big deal? Let‚Äôs break it down: First Mover Advantage (Almost): While not the absolute first, Huaxia Fund is among the pioneers in Hong Kong to offer Ethereum staking within an ETF structure. This positions them as a forward-thinking player in the rapidly evolving crypto ETF space. Regulatory Green Light: This move is made possible by the recent progressive changes in crypto regulations Hong Kong . The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has updated its rules to allow regulated firms to provide crypto staking services, paving the way for institutions like Huaxia Fund to innovate. Institutional Backing and Trust: As a subsidiary of ChinaAMC, a major player in asset management, Huaxia Fund brings credibility and trust to the crypto ETF market. Their foray into staking further legitimizes crypto investments within traditional financial frameworks. Enhanced Investor Appeal: Staking adds an extra layer of attractiveness to ETH ETFs. Investors can now potentially earn passive income on their ETH holdings through staking rewards, in addition to potential capital appreciation. This isn‚Äôt just about adding a feature; it‚Äôs about fundamentally enhancing the value proposition of a Huaxia Fund ETF and making crypto investments more appealing to a wider audience in Hong Kong. The Mechanics: How Does ETH ETF Staking Work? For those new to the concept, staking might sound a bit technical. But the core idea is quite simple. When you stake your Ethereum, you are essentially participating in the network‚Äôs operation. Here‚Äôs a simplified explanation in the context of an ETF: Holding ETH ETF Shares: You, as an investor, hold shares of the Huaxia Fund ETH ETF. These shares represent ownership of underlying Ethereum. ETF Provider Stakes ETH: Huaxia Fund, as the ETF provider, takes a portion of the ETH held by the ETF and stakes it on the Ethereum network. Earning Staking Rewards: By staking, the ETF provider earns staking rewards. These rewards are generated by the Ethereum network for validating transactions and securing the blockchain. Passing Rewards to Investors (Potentially): While not explicitly stated in the provided content whether the staking rewards will be directly passed on to ETF holders, in typical staking ETF models, a portion of these rewards are often reflected in the ETF‚Äôs overall performance, potentially increasing the ETF‚Äôs value over time. It‚Äôs crucial to check the specific ETF prospectus for details on reward distribution. Key Player: OSL Digital Services To ensure the security and efficiency of this staking operation, Huaxia Fund is partnering with OSL Digital Services. OSL will provide the crucial custody and staking infrastructure. This partnership highlights the growing synergy between traditional finance and specialized crypto service providers. Why is Hong Kong Becoming a Crypto Hub? The Regulatory Shift Hong Kong‚Äôs proactive approach to crypto regulation is a key factor driving these innovations. For a while, the regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies globally has been a patchwork of approaches, ranging from outright bans to cautious acceptance. Hong Kong, however, is positioning itself as a more welcoming and regulated hub for digital assets. The recent rule change by the SFC, allowing regulated entities to offer crypto staking, is a testament to this shift. Factors Contributing to Hong Kong‚Äôs Crypto-Friendly Stance: Desire to be a Financial Innovation Hub: Hong Kong has historically been a major financial center. Embracing crypto and fintech innovation is seen as crucial to maintaining this status in the evolving global economy. Clearer Regulatory Framework: By establishing clear rules and guidelines, Hong Kong is aiming to attract legitimate crypto businesses and investors while mitigating risks. The SFC‚Äôs move on staking is a prime example of this clarity. Competition in Asia: There‚Äôs a regional race to become a crypto hub. Locations like Singapore and Dubai are also vying for this position. Hong Kong‚Äôs recent regulatory moves signal its intent to be a serious contender. Attracting Institutional Investment: Regulations that foster trust and security are essential to attract institutional investors into the crypto space. Allowing staking within regulated ETFs is a step in this direction. This supportive regulatory environment is not just beneficial for companies like Huaxia Fund; it‚Äôs creating a more vibrant and dynamic crypto ecosystem in Hong Kong, potentially attracting talent, investment, and further innovation. Benefits of ETH ETF Staking: A Win-Win Scenario? The introduction of staking to ETH ETFs offers several potential benefits for various stakeholders: Stakeholder Benefit Investors Potential to earn passive income through staking rewards, enhancing overall returns. Exposure to Ethereum with the convenience and security of a regulated ETF. Simplified staking process ‚Äì no need to manage staking infrastructure directly. ETF Providers (like Huaxia Fund) Differentiated product offering, potentially attracting more investors and assets under management. Opportunity to generate additional revenue through staking rewards (part of which may be reinvested or contribute to ETF fees). Enhanced reputation as an innovator in the crypto ETF market. Ethereum Network Increased participation in staking, contributing to network security and decentralization. Greater adoption of Ethereum as an asset class. Hong Kong as a Financial Hub Strengthened position as a leading center for fintech and crypto innovation. Attraction of crypto businesses and investment. Economic growth and job creation in the crypto sector. While the benefits appear substantial, it‚Äôs also important to consider potential challenges. Challenges and Considerations Introducing staking to ETH ETFs is not without its complexities and potential challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty (Evolving Landscape): While Hong Kong‚Äôs regulations are becoming clearer, the global regulatory landscape for crypto is still evolving. Future changes could impact staking ETFs. Custodial Risks: Secure custody of staked ETH is paramount. Reliance on third-party custodians like OSL introduces a layer of dependency and potential risk, although OSL is a reputable provider. Slashing Risks: In proof-of-stake systems like Ethereum, there‚Äôs a risk of ‚Äúslashing‚Äù ‚Äì penalties imposed on validators for misbehavior. ETF providers need robust risk management to mitigate this. Complexity for Investors: While simplified compared to direct staking, understanding the nuances of staking ETFs and how rewards are distributed may still require some investor education. Fee Structures: Investors need to be aware of the fee structures associated with staking ETFs and how these fees impact net returns after staking rewards. Actionable Insights for Investors Considering the developments around Hong Kong crypto ETF staking, here are some actionable insights for investors: Do Your Due Diligence: Before investing in any ETH ETF, especially staking ETFs, thoroughly research the ETF provider (like Huaxia Fund ETF ), understand the fee structure, and review the ETF prospectus for details on staking mechanisms and reward distribution. Understand Staking Risks: Familiarize yourself with the risks associated with staking, including slashing and custodial risks. Assess your risk tolerance. Compare Different ETFs: As more staking ETFs become available, compare their features, fees, and potential returns. Don‚Äôt just focus on staking; consider the overall ETF structure and management. Stay Informed on Regulations: Keep abreast of regulatory developments in Hong Kong and globally related to crypto and ETFs. Regulatory changes can impact the landscape. Consider Long-Term Potential: View staking ETFs as a long-term investment in the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader crypto space. Staking rewards can compound over time. Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward for Crypto ETFs Huaxia Fund‚Äôs move to add staking to its ETH ETF in Hong Kong is undoubtedly a revolutionary step. It signifies the growing maturity of the crypto market and the increasing acceptance of digital assets within mainstream finance. As crypto regulations Hong Kong become more refined and supportive, we can expect to see further innovation and adoption of crypto investment products. For investors, this development opens up exciting new avenues to participate in the Ethereum ecosystem and potentially enhance their portfolio returns.

43467616,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150626,1744937434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Savvy OpenAI Unveils Flex Processing: Unlock Cheaper AI for Smart Tasks,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-flex-processing-cheaper-ai/,"In the fast-evolving world of artificial intelligence, where every byte and millisecond counts, OpenAI is making a smart move to democratize access and optimize costs. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space who are constantly seeking efficient and scalable solutions, this development is particularly noteworthy. Imagine leveraging powerful AI without breaking the bank ‚Äì that‚Äôs the promise of OpenAI‚Äôs latest innovation: Flex Processing . What is OpenAI Flex Processing and Why Should You Care About Cheaper AI? OpenAI, the powerhouse behind cutting-edge AI models, is rolling out Flex Processing , a new API option designed to offer significantly reduced prices for AI model usage. This isn‚Äôt just a minor price tweak; it‚Äôs a strategic shift to compete more effectively with rivals like Google and to cater to a broader range of AI application needs. The trade-off? Slower response times and potential occasional resource unavailability. But for many tasks, especially those not requiring lightning-fast speeds, this is a game-changer. Why is this relevant to the crypto world? Because as blockchain and AI converge, cost-effective AI solutions become crucial for everything from smart contract analysis to decentralized application enhancements. Cheaper AI means more accessible innovation. Diving Deep into the Details of API Pricing for AI Models Let‚Äôs get down to brass tacks and see how much cheaper AI we‚Äôre talking about with Flex Processing . Currently in beta for OpenAI‚Äôs o3 and o4-mini reasoning models, this option is specifically targeted at tasks that aren‚Äôt mission-critical or time-sensitive. Think of activities like model evaluations, enriching datasets, or handling asynchronous workloads ‚Äì tasks that are important but don‚Äôt demand immediate results. The price reduction is a flat 50% across the board. Here‚Äôs a quick comparison: Model Processing Type Input Tokens (per 1M) Output Tokens (per 1M) o3 Standard $10 $40 o3 Flex Processing $5 $20 o4-mini Standard $1.10 $4.40 o4-mini Flex Processing $0.55 $2.20 As you can see, the savings are substantial. For instance, with o3 Flex Processing , you‚Äôre looking at $5 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words) and $20 per million output tokens, compared to the standard rates of $10 and $40 respectively. For the more compact o4-mini, the drop is equally impressive, making it even more accessible for various applications. This price cut directly addresses the rising artificial intelligence costs which can be a barrier to entry for many developers and smaller projects. Why Now? The Competitive Landscape and Artificial Intelligence Costs The timing of Flex Processing is no coincidence. The frontier of AI development is becoming increasingly expensive, with top-tier models demanding significant computational resources. At the same time, the market is seeing a surge of more efficient, budget-friendly models from competitors. Google, for example, recently launched Gemini 2.5 Flash, a reasoning model that boasts performance on par with or even exceeding DeepSeek‚Äôs R1, but at a lower input token cost. This competitive pressure is pushing AI companies to innovate not just in model capabilities but also in pricing strategies. OpenAI‚Äôs move is a clear indication that the race for AI dominance is also a race to offer the most cost-effective solutions. For businesses and developers, this means more choices and the potential to optimize their API pricing based on their specific needs. ID Verification and Access to Advanced AI Models In conjunction with the launch of Flex Processing , OpenAI has also introduced a new ID verification process for developers in tiers 1-3 of their usage hierarchy to access the o3 model. These tiers are based on spending on OpenAI services. Furthermore, features like o3‚Äôs reasoning summaries and streaming API support are also gated behind this verification. OpenAI states that this measure is aimed at preventing misuse and policy violations by malicious actors. While it adds a step to the onboarding process, it underscores the company‚Äôs commitment to responsible AI development and deployment. For legitimate users, this is a small hurdle to ensure a safer and more reliable AI ecosystem. Benefits of Embracing Flex Processing for AI Tasks Significant Cost Reduction: The 50% price cut is the most obvious advantage. This can dramatically lower the operational expenses for projects that utilize AI models, making AI more financially viable for a wider range of applications. Ideal for Non-Critical Tasks: For processes like data enrichment, model evaluations, and asynchronous workflows where immediate response isn‚Äôt crucial, Flex Processing offers an economically sound alternative without sacrificing the power of OpenAI‚Äôs models. Democratizing AI Access: By lowering the barrier to entry in terms of cost, OpenAI is making its advanced AI models more accessible to smaller businesses, startups, researchers, and hobbyist developers who might have been priced out before. Optimized Resource Allocation: Flex Processing allows OpenAI to better manage its computational resources by directing less time-sensitive tasks to less premium infrastructure, thus improving overall system efficiency. Use Cases: Where Does Flex Processing Shine? Flex Processing isn‚Äôt meant for every AI application, but it‚Äôs perfectly suited for a variety of use cases, particularly those where speed isn‚Äôt paramount: Model Evaluations and Benchmarking: Testing and evaluating AI models often involves numerous runs and iterations. Cheaper AI processing for these tasks can significantly reduce research and development costs. Data Enrichment: Enhancing datasets with AI-generated insights, summaries, or classifications can be done efficiently and affordably using Flex Processing for background tasks. Asynchronous Workloads: Applications that involve tasks that can be processed in the background without immediate user interaction, such as content generation queues or batch processing of data, are ideal candidates. Internal Tooling and Experimentation: Developing internal AI-powered tools or experimenting with new AI functionalities within a company can be made more cost-effective, encouraging innovation and exploration. Potential Challenges and Considerations While Flex Processing offers numerous benefits, it‚Äôs important to be aware of the trade-offs: Slower Response Times: The most significant drawback is the reduced speed. Applications requiring real-time responses or low latency will not be suitable for Flex Processing . Occasional Unavailability: The service is explicitly stated to have potential resource unavailability. For critical systems that require constant uptime, this might be a concern, though the term ‚Äòoccasional‚Äô suggests it‚Äôs not a frequent issue. Beta Status: Being in beta means the service is still under development and may be subject to changes, including pricing or availability. Users should be prepared for potential adjustments as OpenAI refines the offering. Actionable Insights: Leveraging Flex Processing for Your Projects For those looking to integrate AI into their projects or optimize existing AI workflows, here are some actionable steps: Identify Suitable Tasks: Analyze your AI workloads and pinpoint tasks that are not time-critical and can tolerate slower processing. Model evaluations, data enrichment, and background processing are prime candidates. Evaluate Cost Savings: Calculate the potential cost reduction by switching to Flex Processing for eligible tasks. The 50% reduction can lead to substantial savings, especially for high-volume usage. Test and Monitor Performance: Experiment with Flex Processing on a smaller scale initially to assess the actual response times and reliability for your specific use cases. Monitor performance to ensure it meets your operational requirements. Plan for Asynchronous Workflows: Design or adapt your applications to leverage asynchronous processing where possible. This will allow you to take full advantage of Flex Processing for background tasks without impacting user-facing performance. Stay Updated: Keep an eye on OpenAI‚Äôs updates regarding Flex Processing , especially as it is currently in beta. Be aware of any changes in pricing, features, or terms of service. Conclusion: A Smart Step Towards Accessible and Affordable AI OpenAI‚Äôs Flex Processing is a smart and timely response to the growing demand for cost-effective AI solutions. By offering a 50% reduction in API pricing for slower, non-critical tasks, OpenAI is not only making its powerful AI models more accessible but also strategically positioning itself in an increasingly competitive market. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain community, this development opens up new avenues for integrating AI into various applications without the prohibitive costs often associated with cutting-edge AI technology. As artificial intelligence costs continue to be a crucial factor in adoption, initiatives like Flex Processing are vital in democratizing AI and fostering broader innovation across industries.

As ETH heats up, it‚Äôs not alone, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is catching the same tailwind. Presale phase 4 has started since the third phase sold out more quickly than anticipated. The fundraising has surpassed $6.8 million while drawing in more than 8400 holders. Investors currently purchase at $0.025 with the understanding that the price will reach $0.03 after phase 5 begins. The current investors stand to gain a 140% return on investment before the project begins trading at $0.06. This emerging DeFi token is setting itself up to mirror ETH‚Äôs trajectory, on a much smaller price tag, and with potentially much larger gains. Mutuum Finance Presale Soars as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance obtained popularity among the decentralized lending sector because its dual-lending model brings fresh ideas to the market. Mutuum Finance earned quick marketplace adoption following its presale start-up because investors from more than 8,400 participants contributed $6.8 million. Investors can make profits from the Phase 5 price rise of Mutuum Finance tokens from $0.025 during Phase 4 to $0.03. Experts identify Mutuum Finance as the least valued DeFi startup for present times and foresee an anticipated value surpassing $1 during public distribution. In a recent update, Mutuum Finance introduced an interactive dashboard that displays a real-time leaderboard, highlighting the top 50 token holders. These investors won‚Äôt just get recognized, they‚Äôll also earn bonus tokens for maintaining their spot on the leaderboard. Shaking Up the DeFi Game with a Hybrid Lending Strategy What distinguishes Mutuum Finance is its trailblazing combination of two extremely impactful lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). While the P2C model allows users to invest in liquidity pools and earn passive income in the way of automatic smart contract lending in USDT, the P2P model allows users to lend and borrow directly from each other, cutting out the middleman. Through the integration of these two models, Mutuum Finance brings a new degree of security, efficiency, and decentralization to the DeFi market, making it an attractive option for investors looking for high-yield investments. Building a Secure and Stable Ecosystem In order to offer long-term stability, Mutuum Finance is launching a totally collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. In contrast to earlier algorithmic stablecoins that have been difficult, this stablecoin will be over-collateralized, reducing risk and enhancing confidence. Open financial architectures and audited smart contracts are also employed by the platform in order to eliminate the vulnerabilities that have weakened other DeFi projects. Mutuum Finance strives to enhance its network of users through profitable incentive systems. The $100,000 giveaway divides 10 rewards of $10,000 MUTM tokens while the referral system provides bonuses for successful individual and organizational referrals. Platform users who join early will gain access to exclusive staking pools while also receiving governance voting rights and VIP information updates that keep them involved on the platform for extended periods. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth The hash platform created its economic model specifically for extended platform development. The platform controls presale token releases while implementing deflationary mechanisms to establish limited supply which potentially increases token value throughout time. Through its staking program Mutuum Finance provides enticing incentives that motivate users to maintain active participation in order to help develop the platform successfully. Ethereum‚Äôs bullish momentum could soon push it to new highs, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) appears set to follow suit. With $6.8 million raised and over 8,400 investors already on board, MUTM offers a better entry point at $0.025 during Phase 4. Join the presale today and ride the wave of what could be 2025‚Äôs next major breakout.

Solana (SOL) has jumped more than 22%, adding strength to what many are seeing as the start of a new bull run crypto phase. This jump was driven by improved market sentiment and growing excitement about the token‚Äôs role in decentralized finance (DeFi). On the other hand, Cardano (ADA) is staying focused on long-term goals, with experts predicting it could pass the $9 mark by 2030. But while price jumps and decade-long forecasts make headlines, a lesser-known presale project is quietly presenting one of the clearest growth paths right now. Web3 ai , available at $0.100 in presale and targeting a $0.800 launch, offers a direct route to 700% returns. It sets itself apart by focusing on tools that assist serious participants‚Äîan AI-based system designed to improve trade decisions, catch scams, and improve crypto planning. In a market full of price movement and development plans, Web3 ai could be setting a whole new standard. Solana‚Äôs 22% Rise Points to DeFi Strength Solana (SOL) has become one of the week‚Äôs best performers, with its value climbing by 22% following a global tariff freeze mentioned by former U.S. President Trump. This political event added a boost to the already growing confidence in the market. Solana‚Äôs fast performance and expanding base of decentralized platforms had already placed it in focus, and this announcement only helped raise interest further. Its usage has seen a rise, especially in DEX volume, which has overtaken many competitors and confirmed Solana‚Äôs role as a strong DeFi player. The Solana (SOL) price surge is now viewed as a possible signal of wider capital flowing into high-performing layer-one chains, especially those that mix speed with a simple user experience. If this wave of market gains keeps up, Solana could remain a top option for short-term trade activity. Cardano‚Äôs Long-Term Structure and Price Vision Unlike projects that chase fast results, the future of Cardano (ADA) is taking shape through a steady and careful approach. With a focus on academic research and technical rollouts, Cardano is making progress in on-chain management and smart contract features. Even though it may not generate frequent buzz, some forecasts suggest that ADA could climb above $9 within the decade. Models tied to the Cardano (ADA) future link its possible growth to growing support from institutions, functional DeFi use, and stronger platform reliability. Its focus on peer-reviewed updates and careful delivery methods connects with cautious user groups. Yet, as markets warm up again, ADA‚Äôs slower pace might limit short-term price growth. While those planning to hold long-term could see results, others may view quicker options more favorably. Web3 ai: A Strong Presale Entry with Real Functionality Looking at Solana‚Äôs strong weekly gains and Cardano‚Äôs future goals, Web3 ai enters the scene with a different type of advantage‚Äîearly access and useful features. Priced at $0.100 and expected to reach $0.800, the current presale offers a 700% return window before official listings. But what really sets it apart is what the platform is building. Web3 ai is bringing together 12 connected crypto tools designed to make managing digital assets easier. It includes tools such as AI trade support, planning tools, DeFi return analysis, and a scam detection system. These systems collect insights from top networks like Ethereum, BNB, Solana, and Polygon, bringing news, charts, and trends into one space. The WAI coin unlocks more than features, like lower pricing on premium tools. The layout is meant for use across different chains, and the service will be available on phones, browsers, and the web. At a time when tools, safety, and strong infrastructure matter more than hype, Web3 ai is clearly shaping its own space. Final Remarks! Signals of recovery are growing. From tariff pauses to crypto ETF developments, energy is flowing back into the sector. But what truly drives future value is more than temporary excitement. While the Solana (SOL) price surge is impressive and the Cardano (ADA) future looks promising, neither one offers a solid 700% gain with a structured tool-based model already in progress. As this bull run crypto trend continues, people are watching for platforms that combine low cost with strong features. Web3 ai checks both boxes. It isn‚Äôt just an affordable entry‚Äîit delivers working tools like data insights, safety alerts, and control rights. For those who join early, this is not only about short-term gain‚Äîit‚Äôs also a chance to build strong positions for the future.

33767162,[object Object],1744938018,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,XRP Price Eyes Recovery To $3 As Analyst Reveals How High The Price Would Be In Altcoin Season,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-eyes-recovery-to-3/,"Crypto analyst BarriC has predicted that the XRP price could soon recover and rebound to as high as $3. The analyst also revealed how high the token could reach when the altcoin season begins. XRP Price Eyes Recovery To $3 As Analyst Reveals Target In an X post , BarriC affirmed that the XRP price will hit $3 very soon. He further remarked that when that happens, the altcoin will skyrocket up to $5, marking a new all-time high (ATH). The crypto analyst added that the altcoin will then finally reach between $10 and $20 at the peak of the upcoming altcoin season. Interestingly, BarriC even revealed a more ambitious target for the XRP price , predicting that the altcoin could still rally to as high as $1,000 at some point. He noted that the price target of $10 to $20 is just the trajectory within the parameters of an altcoin season. However, outside this parameter, he believes that the asset can indeed reach $1,000. This isn‚Äôt the first time the crypto analyst has predicted that the price can reach such an ambitious target. He had previously alluded to institutional adoption as the major factor that could drive XRP to this target. BarriC noted the impact of Bitcoin ETFs on the BTC price and remarked that the XRP ETFs could also have a similar effect and send the altcoin to new highs. Crypto analysts like Egrag Crypto have given a more conservative price target for the altcoin, predicting that it could rally to double digits in this cycle and triple digits in the next cycle. Like BarriC, the analyst also alluded to the XRP ETFs as what could spark this massive price surge. As Bitcoinist reported, these ETFs currently lead the race for approval from the US SEC. One Final Dip For Rallies To New Highs In an X post, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto stated that the XRP price may face one final dip before it rallies to new highs. He remarked that if the altcoin doesn‚Äôt close above $2.30 to $2.50 on the 5-day timeframe, then a potential retest of $1.85 is still on the table. However, the analyst assured that the targets remain the same, with the altcoin set to rally to $7.50, $13, and then $27. Meanwhile, Egrag Crypto also warned market participants that a major liquidation event with a wick to $1.4 is still possible. He added that market makers know how to surprise the market with news that could either dump or pump it. This news could relate to the ongoing trade war between the US and China .

For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space who understand the importance of secure and reliable systems, the concept of safe AI is becoming increasingly crucial. Now, a prominent figure from the startup world is stepping up to address this very concern with a dedicated investment fund. Introducing the Safe Artificial Intelligence Fund (SAIF): A New Era for AI Investment Geoff Ralston, the former president of Y Combinator, has announced the launch of his new venture, the AI safety fund , aptly named the Safe Artificial Intelligence Fund (SAIF). This isn‚Äôt just another AI investment initiative; it‚Äôs a focused effort to support startups dedicated to enhancing the security, safety, and responsible deployment of artificial intelligence. For those familiar with the early-stage investment landscape, Ralston‚Äôs name carries weight, and his return to formal investing with a safety-centric mission signals a significant development in the tech world. Ralston is planning to deploy capital in the form of $100,000 SAFEs ‚Äì a nod to the investment instrument popularized by Y Combinator ‚Äì with a total fund cap of $10 million. This approach underscores his commitment to early-stage ventures focused squarely on safe AI startups . Key Highlights of the Safe Artificial Intelligence Fund (SAIF): Focus on AI Safety: SAIF is exclusively dedicated to startups prioritizing AI safety, security, and responsible deployment. Investment Size: Initial investments will be $100,000 via SAFEs, with a fund cap of $10 million. Experienced Leadership: Led by Geoff Ralston, former president of Y Combinator, bringing years of startup expertise and a vast network. Mentorship and Network: Ralston will provide mentorship, leveraging his Y Combinator experience, and offer access to his investor network. Why Focus on Safe AI Now? Addressing the Growing Need for Secure AI Systems While the current wave of AI innovation is largely geared towards problem-solving, efficiency gains, and creating new capabilities, Ralston points out a crucial gap: the primary focus isn‚Äôt always on safety. In an interview with Bitcoin World, Ralston emphasized, ‚ÄúThe vast majority of AI projects out in the world today are using the technology to solve problems or create efficiencies or create new capabilities. They are not necessarily intrinsically unsafe, but safety is not their primary concern.‚Äù This is where SAIF steps in. Ralston‚Äôs vision is to fund startups whose core mission is safe AI , broadly defined. This includes a diverse range of applications and technologies, all centered around making AI systems more reliable, secure, and beneficial for humanity. What Kind of Safe AI Startups is Ralston Looking For? Exploring Investment Areas The scope of ‚Äúsafe AI‚Äù is intentionally broad, encompassing various facets of AI development and deployment. Ralston‚Äôs investment thesis includes startups working on: Improving AI Explainability: Startups focused on making AI decision-making processes more transparent and understandable. This is crucial for building trust and accountability in AI systems. Benchmarking AI Safety: Companies developing standards and benchmarks to evaluate and measure the safety and security of AI models. Intellectual Property Protection: Solutions designed to safeguard intellectual property in the age of AI, preventing unauthorized access and misuse. Compliance and Regulation: Tools that ensure AI systems adhere to regulatory requirements and compliance standards, navigating the complex legal landscape of AI. Disinformation and Attack Detection: Technologies combating AI-driven disinformation campaigns and detecting AI-generated cyberattacks, critical for maintaining information integrity and security. Functional AI Tools with Built-in Safety: Developing practical AI applications, such as forecasting and negotiation tools, that incorporate safety features to prevent unintended consequences like revealing sensitive corporate data. This diverse portfolio reflects a holistic approach to AI safety , recognizing that security and responsibility must be embedded across the entire AI lifecycle, from model development to real-world applications. Contrarian Views and Ethical Considerations: Navigating the Complexities of AI Ralston‚Äôs perspective also takes a contrarian stance on certain aspects of AI development, particularly in defense technology. While many in the defense tech space are advocating for fully autonomous weapons, Ralston expresses strong reservations. He explicitly states that SAIF would not invest in fully autonomous weapons, citing the inherent dangers of AI-driven bioweapons and weapon systems operating without human oversight. Interestingly, Ralston is open to investing in ‚Äúweapon safety systems‚Äù ‚Äì technologies designed to detect and prevent attacks from AI weapons. This nuanced approach highlights the ethical considerations at the heart of AI investment and the importance of prioritizing safety and human control, especially in high-stakes domains like defense. The Y Combinator Advantage: Leveraging Connections in a Crowded Market The AI investment landscape is undeniably crowded. Numerous venture capital firms are vying to back the next groundbreaking AI startup. So, what gives SAIF an edge? Ralston believes his extensive network and experience at Y Combinator will be a significant differentiator. Having served as Y Combinator‚Äôs president for three years and an advisor for over a decade, Ralston possesses deep connections within the startup ecosystem. He plans to offer mentorship akin to his YC days, guiding portfolio companies on everything from business strategy to navigating the Y Combinator application process itself. Furthermore, he will leverage his considerable investor network to help startups secure follow-on funding and strategic partnerships. This Y Combinator connection is a powerful asset, providing SAIF startups with unique access and support. What‚Äôs Next for SAIF and the Future of Safe AI? While Ralston has remained tight-lipped about the fund‚Äôs exact size, the number of planned investments, and the identity of his limited partners (LPs), the launch of SAIF marks a pivotal moment for the safe AI startups ecosystem. It signals a growing recognition within the investment community of the critical importance of responsible AI development and deployment. As AI continues to permeate every aspect of our lives, from finance and healthcare to transportation and communication, ensuring its safety and security is paramount. Geoff Ralston‚Äôs Safe Artificial Intelligence Fund is poised to play a crucial role in fostering a future where AI benefits humanity without compromising our safety or ethical principles. This initiative could very well catalyze a new wave of innovation focused on building trustworthy and secure AI systems, a development eagerly anticipated by those in the cryptocurrency world and beyond who understand the value of robust and reliable technology.

Analyst Sets Mid-Term Target At $155,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-following-golds-footsteps-analyst-sets-mid-term-target-at-155000/,"As gold continues to set new all-time highs (ATH) ‚Äì trading at $3,333 per ounce at the time of writing ‚Äì Bitcoin (BTC) has seen more subdued price action, consolidating in the mid-$80,000 range. However, analysts suggest that the top digital asset may soon mirror gold‚Äôs recent momentum. Bitcoin Set To Follow Gold‚Äôs Momentum? In a recent post on X, crypto trading account Cryptollica hinted that BTC may be poised to replicate gold‚Äôs historic price movement seen over the past few months. The account shared the following chart, highlighting the striking similarities between the price actions of gold and BTC. The chart shows both gold and BTC forming a macro-bottom around early 2023, followed by a rejection at the range top in early 2024. Gold eventually broke out in the following months, while BTC lagged slightly, breaking out around November 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin Undervalued? Analyst Breaks Down Bullish On-Chain Metrics According to Cryptollica, BTC now appears to be breaking out of a consolidatory wedge pattern, with a potential mid-term target as high as $155,000. Currently, Bitcoin‚Äôs ATH stands at $108,786, recorded earlier this year in January. BTC is also likely to benefit from several favorable macroeconomic trends. For example, the global M2 money supply is expected to increase in 2025, a development that typically supports risk-on assets like Bitcoin. BTC Maturing As A Safe Haven Asset Beyond technical chart patterns, BTC has demonstrated remarkable resilience amid escalating global tariff-induced uncertainty. According to the latest The Week On-Chain report, both gold and BTC have performed well during the ongoing tariff war. The report notes: Amidst this turmoil, the performance of hard assets remains remarkably impressive. Gold continues to surge higher, having reached a new ATH of $3,300, as investors flee to the traditional safe haven asset. Bitcoin sold off to $75k initially alongside risk assets, but has since recovered the week‚Äôs gains, trading back up to $85k, now flat since this burst of volatility. The report also mentions that BTC recently experienced its largest price correction of the 2023‚Äì25 cycle, a -33% drawdown from its ATH earlier this year. However, this correction remains relatively modest compared to those seen in previous market cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly RSI Breakout Signals Trend Shift ‚Äì Is $100,000 Next For BTC? The following chart illustrates BTC bull market correction drawdowns since 2011. As shown, the recent -33% correction is the shallowest among past cycles, with the deepest being -72% during the 2012‚Äì14 bull market. While BTC continues to show signs of maturing as a reliable asset during times of geopolitical uncertainty, institutional investors appear to be taking profits. This is evidenced by recent outflows from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At press time, BTC is trading at $84,694, up 0.7% in the past 24 hours.

The platform revealed that most of its management team voted to ‚Äúcease and retreat‚Äù after allegations surfaced that North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus Group used the platform to launder approximately $35 million of the $1.4 billion stolen in a Bybit exploit. eXch blames global crackdown and misinterpretation of Its mission for shutdown According to eXch, it was under an ‚Äúactive transatlantic operation‚Äù that targeted its shutdown and potential legal action. eXch said that‚ÄÇwhile it had remained operational despite numerous failed attempts to dismantle its infrastructure ‚Äî which it acknowledged were part of a current operation ‚Äî it no longer felt it was worth operating in an unfriendly environment. It said it was being targeted by Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) due to‚ÄÇconfusion over its mission. At first, the platform rebuffed reports by‚ÄÇcrypto sleuths that it had laundered digital assets for the Lazarus Group. However, it acknowledged handling an ‚Äúinsignificant portion of funds‚Äù from the February attack. Individuals from eXch‚Äôs management team emphasized its focus on user privacy in announcing the shutdown, claiming that some exchanges ‚Äúabuse customers with nonsensical policies‚Äù in their attempts to fight money laundering. Bybit recovers after record $1.5B hack as regulators signal softer stance on crypto On February 21, 2025, a group of hackers from North Korea stole the largest cryptocurrency heist in history after stealing $1.5 billion in Ethereum tokens from the Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange ByBit . The hackers exploited a free storage software product that ByBit used to move Ethereum to another location, most likely coupled with phishing attacks to access control and download malware . On February 22, CEO Ben Zhou assured that the exchange had the resources to ‚Äúcover the loss‚Äù if the funds weren‚Äôt recovered. However, the company later revealed plans to shut down some of its Web3 services and close its NFT marketplace. By April 10, Bybit had regained its market share achieved before the hack: roughly 7%. The exchange paid more than $2 million to bounty hunters providing information that could be used to freeze some of the funds traceable to other platforms, which was estimated to be roughly 89% of the $1.4 billion as of March 20. That effort rewarded tipsters who helped freeze stolen tokens before they could be laundered through smaller exchanges or converted into fiat. Bybit has since recovered its pre-hack market share, regaining roughly 7% of global crypto volume by April 10. Fed chair signals softer crypto rules as digital assets enter the mainstream Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that regulators may soon take a more open approach to digital assets , even as enforcement efforts continue to intensify. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve taken a conservative stance, especially after the wave of failures and frauds,‚Äù Powell said. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre entering a new phase.‚Äù Powell pointed to growing bipartisan interest in regulating stablecoins, signaling that Congress may soon revisit a legal framework that stalled in past sessions. He said any new policy must balance innovation with risk controls, especially as crypto becomes more intertwined with the traditional banking system. ‚ÄúThe climate is changing,‚Äù Powell noted. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre seeing digital assets move into the mainstream.‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Bitcoin Realized Cap Is Growing At A Notably Slower Rate Now According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the Realized Cap of Bitcoin has just set a new record. The ‚ÄúRealized Cap‚Äù here refers to a capitalization model for Bitcoin that calculates the asset‚Äôs total value by assuming the ‚Äòreal‚Äô value of any token in circulation is equal to the spot price at which it was last transacted on the network. The last transaction of a given coin is likely to represent the last point at which it changed hands, so the price at the time of the move would denote the coin‚Äôs current cost basis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Still Close To Extreme Fear‚ÄîGreen Sign For Recovery? As the Realized Cap sums up this acquisition value for all tokens part of the circulating supply, it essentially determines the amount of capital that the investors as a whole have used to purchase Bitcoin. Now, here is the chart for the indicator shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in its value over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realizzed Cap has been following an uptrend for a while now. Whenever the indicator‚Äôs value rises, it means a net amount of capital is flowing into the cryptocurrency. Thus, the long-term surge would imply BTC has been enjoying continuous inflows. That said, while capital has been flowing in without break, the growth rate has fluctuated over the cycle. From the chart, it‚Äôs visible that the Realized Cap saw a particularly sharp rise during two periods: Q1 2024 and Q4 2024. The Q1 2024 phase was followed by a rapid slowdown in capital inflowsm and so far, it would appear that the Q4 2024 one has been seeing something similar. At the height of inflows in December, the growth rate of the metric stood at around 13% per month. Today, this value has declined to just 0.9% per month. Growth is still continuing, of course, and the indicator has managed to set a new record of $872 billion. But as Glassnode has explained, the slowdown could indicate ‚Äúinvestor appetite is softening ‚Äì signaling continued risk-off sentiment.‚Äù Both the periods of fresh capital inflows last year coincided with bull rallies for Bitcoin, while the phase of slowdown in between the two resulted in bearish consolidation for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Hasn‚Äôt Lost This Key Level Yet‚ÄîBull Cycle Intact? The latest drop in Realized Cap growth has so far resulted in a notable drawdown for the asset‚Äôs price. Given the trend of last year, it‚Äôs possible that a proper reversal may not happen for BTC until the metric catches a sharper uptrend. BTC Price Bitcoin has taken to sideways movement over the last few days as its price is still floating around the $84,700 mark.

TRUMP Coin is treading water as it braces for a substantial token unlock. Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing price rebound is gaining strength, with support levels now holding. But while those assets represent known territory, one rising name‚Äî Web3 ai ‚Äîis stealing the spotlight with a 700% ROI baked into its presale. This isn‚Äôt just about performance‚Äîit‚Äôs about positioning. From volatile meme tokens to infrastructure giants and AI-powered presales, the market is sorting itself into short-term buzz and long-term relevance. And for anyone looking for the top altcoin to buy now, these three stories are worth watching. TRUMP Coin Price Today Remains Flat Ahead of $320M Token Release TRUMP Coin is currently trading just above $8, after freefalling from its previous high of $74. Despite the dramatic correction, TRUMP coin price today has been relatively steady‚Äîbut that could soon change. A $320 million token unlock is scheduled for April 17, releasing 20% of the total token supply into circulation. While some traders believe this is already priced in, others are bracing for renewed volatility. Unlocks of this size almost always create friction in the market‚Äîespecially for meme tokens without deeper utility layers to support demand. That said, TRUMP coin price today still reflects enough interest to suggest that volatility hasn‚Äôt vanished‚Äîonly paused. Whether this project rebounds or fades may come down to how the unlock is handled‚Äîand whether speculative energy returns. For now, TRUMP remains a high-risk, high-drama meme asset that, while entertaining, doesn‚Äôt quite rank as a top altcoin to buy now for serious long-term positioning. Ethereum (ETH) Price Recovery Gains Strength Above Key Levels While TRUMP Coin holds flat, Ethereum (ETH) price recovery is gaining traction. After bottoming out near $1,385 last week, ETH has rebounded above $1,500 and is now testing resistance around $1,750. For traders watching closely, this zone marks a major turning point. A confirmed breakout could push Ethereum back toward the $1,800‚Äì$2,000 range over the next few weeks. What‚Äôs fueling the Ethereum (ETH) price recovery? Part of it is macro optimism‚Äîtariff suspensions and stable inflation data have lifted broader risk assets. But Ethereum‚Äôs fundamentals are also playing a role. With DeFi volume rising, Layer 2 adoption increasing, and ETH staking showing record inflows, the use case for Ethereum remains strong. The recovery isn‚Äôt euphoric‚Äîbut it‚Äôs measured, and it‚Äôs building. For mid- to long-term holders, that makes Ethereum a clear component of any balanced portfolio‚Äîand a strong complement to emerging altcoins with breakout potential. Web3 ai: A Utility-Powered 700% Presale Positioned as the Top Altcoin to Buy Now Enter Web3 ai‚Äîthe low-cap AI-driven project now leading the conversation around the top altcoin to buy now. While other tokens are fighting to recover or hold ground, Web3 ai is opening the door to early-stage investors with a confirmed 700% ROI window. The token is available at $0.10 in presale, with an $0.80 launch target already set in motion. But this isn‚Äôt just about price multiples‚Äîit‚Äôs about purpose. Web3 ai is building a 12-tool AI ecosystem aimed at improving crypto decision-making. From AI trading assistants and staking dashboards to risk analytics and scam detectors, every tool is designed to offer real-time insight across Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and Polygon. The $WAI token isn‚Äôt a gimmick‚Äîit powers access to the platform and gives holders governance power over platform upgrades. It‚Äôs a model built not for hype, but for staying power. With crypto getting more complex by the day, investors aren‚Äôt just looking for new tokens‚Äîthey‚Äôre looking for tools that help them manage risk, act faster, and optimize performance. Web3 ai delivers on that, and that‚Äôs exactly why it‚Äôs rapidly being recognized as the top altcoin to buy now ‚Äîespecially before it hits public markets. Final Word TRUMP coin price today is steady, but looming risk remains. Ethereum (ETH) price recovery is progressing, giving confidence to those tracking broader crypto resilience. And Web3 ai is delivering a rare presale combo: functional products, AI-powered utility, and a clear 700% launch window. As 2025 approaches, capital is rotating away from short-lived speculation and into real, useful infrastructure.

The bill proposes to tax traders when they sell their cryptocurrency for fiat or pay for goods and services, but crypto-to-crypto and transfers between wallets owned by the same user will be exempt, Slovenia‚Äôs Finance Ministry said in an April 17 statement. Under the proposed legislation, crypto tax will be aligned with existing tax laws. Slovenia taxpayers will be required to keep a record of all their transactions for annual tax returns. The tax base would be calculated on profits by subtracting the purchase price from the sale price. In a statement to the Slovenia Times, finance minister Klemen Bo≈°tjanƒçiƒç said it‚Äôs unreasonable that crypto trading for individuals isn‚Äôt currently taxed in the country. ‚ÄúThe goal of taxation of crypto assets is not to generate tax revenue, but we find it illogical and unreasonable that one of the most speculative financial instruments is not taxed at all,‚Äù he said in a statement translated from Slovenian. New tax could stifle crypto in Slovenia, lawmaker says Jernej Vrtovec, a member of Slovenia‚Äôs national assembly and New Slovenia opposition party, slammed the proposal in an April 16 statement to X, arguing it could stifle crypto growth in the country. ‚ÄúSlovenia has the opportunity to become a crypto-friendly country, but with the government‚Äôs proposals, we will miss the train again,‚Äù he said in a post also translated from Slovenian. ‚ÄúWith excessive taxation, we will once again see young people and capital fleeing abroad. Taxes should encourage, not stifle.‚Äù Source: Jernej Vrtovec The proposal is open to public consultation until May 5. If Slovenian lawmakers pass the bill, it will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2026. Slovenia introduced a 10% tax on crypto withdrawals and payments in 2023, but capital gains from occasional crypto trading are not taxed, according to the crypto tax platform Token Tax.

Business activity, such as mining or staking, is subject to income tax. A previous bill proposed in April 2022 planned to levy a 5% tax on profits over 10,000 euros ($11,372), but it was never passed into law. Slovenia issued the first digital sovereign bond in the European Union on July 25 last year . It had a nominal size of 30 million euros ($32.5 million) with a 3.65% coupon and a maturity date of Nov. 25 that year. The number of crypto users in Slovenia is projected to reach roughly 98,000 in 2025, according to online data platform Statisa, with a penetration rate of 4.6% among its population of 2.12 million people. While the projected revenue for the country's crypto market is slated to hit $2.8 million.

However, it appears to have found minor support, though not strong enough, and there‚Äôs no assurance that it will hold. Doge‚Äôs outlook is still under the bears‚Äô radar on a mid-term scale, but they appear to have exhausted momentum and are now looking weak. The bulls intercepted their recent attempt to resume pressure, and the market is now calm at the time of writing. This slight bearish suspension manifested earlier this month after testing a new monthly low of $0.13. A bounce occurred, and the price recovered to $0.17. Marking a resistance there, the price fell to $0.15 yesterday and held above this price level as support. Whether this minor support level will hold or not is yet to be ascertained. Advancing bearish move, the primary meme coin may lose grip above the support level, and continues to show signs of weakness on the daily chart. While this could lead to another major breakdown, it may see big losses in the long term. A few top meme coins have mirrored Doge‚Äôs recent price movement. While some are posting gains in the past few days, many are yet to find a solid ground on the daily timeframe. Nevertheless, the overall market is still considered bearish. DOGE‚Äôs Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview If the bears pull below $0.15, we can expect an extension to $0.142, along with the monthly $0.128 low. A collapse from there should bring us to $0.115 and maybe the $0.1 level in the near term. Towards the upside, the $0.17 level has recently held as resistance. If the price rebounds through it to $0.18, we can anticipate a recovery to $0.2 and $0.24 in no time. Key Resistance Levels: $0.18, $0.2, $0.24 Key Support Levels: $0.142, $0.128, $0.115 Spot Price: $0.154 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Approval of spot Litecoin ETFs appears likely, with analysts giving high odds; Canary Capital's ETF is in 'Pre Launch' status per the DTCC website. Litecoin's utility and active user growth contrast with Bitcoin's scaling stagnation, suggesting LTC is undervalued relative to BTC on PoW peers. LTCN trades at a discount to NAV, presenting a potential arbitrage opportunity if spot ETFs are approved, boosting LTCN's value. In the roughly three months since I last covered Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) and the Grayscale Litecoin Trust ( LTCN ) for Seeking Alpha, the performances of both the coin and the fund have been admittedly lack-luster. Data by YCharts When I wrote my last piece, LTCN was trading at a small premium relative to the prior year. As of mid-April, not only is that premium gone entirely but the fund has shifted back to a NAV rate discount for the first time since Q4-23. In this update, we'll look at the latest pertaining to spot Litecoin ETFs, Litecoin's continued usage story, and why I still like both LTC and LTCN given the broader setup in the digital asset market. Spot Litecoin ETF Developments While it isn't yet exactly clear when (or even if) spot ETFs will be approved by the SEC, the indications are that they will be coming at some point in the future. Consider that Canary Capital's Litecoin ETF is currently listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's website as a 'Pre Launch' ticker: LTCC Ticker in Pre Launch (DTCC) This doesn't actually mean that LTCC is guaranteed to become an approved ETF, but it is a positive sign as it shows the issuer is becoming more prepared for approval. ETF Analyst Expectations as of 2/10/25 (James Seyffart/X) Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart previously put LTC ETF approval odds at 90%. Furthermore, Seyffart said in early-February that he believes LTC will be the next ETF approved in the United States. In March, the SEC delayed a decision on the Canary fund and the next deadline is May 5th, which as of article submission, is less than three weeks away. Revisiting The Litecoin Thesis A view that I've steadfastly held in my coverage of cryptocurrencies through the years is the idea that the networks where these assets live have to actually offer the world real utility. Otherwise, speculation on price is likely the only real point of existence. That's not the future the cypherpunks who originally advocated for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) envisioned. But to a large degree, it's indeed the reality that we have today. That doesn't mean it has to remain the case going forward, and I've long suspected that through the bullish/bearish cycles that crypto speculators endure, the assets that will ultimately remain are the ones that offer the very utility I mentioned. There are many in the space who will argue that Bitcoin can do just about anything. BTC is viewed as 'Digital Gold' and any end user payments for smaller transactions can simply happen on secondary scaling layers. Thus, LTC need not exist. Yet lo and behold, after over 13 years in the market, Litecoin still commands a market capitalization of nearly $6 billion and a market cap rank of 21. For a coin that some feel is totally obsolete, this is impressive staying power, in my view. And my thinking here is the reason LTC still matters is precisely because scaling Bitcoin efforts have stagnated while Litecoin usage continues to grow. 30 Day Average DAAs (CoinMetrics) I've shared this chart in prior articles, but I'm sharing it again because I believe it helps illustrate two things; first, Litecoin's 30-day average DAA trend remains up since the beginning of 2021 while Bitcoin's is actually down. Second, when Bitcoin's transaction fees spiked in late-2023 and early-2024, crypto's user base shifted to Litecoin. I think another way to look at this though is through what I'll call the BTC/LTC DAA Multiple: 90 Day Average DAA Multiple (CoinMetrics) This logarithmic chart shows Bitcoin DAAs divided by Litecoin DAAs on a rolling 90-day average. This is essentially another way of showing Bitcoin losing active user share to Litecoin since 2017. Back then, the BTC/LTC DAA multiple was 60x. Today, it's just 2x, and it even spent some of 2024 under 2x. This isn't the only multiple that I think matters. You won't get any argument from me that Bitcoin settles far more in USD-denominated value each day. Over the last 30 days, Bitcoin has averaged about $9 billion in daily transferred value, while Litecoin's figure is closer to $86 million. To be sure, a massive difference. But adjusting for the differences in market capitalization, LTC is far cheaper than BTC: 30 Day Average NVT Ratio (CoinMetrics) This is the 30-day average NVT ratio; which divides the market capitalization of the coin by the USD-denominated transferred value on the network. I've added Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) and Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ) to show that LTC is indeed the outlier. At a 77 NVT ratio, Litecoin's valuation continues to trade at a massive discount to Proof-of-Work payment chain peers. DOGE, BCH, and BTC all command NVT ratios in excess of 200. So this is either a bad framework, or Litecoin is undervalued relative to the rest of the market. I continue to believe the issue lies with the valuations rather than the framework. Grayscale Litecoin Trust I'll point out again that my issue with LTCN as an investment in recent years hasn't been due to the underlying asset or its attractiveness as a digital currency. My problem with the fund over the last year and change has simply been one of valuation. At a significant multiple over the underlying value of the LTC, LTCN isn't worth the price tag. However, at a discount, I like it a lot more due to what, I think, is discounted exposure to a digital asset that is also significantly discounted relative to Proof-of-Work peers. Data by YCharts And that's exactly what we have from the market today. LTCN trades a small discount to NAV. And LTC trades a significant discount to the NVT ratios that are presently observed by natural peers BTC, BCH, and DOGE. All this said, a consideration that LTCN shareholders should remain mindful of is share unlocks through the end of the year: Grayscale LTC Holdings (CoinGlass) Grayscale held 1.48 million LTC through the trust back in February 2024. By the end of April, LTC holdings grew to 1.69 million. Though as of April 17th, most of the shares issued from that LTC growth are already unlocked. The next big unlock appears to be in mid-July, where LTC holdings grew by 5% overnight. LTC pricing likely matters here because between April 15th, 2024 and July 17th, 2024, Litecoin traded between $60-80 dollars per coin. Which means that some of these LTCN shares are likely already underwater. Will those shareholders take the loss and further depress the NAV rate? I won't attempt to guess. Closing Thoughts Litecoin is quietly still an important asset in the cryptocurrency market. It's one of just three coins that can be purchased through a Fidelity crypto IRA, and all indications from ETF analysts are that the spot LTC ETFs will be approved in the United States. When that happens, LTCN's days at a discount are presumably over. So coin price being equal, buying LTCN at a discount could be a nice little arbitrage trade between now and a potential ETF conversion. Fundamentally, LTC remains highly depressed relative to similar assets. If LTC traded at the same NVT ratio as BTC, the coin price would be closer to $225.",LTC-USD|LTCN,EN,0,0,BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|LTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-18 02:45:45
