43463604,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150517,1744929055,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alert: Slovenia Considers 25% Crypto Tax ‚Äì Decoding the Impact,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/slovenia-crypto-tax-imminent-impact/,"Cryptocurrency investors in Slovenia, brace yourselves! A significant shift in the regulatory landscape might be on the horizon. The Slovenian Finance Ministry has dropped a bombshell proposal: a 25% tax on profits from individual crypto investments. This move, aimed at plugging a perceived tax loophole, is currently open for public discussion until May 5th. If it gets the green light from parliament, this new law could come into effect as early as January 1, 2026. Let‚Äôs dive deep into what this crypto tax Slovenia proposal entails and what it could mean for you. Why the Sudden Focus on Crypto Tax in Slovenia? For some time, Slovenia has been known for its relatively lenient stance on cryptocurrency taxation, often seen as a haven for crypto enthusiasts within the European Union. However, this proposed 25% tax on individual crypto profits tax Slovenia signals a potential change in direction. The government‚Äôs rationale is clear: to close an existing tax loophole and generate revenue. According to Bloomberg reports, the estimated annual revenue from this tax could range anywhere from ‚Ç¨2.5 million to a substantial ‚Ç¨25 million. But why now? Several factors could be at play: Increased Crypto Adoption: As cryptocurrency adoption grows globally and within Slovenia, governments are increasingly looking at ways to tax this burgeoning asset class. EU Pressure and Harmonization: There‚Äôs a broader trend within the European Union towards harmonizing tax regulations, including those related to digital assets. Slovenia might be aligning itself with this trend. Revenue Generation: Governments worldwide are constantly seeking new revenue streams, and the growing crypto market presents an attractive target for taxation. Fairness and Equity: The argument is often made that profits from crypto investments should be taxed similarly to other forms of investment gains to ensure fairness in the tax system. Decoding the Proposed 25% Slovenia Crypto Tax Rate The core of the proposal is a 25% tax on individual cryptocurrency tax Slovenia gains. This is a significant percentage and warrants careful consideration. Let‚Äôs break down what this could mean: Who is Affected? This tax specifically targets individual investors and their profits from crypto investments. It‚Äôs crucial to note that it focuses on gains, not the principal investment amount. Tax Rate: A flat 25% tax rate is proposed. This is a considerable tax rate, potentially impacting the profitability of crypto investments for Slovenian residents. Taxable Events: The proposal likely defines specific taxable events, such as selling cryptocurrency for fiat currency or potentially exchanging one cryptocurrency for another. The specifics will be crucial to understand. Implementation Date: If approved, the law is slated to take effect on January 1, 2026. This gives investors some time to prepare, but also underscores the urgency to understand and potentially respond to the proposal during the public comment period. Potential Benefits and Challenges of the New Crypto Tax Law Like any tax policy, the proposed Slovenia crypto tax law comes with its own set of potential benefits and challenges. Let‚Äôs weigh them out: Potential Benefits: Increased Government Revenue: The most direct benefit is the potential for increased revenue for the Slovenian government. This revenue could be used for public services and infrastructure projects. Level Playing Field: Taxing crypto profits could create a more level playing field with traditional investments, which are typically subject to capital gains taxes. Regulatory Clarity: While taxation can be seen as a burden, it also provides a degree of regulatory clarity for the crypto sector in Slovenia. Clear rules can foster a more stable and predictable environment. Potential Challenges: Impact on Crypto Innovation: A high tax rate could potentially stifle innovation and investment in the crypto sector within Slovenia. It might make Slovenia less attractive compared to jurisdictions with more favorable tax regimes. Compliance Burden: Implementing and complying with crypto tax regulations can be complex. Both taxpayers and tax authorities will need to adapt to new reporting and compliance requirements. Capital Flight: If the tax regime is perceived as too burdensome, there‚Äôs a risk of capital flight, with crypto businesses and investors potentially moving to more tax-friendly locations. Enforcement Challenges: Taxing crypto assets can be challenging due to their decentralized and often borderless nature. Effective enforcement will be crucial for the success of this tax law. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors in Slovenia? Actionable Insights For crypto investors in Slovenia, this proposed cryptocurrency tax law is a significant development that requires attention and proactive steps: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on the developments regarding this proposal. Follow news outlets and official announcements from the Slovenian Finance Ministry. Participate in Public Comment: The public comment period is open until May 5th. If you are affected by this proposal, consider submitting your comments and feedback. Your voice matters! Seek Professional Advice: Consult with a tax advisor or financial professional to understand how this proposed law might impact your specific crypto investments and tax obligations. Tax Planning: Start thinking about tax planning strategies in light of this potential new tax regime. This might involve reviewing your investment strategies and considering the tax implications of your crypto activities. Long-Term Perspective: Consider the long-term implications of this tax law on the Slovenian crypto market. Think about how it might affect your investment decisions in the future. Examples of Crypto Tax Regulations in Other Countries To put Slovenia‚Äôs proposal into perspective, let‚Äôs briefly look at how other countries are approaching crypto regulation and taxation: Country Crypto Tax Approach Germany Tax-free after one year of holding for individuals. Otherwise, taxed as income tax. Portugal Generally no personal income tax on crypto gains (subject to change). United States Taxed as property, with capital gains tax rates applying based on holding period. India 30% tax on crypto gains, with limited deductions. South Korea 20% tax on crypto gains exceeding a certain threshold (implementation delayed). Note: Crypto tax regulations are constantly evolving, and this table provides a simplified overview. Always consult with a tax professional for specific advice. As you can see, the approach to crypto taxation varies significantly across different jurisdictions. Slovenia‚Äôs proposed 25% tax rate, if implemented, would place it somewhere in the mid-to-high range compared to other countries. The final impact will depend on the specific details of the law and how effectively it is implemented and enforced. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Crypto Tax Landscape in Slovenia The proposed 25% tax on individual crypto profits in Slovenia marks a potentially shocking turning point in the country‚Äôs approach to cryptocurrency regulation. While aimed at closing tax loopholes and generating revenue, it also presents challenges for crypto investors and the broader crypto ecosystem in Slovenia. Staying informed, participating in the public discourse, and seeking professional advice are crucial steps for navigating this evolving landscape. The future of crypto regulation in Slovenia is now in a period of critical discussion and development. Keep watching this space!

43463907,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150520,1744929652,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Confidence Surge: a16z Crypto Amplifies LayerZero Investment with $55M Locked ZRO Token Acquisition,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/a16z-crypto-layerzero-investment/,"In a powerful display of confidence in cross-chain technology, a16z Crypto has significantly deepened its commitment to LayerZero by acquiring an additional $55 million worth of ZRO tokens. This substantial LayerZero investment , announced on X, comes with a three-year lock-up period, signaling a long-term belief in the protocol‚Äôs potential. But what does this mean for LayerZero, a16z crypto, and the broader Web3 ecosystem? Let‚Äôs dive into the details of this exciting development. Why is a16z Crypto Doubling Down on LayerZero? For those familiar with the crypto venture capital landscape, a16z crypto is a name synonymous with strategic investments and backing for groundbreaking projects. Their continued support for LayerZero is not entirely new; they previously led LayerZero‚Äôs Series A+ and Series B funding rounds. This latest acquisition, however, is more than just another funding round. It‚Äôs a strong endorsement, a public declaration of faith in LayerZero‚Äôs technology and its future trajectory. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what makes this investment noteworthy: Significant Investment Size: $55 million is a considerable sum, especially in the current market climate. It demonstrates a substantial financial commitment from a major player like a16z. Token Lock-up Period: The three-year lock-up is crucial. It means a16z is not looking for a quick flip. They are in it for the long haul, indicating a belief in the long-term growth and success of LayerZero and the ZRO token . Existing Relationship: a16z‚Äôs prior investments in LayerZero suggest a deep understanding of the project, its team, and its technology. This isn‚Äôt a speculative bet; it‚Äôs a calculated move based on existing conviction. Strategic Alignment: LayerZero‚Äôs mission to solve blockchain interoperability aligns perfectly with the broader Web3 vision of a connected and decentralized future, a vision a16z actively champions. Key Aspect Details of a16z‚Äôs LayerZero Investment Investor a16z Crypto Investment Amount $55 million Token ZRO Lock-up Period 3 years Previous Involvement Led Series A+ and Series B rounds Understanding LayerZero: The Interoperability Powerhouse For those newer to the crypto space, understanding LayerZero is crucial to appreciating the significance of this crypto venture capital injection. LayerZero is designed to be an omnichain interoperability protocol. In simpler terms, it‚Äôs built to connect different blockchains seamlessly. Imagine a world where moving assets or data between Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and other blockchains is as easy as sending an email. That‚Äôs the problem LayerZero is tackling. Here‚Äôs why interoperability is so vital and why LayerZero stands out: Breaking Down Silos: Currently, blockchains often operate in isolation. LayerZero aims to break down these silos, creating a more unified and efficient crypto ecosystem. Enhanced User Experience: Interoperability simplifies the user experience. Users won‚Äôt need to navigate complex bridges or worry about chain compatibility when interacting with different dApps (decentralized applications). Developer Flexibility: LayerZero empowers developers to build truly omnichain applications, leveraging the strengths of multiple blockchains without being confined to a single ecosystem. Increased Capital Efficiency: By enabling seamless asset transfer across chains, LayerZero can improve capital efficiency within the crypto market. LayerZero‚Äôs technology utilizes an innovative approach called the Ultra Light Node (ULN), which offers a balance of security and efficiency in cross-chain communication. This is a key differentiator compared to earlier bridging solutions that often faced security vulnerabilities or were cumbersome to use. The Role of Web3 Funding and Venture Capital in Crypto Growth The web3 funding landscape is heavily influenced by venture capital firms like a16z. These firms play a crucial role in nurturing and accelerating the growth of promising crypto projects. Their investments are not just about the money; they bring expertise, networks, and credibility to the table. Here‚Äôs how venture capital fuels the Web3 revolution: Financial Resources: VC funding provides the capital needed for projects to develop their technology, build teams, and scale their operations. Strategic Guidance: VC firms often offer strategic advice and mentorship, helping projects navigate the complexities of the crypto market and build sustainable businesses. Network Effects: VCs have extensive networks within the industry, connecting projects with potential partners, talent, and future investors. Validation and Credibility: Investment from reputable VCs like a16z adds significant validation and credibility to a project, attracting further attention and adoption. a16z‚Äôs increased investment in LayerZero underscores the continued confidence of institutional investors in the long-term potential of Web3 and the underlying technologies that power it. Despite market fluctuations and regulatory uncertainties, smart money is still flowing into the space, seeking out projects with strong fundamentals and innovative solutions. What‚Äôs Next for LayerZero and the ZRO Token? With this fresh infusion of capital and the unwavering backing of a16z crypto , LayerZero is well-positioned to further develop its technology and expand its ecosystem. The three-year lock-up on the ZRO token acquisition suggests a focus on long-term value creation rather than short-term gains. Potential future developments for LayerZero and ZRO could include: Ecosystem Growth: We can expect to see more dApps and projects integrating LayerZero for cross-chain functionality, expanding its network effect. Technology Advancements: LayerZero may continue to innovate and enhance its protocol, potentially improving speed, security, and cost-effectiveness. Token Utility Expansion: The utility of the ZRO token within the LayerZero ecosystem could evolve, potentially encompassing governance, staking, or other functionalities. Mainstream Adoption: As interoperability becomes increasingly crucial, LayerZero could play a pivotal role in driving mainstream adoption of Web3 technologies. Conclusion: A Confident Stride Towards Interoperable Web3 a16z Crypto‚Äôs $55 million investment in locked ZRO tokens is a resounding vote of confidence in LayerZero and the future of blockchain interoperability. It highlights the strategic importance of cross-chain solutions in building a more connected and user-friendly Web3 ecosystem. This move not only benefits LayerZero directly but also sends a positive signal to the broader crypto market, reinforcing the long-term investment thesis for innovative projects tackling fundamental challenges. As LayerZero continues to build and expand, its impact on the crypto landscape is poised to become even more profound, paving the way for a truly omnichain future.

43464143,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=711846,1744929812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43464143.jpeg,Google‚Äôs AI safety promises under scrutiny after Gemini report,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/googles-ai-safety-promises-under-scrutiny-after-gemini-report/,"Google shared a safety paper on its flagship artificial‚Äëintelligence model, Gemini 2.5 Pro. Experts say it leaves key risks unexplained. The company posted the technical paper on Thursday, several weeks after it released Gemini 2.5 Pro to customers. The document lists the internal tests Google ran on the model but offers few facts on how the system behaves under overload or misuse. Researchers who reviewed the paper told TechCrunch the missing details make it hard to judge whether Gemini 2.5 Pro is truly safe for broad use. Technical reports are one of the main ways the public learns what advanced AI systems can and cannot do. A thorough report often shows where a model fails and where it might be misused. Many AI researchers treat these papers as honest efforts to back up a company‚Äôs safety claims. Google handles safety reporting differently. Google releases a report only after a model is no longer tagged ‚Äúexperimental,‚Äù and it moves certain ‚Äúdangerous capability‚Äù findings into a separate audit that is not published at once. As a result, the public paper does not cover every threat Google has tested for. Several analysts said the new Gemini 2.5 Pro document is a stark case of limited disclosure. They also noticed that the report never refers to Google‚Äôs Frontier Safety Framework, or FSF, a policy the company announced last year to spot future AI powers that could cause ‚Äúsevere harm.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis report is very sparse, contains minimal information, and arrived weeks after the model went public,‚Äù said Peter Wildeford, co‚Äëfounder of the Institute for AI Policy and Strategy. ‚ÄúIt is impossible to confirm whether Google is meeting its own promises, and therefore impossible to judge the safety and security of its models.‚Äù Thomas Woodside, co‚Äëfounder of the Secure AI Project, said he was glad any paper had appeared at all, yet he doubted Google‚Äôs plan to release steady follow‚Äëups. He pointed out that the last time the firm shared results from dangerous‚Äëcapability tests was June 2024, and that paper covered a model announced in February of the same year. Confidence slipped further when observers saw no safety paper for Gemini 2.5 Flash, a slimmer and faster model Google revealed last week. A company spokesperson said a Flash paper is ‚Äúcoming soon.‚Äù ‚ÄúI hope this is a real promise to start giving more frequent updates,‚Äù Woodside said. ‚ÄúThose updates should include results for models that have not yet reached the public, because those models may also pose serious risks.‚Äù Google now falls short on transparency Meta‚Äôs safety note for its new Llama 4 models runs only a few pages, while OpenAI chose not to publish any report at all for its GPT‚Äë4.1 series. The shortage of detail comes at a tense time. Two years ago, Google told the U.S. government it would post safety papers for every ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù AI model within scope.‚Äù The company made similar pledges to officials in other countries, saying it would offer ‚Äúpublic transparency‚Äù about its AI products. Kevin Bankston, senior adviser on AI governance at the Center for Democracy and Technology, called the releases from leading labs a ‚Äúrace to the bottom‚Äù on safety. ‚ÄúCombined with reports that rival labs like OpenAI have cut safety‚Äëtesting time before release from months to days, this meager documentation for Google‚Äôs top model tells a troubling story of a race to the bottom on AI safety and transparency as companies rush their models to market,‚Äù he added. Google says much of its safety work happens behind closed doors. The company states that every model undergoes strict tests, including ‚Äúadversarial red teaming,‚Äù before any public launch.

The world of digital asset derivatives is heating up, and Coinbase International is making waves. Last week, this Bermuda-based platform, a sibling to the U.S. crypto giant Coinbase, witnessed a massive surge in Bitcoin futures volume , hitting a staggering $100 billion. Yes, you read that right ‚Äì $100 billion in just one week! This isn‚Äôt just a blip on the radar; it‚Äôs a significant indicator of the evolving landscape of crypto trading and the growing appetite for derivatives outside the heavily regulated U.S. market. Why the Sudden Spike in Bitcoin Futures Volume? So, what‚Äôs fueling this explosive growth in Bitcoin futures volume on Coinbase International? Several factors are likely at play, all converging to create a perfect storm for derivatives trading: Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its rollercoaster rides, and recent weeks have been no exception. Periods of high volatility often drive traders towards derivatives markets. Why? Because futures contracts allow traders to speculate on price movements ‚Äì both up and down ‚Äì without actually holding the underlying asset. This can be particularly attractive during uncertain times. Demand for Crypto Derivatives: U.S. regulations are stringent when it comes to crypto derivatives. Platforms like Coinbase in the U.S. don‚Äôt offer the same range of perpetual futures contracts that are available on international exchanges. Traders seeking access to these instruments are naturally drawn to platforms like Coinbase International . Institutional Interest: While retail traders are a significant part of the crypto market, the $100 billion figure suggests a substantial influx of institutional capital. Institutional demand for crypto exposure is on the rise, and derivatives offer a sophisticated way for institutions to participate in the market, manage risk, and potentially enhance returns. Coinbase‚Äôs Global Expansion: Coinbase‚Äôs strategic move to establish Coinbase International in Bermuda is paying off. It allows them to tap into the global derivatives market and cater to a wider audience beyond the U.S. This expansion positions Coinbase as a key player in the international crypto derivatives space. Coinbase International: A Rising Star in Crypto Derivatives Coinbase International , though relatively new, is rapidly establishing itself as a force to be reckoned with in the crypto derivatives market. Here‚Äôs a closer look at what makes it stand out: Backed by Coinbase: The platform benefits from the reputation and infrastructure of Coinbase, a publicly traded and well-respected name in the crypto industry. This association provides a level of trust and security that is crucial in the often-unregulated world of crypto exchanges. Focus on Perpetual Futures: Perpetual futures contracts are a popular type of crypto derivative that doesn‚Äôt have an expiry date. This allows traders to hold positions for as long as they want, making them attractive for both short-term speculation and longer-term trading strategies. Global Reach: Being based in Bermuda allows Coinbase International to serve a global audience, bypassing some of the regulatory hurdles faced by U.S.-based platforms. This global accessibility is a major advantage in attracting international traders and institutional demand . Competitive Trading Environment: The platform likely offers competitive trading fees and a robust trading engine to attract and retain users in the highly competitive crypto exchange landscape. The Allure of Futures Trading: Benefits and Risks Futures trading , particularly in the crypto market, offers both exciting opportunities and significant risks. Understanding these is crucial for anyone considering venturing into this space. Benefits of Futures Trading: Leverage: Futures contracts allow traders to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. This leverage can amplify profits, but also losses. Hedging: Futures can be used to hedge against price volatility in the spot market. For example, if you hold Bitcoin, you can use Bitcoin futures to protect against potential price declines. Profit from Falling Prices: Unlike traditional spot trading where you primarily profit from price increases, futures allow you to profit from both rising and falling prices by taking long or short positions. Liquidity: Major crypto futures exchanges generally offer high liquidity, allowing for efficient order execution. Risks of Futures Trading: High Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile, and this volatility is amplified in futures trading due to leverage. Liquidation Risk: Leverage increases the risk of liquidation. If the market moves against your position, you could lose your initial margin and potentially more. Complexity: Futures trading can be more complex than spot trading, requiring a deeper understanding of margin, leverage, and contract specifications. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto derivatives is still evolving, and changes in regulations could impact the market. Institutional Demand: The Driving Force? While retail interest in crypto remains strong, the surge in futures trading volume, especially on platforms like Coinbase International , increasingly points towards the growing influence of institutional demand . Institutions, such as hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations, are increasingly looking at crypto as a legitimate asset class. Here‚Äôs why institutional demand is a significant factor: Portfolio Diversification: Institutions are constantly seeking diversification to manage risk and enhance returns. Crypto, with its low correlation to traditional assets, offers a compelling diversification opportunity. Sophisticated Trading Strategies: Institutions often employ more sophisticated trading strategies, including derivatives trading, to optimize their crypto exposure. Increased Market Maturity: As the crypto market matures, institutions are becoming more comfortable participating, driven by factors like improved custody solutions, clearer regulatory frameworks (in some jurisdictions), and growing market infrastructure. Search for Yield: In a low-interest-rate environment, institutions are constantly searching for yield. Crypto, despite its volatility, offers the potential for higher returns compared to traditional fixed-income assets. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders What does this Bitcoin futures volume surge on Coinbase International mean for you, the crypto trader? Keep an Eye on Derivatives Markets: The derivatives market is becoming increasingly important in the crypto ecosystem. Monitoring trading volumes and trends on platforms like Coinbase International can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Understand Futures Trading: If you‚Äôre not already familiar with futures trading, now might be a good time to learn the basics. While it comes with risks, it also offers powerful tools for speculation, hedging, and portfolio management. Consider Global Platforms: Don‚Äôt limit yourself to U.S.-regulated exchanges, especially if you‚Äôre interested in derivatives. Explore international platforms like Coinbase International to access a wider range of crypto products and trading opportunities. Stay Informed about Regulations: The regulatory landscape for crypto derivatives is constantly evolving. Stay updated on regulatory developments in different jurisdictions to understand the implications for your trading activities. Conclusion: The Future is Derivatives? The $100 billion Bitcoin futures volume on Coinbase International is not just a number; it‚Äôs a testament to the growing sophistication and globalization of the crypto market. It signals a clear shift towards derivatives trading, driven by market volatility, institutional demand , and the strategic expansion of platforms like Coinbase. As the crypto space matures, expect to see derivatives playing an even more central role, offering both opportunities and challenges for traders and investors alike. The surge on Coinbase International is a powerful reminder that the crypto revolution is far from over ‚Äì it‚Äôs just entering a new, more complex, and potentially more rewarding phase.

Related Reading: Is Shiba Inu On Track To Dethrone Dogecoin? Here‚Äôs What The Experts Say Total market value witnessed a drop of $3.8 trillion to $2.8 trillion, an 18.6% decline over the quarter. This sharp plunge marked the turnaround before the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president, in stark contrast to last year‚Äôs ramp up. Trading volume also suffered some contractions, as the daily volumes dropped to $146 billion, a decrease of 27%. Bitcoin Rules Market While Others Decline Bitcoin insulated itself reasonably from the turbulence in other cryptocurrencies so that its market share reached nearly 60%, the highest in four years. Bitcoin achieved peak valuation at $106,182 in January shortly after inauguration but plunged almost 12% to finish the quarter at $82,514. Compared with Bitcoin during this period, gold and US Treasury bonds were traditional safe-haven investments with lower performance. Compared to Ethereum, however, the situation was much worse. Its price fell by 45%, essentially wiping out all gains in 2024. Its market share dropped to almost 8%, the lowest it has been since the end of 2019. As it has been observed by most analysts, this downturn is not something new since more and more activities have shifted toward ‚ÄúLayer 2‚Äù networks built atop Ethereum and not using the Ethereum main network. Meme Coins Crash After Major Scam The previously red-hot meme coin space received a rude wake-up call in early 2025. Following a boom in Trump-themed tokens, the industry was severely hurt when the Libra token ‚Äì introduced by Argentina‚Äôs President Javier Milei ‚Äì proved to be a scam. The project was abandoned by developers after they had taken investors‚Äô funds, shattering confidence in such tokens. By late March, new token launches on the platform Pump.fun per day had dropped by over 50%. DeFi Industry Loses More Than A Quarter Of Its Value Not even the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry was exempted. Overall money in DeFi projects dropped 27% to $48 billion during the first quarter. Ethereum‚Äôs dominance in the DeFi space declined to 56% by quarter-end. Related Reading: Solana Hits Milestone As Canada OKs First Spot ETFs Not everything was negative, though. Stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) became more popular with investors seeking a safer bet as the market tanked. Solana also remained in its leadership position, holding 39.6% of all decentralized exchange (DEX) trading during Q1, courtesy mostly of meme coin mania. Even Solana‚Äôs leadership, however, started to wane at the end of the period as the meme coin mania declined. The dramatic shift in market sentiment shows how quickly cryptocurrency fortunes can change. After a promising end to 2024, the new year brought a harsh reality check for crypto investors, with nearly $1 trillion in market value disappearing in just three months.

Arbitrum Hits $300B Milestone While Litecoin Holds Steady,https://thecoinrise.com/is-qubetics-the-top-crypto-presale-of-2025-arbitrum-hits-300b-milestone-while-litecoin-holds-steady/,"The current market is showing signs of consolidation, and that‚Äôs often when the sharpest eyes find the best entries. While Bitcoin and top altcoins weather the volatility, the real shift is happening beneath the surface‚Äîwhere utility meets opportunity. Arbitrum just broke records with Uniswap, clocking over $300 billion in volume and proving that Ethereum Layer 2 scaling isn‚Äôt just hype‚Äîit‚Äôs infrastructure. Meanwhile, Litecoin is doing what it always does in uncertain markets: staying steady, staying fast, and staying relevant. These developments set the stage for something bigger‚Äîbecause while Layer 2 adoption heats up and OG coins like Litecoin hold their ground, the window is still open for standout presales with real-world application to disrupt the space. One project making that kind of noise right now is Qubetics. It‚Äôs checking every box: enterprise-grade utility, a live presale with surging numbers, and a dev-friendly ecosystem that could bring Web3 to the everyday user without friction. That kind of clarity is what makes a top crypto presale , especially when big-name tokens are grappling with gas fees, throughput issues, or stagnant roadmaps. Qubetics ($TICS) enters the scene with something rare‚Äîan ecosystem that doesn‚Äôt require a dictionary to understand. It‚Äôs built with a problem-solving lens that directly challenges the hurdles most chains still haven‚Äôt solved. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs capturing attention not only from DeFi participants and early adopters but also from business professionals, developers, and even Web2-native platforms exploring their first leap into Web3 integration. Qubetics ‚Äì Developer-First Ecosystem Powered by QubeQode IDE At the heart of Qubetics lies QubeQode IDE , a no-nonsense, developer-focused interface that enables real-time smart contract generation and deployment without needing a PhD in Solidity. The IDE streamlines the Web3 build process for both seasoned blockchain developers and professionals with zero coding background. Through its simplified architecture, users can create, test, and deploy cross-chain applications‚Äîall without leaving the platform. That‚Äôs not just a perk‚Äîit‚Äôs a shift in how decentralized applications are built and scaled. Businesses can tokenize assets, professionals can build revenue-generating protocols, and individuals can plug into DeFi ecosystems without clunky middleware or third-party dependencies. It‚Äôs interoperability and automation baked into one environment‚Äîunlocking access to decentralized infrastructure for real users, not just crypto natives. And it‚Äôs this kind of user-centric innovation that defines what a top crypto presale should look like. Qubetics isn‚Äôt trying to be a trend‚Äîit‚Äôs aiming to be a backbone. Qubetics Presale Update ‚Äì Entry Price, ROI Potential, and Market Response The Qubetics presale is currently in Stage 30 , and momentum hasn‚Äôt skipped a beat. So far, the project has sold more than 508 million tokens to over 24,800 holders , raising more than $16.1 million . $TICS tokens are available now at $0.1729 , but time and supply are moving fast. Those who jumped in during Stage 1 at $0.01 are already sitting on a 1629% return . But even at this stage, the window is wide open for those seeking long-term ROI and entry at a high-leverage point. If acquired today, a $TICS token priced at $0.1729 could still yield a projected 477% return at $1. At $5, that jumps to 2789% , while $6 gives 3367% ROI . If $TICS pushes to $10 post-listing, the return spikes to 5678% . Analysts projecting a $15 valuation following the mainnet launch estimate a return of 8567% from current levels. That kind of potential doesn‚Äôt appear out of thin air. It comes from substance‚Äîutility, usability, scalability, and forward-looking tech. It‚Äôs why Qubetics is drawing comparisons with the best crypto presale contenders historically and establishing its case as a top crypto presale in 2025. Arbitrum ‚Äì Setting the L2 Standard in DeFi Arbitrum just crossed an industry-defining threshold. The Ethereum Layer 2 network recently surpassed $300 billion in trading volume on Uniswap , the first L2 to achieve this. The milestone is more than a big number‚Äîit‚Äôs a reflection of Arbitrum‚Äôs role as the backbone of affordable, high-speed DeFi. Uniswap‚Äôs integration with Arbitrum proves that L2 networks are not just scaling tools‚Äîthey‚Äôre foundational for next-gen finance. What makes Arbitrum‚Äôs rise more impactful is its balance of speed and security. It maintains Ethereum‚Äôs trustless infrastructure while eliminating the prohibitively high gas fees that drove many users away from L1 DEX activity. This L2 adoption trend is now influencing both institutional and retail decision-makers, further anchoring Arbitrum as a critical force in Ethereum‚Äôs scaling narrative. While Arbitrum isn‚Äôt a presale and doesn‚Äôt carry the same upside dynamics as Qubetics, its dominance showcases the infrastructure layer needed to support scalable projects‚Äîmany of which will emerge from presale ecosystems like Qubetics. Litecoin ‚Äì Simplicity That Sticks Litecoin is one of those projects that doesn‚Äôt need gimmicks. It‚Äôs been called the ‚Äúsilver to Bitcoin‚Äôs gold‚Äù for years‚Äîand that analogy still holds. Built for speed and designed with lower transaction fees in mind, Litecoin has seen multiple market cycles and remains standing, adopted, and widely supported. And in a market where complexity can push out everyday users, Litecoin‚Äôs simplicity is its power. Halving events have consistently driven renewed attention to LTC, not only for their economic impact but also for the sentiment reset they provide. While other altcoins ride waves of news and flash launches, Litecoin grinds upward on the back of proven history. And that‚Äôs what makes it an appealing option for those who like their risk measurable and their asset behavior understandable. Though Litecoin may not fall under the top crypto presale category, it serves a critical role in portfolios looking to balance innovation with resilience. Final Thoughts In a time when the market demands more than promises, Qubetics is doing something few others can‚Äîdelivering early. With a fully integrated dev stack, a live and engaged presale community, and ROI models that don‚Äôt rely on hype alone, Qubetics isn‚Äôt just a top crypto presale‚Äîit‚Äôs the blueprint for what presales should aim to be. Meanwhile, Arbitrum‚Äôs achievements in DeFi scalability and Litecoin‚Äôs status as a legacy asset serve to reinforce the broader point: that real value comes from real functionality. As the market recalibrates, participants are beginning to understand that flash-in-the-pan projects don‚Äôt cut it anymore. The focus is shifting toward scalable tech, real-world usability, and systems that onboard‚Äînot alienate. Qubetics, Arbitrum, and Litecoin reflect different ends of that spectrum‚Äîbut they each represent a strong case for the top crypto presale discussions now and going forward.

Trump signaled that he is reluctant to impose further tariffs on China because doing so would delay a trade deal. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, the president said people he regards as direct envoys of Chinese leader Xi‚ÄØJinping had ‚Äúreached out a number of times‚Äù in recent days. ‚ÄúI have a very good relationship with President‚ÄØXi, and I think it‚Äôs going to continue,‚Äù Trump said. Asked if Xi himself had called, Trump replied, ‚ÄúWell, the same. I view it very similar. It would be top levels of China.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs comments come after months of rising import duties that have pushed U.S. taxes on Chinese goods to a combined 145‚ÄØpercent and prompted Beijing to retaliate with tariffs of 125‚ÄØpercent. The trade war has halted commerce between the world‚Äôs two largest economies and complicated a separate effort to force ByteDance‚ÄØLtd. to divest TikTok‚Äôs American operations. On Thursday, the President suggested for the first time that further tariff hikes could backfire. ‚ÄúAt a certain point I don‚Äôt want them to go higher because at a certain point you make it where people don‚Äôt buy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo I may not want to go higher, or I may not want to even go up to that level. I may want to go to less because, you know, you want people to buy.‚Äù Trump may provide a relief in tariffs if China accepts TikTok divestiture Both capitals have insisted that the other side make the next move. Even so, Trump sounded upbeat about the chances of linking a wider trade deal with a TikTok deal . ‚ÄúWell, we have a deal for TikTok, but it‚Äôll be subject to China, so we‚Äôll just delay the deal till this thing works out,‚Äù he said. He argued that selling TikTok‚Äôs U.S. assets to ‚Äúsome of the best companies in the world‚Äù would satisfy American security worries and still benefit Beijing. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a good deal for China,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTikTok is good for China. And I think they‚Äôd like to see us do a deal, especially the deal that we have pretty much done.‚Äù When asked about whether tariff relief might be offered if China accepts the divestiture plan, the president answered that nothing was off the table. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a natural ‚Äî if we‚Äôre making a deal. I guess we‚Äôll spend five minutes to talk about TikTok. It wouldn‚Äôt take very long,‚Äù he said. Trump declined to describe any timetable for new talks or for easing duties. He also avoided saying whether he and Xi had spoken directly, stressing instead that any overture from Beijing would reflect Xi‚Äôs personal approval. ‚ÄúIf you knew him you would know that if they reached out, he knew exactly,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúHe knew everything about it, he runs it very tight, very strong, very smart.‚Äù With both sides dug in publicly, it remains unclear how soon formal negotiations might resume.

The media outlet Daehan Kyungjae reported that FIU, which answers to the Financial Services Commission (FSC), will wrap up its investigation on April 18. The probe began on March 17, and was originally planned to conclude on March 28. The investigation is primarily aimed at checking exchanges‚Äô compliance with anti-money laundering protocols. After Bithumb, Coinone will be the last of South Korea‚Äôs five fiat KRW-trading exchanges to face the FIU probe.

(Source: CoinGecko) The Upbit probe unearthed a slew of Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verification violations, with the FSC later dishing out a three-month punishment. In late March, a branch of the Seoul Administrative Court suspended the ban for 30 days . The media outlet quoted an anonymous official from an unnamed domestic crypto exchange as saying that the FIU‚Äôs extension ‚Äúmay be due to the vast amount of data‚Äù it is now combing through. However, the same individual claimed there was a ‚Äúsuspicion‚Äù that the delay was due to a specific transaction. The individual claimed that Bithumb wallets had ‚Äútransferred more than 60 million coins, worth approximately 22.4 billion won (over $15.8 million), to an exchange that is not registered with the financial authorities.‚Äù The FIU plans to begin its on-site inspection at Coinone on April 21.

(Source: CoinGecko) The FSS claims that a former Bithumb CEO and a current advisor used company-provided apartment deposits to lease a property to a third party. The regulator thinks that one of the executives used a KRW 1.1 billion ($778,000) deposit from Bithumb to pay for a home they then leased to a resident in exchange for rent payments worth around $2 million. The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors‚Äô Office‚Äôs crypto investigation team followed up with a raid of Bithumb‚Äôs headquarters last month. Coinone, meanwhile, faced an FSS probe of its own late last year. The investigation followed a massive December 9 Movement (MOVE) token price spike on the Coinone platform.

The crypto market in 2025 is rewarding early movers who back projects with working products, clear roadmaps, and rising demand. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain dominant, new projects are quietly gaining ground‚Äîand delivering serious growth. In this guide, we break down six of the top cryptos to buy now, including BlockDAG , Web3 ai , Cold Wallet, Unstaked, Dragoin, and Web3Bay. Whether you‚Äôre after cutting-edge AI, privacy tools, meme coin potential, or real-world e-commerce integration, these tokens check all the right boxes. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) ‚Äî Best Crypto Infrastructure Pick Right Now BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the best cryptos to invest in now. It‚Äôs raised over $214.5 million, sold 16,600+ mining rigs, and its X1 mobile miner app has hit 800,000+ users. What makes BlockDAG different is its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology. Instead of creating one block at a time like traditional chains, it allows for multiple blocks to be created in parallel‚Äîmaking transactions faster and cheaper. The project is EVM-compatible , making it easy for developers to migrate dApps from Ethereum. Currently in Batch 27 at $0.0248 , BDAG‚Äôs projected ROI stands at 2,380% , especially with its mainnet launching in just 4 months . For those looking for a project that blends technical strength with growing adoption, BlockDAG is one of the best cryptos to buy now . 2. Web3 ai (WAI) ‚Äî Top AI Crypto With Real Utility From Day One Web3 ai merges artificial intelligence with crypto to give users a powerful suite of tools for smarter investing. Unlike most presale projects, Web3 ai already offers 12 live tools , including an AI trading assistant, price prediction engine, scam detector, yield farming advisor, and automated trading bot. The project uses advanced machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to deliver real-time insights across multiple chains and exchanges. The $WAI token, priced at $0.10 in Batch 1, gives users full access to the platform and a future listing price of $0.80 makes the upside extremely attractive. If you want a working product, a clear roadmap, and next-gen AI tools in one package, Web3 ai is one of the best new cryptos to buy now . 3. Cold Wallet (CWT) ‚Äî Best Privacy Crypto Wallet in the Market If privacy matters to you, Cold Wallet could be the best crypto to buy now for protecting your assets. Unlike most wallets that track IP addresses, log behavior, or expose transaction data, Cold Wallet is invisible by design. It functions like a cold wallet but remains online and fully accessible. Powered by zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) , it supports private transactions, hidden balances, and anonymous authentication. The $CWT token , now in presale at $0.007 , will unlock premium features and governance. With a launch price of $0.35 , Cold Wallet offers serious upside for early backers. As hacks and surveillance increase in Web3, Cold Wallet is standing out as one of the best cryptos to buy now for privacy-first users. 4. Unstaked (UNSD) ‚Äî Best AI Agent Platform for Earning and Engagement Unstaked is the first crypto platform that deploys AI agents to run and grow your online communities‚Äîcompletely autonomously. These agents create content, reply to users, and optimize behavior in real-time. They‚Äôre tied to your wallet and earn based on actual performance through a system called Proof of Intelligence (PoI). The token, $UNSD , is priced at just $0.0065 in presale, with a projected launch market cap of over $1 billion . With $20 million in liquidity provisioned at launch , this isn‚Äôt just an idea‚Äîit‚Äôs a fully functional platform from day one. For those who want real AI utility, merit-based rewards, and early entry, Unstaked is among the best cryptos to invest in today. 5. Dragoin (DDGN) ‚Äî Meme Coin With Burn Mechanics and Scarcity Dragoin is not your typical meme coin. Every transaction burns a portion of the supply, creating real scarcity. This smart deflationary design helps prevent the common inflation issues found in many meme projects. The token, $DDGN , is in public presale , with a launch price set at $0.002 . Inspired by SHIB and PEPE but with better tokenomics, Dragoin offers meme potential without the empty speculation. If it hits its upside targets, early holders could see gains as high as 6,700% . If you‚Äôre looking for the best meme crypto to buy now, Dragoin is worth serious attention. 6. Web3Bay (3BAY) ‚Äî Best Crypto for Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is building the Amazon of Web3‚Äîa fully decentralized, peer-to-peer e-commerce platform. It supports both crypto and fiat payments, including PayPal, Google Pay, and Apple Pay. With smart contracts handling escrow and settlements, Web3Bay eliminates the need for intermediaries. The $3BAY token is priced at $0.00524 in Stage 5 , with $1.7 million raised and 400M tokens sold . Token holders get discounts, governance rights, and staking rewards. As the project evolves, plans include NFT integration, lending, and full DAO governance. Web3Bay is easily one of the best cryptos to buy now if you‚Äôre bullish on blockchain adoption in e-commerce.

Despite the current lack of a strong bullish momentum, many crypto analysts are banking on a bullish continuation and a new Bitcoin price all-time high before the end of 2025. According to crypto analyst TradingShot, Bitcoin could be approaching the final leg of this bull cycle, predicting a peak above $125,000. However, this analysis comes with a caveat that an extended bear market might roll in by October 2025. Long-Term Bitcoin Cycles Hint At Imminent Peak TradingShot‚Äôs analysis, which was posted on the TradingView platform, is based on over a decade of symmetrical Bitcoin market behavior that shows both bull and bear cycles unfolding in consistent timeframes. According to TradingShot, the bull cycles dating back to 2015 have all lasted approximately 1,064 days, or 152 weeks, with each cycle topping out almost exactly three years after the previous bottom. On the other hand, bear cycles have consistently lasted for around one year, either from December to December or November to November. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Following Analyst‚Äôs Prediction For Bullish Breakout, Here‚Äôs The Target This historical symmetry is reflected in the chart below, which highlights three bull cycles followed by three bear periods, all forming a repeating pattern. The most recent bottom, recorded on November 7, 2022, marked the start of the current bull cycle. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin could reach its next peak in the week of October 6, 2025. The bull cycle has led to Bitcoin breaking above $100,000 and now with an all-time high of $108,786, but like many others, the analyst predicted this peak will still be broken this year. This peak will likely mirror the explosive rallies that ended the 2017 and 2021 cycles and eventually surpass $125,000. Sell Everything In October 2025, Buy Back In October 2026 TradingShot‚Äôs primary advice is blunt but strategic: sell everything by October 2025. According to the analyst, this window could be the final opportunity to exit near the top before the next bear cycle takes hold. Counting 1064 days from the most recent bottom of $15,600 in November 07 2022, gives a time estimate for the next cycle top on October 6 2025. If history repeats itself, the subsequent bearish phase will likely last for 12 months and bottom out around October 12, 2026, before the next bull phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Stalls Below $85,000 Psychological Level, Why A Drop To $74,000 Is Possible This timing is not speculative; it‚Äôs based on a consistent one-year bearish phase across three full market cycles. Therefore, it would be better to sell before October 2025 and start accumulating by October 2026. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $84,500, up by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and 48% away from the predicted peak of $125,000.

The largest U.S. crypto exchange has rolled out improved failsafes, enhanced liquidity measures, and faster transaction processing. Additionally, Coinbase promised to speed up Solana transaction processing times in January after users encountered problems with depositing and withdrawing SOL. Coinbase supercharges Solana support with 5x faster throughput According to Coinbase , enhancements allowed quicker and more dependable sends and receives, reaffirming its dedication to providing industry-best results and dependability for its users. In addition, the crypto exchange highlighted that to satisfy demand, as Solana expanded in the future, it kept investing in its infrastructure. The crypto exchange also shared an X post that detailed the enhancements. Based on the X post, these enhancements included asynchronous transaction processing that will result in a five-fold increase in block processing throughput, four-fold improvements to the remote procedure call (RPC), failover augmentations to increase resilience, liquidity optimizations, and enhanced operational controls. Moreover, on January 21, Coinbase shared a post on the X platform stating that ‚ÄúCoinbase has seen unprecedented Solana transaction activity ‚Ä¶ and our systems have been unable to validate and process transactions at the speed that we are receiving them.‚Äù This came after users experienced delays when attempting to withdraw or deposit SOL, sometimes lasting hours. Interestingly, according to the crypto exchange, the volume of transactions at that time was ten times higher than usual. Meme coin trading has gained popularity, which has led to Solana‚Äôs widespread adoption Extensive meme coin trading had been a major factor in Solana‚Äôs high transaction volumes. This resulted partly from a significant rise in Solana‚Äôs market capitalization that occurred the weekend before the inauguration when the new president and first lady released meme coins on the blockchain, contributing to the rise in popularity of meme coin trading. However, weeks before Trump‚Äôs token launch, reports from sources revealed that Solana‚Äôs overall onchain trading volume and fees had reached all-time highs due to memecoin trading volume. On January 5, Solana‚Äôs onchain volume reached an all-time high of $3.79 billion, with approximately 4.5 million active addresses. Solana is up nearly 23% over the past week, making it one of the biggest gainers in the top 100 coins. According to CoinMarketCap reports, Solana is trading at $133.32, reflecting a 0.04% increase in the past 24 hours. With a market capitalization of around $69.68 billion, it holds the sixth spot among all cryptocurrencies by market value. T he recent surge comes amid Wednesday‚Äôs launch of Canada‚Äôs first spot Solana ETFs from issuers, including 3iQ, Evolve, CI, and Purpose. The exchange-traded funds feature staking functionality, providing investors with yield obtained by issuers staking their SOL to support the Solana blockchain. Spot Solana ETFs have yet to be approved in the United States. However, firms including VanEck, 21Shares, and Bitwise have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch such products. Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs were both approved in the U.S. in 2024. Alongside Solana, issuers have filed to launch a potentially wide range of additional spot crypto funds in the States, including those tied to XRP, Dogecoin, and even President Donald Trump‚Äôs official Solana-based meme coin.

Enter Chatbot Arena, the AI benchmarking platform that has become a cornerstone for major AI labs. Now, in a major development, Chatbot Arena is taking a giant leap forward by forming its own company, Arena Intelligence Inc. This move signals a significant commitment to enhancing its platform and solidifying its role in the rapidly expanding AI landscape. Let‚Äôs dive into what this exciting development means for the AI community and beyond. What is Chatbot Arena and Why Does It Matter? Before we delve into the new company formation, it‚Äôs crucial to understand what Chatbot Arena is and why it has become so influential. Launched in 2023 and primarily managed by researchers affiliated with UC Berkeley, Chatbot Arena is a crowdsourced platform designed for AI model testing . Think of it as a neutral battleground where different AI models, including flagship models from giants like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, are put to the test by a global community of users. Here‚Äôs why Chatbot Arena is so important: Neutral Benchmarking: It offers a platform free from bias, allowing for objective comparisons between different AI models. This is vital in an industry where marketing hype can often overshadow genuine performance metrics. Community-Driven Evaluation: The power of crowdsourcing means a wide range of perspectives contribute to the evaluation process, making the benchmarking more comprehensive and reflective of real-world usage. Industry Standard: Major AI labs rely on Chatbot Arena for testing and showcasing their models, highlighting its credibility and influence within the AI industry. Transparency: By making the evaluation process public, Chatbot Arena fosters transparency and accountability in AI development. Arena Intelligence Inc.: A New Chapter for AI Benchmarking The announcement of Arena Intelligence Inc. marks a pivotal moment for Chatbot Arena. According to a recent blog post and reports from Bloomberg, this new corporate structure is designed to inject resources and accelerate the platform‚Äôs development. The team behind Chatbot Arena emphasizes that this move will enable them to significantly improve the platform beyond its current capabilities. What can we expect from this new AI company formation ? Enhanced Platform Features: With dedicated resources, Arena Intelligence Inc. is poised to introduce new features, improve user experience, and potentially expand the types of AI models and benchmarks offered. Sustained Neutrality: A core promise from the team is the continued commitment to providing a neutral testing ground, uninfluenced by external vested interests. This is crucial for maintaining the platform‚Äôs integrity and trustworthiness. Business Model Exploration: While details are still under wraps, the formation of a company suggests the exploration of sustainable business models.

This latest outburst has sent ripples through financial markets, raising questions about the future direction of U.S. monetary policy and the independence of the central bank. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors closely monitoring global economic signals, this development is particularly noteworthy as it adds another layer of uncertainty to the already complex macroeconomic landscape. Let‚Äôs delve deeper into Trump‚Äôs accusations, the Fed‚Äôs stance, and what this all means for the broader economy and potentially, the crypto markets. Why is Trump Targeting Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve? Trump‚Äôs criticism of Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve is not new, but this recent call for his removal marks a significant intensification. At the heart of Trump‚Äôs discontent lies the belief that the Fed‚Äôs monetary policy is hindering economic growth and putting the U.S. at a disadvantage compared to other nations. According to a post by Walter Bloomberg on X, Trump specifically pointed to the European Central Bank (ECB) as an example, highlighting their recent interest rate cut ‚Äì their seventh ‚Äì as a proactive measure the Fed has failed to emulate. Trump argues that the Fed‚Äôs inaction is making the U.S. less competitive globally. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of Trump‚Äôs main grievances: Accusation of Inaction: Trump claims the Fed is ‚Äúfalling behind global peers‚Äù like the ECB by not cutting interest rates aggressively enough. Economic Growth Concerns: He believes higher interest rates are stifling US economy growth and potentially leading to a recession. Global Competitiveness: Trump suggests that lower interest rates in other countries give them an unfair economic advantage over the US economy . Personal Animosity: There‚Äôs a history of strained relations between Trump and Jerome Powell , dating back to Powell‚Äôs appointment during Trump‚Äôs presidency. It‚Äôs important to remember that central bank independence is a cornerstone of modern economic policy in many countries. The idea is to shield monetary policy decisions from short-term political pressures, allowing central bankers to focus on long-term economic stability and price stability. Trump‚Äôs public pronouncements and calls for Powell‚Äôs removal challenge this established norm. The Fed‚Äôs Stance on Interest Rates and the US Economy The Federal Reserve , under Jerome Powell‚Äôs leadership, has been navigating a delicate balancing act. Their primary mandate is to maintain price stability (control inflation) and promote maximum employment. In recent times, the Fed has been focused on combating inflation, which surged in the aftermath of the pandemic and global supply chain disruptions. To tame inflation, the Fed aggressively raised interest rates throughout 2022 and 2023. While inflation has cooled down from its peak, it remains above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target. The Fed‚Äôs current approach is to maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance until they are confident that inflation is sustainably moving towards their target. Here‚Äôs a summary of the Fed‚Äôs current position: Factor Fed‚Äôs Stance Inflation Concerned, still above target Interest Rates Currently holding steady, but data-dependent US Economy Growth Monitoring, aiming for a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù (slowing inflation without causing a recession) Global Economic Conditions Considering, but primarily focused on domestic mandate The Fed argues that premature interest rate cuts could reignite inflationary pressures, potentially leading to more economic pain down the line. They emphasize a data-dependent approach, meaning their decisions will be guided by incoming economic data, particularly inflation and employment figures. Market Reaction and Betting Odds on Powell‚Äôs Departure Financial markets are sensitive to any signals regarding the future of monetary policy and the stability of the Federal Reserve . Trump‚Äôs comments have undoubtedly introduced an element of uncertainty. According to reports, betting odds on Jerome Powell‚Äôs departure this year have seen a notable increase. Kalshi, a prediction market platform, reported that the odds of Powell leaving his position in 2024 rose to 26% following Trump‚Äôs remarks. This increase in betting odds reflects market participants‚Äô acknowledgment of the heightened political pressure on Powell. While it‚Äôs important to note that these are just betting odds and not definitive predictions, they do indicate a growing perception of risk surrounding Powell‚Äôs tenure. Here‚Äôs what this market reaction suggests: Increased Uncertainty: Trump‚Äôs comments inject uncertainty into the market‚Äôs outlook for Fed policy. Potential for Volatility: Further escalations in Trump‚Äôs rhetoric could lead to increased market volatility, particularly in bond and stock markets. Focus on Fed Independence: The situation highlights the importance of central bank independence and the potential risks when this principle is challenged. Monitoring Political Developments: Investors will be closely watching political developments and any further signals regarding the Fed‚Äôs future leadership. Impact on Cryptocurrency Markets While the immediate focus of Trump‚Äôs criticism is on traditional financial markets and the US economy , the cryptocurrency market is not immune to these developments. Crypto markets are increasingly intertwined with the broader macroeconomic environment. Here‚Äôs how Trump‚Äôs stance on Jerome Powell and the Fed could potentially impact the crypto space: Economic Uncertainty & Safe Haven Assets: Increased economic uncertainty can sometimes drive investors towards perceived safe haven assets, and in some cases, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have been considered as such. However, this relationship is not always consistent and can be influenced by various factors. Dollar Strength/Weakness: Fed policy and interest rate decisions can impact the strength of the US dollar. A weaker dollar could, in theory, make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more attractive to international investors. Conversely, a stronger dollar could have the opposite effect. Risk Appetite: Overall market sentiment and risk appetite are crucial drivers for crypto markets. If Trump‚Äôs criticism leads to broader market jitters or a perception of increased economic risk, it could impact investor sentiment towards cryptocurrencies as well. Regulatory Landscape: Political shifts and changes in administration can also influence the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. While not directly related to Powell‚Äôs removal, the broader political climate can indirectly affect crypto regulations. Navigating the Uncertainty: Key Takeaways Trump‚Äôs renewed attack on Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve adds another layer of complexity to the economic and market outlook. For those involved in the cryptocurrency space, it‚Äôs crucial to stay informed and understand the potential implications. Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Monitor Economic Data: Pay close attention to key economic indicators, particularly inflation and employment data, as these will heavily influence the Fed‚Äôs future decisions. Stay Updated on Fed Communication: Follow speeches and statements from Fed officials, including Jerome Powell , to gauge their thinking and potential policy shifts. Assess Market Sentiment: Keep an eye on market sentiment and volatility in both traditional and crypto markets, as these can be indicators of investor reactions to political and economic developments. Diversification and Risk Management: In times of uncertainty, diversification and robust risk management strategies are even more critical in your investment portfolio, including crypto holdings. Understand Macroeconomic Interplay: Recognize that cryptocurrency markets are increasingly influenced by macroeconomic factors and global economic events. Conclusion: A Test for Fed Independence? Donald Trump‚Äôs forceful call for Jerome Powell‚Äôs removal is more than just political rhetoric; it‚Äôs a direct challenge to the independence of the Federal Reserve and a potential source of market instability. While the likelihood of Powell‚Äôs immediate removal remains uncertain, the episode underscores the ongoing tensions between political pressures and central bank autonomy. For cryptocurrency investors and the broader financial world, this situation warrants close monitoring. The coming months will be crucial in determining how this drama unfolds and what implications it holds for the US economy and global markets.

The law gives the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic the exclusive right to issue the digital som, establish the rules for its issuance and circulation, and oversee the platform on which the national currency will operate, Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs presidential office said on April 17. However, a final decision on whether to officially issue the CBDC is not expected until the end of 2026, local outlet Trend News Agency reported in December. If the central bank decides to adopt the digital som, it would also need to outline cryptographic protection measures to ensure the digital som remains secure and isn‚Äôt used for fraudulent transactions. Testing of the digital som platform is expected to take place sometime this year. Zhaparov‚Äôs sign-off comes nearly a month after Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs parliament, the Jogorku Kenesh, approved the amendment to Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs constitutional law on March 18. CBDCs continue to be heavily criticized by some members of the crypto community, flagging concerns that they could undermine financial privacy and enable excessive government oversight, among other things. While 115 nations have initiated CBDC projects, only four CBDCs have officially launched ‚Äî the Bahamas Sand Dollar, Nigeria‚Äôs e-Naira, Zimbabwe‚Äôs ZiG and Jamaica‚Äôs JAM-DEX, data from cbdctracker.org shows.

The financial landscape in Hong Kong is about to witness a significant shift as Huaxia Fund, a subsidiary of China Asset Management (ChinaAMC), prepares to inject a powerful feature into its ETH ETF staking product. Imagine earning rewards simply by holding onto your Ethereum ETF ‚Äì that‚Äôs precisely what Huaxia Fund is set to offer. Let‚Äôs dive into how this game-changing development is reshaping the Hong Kong crypto ETF market and what it means for investors like you. What‚Äôs the Buzz Around Huaxia Fund‚Äôs ETH ETF Staking? On May 15th, Huaxia Fund will officially introduce staking capabilities to its Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). This makes them only the second entity in Hong Kong to embrace this innovative feature, marking a significant leap forward for crypto investment products in the region. But why is this such a big deal? Let‚Äôs break it down: First Mover Advantage (Almost): While not the absolute first, Huaxia Fund is among the pioneers in Hong Kong to offer Ethereum staking within an ETF structure. This positions them as a forward-thinking player in the rapidly evolving crypto ETF space. Regulatory Green Light: This move is made possible by the recent progressive changes in crypto regulations Hong Kong . The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has updated its rules to allow regulated firms to provide crypto staking services, paving the way for institutions like Huaxia Fund to innovate. Institutional Backing and Trust: As a subsidiary of ChinaAMC, a major player in asset management, Huaxia Fund brings credibility and trust to the crypto ETF market. Their foray into staking further legitimizes crypto investments within traditional financial frameworks. Enhanced Investor Appeal: Staking adds an extra layer of attractiveness to ETH ETFs. Investors can now potentially earn passive income on their ETH holdings through staking rewards, in addition to potential capital appreciation. This isn‚Äôt just about adding a feature; it‚Äôs about fundamentally enhancing the value proposition of a Huaxia Fund ETF and making crypto investments more appealing to a wider audience in Hong Kong. The Mechanics: How Does ETH ETF Staking Work? For those new to the concept, staking might sound a bit technical. But the core idea is quite simple. When you stake your Ethereum, you are essentially participating in the network‚Äôs operation. Here‚Äôs a simplified explanation in the context of an ETF: Holding ETH ETF Shares: You, as an investor, hold shares of the Huaxia Fund ETH ETF. These shares represent ownership of underlying Ethereum. ETF Provider Stakes ETH: Huaxia Fund, as the ETF provider, takes a portion of the ETH held by the ETF and stakes it on the Ethereum network. Earning Staking Rewards: By staking, the ETF provider earns staking rewards. These rewards are generated by the Ethereum network for validating transactions and securing the blockchain. Passing Rewards to Investors (Potentially): While not explicitly stated in the provided content whether the staking rewards will be directly passed on to ETF holders, in typical staking ETF models, a portion of these rewards are often reflected in the ETF‚Äôs overall performance, potentially increasing the ETF‚Äôs value over time. It‚Äôs crucial to check the specific ETF prospectus for details on reward distribution. Key Player: OSL Digital Services To ensure the security and efficiency of this staking operation, Huaxia Fund is partnering with OSL Digital Services. OSL will provide the crucial custody and staking infrastructure. This partnership highlights the growing synergy between traditional finance and specialized crypto service providers. Why is Hong Kong Becoming a Crypto Hub? The Regulatory Shift Hong Kong‚Äôs proactive approach to crypto regulation is a key factor driving these innovations. For a while, the regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies globally has been a patchwork of approaches, ranging from outright bans to cautious acceptance. Hong Kong, however, is positioning itself as a more welcoming and regulated hub for digital assets. The recent rule change by the SFC, allowing regulated entities to offer crypto staking, is a testament to this shift. Factors Contributing to Hong Kong‚Äôs Crypto-Friendly Stance: Desire to be a Financial Innovation Hub: Hong Kong has historically been a major financial center. Embracing crypto and fintech innovation is seen as crucial to maintaining this status in the evolving global economy. Clearer Regulatory Framework: By establishing clear rules and guidelines, Hong Kong is aiming to attract legitimate crypto businesses and investors while mitigating risks. The SFC‚Äôs move on staking is a prime example of this clarity. Competition in Asia: There‚Äôs a regional race to become a crypto hub. Locations like Singapore and Dubai are also vying for this position. Hong Kong‚Äôs recent regulatory moves signal its intent to be a serious contender. Attracting Institutional Investment: Regulations that foster trust and security are essential to attract institutional investors into the crypto space. Allowing staking within regulated ETFs is a step in this direction. This supportive regulatory environment is not just beneficial for companies like Huaxia Fund; it‚Äôs creating a more vibrant and dynamic crypto ecosystem in Hong Kong, potentially attracting talent, investment, and further innovation. Benefits of ETH ETF Staking: A Win-Win Scenario? The introduction of staking to ETH ETFs offers several potential benefits for various stakeholders: Stakeholder Benefit Investors Potential to earn passive income through staking rewards, enhancing overall returns. Exposure to Ethereum with the convenience and security of a regulated ETF. Simplified staking process ‚Äì no need to manage staking infrastructure directly. ETF Providers (like Huaxia Fund) Differentiated product offering, potentially attracting more investors and assets under management. Opportunity to generate additional revenue through staking rewards (part of which may be reinvested or contribute to ETF fees). Enhanced reputation as an innovator in the crypto ETF market. Ethereum Network Increased participation in staking, contributing to network security and decentralization. Greater adoption of Ethereum as an asset class. Hong Kong as a Financial Hub Strengthened position as a leading center for fintech and crypto innovation. Attraction of crypto businesses and investment. Economic growth and job creation in the crypto sector. While the benefits appear substantial, it‚Äôs also important to consider potential challenges. Challenges and Considerations Introducing staking to ETH ETFs is not without its complexities and potential challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty (Evolving Landscape): While Hong Kong‚Äôs regulations are becoming clearer, the global regulatory landscape for crypto is still evolving. Future changes could impact staking ETFs. Custodial Risks: Secure custody of staked ETH is paramount. Reliance on third-party custodians like OSL introduces a layer of dependency and potential risk, although OSL is a reputable provider. Slashing Risks: In proof-of-stake systems like Ethereum, there‚Äôs a risk of ‚Äúslashing‚Äù ‚Äì penalties imposed on validators for misbehavior. ETF providers need robust risk management to mitigate this. Complexity for Investors: While simplified compared to direct staking, understanding the nuances of staking ETFs and how rewards are distributed may still require some investor education. Fee Structures: Investors need to be aware of the fee structures associated with staking ETFs and how these fees impact net returns after staking rewards. Actionable Insights for Investors Considering the developments around Hong Kong crypto ETF staking, here are some actionable insights for investors: Do Your Due Diligence: Before investing in any ETH ETF, especially staking ETFs, thoroughly research the ETF provider (like Huaxia Fund ETF ), understand the fee structure, and review the ETF prospectus for details on staking mechanisms and reward distribution. Understand Staking Risks: Familiarize yourself with the risks associated with staking, including slashing and custodial risks. Assess your risk tolerance. Compare Different ETFs: As more staking ETFs become available, compare their features, fees, and potential returns. Don‚Äôt just focus on staking; consider the overall ETF structure and management. Stay Informed on Regulations: Keep abreast of regulatory developments in Hong Kong and globally related to crypto and ETFs. Regulatory changes can impact the landscape. Consider Long-Term Potential: View staking ETFs as a long-term investment in the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader crypto space. Staking rewards can compound over time. Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward for Crypto ETFs Huaxia Fund‚Äôs move to add staking to its ETH ETF in Hong Kong is undoubtedly a revolutionary step. It signifies the growing maturity of the crypto market and the increasing acceptance of digital assets within mainstream finance. As crypto regulations Hong Kong become more refined and supportive, we can expect to see further innovation and adoption of crypto investment products. For investors, this development opens up exciting new avenues to participate in the Ethereum ecosystem and potentially enhance their portfolio returns.

43467616,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150626,1744937434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Savvy OpenAI Unveils Flex Processing: Unlock Cheaper AI for Smart Tasks,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-flex-processing-cheaper-ai/,"In the fast-evolving world of artificial intelligence, where every byte and millisecond counts, OpenAI is making a smart move to democratize access and optimize costs. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space who are constantly seeking efficient and scalable solutions, this development is particularly noteworthy. Imagine leveraging powerful AI without breaking the bank ‚Äì that‚Äôs the promise of OpenAI‚Äôs latest innovation: Flex Processing . What is OpenAI Flex Processing and Why Should You Care About Cheaper AI? OpenAI, the powerhouse behind cutting-edge AI models, is rolling out Flex Processing , a new API option designed to offer significantly reduced prices for AI model usage. This isn‚Äôt just a minor price tweak; it‚Äôs a strategic shift to compete more effectively with rivals like Google and to cater to a broader range of AI application needs. The trade-off? Slower response times and potential occasional resource unavailability. But for many tasks, especially those not requiring lightning-fast speeds, this is a game-changer. Why is this relevant to the crypto world? Because as blockchain and AI converge, cost-effective AI solutions become crucial for everything from smart contract analysis to decentralized application enhancements. Cheaper AI means more accessible innovation. Diving Deep into the Details of API Pricing for AI Models Let‚Äôs get down to brass tacks and see how much cheaper AI we‚Äôre talking about with Flex Processing . Currently in beta for OpenAI‚Äôs o3 and o4-mini reasoning models, this option is specifically targeted at tasks that aren‚Äôt mission-critical or time-sensitive. Think of activities like model evaluations, enriching datasets, or handling asynchronous workloads ‚Äì tasks that are important but don‚Äôt demand immediate results. The price reduction is a flat 50% across the board. Here‚Äôs a quick comparison: Model Processing Type Input Tokens (per 1M) Output Tokens (per 1M) o3 Standard $10 $40 o3 Flex Processing $5 $20 o4-mini Standard $1.10 $4.40 o4-mini Flex Processing $0.55 $2.20 As you can see, the savings are substantial. For instance, with o3 Flex Processing , you‚Äôre looking at $5 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words) and $20 per million output tokens, compared to the standard rates of $10 and $40 respectively. For the more compact o4-mini, the drop is equally impressive, making it even more accessible for various applications. This price cut directly addresses the rising artificial intelligence costs which can be a barrier to entry for many developers and smaller projects. Why Now? The Competitive Landscape and Artificial Intelligence Costs The timing of Flex Processing is no coincidence. The frontier of AI development is becoming increasingly expensive, with top-tier models demanding significant computational resources. At the same time, the market is seeing a surge of more efficient, budget-friendly models from competitors. Google, for example, recently launched Gemini 2.5 Flash, a reasoning model that boasts performance on par with or even exceeding DeepSeek‚Äôs R1, but at a lower input token cost. This competitive pressure is pushing AI companies to innovate not just in model capabilities but also in pricing strategies. OpenAI‚Äôs move is a clear indication that the race for AI dominance is also a race to offer the most cost-effective solutions. For businesses and developers, this means more choices and the potential to optimize their API pricing based on their specific needs. ID Verification and Access to Advanced AI Models In conjunction with the launch of Flex Processing , OpenAI has also introduced a new ID verification process for developers in tiers 1-3 of their usage hierarchy to access the o3 model. These tiers are based on spending on OpenAI services. Furthermore, features like o3‚Äôs reasoning summaries and streaming API support are also gated behind this verification. OpenAI states that this measure is aimed at preventing misuse and policy violations by malicious actors. While it adds a step to the onboarding process, it underscores the company‚Äôs commitment to responsible AI development and deployment. For legitimate users, this is a small hurdle to ensure a safer and more reliable AI ecosystem. Benefits of Embracing Flex Processing for AI Tasks Significant Cost Reduction: The 50% price cut is the most obvious advantage. This can dramatically lower the operational expenses for projects that utilize AI models, making AI more financially viable for a wider range of applications. Ideal for Non-Critical Tasks: For processes like data enrichment, model evaluations, and asynchronous workflows where immediate response isn‚Äôt crucial, Flex Processing offers an economically sound alternative without sacrificing the power of OpenAI‚Äôs models. Democratizing AI Access: By lowering the barrier to entry in terms of cost, OpenAI is making its advanced AI models more accessible to smaller businesses, startups, researchers, and hobbyist developers who might have been priced out before. Optimized Resource Allocation: Flex Processing allows OpenAI to better manage its computational resources by directing less time-sensitive tasks to less premium infrastructure, thus improving overall system efficiency. Use Cases: Where Does Flex Processing Shine? Flex Processing isn‚Äôt meant for every AI application, but it‚Äôs perfectly suited for a variety of use cases, particularly those where speed isn‚Äôt paramount: Model Evaluations and Benchmarking: Testing and evaluating AI models often involves numerous runs and iterations. Cheaper AI processing for these tasks can significantly reduce research and development costs. Data Enrichment: Enhancing datasets with AI-generated insights, summaries, or classifications can be done efficiently and affordably using Flex Processing for background tasks. Asynchronous Workloads: Applications that involve tasks that can be processed in the background without immediate user interaction, such as content generation queues or batch processing of data, are ideal candidates. Internal Tooling and Experimentation: Developing internal AI-powered tools or experimenting with new AI functionalities within a company can be made more cost-effective, encouraging innovation and exploration. Potential Challenges and Considerations While Flex Processing offers numerous benefits, it‚Äôs important to be aware of the trade-offs: Slower Response Times: The most significant drawback is the reduced speed. Applications requiring real-time responses or low latency will not be suitable for Flex Processing . Occasional Unavailability: The service is explicitly stated to have potential resource unavailability. For critical systems that require constant uptime, this might be a concern, though the term ‚Äòoccasional‚Äô suggests it‚Äôs not a frequent issue. Beta Status: Being in beta means the service is still under development and may be subject to changes, including pricing or availability. Users should be prepared for potential adjustments as OpenAI refines the offering. Actionable Insights: Leveraging Flex Processing for Your Projects For those looking to integrate AI into their projects or optimize existing AI workflows, here are some actionable steps: Identify Suitable Tasks: Analyze your AI workloads and pinpoint tasks that are not time-critical and can tolerate slower processing. Model evaluations, data enrichment, and background processing are prime candidates. Evaluate Cost Savings: Calculate the potential cost reduction by switching to Flex Processing for eligible tasks. The 50% reduction can lead to substantial savings, especially for high-volume usage. Test and Monitor Performance: Experiment with Flex Processing on a smaller scale initially to assess the actual response times and reliability for your specific use cases. Monitor performance to ensure it meets your operational requirements. Plan for Asynchronous Workflows: Design or adapt your applications to leverage asynchronous processing where possible. This will allow you to take full advantage of Flex Processing for background tasks without impacting user-facing performance. Stay Updated: Keep an eye on OpenAI‚Äôs updates regarding Flex Processing , especially as it is currently in beta. Be aware of any changes in pricing, features, or terms of service. Conclusion: A Smart Step Towards Accessible and Affordable AI OpenAI‚Äôs Flex Processing is a smart and timely response to the growing demand for cost-effective AI solutions. By offering a 50% reduction in API pricing for slower, non-critical tasks, OpenAI is not only making its powerful AI models more accessible but also strategically positioning itself in an increasingly competitive market. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain community, this development opens up new avenues for integrating AI into various applications without the prohibitive costs often associated with cutting-edge AI technology.

As ETH heats up, it‚Äôs not alone, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is catching the same tailwind. Presale phase 4 has started since the third phase sold out more quickly than anticipated. The fundraising has surpassed $6.8 million while drawing in more than 8400 holders. Investors currently purchase at $0.025 with the understanding that the price will reach $0.03 after phase 5 begins. The current investors stand to gain a 140% return on investment before the project begins trading at $0.06. This emerging DeFi token is setting itself up to mirror ETH‚Äôs trajectory, on a much smaller price tag, and with potentially much larger gains. Mutuum Finance Presale Soars as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance obtained popularity among the decentralized lending sector because its dual-lending model brings fresh ideas to the market. Mutuum Finance earned quick marketplace adoption following its presale start-up because investors from more than 8,400 participants contributed $6.8 million. Investors can make profits from the Phase 5 price rise of Mutuum Finance tokens from $0.025 during Phase 4 to $0.03. Experts identify Mutuum Finance as the least valued DeFi startup for present times and foresee an anticipated value surpassing $1 during public distribution. In a recent update, Mutuum Finance introduced an interactive dashboard that displays a real-time leaderboard, highlighting the top 50 token holders. These investors won‚Äôt just get recognized, they‚Äôll also earn bonus tokens for maintaining their spot on the leaderboard. Shaking Up the DeFi Game with a Hybrid Lending Strategy What distinguishes Mutuum Finance is its trailblazing combination of two extremely impactful lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). While the P2C model allows users to invest in liquidity pools and earn passive income in the way of automatic smart contract lending in USDT, the P2P model allows users to lend and borrow directly from each other, cutting out the middleman. Through the integration of these two models, Mutuum Finance brings a new degree of security, efficiency, and decentralization to the DeFi market, making it an attractive option for investors looking for high-yield investments. Building a Secure and Stable Ecosystem In order to offer long-term stability, Mutuum Finance is launching a totally collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. In contrast to earlier algorithmic stablecoins that have been difficult, this stablecoin will be over-collateralized, reducing risk and enhancing confidence. Open financial architectures and audited smart contracts are also employed by the platform in order to eliminate the vulnerabilities that have weakened other DeFi projects. Mutuum Finance strives to enhance its network of users through profitable incentive systems. The $100,000 giveaway divides 10 rewards of $10,000 MUTM tokens while the referral system provides bonuses for successful individual and organizational referrals. Platform users who join early will gain access to exclusive staking pools while also receiving governance voting rights and VIP information updates that keep them involved on the platform for extended periods. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth The hash platform created its economic model specifically for extended platform development. The platform controls presale token releases while implementing deflationary mechanisms to establish limited supply which potentially increases token value throughout time. Through its staking program Mutuum Finance provides enticing incentives that motivate users to maintain active participation in order to help develop the platform successfully. Ethereum‚Äôs bullish momentum could soon push it to new highs, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) appears set to follow suit. With $6.8 million raised and over 8,400 investors already on board, MUTM offers a better entry point at $0.025 during Phase 4. Join the presale today and ride the wave of what could be 2025‚Äôs next major breakout.

Solana (SOL) has jumped more than 22%, adding strength to what many are seeing as the start of a new bull run crypto phase. This jump was driven by improved market sentiment and growing excitement about the token‚Äôs role in decentralized finance (DeFi). On the other hand, Cardano (ADA) is staying focused on long-term goals, with experts predicting it could pass the $9 mark by 2030. But while price jumps and decade-long forecasts make headlines, a lesser-known presale project is quietly presenting one of the clearest growth paths right now. Web3 ai , available at $0.100 in presale and targeting a $0.800 launch, offers a direct route to 700% returns. It sets itself apart by focusing on tools that assist serious participants‚Äîan AI-based system designed to improve trade decisions, catch scams, and improve crypto planning. In a market full of price movement and development plans, Web3 ai could be setting a whole new standard. Solana‚Äôs 22% Rise Points to DeFi Strength Solana (SOL) has become one of the week‚Äôs best performers, with its value climbing by 22% following a global tariff freeze mentioned by former U.S. President Trump. This political event added a boost to the already growing confidence in the market. Solana‚Äôs fast performance and expanding base of decentralized platforms had already placed it in focus, and this announcement only helped raise interest further. Its usage has seen a rise, especially in DEX volume, which has overtaken many competitors and confirmed Solana‚Äôs role as a strong DeFi player. The Solana (SOL) price surge is now viewed as a possible signal of wider capital flowing into high-performing layer-one chains, especially those that mix speed with a simple user experience. If this wave of market gains keeps up, Solana could remain a top option for short-term trade activity. Cardano‚Äôs Long-Term Structure and Price Vision Unlike projects that chase fast results, the future of Cardano (ADA) is taking shape through a steady and careful approach. With a focus on academic research and technical rollouts, Cardano is making progress in on-chain management and smart contract features. Even though it may not generate frequent buzz, some forecasts suggest that ADA could climb above $9 within the decade. Models tied to the Cardano (ADA) future link its possible growth to growing support from institutions, functional DeFi use, and stronger platform reliability. Its focus on peer-reviewed updates and careful delivery methods connects with cautious user groups. Yet, as markets warm up again, ADA‚Äôs slower pace might limit short-term price growth. While those planning to hold long-term could see results, others may view quicker options more favorably. Web3 ai: A Strong Presale Entry with Real Functionality Looking at Solana‚Äôs strong weekly gains and Cardano‚Äôs future goals, Web3 ai enters the scene with a different type of advantage‚Äîearly access and useful features. Priced at $0.100 and expected to reach $0.800, the current presale offers a 700% return window before official listings. But what really sets it apart is what the platform is building. Web3 ai is bringing together 12 connected crypto tools designed to make managing digital assets easier. It includes tools such as AI trade support, planning tools, DeFi return analysis, and a scam detection system. These systems collect insights from top networks like Ethereum, BNB, Solana, and Polygon, bringing news, charts, and trends into one space. The WAI coin unlocks more than features, like lower pricing on premium tools. The layout is meant for use across different chains, and the service will be available on phones, browsers, and the web. At a time when tools, safety, and strong infrastructure matter more than hype, Web3 ai is clearly shaping its own space. Final Remarks! Signals of recovery are growing. From tariff pauses to crypto ETF developments, energy is flowing back into the sector. But what truly drives future value is more than temporary excitement. While the Solana (SOL) price surge is impressive and the Cardano (ADA) future looks promising, neither one offers a solid 700% gain with a structured tool-based model already in progress. As this bull run crypto trend continues, people are watching for platforms that combine low cost with strong features. Web3 ai checks both boxes. It isn‚Äôt just an affordable entry‚Äîit delivers working tools like data insights, safety alerts, and control rights. For those who join early, this is not only about short-term gain‚Äîit‚Äôs also a chance to build strong positions for the future.

This diverse portfolio reflects a holistic approach to AI safety , recognizing that security and responsibility must be embedded across the entire AI lifecycle, from model development to real-world applications. Contrarian Views and Ethical Considerations: Navigating the Complexities of AI Ralston‚Äôs perspective also takes a contrarian stance on certain aspects of AI development, particularly in defense technology. While many in the defense tech space are advocating for fully autonomous weapons, Ralston expresses strong reservations. He explicitly states that SAIF would not invest in fully autonomous weapons, citing the inherent dangers of AI-driven bioweapons and weapon systems operating without human oversight. Interestingly, Ralston is open to investing in ‚Äúweapon safety systems‚Äù ‚Äì technologies designed to detect and prevent attacks from AI weapons. This nuanced approach highlights the ethical considerations at the heart of AI investment and the importance of prioritizing safety and human control, especially in high-stakes domains like defense. The Y Combinator Advantage: Leveraging Connections in a Crowded Market The AI investment landscape is undeniably crowded. Numerous venture capital firms are vying to back the next groundbreaking AI startup. So, what gives SAIF an edge? Ralston believes his extensive network and experience at Y Combinator will be a significant differentiator. Having served as Y Combinator‚Äôs president for three years and an advisor for over a decade, Ralston possesses deep connections within the startup ecosystem. He plans to offer mentorship akin to his YC days, guiding portfolio companies on everything from business strategy to navigating the Y Combinator application process itself. Furthermore, he will leverage his considerable investor network to help startups secure follow-on funding and strategic partnerships. This Y Combinator connection is a powerful asset, providing SAIF startups with unique access and support. What‚Äôs Next for SAIF and the Future of Safe AI? While Ralston has remained tight-lipped about the fund‚Äôs exact size, the number of planned investments, and the identity of his limited partners (LPs), the launch of SAIF marks a pivotal moment for the safe AI startups ecosystem. It signals a growing recognition within the investment community of the critical importance of responsible AI development and deployment. As AI continues to permeate every aspect of our lives, from finance and healthcare to transportation and communication, ensuring its safety and security is paramount. Geoff Ralston‚Äôs Safe Artificial Intelligence Fund is poised to play a crucial role in fostering a future where AI benefits humanity without compromising our safety or ethical principles. This initiative could very well catalyze a new wave of innovation focused on building trustworthy and secure AI systems, a development eagerly anticipated by those in the cryptocurrency world and beyond who understand the value of robust and reliable technology.

Analyst Sets Mid-Term Target At $155,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-following-golds-footsteps-analyst-sets-mid-term-target-at-155000/,"As gold continues to set new all-time highs (ATH) ‚Äì trading at $3,333 per ounce at the time of writing ‚Äì Bitcoin (BTC) has seen more subdued price action, consolidating in the mid-$80,000 range. However, analysts suggest that the top digital asset may soon mirror gold‚Äôs recent momentum. Bitcoin Set To Follow Gold‚Äôs Momentum? In a recent post on X, crypto trading account Cryptollica hinted that BTC may be poised to replicate gold‚Äôs historic price movement seen over the past few months. The account shared the following chart, highlighting the striking similarities between the price actions of gold and BTC. The chart shows both gold and BTC forming a macro-bottom around early 2023, followed by a rejection at the range top in early 2024. Gold eventually broke out in the following months, while BTC lagged slightly, breaking out around November 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin Undervalued? Analyst Breaks Down Bullish On-Chain Metrics According to Cryptollica, BTC now appears to be breaking out of a consolidatory wedge pattern, with a potential mid-term target as high as $155,000. Currently, Bitcoin‚Äôs ATH stands at $108,786, recorded earlier this year in January. BTC is also likely to benefit from several favorable macroeconomic trends. For example, the global M2 money supply is expected to increase in 2025, a development that typically supports risk-on assets like Bitcoin. BTC Maturing As A Safe Haven Asset Beyond technical chart patterns, BTC has demonstrated remarkable resilience amid escalating global tariff-induced uncertainty. According to the latest The Week On-Chain report, both gold and BTC have performed well during the ongoing tariff war. The report notes: Amidst this turmoil, the performance of hard assets remains remarkably impressive. Gold continues to surge higher, having reached a new ATH of $3,300, as investors flee to the traditional safe haven asset. Bitcoin sold off to $75k initially alongside risk assets, but has since recovered the week‚Äôs gains, trading back up to $85k, now flat since this burst of volatility. The report also mentions that BTC recently experienced its largest price correction of the 2023‚Äì25 cycle, a -33% drawdown from its ATH earlier this year. However, this correction remains relatively modest compared to those seen in previous market cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly RSI Breakout Signals Trend Shift ‚Äì Is $100,000 Next For BTC? The following chart illustrates BTC bull market correction drawdowns since 2011. As shown, the recent -33% correction is the shallowest among past cycles, with the deepest being -72% during the 2012‚Äì14 bull market. While BTC continues to show signs of maturing as a reliable asset during times of geopolitical uncertainty, institutional investors appear to be taking profits. This is evidenced by recent outflows from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At press time, BTC is trading at $84,694, up 0.7% in the past 24 hours.

The platform revealed that most of its management team voted to ‚Äúcease and retreat‚Äù after allegations surfaced that North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus Group used the platform to launder approximately $35 million of the $1.4 billion stolen in a Bybit exploit. eXch blames global crackdown and misinterpretation of Its mission for shutdown According to eXch, it was under an ‚Äúactive transatlantic operation‚Äù that targeted its shutdown and potential legal action. eXch said that‚ÄÇwhile it had remained operational despite numerous failed attempts to dismantle its infrastructure ‚Äî which it acknowledged were part of a current operation ‚Äî it no longer felt it was worth operating in an unfriendly environment. It said it was being targeted by Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) due to‚ÄÇconfusion over its mission. At first, the platform rebuffed reports by‚ÄÇcrypto sleuths that it had laundered digital assets for the Lazarus Group. However, it acknowledged handling an ‚Äúinsignificant portion of funds‚Äù from the February attack. Individuals from eXch‚Äôs management team emphasized its focus on user privacy in announcing the shutdown, claiming that some exchanges ‚Äúabuse customers with nonsensical policies‚Äù in their attempts to fight money laundering. Bybit recovers after record $1.5B hack as regulators signal softer stance on crypto On February 21, 2025, a group of hackers from North Korea stole the largest cryptocurrency heist in history after stealing $1.5 billion in Ethereum tokens from the Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange ByBit . The hackers exploited a free storage software product that ByBit used to move Ethereum to another location, most likely coupled with phishing attacks to access control and download malware . On February 22, CEO Ben Zhou assured that the exchange had the resources to ‚Äúcover the loss‚Äù if the funds weren‚Äôt recovered. However, the company later revealed plans to shut down some of its Web3 services and close its NFT marketplace. By April 10, Bybit had regained its market share achieved before the hack: roughly 7%. The exchange paid more than $2 million to bounty hunters providing information that could be used to freeze some of the funds traceable to other platforms, which was estimated to be roughly 89% of the $1.4 billion as of March 20. That effort rewarded tipsters who helped freeze stolen tokens before they could be laundered through smaller exchanges or converted into fiat. Bybit has since recovered its pre-hack market share, regaining roughly 7% of global crypto volume by April 10. Fed chair signals softer crypto rules as digital assets enter the mainstream Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that regulators may soon take a more open approach to digital assets , even as enforcement efforts continue to intensify. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve taken a conservative stance, especially after the wave of failures and frauds,‚Äù Powell said. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre entering a new phase.‚Äù Powell pointed to growing bipartisan interest in regulating stablecoins, signaling that Congress may soon revisit a legal framework that stalled in past sessions. He said any new policy must balance innovation with risk controls, especially as crypto becomes more intertwined with the traditional banking system. ‚ÄúThe climate is changing,‚Äù Powell noted. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre seeing digital assets move into the mainstream.‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Bitcoin Realized Cap Is Growing At A Notably Slower Rate Now According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the Realized Cap of Bitcoin has just set a new record. The ‚ÄúRealized Cap‚Äù here refers to a capitalization model for Bitcoin that calculates the asset‚Äôs total value by assuming the ‚Äòreal‚Äô value of any token in circulation is equal to the spot price at which it was last transacted on the network. The last transaction of a given coin is likely to represent the last point at which it changed hands, so the price at the time of the move would denote the coin‚Äôs current cost basis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Still Close To Extreme Fear‚ÄîGreen Sign For Recovery? As the Realized Cap sums up this acquisition value for all tokens part of the circulating supply, it essentially determines the amount of capital that the investors as a whole have used to purchase Bitcoin. Now, here is the chart for the indicator shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in its value over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realizzed Cap has been following an uptrend for a while now. Whenever the indicator‚Äôs value rises, it means a net amount of capital is flowing into the cryptocurrency. Thus, the long-term surge would imply BTC has been enjoying continuous inflows. That said, while capital has been flowing in without break, the growth rate has fluctuated over the cycle. From the chart, it‚Äôs visible that the Realized Cap saw a particularly sharp rise during two periods: Q1 2024 and Q4 2024. The Q1 2024 phase was followed by a rapid slowdown in capital inflowsm and so far, it would appear that the Q4 2024 one has been seeing something similar. At the height of inflows in December, the growth rate of the metric stood at around 13% per month. Today, this value has declined to just 0.9% per month. Growth is still continuing, of course, and the indicator has managed to set a new record of $872 billion. But as Glassnode has explained, the slowdown could indicate ‚Äúinvestor appetite is softening ‚Äì signaling continued risk-off sentiment.‚Äù Both the periods of fresh capital inflows last year coincided with bull rallies for Bitcoin, while the phase of slowdown in between the two resulted in bearish consolidation for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Hasn‚Äôt Lost This Key Level Yet‚ÄîBull Cycle Intact? The latest drop in Realized Cap growth has so far resulted in a notable drawdown for the asset‚Äôs price. Given the trend of last year, it‚Äôs possible that a proper reversal may not happen for BTC until the metric catches a sharper uptrend. BTC Price Bitcoin has taken to sideways movement over the last few days as its price is still floating around the $84,700 mark.

TRUMP Coin is treading water as it braces for a substantial token unlock. Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing price rebound is gaining strength, with support levels now holding. But while those assets represent known territory, one rising name‚Äî Web3 ai ‚Äîis stealing the spotlight with a 700% ROI baked into its presale. This isn‚Äôt just about performance‚Äîit‚Äôs about positioning. From volatile meme tokens to infrastructure giants and AI-powered presales, the market is sorting itself into short-term buzz and long-term relevance. And for anyone looking for the top altcoin to buy now, these three stories are worth watching. TRUMP Coin Price Today Remains Flat Ahead of $320M Token Release TRUMP Coin is currently trading just above $8, after freefalling from its previous high of $74. Despite the dramatic correction, TRUMP coin price today has been relatively steady‚Äîbut that could soon change. A $320 million token unlock is scheduled for April 17, releasing 20% of the total token supply into circulation. While some traders believe this is already priced in, others are bracing for renewed volatility. Unlocks of this size almost always create friction in the market‚Äîespecially for meme tokens without deeper utility layers to support demand. That said, TRUMP coin price today still reflects enough interest to suggest that volatility hasn‚Äôt vanished‚Äîonly paused. Whether this project rebounds or fades may come down to how the unlock is handled‚Äîand whether speculative energy returns. For now, TRUMP remains a high-risk, high-drama meme asset that, while entertaining, doesn‚Äôt quite rank as a top altcoin to buy now for serious long-term positioning. Ethereum (ETH) Price Recovery Gains Strength Above Key Levels While TRUMP Coin holds flat, Ethereum (ETH) price recovery is gaining traction. After bottoming out near $1,385 last week, ETH has rebounded above $1,500 and is now testing resistance around $1,750. For traders watching closely, this zone marks a major turning point. A confirmed breakout could push Ethereum back toward the $1,800‚Äì$2,000 range over the next few weeks. What‚Äôs fueling the Ethereum (ETH) price recovery? Part of it is macro optimism‚Äîtariff suspensions and stable inflation data have lifted broader risk assets. But Ethereum‚Äôs fundamentals are also playing a role. With DeFi volume rising, Layer 2 adoption increasing, and ETH staking showing record inflows, the use case for Ethereum remains strong. The recovery isn‚Äôt euphoric‚Äîbut it‚Äôs measured, and it‚Äôs building. For mid- to long-term holders, that makes Ethereum a clear component of any balanced portfolio‚Äîand a strong complement to emerging altcoins with breakout potential. Web3 ai: A Utility-Powered 700% Presale Positioned as the Top Altcoin to Buy Now Enter Web3 ai‚Äîthe low-cap AI-driven project now leading the conversation around the top altcoin to buy now. While other tokens are fighting to recover or hold ground, Web3 ai is opening the door to early-stage investors with a confirmed 700% ROI window. The token is available at $0.10 in presale, with an $0.80 launch target already set in motion. But this isn‚Äôt just about price multiples‚Äîit‚Äôs about purpose. Web3 ai is building a 12-tool AI ecosystem aimed at improving crypto decision-making. From AI trading assistants and staking dashboards to risk analytics and scam detectors, every tool is designed to offer real-time insight across Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and Polygon. The $WAI token isn‚Äôt a gimmick‚Äîit powers access to the platform and gives holders governance power over platform upgrades. It‚Äôs a model built not for hype, but for staying power. With crypto getting more complex by the day, investors aren‚Äôt just looking for new tokens‚Äîthey‚Äôre looking for tools that help them manage risk, act faster, and optimize performance. Web3 ai delivers on that, and that‚Äôs exactly why it‚Äôs rapidly being recognized as the top altcoin to buy now ‚Äîespecially before it hits public markets. Final Word TRUMP coin price today is steady, but looming risk remains. Ethereum (ETH) price recovery is progressing, giving confidence to those tracking broader crypto resilience. And Web3 ai is delivering a rare presale combo: functional products, AI-powered utility, and a clear 700% launch window. As 2025 approaches, capital is rotating away from short-lived speculation and into real, useful infrastructure. Web3 ai might not be the loudest name‚Äîyet‚Äîbut it‚Äôs checking the boxes that matter. For early movers with an eye on asymmetric gains and tangible tools, this might just be the top altcoin to buy now before the next cycle fully takes shape.

The bill proposes to tax traders when they sell their cryptocurrency for fiat or pay for goods and services, but crypto-to-crypto and transfers between wallets owned by the same user will be exempt, Slovenia‚Äôs Finance Ministry said in an April 17 statement. Under the proposed legislation, crypto tax will be aligned with existing tax laws. Slovenia taxpayers will be required to keep a record of all their transactions for annual tax returns. The tax base would be calculated on profits by subtracting the purchase price from the sale price. In a statement to the Slovenia Times, finance minister Klemen Bo≈°tjanƒçiƒç said it‚Äôs unreasonable that crypto trading for individuals isn‚Äôt currently taxed in the country. ‚ÄúThe goal of taxation of crypto assets is not to generate tax revenue, but we find it illogical and unreasonable that one of the most speculative financial instruments is not taxed at all,‚Äù he said in a statement translated from Slovenian. New tax could stifle crypto in Slovenia, lawmaker says Jernej Vrtovec, a member of Slovenia‚Äôs national assembly and New Slovenia opposition party, slammed the proposal in an April 16 statement to X, arguing it could stifle crypto growth in the country. ‚ÄúSlovenia has the opportunity to become a crypto-friendly country, but with the government‚Äôs proposals, we will miss the train again,‚Äù he said in a post also translated from Slovenian. ‚ÄúWith excessive taxation, we will once again see young people and capital fleeing abroad. Taxes should encourage, not stifle.‚Äù Source: Jernej Vrtovec The proposal is open to public consultation until May 5. If Slovenian lawmakers pass the bill, it will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2026. Slovenia introduced a 10% tax on crypto withdrawals and payments in 2023, but capital gains from occasional crypto trading are not taxed, according to the crypto tax platform Token Tax.

Business activity, such as mining or staking, is subject to income tax. A previous bill proposed in April 2022 planned to levy a 5% tax on profits over 10,000 euros ($11,372), but it was never passed into law. Slovenia issued the first digital sovereign bond in the European Union on July 25 last year . It had a nominal size of 30 million euros ($32.5 million) with a 3.65% coupon and a maturity date of Nov. 25 that year. The number of crypto users in Slovenia is projected to reach roughly 98,000 in 2025, according to online data platform Statista, with a penetration rate of 4.6% among its population of 2.12 million people. While the projected revenue for the country's crypto market is slated to hit $2.8 million.

One of Arizona‚Äôs crypto reserve bills has been passed by the House and is now one successful vote away from heading to the governor‚Äôs desk for official approval. Arizona's Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Bill (SB 1373) was approved on April 17 by the House Committee of the Whole, which involves 60 House members weighing in on the bill before a third and final reading and a full floor vote. Source: Bitcoin Laws SB 1373 seeks to establish a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund made up of digital assets seized through criminal proceedings to be managed by the state‚Äôs treasurer. Arizona‚Äôs treasurer would be permitted to invest up to 10% of the fund‚Äôs total monies in any fiscal year in digital assets. The treasurer would also be able to loan the fund‚Äôs assets in order to increase returns, provided it doesn‚Äôt increase financial risks. However, a Senate-approved SB 1373 may be set back by Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, who recently pledged to veto all bills until the legislature passes a bill for disability funding. Hobbs also has a history of vetoing bills before the House and has vetoed 15 bills sent to her desk this week alone. Bitcoin Laws founder and Apollo CEO Julian Fahrer told Cointelegraph that he expects SB 1373 will pass the House, though it may merge with another crypto-related bill, such as SB 1062, which aims to expand the definition of legal tender to include crypto. Arizona is the new leader in the state Bitcoin reserve race SB 1373 has been passing through Arizona‚Äôs legislature alongside the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB 1025), which only includes Bitcoin ( BTC ). The bill proposes allowing Arizona‚Äôs treasury and state retirement system to invest up to 10% of the available funds into Bitcoin. SB 1025 also passed Arizona‚Äôs House Committee of the Whole on April 1 and is awaiting a full floor vote.

However, it appears to have found minor support, though not strong enough, and there‚Äôs no assurance that it will hold. Doge‚Äôs outlook is still under the bears‚Äô radar on a mid-term scale, but they appear to have exhausted momentum and are now looking weak. The bulls intercepted their recent attempt to resume pressure, and the market is now calm at the time of writing. This slight bearish suspension manifested earlier this month after testing a new monthly low of $0.13. A bounce occurred, and the price recovered to $0.17. Marking a resistance there, the price fell to $0.15 yesterday and held above this price level as support. Whether this minor support level will hold or not is yet to be ascertained. Advancing bearish move, the primary meme coin may lose grip above the support level, and continues to show signs of weakness on the daily chart. While this could lead to another major breakdown, it may see big losses in the long term. A few top meme coins have mirrored Doge‚Äôs recent price movement. While some are posting gains in the past few days, many are yet to find a solid ground on the daily timeframe. Nevertheless, the overall market is still considered bearish. DOGE‚Äôs Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview If the bears pull below $0.15, we can expect an extension to $0.142, along with the monthly $0.128 low. A collapse from there should bring us to $0.115 and maybe the $0.1 level in the near term. Towards the upside, the $0.17 level has recently held as resistance. If the price rebounds through it to $0.18, we can anticipate a recovery to $0.2 and $0.24 in no time.

Approval of spot Litecoin ETFs appears likely, with analysts giving high odds; Canary Capital's ETF is in 'Pre Launch' status per the DTCC website. Litecoin's utility and active user growth contrast with Bitcoin's scaling stagnation, suggesting LTC is undervalued relative to BTC on PoW peers. LTCN trades at a discount to NAV, presenting a potential arbitrage opportunity if spot ETFs are approved, boosting LTCN's value. In the roughly three months since I last covered Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) and the Grayscale Litecoin Trust ( LTCN ) for Seeking Alpha, the performances of both the coin and the fund have been admittedly lack-luster. Data by YCharts When I wrote my last piece, LTCN was trading at a small premium relative to the prior year. As of mid-April, not only is that premium gone entirely but the fund has shifted back to a NAV rate discount for the first time since Q4-23. In this update, we'll look at the latest pertaining to spot Litecoin ETFs, Litecoin's continued usage story, and why I still like both LTC and LTCN given the broader setup in the digital asset market. Spot Litecoin ETF Developments While it isn't yet exactly clear when (or even if) spot ETFs will be approved by the SEC, the indications are that they will be coming at some point in the future. Consider that Canary Capital's Litecoin ETF is currently listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's website as a 'Pre Launch' ticker: LTCC Ticker in Pre Launch (DTCC) This doesn't actually mean that LTCC is guaranteed to become an approved ETF, but it is a positive sign as it shows the issuer is becoming more prepared for approval. ETF Analyst Expectations as of 2/10/25 (James Seyffart/X) Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart previously put LTC ETF approval odds at 90%. Furthermore, Seyffart said in early-February that he believes LTC will be the next ETF approved in the United States. In March, the SEC delayed a decision on the Canary fund and the next deadline is May 5th, which as of article submission, is less than three weeks away. Revisiting The Litecoin Thesis A view that I've steadfastly held in my coverage of cryptocurrencies through the years is the idea that the networks where these assets live have to actually offer the world real utility. Otherwise, speculation on price is likely the only real point of existence. That's not the future the cypherpunks who originally advocated for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) envisioned. But to a large degree, it's indeed the reality that we have today. That doesn't mean it has to remain the case going forward, and I've long suspected that through the bullish/bearish cycles that crypto speculators endure, the assets that will ultimately remain are the ones that offer the very utility I mentioned. There are many in the space who will argue that Bitcoin can do just about anything. BTC is viewed as 'Digital Gold' and any end user payments for smaller transactions can simply happen on secondary scaling layers. Thus, LTC need not exist. Yet lo and behold, after over 13 years in the market, Litecoin still commands a market capitalization of nearly $6 billion and a market cap rank of 21. For a coin that some feel is totally obsolete, this is impressive staying power, in my view. And my thinking here is the reason LTC still matters is precisely because scaling Bitcoin efforts have stagnated while Litecoin usage continues to grow. 30 Day Average DAAs (CoinMetrics) I've shared this chart in prior articles, but I'm sharing it again because I believe it helps illustrate two things; first, Litecoin's 30-day average DAA trend remains up since the beginning of 2021 while Bitcoin's is actually down. Second, when Bitcoin's transaction fees spiked in late-2023 and early-2024, crypto's user base shifted to Litecoin. I think another way to look at this though is through what I'll call the BTC/LTC DAA Multiple: 90 Day Average DAA Multiple (CoinMetrics) This logarithmic chart shows Bitcoin DAAs divided by Litecoin DAAs on a rolling 90-day average. This is essentially another way of showing Bitcoin losing active user share to Litecoin since 2017. Back then, the BTC/LTC DAA multiple was 60x. Today, it's just 2x, and it even spent some of 2024 under 2x. This isn't the only multiple that I think matters. You won't get any argument from me that Bitcoin settles far more in USD-denominated value each day. Over the last 30 days, Bitcoin has averaged about $9 billion in daily transferred value, while Litecoin's figure is closer to $86 million. To be sure, a massive difference. But adjusting for the differences in market capitalization, LTC is far cheaper than BTC: 30 Day Average NVT Ratio (CoinMetrics) This is the 30-day average NVT ratio; which divides the market capitalization of the coin by the USD-denominated transferred value on the network. I've added Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) and Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ) to show that LTC is indeed the outlier. At a 77 NVT ratio, Litecoin's valuation continues to trade at a massive discount to Proof-of-Work payment chain peers. DOGE, BCH, and BTC all command NVT ratios in excess of 200. So this is either a bad framework, or Litecoin is undervalued relative to the rest of the market. I continue to believe the issue lies with the valuations rather than the framework. Grayscale Litecoin Trust I'll point out again that my issue with LTCN as an investment in recent years hasn't been due to the underlying asset or its attractiveness as a digital currency. My problem with the fund over the last year and change has simply been one of valuation. At a significant multiple over the underlying value of the LTC, LTCN isn't worth the price tag. However, at a discount, I like it a lot more due to what, I think, is discounted exposure to a digital asset that is also significantly discounted relative to Proof-of-Work peers. Data by YCharts And that's exactly what we have from the market today. LTCN trades a small discount to NAV. And LTC trades a significant discount to the NVT ratios that are presently observed by natural peers BTC, BCH, and DOGE. All this said, a consideration that LTCN shareholders should remain mindful of is share unlocks through the end of the year: Grayscale LTC Holdings (CoinGlass) Grayscale held 1.48 million LTC through the trust back in February 2024. By the end of April, LTC holdings grew to 1.69 million. Though as of April 17th, most of the shares issued from that LTC growth are already unlocked. The next big unlock appears to be in mid-July, where LTC holdings grew by 5% overnight. LTC pricing likely matters here because between April 15th, 2024 and July 17th, 2024, Litecoin traded between $60-80 dollars per coin. Which means that some of these LTCN shares are likely already underwater. Will those shareholders take the loss and further depress the NAV rate? I won't attempt to guess. Closing Thoughts Litecoin is quietly still an important asset in the cryptocurrency market. It's one of just three coins that can be purchased through a Fidelity crypto IRA, and all indications from ETF analysts are that the spot LTC ETFs will be approved in the United States. When that happens, LTCN's days at a discount are presumably over. So coin price being equal, buying LTCN at a discount could be a nice little arbitrage trade between now and a potential ETF conversion. Fundamentally, LTC remains highly depressed relative to similar assets. If LTC traded at the same NVT ratio as BTC, the coin price would be closer to $225.",LTC-USD|LTCN,EN,0,0,BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|LTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-18 02:45:45

David Schwartz‚Äôs quote from 2020, resurfaced by Squire, captures what Ripple envisioned years ago: ‚ÄúMy dream scenario is SWIFT makes a deal with Ripple where all their banks get to use RippleNet for free, maybe even paying SWIFT.‚Äù At the time, this idea was largely speculative. Now, it appears that Ripple‚Äôs ambitions may align with real-world developments. David Schwartz, 2020: ""My dream scenario is SWIFT makes a deal with Ripple where all their banks get to use RippleNet for free, maybe even paying SWIFT! Fits our #XRP strategy perfectly!"" What sounded crazy in 2020‚Ä¶ might be unfolding right now. pic.twitter.com/5RVwITlfag ‚Äî John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) April 16, 2025 Rumors began circulating recently that SWIFT is testing XRP within its network of over 11,000 banks . If true, this would mark a major development in Ripple‚Äôs long-standing strategy and significantly boost XRP‚Äôs role in global finance. XRP‚Äôs Growing Relevance RippleNet, now known as Ripple Payments, is Ripple‚Äôs proprietary network, which was designed to streamline cross-border payments, reduce fees, and eliminate inefficiencies common in traditional financial systems. XRP plays a central role by providing liquidity and enabling rapid settlement with low costs. While Ripple has consistently positioned XRP as an asset capable of replacing outdated messaging systems like SWIFT, recent developments suggest that an outright replacement may not be necessary. Instead, a collaborative approach where SWIFT banks use XRP in tandem with their existing infrastructure could prove more viable. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This possibility fits Ripple‚Äôs broader strategy, particularly in its partnerships with financial institutions worldwide. If SWIFT allows access to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for its member banks, this would represent an unprecedented shift. Such integration would instantly expand XRP‚Äôs reach, potentially placing it at the core of a global settlement framework used by thousands of banks. Schwartz noted that this integration fits the strategy perfectly and could take it to new heights. From Competitors to Collaborators The landscape of global finance is evolving rapidly, and interoperability between traditional systems and blockchain-based solutions is becoming increasingly important. While SWIFT is the current international standard, it has numerous inefficiencies that XRP was built to address. Rumors that SWIFT is exploring XRP as part of a trial program with its vast network could indicate a major turning point. While no official confirmation has been provided, the implications are significant. Recent analysis shows that capturing just 1% of SWIFT‚Äôs daily volume could send XRP above $35 , and full integration could push the asset to unimaginable heights.

Dogecoin to $1 By Summer‚Äôs End? On the one‚Äëweek time‚Äëframe, analyst Chris (@StonkChris) plots an expanding rising channel that has been guiding price action since the October‚Äë2023 low at $0.056. That structure has produced a sequence of higher highs‚Äî~$0.229 in March‚ÄØ2024 and ~$0.484 in December 2024‚Äîand higher lows around $0.077 (February‚ÄØ2024) and $0.08 (early August 2024). The latest pull‚Äëback has just retested the channel‚Äôs lower rail at $0.13, where Chris notes that the weekly Stochastic‚ÄëRSI has begun to curl up from single‚Äëdigit territory and the Ichimoku cloud is turning supportive above $0.22. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To Enter Phase E After Testing Last Point Of Support, Here‚Äôs The Target From that confluence he sketches a steep, almost parabolic trajectory that slashes through the cloud resistance in May, re‚Äëtests the mid‚Äëcloud span near $0.30 and accelerates toward the upper boundary of the channel‚Äîan area that will sit close to $1.00‚Äì$1.10 by late‚Äësummer 2025. ‚ÄúDOGE to $1 by the end of the summer‚ÄØ2025 anyone?‚Äù he asked followers on X, leaving little doubt about his conviction that the secular up‚Äëtrend remains intact. A Higher High Is Needed The short‚Äëterm picture is less binary in the eyes of Olivier (@Dark64), who analyses Dogecoin on the daily chart. His canvas is dominated by two features: a descending regression channel (labelled ‚ÄúBLSR‚Äù) that has trapped price since the November peak at $0.484, and a large rounded accumulation base projected to end between 5‚ÄØMay‚ÄØ2025 and 29‚ÄØJune‚ÄØ2025. Key horizontal levels flank the pattern. Immediate support sits at $0.1533, the level price is presently hugging. Should that shelf give way, Dogecoin could revisit the lower line of the channel below $0.13. To the upside, Olivier marked $0.2175 the most crucial resistance where DOGE could break out of the descending channel and mark the first higher high in months. Related Reading: Dogecoin Follows The Blueprint: Analyst Highlights Perfect Technical Execution Meanwhile, the area around $0.229 could be a last line of defense for bears as this is the local high from March 2024. A break above this level would expose $0.3496‚Äîa key support in December last year until January this year. Ultimately, the December high at $0.4361, with the year‚Äëto‚Äëdate high at $0.484 completing the measured‚Äëmove objective. Olivier‚Äôs trading logic is brutally simple. ‚ÄúThe up‚Äëtrend won‚Äôt resume until it prints a new higher low,‚Äù he wrote, adding in reply to a sceptic who wondered whether DOGE might first undercut $0.12: ‚ÄúIf it breaks the last low, it will go lower. If it prints a new higher low and a new higher high, then I‚Äôll be confident a new up‚Äëtrend is on.‚Äù His road‚Äëmap therefore allows for one more flush‚Äîpotentially into the $0.13‚Äì$0.11 pocket. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.154.

On April 17, Galaxy introduced a Solana proposal called ‚ÄúMultiple Election Stake-Weight Aggregation‚Äù (MESA) to reduce the inflation rate of its native token, SOL ( SOL ). The researchers described the proposal as a ‚Äúmore market-based approach to agreeing on the rate of future SOL emissions.‚Äù Rather than using traditional yes/no voting for inflation rates, MESA allows validators to vote on multiple deflation rates and uses the weighted average as the outcome. ‚ÄúInstead of cycling through inflation reduction proposals until one passes, what if validators could allocate their votes to one or many changes, with the aggregate of ‚Äòyes‚Äô outcomes becoming the adopted emissions curve?‚Äù Galaxy explained. The motivation for the concept comes from a previous proposal (SIMD-228), which showed community agreement that SOL inflation should be reduced, but the binary voting system couldn‚Äôt find consensus on specific parameters. SIMD-228 proposed to change Solana‚Äôs inflation system from a fixed schedule to a dynamic, market-based model. The new proposal suggests maintaining the fixed, terminal inflation rate at 1.5% and sets forth multiple outcomes that create multiple ‚Äòyes‚Äô voting options with different deflation rates from which an average is aggregated if a quorum is reached. For example, if 5% vote for no change, remaining at 15% deflation, 50% vote for a 30% deflation rate, and 45% vote for 33%, the new deflation rate would be calculated as the aggregate at 30.6%. The target is to reach the terminal rate of 1.5% supply inflation. Predicted inflation curves under new voting proposal. Source: Galaxy Digital Solving problems with binary voting The benefits are that a more market-driven system allows validators to express preferences along a spectrum rather than with binary choices, while maintaining predictability with a fixed inflation curve. ‚ÄúGalaxy Research seeks to suggest a genuinely alternative process to achieving what we believe is the community‚Äôs broad goal, and not necessarily proscribe any particular inflation rate outcome,‚Äù the firm explained. Related: Solana upgrades will strengthen network but squeeze validators ‚Äî VanEck Under the current mechanism, supply inflation begins at 8% annually, decreasing by 15% per year until it reaches 1.5%. Solana‚Äôs current inflation rate is 4.6%, and 64.7% of the total supply, or 387 million SOL, is currently staked, according to Solana Compass.

ETH is now consolidating and might attempt to recover above the $1,620 resistance. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $1,620 and $1,600 levels. The price is trading below $1,620 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $1,590 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $1,615 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Faces Hurdles Ethereum price struggled to continue higher above $1,690 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $1,600 and $1,580 support levels. It even spiked below $1,550. A low was formed at $1,538 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $1,580 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,690 swing high to the $1,538 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $1,590 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $1,620 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,600 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,615 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,690 swing high to the $1,538 low. The first major resistance is near the $1,655 level. A clear move above the $1,655 resistance might send the price toward the $1,700 resistance. An upside break above the $1,700 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $1,750 resistance zone or even $1,800 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,615 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,5750 level. The first major support sits near the $1,540 zone. A clear move below the $1,540 support might push the price toward the $1,480 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,420 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,400.

Amid heightened global uncertainty, which is fueled by escalating US-China trade tensions, Bitcoin has experienced a sharp correction, though recent signs point to stabilization. Interestingly, the Coinbase Premium, a metric that reflects the price difference of Bitcoin on Coinbase versus global exchanges, is showing signs of recovery. After tightening through a series of lower highs and higher lows since March 2024, the premium has recently begun to trend upward, which suggests a renewed buying interest from US-based institutional and retail investors. This activity coincides with Bitcoin‚Äôs modest rebound and signals that Coinbase traders may be positioning ahead of broader market shifts. On the other hand, the Korea Premium Index paints a more cautious picture. The metric, which typically signals increased activity among South Korean retail investors, has remained in a downtrend throughout the correction and only saw a delayed uptick after Bitcoin had already rallied. This lag indicates waning enthusiasm from Korean investors compared to previous cycles, where they were often early and aggressive participants. The contrasting behavior highlighted a shift in market influence, with Western platforms like Coinbase now leading price discovery. As such, CryptoQuant stated that while the Korea Premium may serve as a lagging indicator in this cycle, the Coinbase Premium could offer forward-looking insights into demand trends. Despite ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, the strengthening Coinbase Premium hints at growing confidence and a potential medium- to long-term recovery in Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory.

The state‚Äôs Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Bill (SB 1373) passed the House Committee of the Whole on April 17 and now awaits one final vote before heading to Governor Katie Hobbs for approval. The crypto reserve bill proposes the creation of a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund, which would consist of digital assets seized during criminal proceedings. Arizona Treasurer May Gain Power to Invest 10% of State Crypto Fund Annually The fund would be managed by Arizona‚Äôs state treasurer, who would be authorized to invest up to 10% of its total balance in digital assets each fiscal year. Additionally, the treasurer could lend out fund assets to generate returns, provided this does not elevate financial risk. Despite clearing the House committee stage, the bill‚Äôs path forward remains uncertain. Governor Hobbs has vowed to veto all legislation until lawmakers address funding for disability services. She has already rejected 15 bills this week and has previously exercised veto power on several House-approved proposals. SB 1373 is advancing in parallel with another digital asset-focused proposal, the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB 1025). This bill would allow Arizona‚Äôs treasury and state retirement fund to invest up to 10% of available assets specifically in Bitcoin. It passed the House Committee of the Whole on April 1 and is also awaiting a final vote. ARIZONA Update: Bitcoin Reserve Bill SB 1373 has been passed by the House Committee of the Whole (with a minor amendment). The next step is Third Reading and final floor vote. pic.twitter.com/oOahjbZATR ‚Äî Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) April 17, 2025 Arizona now finds itself at the forefront of the growing state-level crypto reserve movement. While Utah passed Bitcoin-related legislation in early March , it removed the Bitcoin reserve provision during final approval. Texas and New Hampshire, however, have seen similar bills advance through their legislatures, with the Texas Senate approving its Bitcoin reserve bill on March 6. Just recently, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear officially signed House Bill 701 , known as the ‚ÄúBitcoin Rights‚Äù bill, into law‚Äîmaking the state one of the latest to enact legislation protecting digital asset users and operations. Missouri is also in the mix , with its Special Committee on Intergovernmental Affairs reviewing its own Bitcoin reserve proposal. Public Companies Boost Bitcoin Holdings by 16% in Q1 2025 Publicly traded companies increased their Bitcoin holdings by 16.1% in the first quarter of 2025, signaling continued institutional interest in the leading cryptocurrency despite market volatility. According to crypto asset manager Bitwise, total corporate Bitcoin holdings climbed to approximately 688,000 BTC by the end of Q1, with companies adding 95,431 BTC over the three-month period. Bitwise reported the combined value of these holdings reached $56.7 billion, based on a Q1 closing price of $82,445 per Bitcoin‚Äîrepresenting a 2.2% increase in value. The number of public companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheets also rose, from 67 to 79, with 12 firms making their first Bitcoin purchases during the quarter.

According to the Q1 Crypto Industry Report recently released by CoinGecko, the broader market experienced a major downturn. However, Bitcoin and Solana still had strong showings relative to the general market. The crypto market entered 2025 on a high note, building on momentum from late 2024. Bitcoin rose to an all-time high of $106,182 in January, contributing immensely to the rise of the total crypto market capitalization, which hit a $3.8 trillion on January 18. However, by the end of Q1, the total market cap had fallen by 18.6%, losing nearly $1 trillion and closing at $2.8 trillion. Crypto market cap and trading volume declined in Q1 2025. Source: Coingecko By the end of the quarter, Bitcoin‚Äôs price had fallen by 11.8%, ending at $82,514. Still, it performed better than most altcoins, further solidifying its dominance, which rose to 59.1% of the total crypto market cap. Solana rides the memecoin wave for growth DEX trading volume has suffered a steady decline since January. Source: Coingecko Solana saw a brief surge in decentralized exchange (DEX) activity in early Q1, accounting for 52% of on-chain spot DEX trades in January, fueled by the TRUMP memecoin frenzy. However, that momentum was reduced by March, as interest in meme coins dropped significantly. Solana‚Äôs DEX trade share fell to 23.4%, while Ethereum reclaimed the lead with 30.1%. Despite the resurgence, Ethereum‚Äôs overall performance was underwhelming. After hitting a high of $3,336, Ethereum ended Q1 at $1,805. Its market dominance fell to 7.9%, which is reportedly the lowest it has dropped since 2019. The memecoin trend saw unprecedented results at the start of the first quarter with the launch of the TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins before Trump‚Äôs inauguration. It pushed the launching of tokens on Pump.fun to a record 72,000 per day. However, its decline was expedited by the LIBRA token incident, which was promoted by Argentina‚Äôs president, Javier Milei, and collapsed following a rug pull. The incident caused LIBRA‚Äôs market cap to crash from $4.6 billion to $221 million within hours. As a result, Pump.fun‚Äôs activity declined sharply, with the launch of tokens falling over 56% on the platform. Stablecoins gain ground as centralized and DeFi crypto markets took hits More investors favored stability as stablecoins such as USDT and USDC due to market volatility. USDT‚Äôs market share increased to 5.2%, while USDC moved up to reclaim the seventh position in terms of market cap, displacing Dogecoin. Amid all the decline and changing of market share positions, XRP and BNB maintained their positions and market share. Binance maintains its lead in terms of CEX trading volume. Source: Coingecko According to the report, the top 10 centralized exchanges (CEXs) saw a 16.3% quarter-on-quarter drop in spot trading volume, totaling $5.4 trillion. Binance maintained its position as market leader with a 40.7% share, although its volume fell to $588.7 billion in March from over $1 trillion in December. HTX was the only exchange in the top 10 to record growth. Upbit saw a steep 34% drop. Bybit was hit the hardest, plunging 52.4% month-on-month following a major February hack. On the decentralized finance (DeFi) side, multichain DeFi total value locked (TVL) fell by 27.5% in Q1 2025, dropping from $177.4 billion to $128.6 billion, largely driven by altcoin price declines.

In accordance with its governance protocol, HTX DAO allocated 50% of revenue generated by the HTX exchange in Q1 2025 toward this burn. Executions were carried out transparently via Sun.io, with complete on-chain verification available through transaction hashes. Community members can review the full burn transaction here: Burn Hash on Tronscan Burn Mechanism: Not a Gimmick, but a Governance-Backed Commitment Unlike short-term, price-focused burns used by many projects as speculative marketing tactics, HTX DAO‚Äôs burn strategy is rooted in its ‚ÄúVerified Revenue ‚Äì Automatic Buyback ‚Äì On-chain Burn‚Äù model, introduced in late 2023. This system ensures consistent and verifiable token reductions aligned with real revenue, not artificially inflated figures. Key elements of the HTX DAO burn mechanism include: Revenue-Linked Buybacks: A fixed percentage of exchange income is used to repurchase and burn $HTX; Full Transparency: All burn addresses and transactions are recorded and publicly accessible on-chain; Scheduled Execution: Quarterly announcements and hash verifications published for community audit; Governance Supervision: DAO governance oversees adjustments to burn ratios and policies. This model makes HTX DAO‚Äôs deflationary action a structural economic feature, rather than a temporary performance signal‚Äîpositioning $HTX for long-term compounding value growth. Market Volatility Validates Mechanism Robustness In Q1 2025, despite Bitcoin falling from nearly $110,000 to $70,000‚Äîa drop of over 30%‚Äîand global crypto trading volumes dropping 27% from $200.7B to $146B (source: Coingecko ), HTX DAO‚Äôs token burn decreased by only 15% compared to Q4 2024 ($22M to $19.2M). This measured reduction highlights two important truths: Burn funding is derived from actual revenue, not reserves or pre-allocated marketing budgets; Burn volumes follow a systematic, non-manipulative model, unaffected by short-term market panic. Rather than artificial inflation of value, HTX DAO reflects a rational, data-driven growth model, balancing deflation and ecosystem expansion with real income performance. Scarcity Effect: Circulating Supply Falls, Value Logic Strengthens The cumulative impact of HTX DAO‚Äôs deflationary system is becoming more pronounced: Over 60.97 trillion $HTX burned, reducing overall token supply; Increased scarcity for long-term holders; Sustainable tokenomics, with low inflation and high burn rates‚Äîmaking $HTX one of the few net-deflationary exchange ecosystem tokens on the market. Following the footsteps of proven models like Ethereum‚Äôs EIP-1559 and BNB‚Äôs quarterly burns, HTX DAO is establishing a durable path toward value consolidation. Its staking, governance, and node programs are all structurally tied to the burn cycle‚Äîcreating a positive feedback loop where ecosystem growth triggers further deflation, and vice versa. Leading by Example: Real DAO Execution in a Sea of Paper DAOs While many projects claim to be DAOs in name, few consistently execute governance-backed decisions with on-chain transparency. HTX DAO sets itself apart by delivering measurable, auditable outcomes‚Äîburns, votes, and revenue allocation‚Äîvisible to all stakeholders. In contrast with projects known for inconsistent execution or vague treasury use, HTX DAO demonstrates: High operational reliability Transparent financial data Clear deflationary logic This makes HTX DAO a standout among modern DAO ecosystems‚Äînot merely in philosophy, but in real-world delivery. More Than a Buzzword: DAO as a Mechanism for Value Fulfillment This Q1 burn underscores HTX DAO‚Äôs continued adherence to its roadmap. Despite macro challenges, it has executed a $19M burn, retained full on-chain traceability, and continued reducing its circulating supply. These attributes collectively validate the DAO‚Äôs ability to deliver on promises‚Äînot just through whitepapers, but through chain-verified results. With renewed user growth, ecosystem expansion, and market recovery expected later in 2025, future burn events are poised to become milestones in HTX DAO‚Äôs deflationary growth story. For a sector still grappling with the legitimacy of decentralized governance, HTX DAO offers a compelling answer to the question: Can DAOs truly deliver value? HTX DAO‚Äôs response is already written‚Äîon-chain. About HTX DAO As a multi-chain deployed decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), HTX DAO demonstrates an innovative governance approach. Unlike traditional corporate structures, it adopts a decentralized governance structure composed of a diversified group, jointly committed to the success of this organization. This unique ecosystem advocates openness and encourages all DAO participants to propose ideas that can promote the development of HTX DAO.

In the past, internet infrastructure challenges and low financial literacy among the war-torn population contributed to relatively limited crypto adoption, according to an April 17 report from blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs. ‚ÄúHowever, there are signs of growing interest and usage driven primarily by necessity rather than speculation,‚Äù the blockchain intelligence firm said. ‚ÄúFor those who use cryptocurrencies in Yemen, the ability to bypass the disruption in local financial services offers a modicum of financial resilience, especially as banks can be difficult to access or are simply inoperable due to the ongoing conflict.‚Äù Yemen has been in a civil war between the government and the Houthi group since September 2014. The US has also frequently sanctioned financial infrastructure in the country to disrupt Houthi activity, with the most recent action on April 17 hitting the International Bank of Yemen. DeFi platforms account for most of Yemen‚Äôs crypto-related web traffic, taking up over 63% of observed activity, while global centralized exchanges account for 18% of crypto-related web traffic, TRM Labs data shows. DeFi platforms account for most of Yemen‚Äôs crypto-related web traffic, followed by centralized exchanges. Source: TRM Labs Some local Yemenis also use peer-to-peer crypto transactions to move funds across borders or conduct remittances. ‚ÄúAlthough these interactions do not necessarily imply high transaction volumes, they reinforce that for some individuals in Yemen, decentralized infrastructure may provide a necessary alternative to traditional payment rails,‚Äù TRM Labs said. ‚ÄúThe interest in DeFi services may reflect the appeal of systems that allow users to transact without intermediaries, particularly where local banking institutions are inaccessible or unreliable.‚Äù Increasing sanctions could spark higher crypto adoption in Yemen Currently, Yemen doesn‚Äôt have legislation in place for the use of crypto; TRM Labs speculates that increasing sanctions against the Houthis could be the spark that ignites higher crypto adoption in Yemen. Following the Biden administration‚Äôs relisting of the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in January 2024, a Yemen-based cryptocurrency exchange tracked by TRM experienced a 270% increase in overall volume, the blockchain intelligence firm said. Related: US DOJ says it seized Hamas crypto meant to finance terrorism It eventually returned to pre-spike levels, but it saw another uptick again, this time by 223%, in the three months following the election of US President Donald Trump and the reinstating of the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization by the US on Jan. 22. ‚ÄúGiven the intensifying international sanctions on the Houthis and their primary backer, Iran, the group‚Äôs use of cryptocurrency is likely to grow in both scale and sophistication,‚Äù TRM Labs said. ‚ÄúAs traditional financial avenues become increasingly restricted, decentralized digital currencies offer an alternative that is less susceptible to oversight and harder to trace.‚Äù Magazine: Terrorism and the Israel-Gaza war have been weaponized to destroy crypto",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-18 04:50:16
43474087,https://nulltx.com/?p=148079,1744951863,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"$DARK Joins Binance Alpha Spotlight, Surges 50% Amid Growing Whale Interest",https://nulltx.com/dark-joins-binance-alpha-spotlight-surges-50-amid-growing-whale-interest/,"In an important turn of events for the cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence sectors, the Solana-based AI project $DARK ( @darkresearchai ) has been chosen as the 40th project to be shown off on Binance Alpha Spotlight. This has created quite a stir in the market. In the last 24 hours, the project has seen a 50 percent increase in its value, exploding its market capitalization to over $30 million. $DARK is not just any old AI project ‚Äî it is a cutting-edge initiative focused on creating algorithms that live in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This has huge implications for decentralized systems and could very well redefine scalability in those systems. What is $DARK and How Does It Work? DARK is an innovative AI project that uses the Solana blockchain. Built onto an experimental network of what are called Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), it allows for computing that is secure and exposes no sensitive data. The way TEEs work is hugely important for the kinds of platforms DARK wants to create. Those are called Multi-Computational Platforms (MCPs), and the term roughly denotes another way of saying the project will allow for massively parallelized computing at a scale and efficiency that just isn‚Äôt achieved with current decentralized systems. In other words, if you‚Äôre trying to do something like train a neural network, DARK promises it will allow you to do so more effectively than any programming you might try on a current platform. Binance Alpha launches DARK. DARK is an experimental network for trusted execution environments. ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 17, 2025 Crucial for guaranteeing the privacy and security of data, TEEs are the bedrock technology on which the $DARK project is built. The aim of $DARK is to create a decentralized, AI-driven network that can perform massive computations with the same security and privacy guarantees that TEEs provide. This very quality‚Äîunmatched scalability and security‚Äîmakes $DARK an attractive solution for decentralized applications that rely on AI and need to process large amounts of sensitive data. And that‚Äôs what makes me excited about $DARK. $DARK is putting itself in a position to be a major player at the rapidly evolving intersection of AI and blockchain technology, using the almost instantaneous, very low-cost Solana blockchain as its infrastructure. The project‚Äôs overall aim is‚Äîto put it in a nice, neat package‚Äîto develop a decentralized AI network that can and will scale infinitely, providing powerful, private AI solutions that, as one wouldn‚Äôt necessarily expect from an AI project, are also privacy-preserving. Binance Alpha Spotlight Boosts $DARK‚Äôs Visibility Having its $DARK included in the Binance Alpha Spotlight has had an immediate impact on the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price and market valuation. Binance Alpha is a platform casting light on those (often nascent) projects it deems innovative and of promise. Being mentioned in the same breath as this behemoth crypto exchange and its associated trading platform gives $DARK an audience with one of the largest and most active crypto communities in the world. After the announcement, the price of $DARK skyrocketed by more than 50% in a mere 24 hours, vaulting its market cap to over $30 million. This jump sharpens our focus on the ability of smart exchanges to take relatively obscure projects and shine a light on them, giving those projects a real shot at prominence. When a token gets on the radar of Binance, for instance, the whole crypto space looks up and takes notice. Whale Interest and Growing Market Confidence One of the key drivers behind the recent surge in $DARK‚Äôs price is the growing interest from whales, particularly those active in the Solana ecosystem. According to market data from GMGN, the largest holder of $DARK, identified as EEx9rj‚Ä¶NNLzXd, currently holds 2.45% of the total supply, with profits exceeding $700,000. This significant stake in $DARK underscores the confidence that major investors have in the project‚Äôs future. One of the biggest whales in Solana has been steadily DCAing into $DARK, almost undetected. This whale divvied out a sum of $117.81K worth of $Fartcoin‚Äîa Solana-based token‚Äîto obtain more $DARK, which is often renamed as Dark Energy. And as you can notice, this is not a very common sight given that whales tend to operate without such clear signs of intent. But why would this whale pay such a premium, and what could it mean for $DARK? How do we even break this to you guys‚Ä¶ One of the top whales on Solana is quietly DCA‚Äôing into $DARK They deposited $117.81K worth of #fartcoin to stack $DARK . pic.twitter.com/Pl0K5IqQSD ‚Äî Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 17, 2025 The whale‚Äôs choice to pile up $DARK not only adds weight to the ongoing debate around the crypto‚Äôs value, but also sends a clear message to the AI and blockchain world: the whaler sees value in $DARK. Even more encouraging? The whaler thinks it way better to have $DARK than not to have it. And in crypto, that‚Äôs a vote of confidence for a project. Looking Ahead: $DARK‚Äôs Future Prospects With $DARK now securely in the limelight, it‚Äôs primed for perpetual expansion. The onslaught in price and mounting looks from both whales and institutional investors are just a prologue. As this project pushes forward and its AI-powered network really gets rolling, $DARK might well be on its way to becoming a leading player in the decentralized A.I. ecosystem. The platform‚Äôs ongoing development holds the key to $DARK‚Äôs future success. This includes making the current TEEs not just functional but also scalable (something that has already proven a challenge for major cloud providers). It also involves integrating other advanced AI technologies, of which there are many, with the potential for enormous impact. Yet such development work is not enough in and of itself. Beyond the actual tech, the question of how many partnerships get forged, and with whom, looms large. $DARK will thrive if and only if many partners, particularly in the blockchain space, adopt its tech. Currently, being highlighted in the Binance Alpha Spotlight is a major leap for $DARK, thrusting it into the very heart of not just crypto, but the altcoin mainstream‚Äîas evidenced by the Bitcoin pullback last September. Binance is indeed the largest exchange in the world by trading volume, and those millions of eyes seeing $DARK are sure to get attention. $DARK becomes one of the standout tokens in the Solana ecosystem, at least by public perception‚Äîwhether it can maintain its newfound relevance and deliver on its promises.

After imposing a 10% tax on crypto withdrawals in 2023, the country‚Äôs Finance Ministry has now suggested a new law to add a 25% tax on crypto trading gains. If the bill gets passed, the law will begin on January 1, 2026. Some experts warn that high taxes might scare off investors, which could slow down crypto growth in Slovenia. Who Will Be Taxed & How? Under the new law , Slovenian residents will be taxed 25% on net gains from crypto when: They sell cryptocurrency in exchange for fiat currency (e.g., euros or dollars) They use crypto to pay for goods or services They send crypto to another person‚Äôs wallet (excluding transfers between personal wallets), whether as a gift or payment This shift marks a significant expansion in how Slovenia treats crypto transactions for tax purposes. Who‚Äôs Exempt from This Tax? Not all crypto activity will be taxed. The proposed law clearly outlines exceptions: Crypto-to-crypto exchanges (e.g., Bitcoin to Ethereum) are not subject to tax. Transfers between your own wallets remain tax-free. Holding crypto without selling or spending does not trigger taxation. In addition, individuals will be required to report annual crypto earnings and maintain accurate transaction records , a step toward greater transparency. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Regulations in Slovenia 2025 , Lawmaker Warns of Negative Impact However, not everyone agrees with the new plan. Jernej Vrtovec, a member of the opposition New Slovenia party, criticized the proposal . He said that heavy taxation could harm Slovenia‚Äôs growing crypto sector and drive young talent and investors out of the country. He believes the government should encourage innovation, not push it away with high taxes. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Klemen Bo≈°tjanƒçiƒç said the goal of the tax isn‚Äôt just to collect more money but to bring fairness to the system. He pointed out that crypto is one of the most speculative financial assets and believes it‚Äôs only fair to apply tax rules similar to those for other investments. How Big Is the Crypto Market in Slovenia? With an estimated 98,000 crypto users expected in 2025 and a growing market projected to bring in $2.8 million in revenue, Slovenia‚Äôs crypto scene is still developing. The government believes this new tax could generate between ‚Ç¨2.5 million to ‚Ç¨25 million a year, depending on how active the market becomes. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a direct response to Pump.fun, Raydium has delivered a platform that has elevated functionality, flexibility, and full control for developers looking to launch their tokens on the Solana blockchain. A suite of features designed to perfect the launch process constitutes a substantial move from Raydium to take the lead on the Solana network and redefine how decentralized tokens are created and launched. Introducing LaunchLab, Raydium's all-in-one token launchpad. Built for Creators, Developers, and the Community https://t.co/yZVzShVZSJ More info pic.twitter.com/r6s1DAegWf ‚Äî Raydium (@RaydiumProtocol) April 16, 2025 The step is taken not long after the Raydium team had a parting of ways with Pump.fun, which has since caused a bit of an uproar in the Solana community. LaunchLab is being opened as a strategic countermeasure, an answer to the development of something like, well, Pump.fun. What is LaunchLab? LaunchLab is an all-in-one token launchpad that gives developers total autonomy and control over their token launches. The platform provides a smooth and efficient way to create a token, manage its supply, and control things like bonding curves and vesting schedules. LaunchLab comes packed with several other features that make the token launch process even more efficient and accessible, positioning it as the platform developers turn to when they need a comprehensive solution. A key thing about LaunchLab is that it lets you create tokens on the fly. If you ever need to whip up a token and distribute it to the public really fast, that‚Äôs your option! LaunchLab will even take care of some of the initial liquidity for you, so there‚Äôs no way the token you‚Äôre launching can avoid getting traded unless people just don‚Äôt want to trade it. And did I mention that you can do all of this without paying a migration fee, since that‚Äôs a thing that some token creators really appreciate? Enhanced Features for Developers LaunchLab goes beyond basic token creation and provides a variety of advanced features that are designed to support the long-term growth and sustainability of tokens launched on the platform. These features include the following: ‚Äì Vesting schedules ‚Äì LP (Liquidity Pool) locks ‚Äì Fee-sharing models ‚Äì A referral program that can incentivize wider community engagement. Developers now possess the capacity to craft bonding curves exactly to their liking. This allows for the establishment of evolved token price points during the launch process, which gives developers a chance to flex when and where they want the token‚Äôs price to go up or down. This price might be conditioned on how much you; or, say, the community, wants it to go up or down, which is, after all, how markets work. Evolved price points and flexing aside, another upshot of bonding curves is that they can function as templates for different sorts of basic tokenomics. They tell you what sorts of things have to happen (or not happen) if the price of a token is reliably going to evolve in a certain way. The LP locks feature on the platform allows for liquidity to be secured, which is absolutely fundamental for ensuring the emergent stability of new tokens and their successful launch. LaunchLab comes pre-installed with a model for generating fees. Raydium‚Äôs $RAY Token Surges Along with the launch of LaunchLab, Raydium‚Äôs native token, $RAY, has experienced a very pronounced upward movement, increasing in value by almost 9% in the past 24 hours. This increase in price above the $RAY formerly occupied (a price point established before the much-ballyhooed split from Pump.fun) is a good signal that the community is reacting positively to Raydium‚Äôs new initiative. The recovery of $RAY‚Äôs value comes as a result of the launch of LaunchLab, which has captured the attention of developers and investors alike. As more tokens are created and launched on the platform, the demand for $RAY is expected to increase, further contributing to its price appreciation. @RaydiumProtocol just clapped back at @pumpdotfun with the launch of a more advanced token launchpad, LaunchLab. This new platform gives full control over supply, bonding curves, and vesting. It even allows devs to build their own apps. $RAY token is up almost 9% in 24h,‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/Qvpq87Gnyh ‚Äî Sad Creator (@SadCreatorTalks) April 17, 2025 The Road Ahead for Raydium and LaunchLab By launching LaunchLab, Raydium now finds itself in the emergence of the leader of the Solana ecosystem. Raydium spat out the LaunchLab, now getting the developers the token and maintaining key control around that token. Laudably, LaunchLab is not a one-off; future features are to be expected as part of the natural evolution of its platform. But for now, what is LaunchLab? The advanced features of the launchpad combined with Raydium‚Äôs presence in the Solana ecosystem make it an appealing choice for developers looking to launch their tokens on a secure, efficient platform with much community engagement. As more projects come to LaunchLab, we could see growth in Raydium‚Äôs $RAY token, and we could see the launchpad becoming a key part of the DeFi ecosystem on Solana. The launchpad competition is getting strong, but Raydium‚Äôs LaunchLab is a sturdy foundation, positioning the platform for what we think is long-term success in the still-developing world of decentralized finance and blockchain technology.

The proposed legislation ‚Äôs main purpose is to ensure greater fairness in the taxation of investment income among Slovenian citizens. The draft legislation changes things As things stand, individuals trading crypto benefit from a tax advantage while traditional investments are greatly exposed, a phenomenon the government now seeks to balance. Under the draft legislation , profits realized from converting crypto into fiat currency, such as euros, or using crypto to pay for goods and services would be taxed. However, the exchange of one crypto asset for another would remain tax-free. The new laws would require taxpayers to maintain detailed transaction records and file annual tax returns by March 31 for the previous year. Meanwhile, merchants accepting over ‚Ç¨500 in crypto must report these transactions. Central bank digital currencies, electronic money, security tokens, and NFTs are excluded from the new tax framework. The law follows definitions introduced under the EU‚Äôs MiCA regulation and OECD‚Äôs CARF framework. To make the transition easier on all participants, all crypto assets held before 2026 will be ‚Äúreset‚Äù and acquisition cost would be set at fair market value on January 1, 2026. Aside from aligning Slovenia‚Äôs tax treatment of crypto with traditional investments, the measure is considered necessary given the growing role of crypto assets and the push for global transparency standards. There is also all the revenue the new tax has the potential of generating. In fact, according to the finance ministry, the new tax could bring in between ‚Ç¨2.5 million and ‚Ç¨25 million in annual revenue. The Slovenian Finance Ministry has asked for public feedback on the proposed tax regime, which is expected to take effect January 1, 2026, pending parliamentary approval with public comments on the proposal due by May 5. Is Slovenia still a crypto tax haven? In the past, many investors considered Slovenia a choice destination because of its tax regime, which stated that for cryptocurrencies traded outside of a permanent business activity, the capital gains from their trade will not be subject to any capital gains tax. Even before the proposal of the 25% tax on crypto profits, there were complaints about the ambiguity of the laws. After all, in Slovenia, there are no clear guidelines as to the meaning of a ‚Äúpermanent business activity‚Äù. This means the Financial Administration of the Republic of Slovenia (FURS) has a sole discretion in determining whether or not a trader is engaged in a permanent trading business activity. The lack of legal certainty was of course not enough to dissuade some investors from taking advantage of what Slovenia‚Äôs tax regime offered. However, even that advantage is about to be stripped away. The current proposal will now make crypto traded by personal investors subject to a 25% tax, which means the government takes a huge chunk out of traders‚Äô money either way, leading to serious deliberations about Slovenia‚Äôs status as a crypto tax haven.

43474247,https://nulltx.com/?p=148081,1744952171,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Smart Money Moves: On-Chain Activity Reveals Shifting Dynamics in the Memecoin Market,https://nulltx.com/smart-money-moves-on-chain-activity-reveals-shifting-dynamics-in-the-memecoin-market/,"The memecoin market showed a clear trend of net inflows, which reveals investor confidence or interest in several of the tokens we would call memecoins. In our last report, we signaled the potential emergence of a couple of these rising tokens as new plays to keep an eye on, even as the market remains volatile. Capital flows seem to be shifting towards these newer plays and away from supposedly more established first-generation memecoins. The market overall experienced an influx of $5.29 million, which exceeded the outflows that totaled $4.37 million. This produced a net positive amount of $928,000. While this net figure has not knocked anyone off their feet, it certainly signifies something: the savvy traders and institutional wallets that track the movement of memecoins are doing so with bullish eyes. FARTCOIN Dominates Inflows While JLP Sees Major Exit Attracting the most inflows was the humorously named but surprisingly dominant memecoin, FARTCOIN, which pulled in a staggering $3.18 million in new capital. Riding a wave of social media buzz and meme-driven hype, the token now finds itself in the spotlight as smart money seems to be betting on its continued virality and liquidity growth. Other memecoins that captured interest included POPCAT, which saw a healthy $322,000 coming in. Its memetic roots and loyal community base seem to be gaining traction once again. PNUT, another playful prescaler of the memecoin scene, followed close behind with $189,000 in new investment, suggesting that some opportunistic holders might be accumulating it in anticipation of future gains. Meanwhile, BONK and WEN must have been attracting some smart money, because they collectively saw $176,000 in new investment over the same period. That suggests there might be some slow, steady buying interest in the prescaler‚Äôs Prescale Toolbox. Conversely, a number of prominent tokens recorded sizable capital exits, which may suggest that profit-takers are at work or investors are reallocating funds to fresh opportunities. WIF, a previously popular token, saw $520,000 head for the exits, which may signal either a fading interest from short-term traders or an expiration of WIF‚Äôs recent transitory uptrend. Recap: Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 16/04/25 Yesterday, there was more inflow than outflow Inflow: $5.29M Outflow: $4.37M Volume: $9.66M Net Volume: $928K There was inflow into: $WEN ($84K) $POPCAT ($322K) $PNUT ($189K) #FARTCOIN ($3.18M) $BONK ‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/1URWhXBbe1 ‚Äî Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) April 17, 2025 The largest outflow came from JLP, which saw an immense $2.01 million capital leave its ecosystem. This could indicate that large holders are reallocating their funds to trendier plays, or it could just be that they are realizing some gains. JUP had the next largest outflow at $123K, followed by ALCH at $101K and RFC at $161K. It appears that each of these was reacting to some recent price action. Market Sentiment and Rotation Strategy The signal volume figure of $928,000 carries cautious optimism for the market. Although the total volume traded was $9.66 million, only a small part of that resulted in net positive inflow. All of that shows that buying interest is present, but much of the balance is upheld by outflows ‚Äî the surest sign of a maturing market. Because speculative interests are always balanced by anti-speculative interests, this market must be seen as highly speculative. The shift in capital from relatively larger tokens such as JLP and WIF to newer or resurgent memecoins like FARTCOIN and POPCAT is intriguing. It‚Äôs a common strategy among smart money participants, where funds are relocated from positions that have either peaked or stabilized into tokens viewed as having higher upside potential or that are entering a new hype cycle. Although this activity doesn‚Äôt forecast long-term trends, it does show where capital flows in the short term. Particular attention to FARTCOIN could lead to increased retail participation, especially if the meme becomes a movement and volumes rise considerably. As always, investors are advised to exercise caution ‚Äî the memecoin market is notoriously volatile and very much driven by sentiment and not by fundamentals. But the actions of some very intelligent participants on April 16 provide a rare, almost voyeuristic view into the next moves too many are making in an effort to try and front-run the next memecoin wave. Despite the overlying presence of meme tokens and their attendant liquidity, there is market action that cannot be denied. A good case can be made that crypto is at a crossroads right now, with the meme-fueled section of the industry serving as much more than a bubble waiting to be burst. Still, it also must be said that action in this part of the market is as hard to call right now as it is to avoid any allure for getting involved.

The first hackathon featured 13 winning projects that showcased a variety of ways to use artificial intelligence to make blockchain technology stronger and smarter. Now, those 13 projects will receive funding and mentorship aimed at making their prototypes suitable for the real world. BNB Chain is increasingly committed to integrating AI with Web3 technologies. This promise was underscored recently by the hackathon held in Paris, where AI-powered wins were celebrated. BNB Chain‚Äôs hackathons have been fruitful in the past in showcasing how decentralized ecosystems can exist and thrive. Now, they are also a vehicle to explore the potential of powerful computational tools like AI, which is making waves across many industries, from finance to entertainment. If nothing else, this promises to be fun and comic-worthy. 13 Standout Projects Selected for Funding and Growth The winning projects from the first quarter show both creative diversity and strong, technical foundations. The 13 selected entries are: BINK AI, Botzilla, Tutorial Agent, Tokrio, Polycruz, WORLD3 Protocol, Sentism AI, iDos Games, Boomie, VitaminAI, Stitch AI, Tearline, and Kudo. Each of these startups brings a distinctive application of AI to the blockchain space ‚Äî from AI-enhanced gaming experiences to data-driven DeFi tools and autonomous agents whose mission is to improve user onboarding and education. All projects that win will obtain a starting fund of $50,000, given in the form of what the BNB Chain calls a Kickstart package. Beyond that financial support, though, the projects and their teams will benefit immensely from being a part of something called the MVB, or Most Valuable Builder, program. This is an incubator of sorts that provides mentoring, technical assistance, help with marketing, and a way for the teams to connect with potential investors and other entrepreneurs in the BNB ecosystem. This twofold provision of financial and strategic backing aims to shorten the interval from the birth of an idea to its actual appearance in the marketplace. It seeks to assist nascent teams in transforming their thoughts into products that are not only sustainable but also scalable. BNB AI Hack, launched by BNB Chain, has produced 13 winning projects in its first quarter, including BINK AI, Botzilla, Tutorial Agent, Tokrio, Polycruz, WORLD3 Protocol, Sentism AI, iDos Games, Boomie, VitaminAI, Stitch AI, Tearline, and Kudo. Winning projects are awarded‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 17, 2025 Tiered Rewards System Encourages Iteration and Growth The BNB AI Hack is not a one-time event. Rather, it uses a tiered system to grant increasing rewards and recognition to teams that iterate on and improve their hackathon projects after the event has concluded. In this way, it encourages teams to continue working on their projects beyond the confines of the hackathon. The event has three tiers, with different awards and recognitions at each tier. Projects attaining Tier 1 are awarded a $10,000 cash prize, admission to the BNB Incubation Alliance demo showcase, and the opportunity to be interviewed for the MVB Inc. They receive the full $50,000 Kickstart funding package and much-needed marketing exposure. Prizes and perks The prizes will be awarded in 3 tiers: Tier 1 $10k in cash rewards MVB interview opportunities BIA demo entry Kickstart funding (worth $50k) Marketing exposure Tier 2 $7k in cash rewards Kickstart package (worth $50k) Marketing exposure‚Ä¶ ‚Äî BNB Chain Developers (@BNBChainDevs) February 12, 2025 Projects allocated to Tier 2 are provided with a cash award of $7,000. They also receive a $50,000 Kickstart package and promotional support. For recipients assigned to Tier 3, they are awarded $3,000 in cash, in addition to the Kickstart funding and marketing support. The structure is interesting because it allows for flexibility. Projects are not limited to just one tier ‚Äî and, as teams continue to build, iterate, and grow their solutions, they can progress through the tiers. Each tier above the first unlocks further benefits, almost as if going up the scale of a rewards program. The shape of the structure is still evolving, but its current state offers teams a wonderful opportunity to engage in that next level of ideation. After all, with the right support, an idea can move past the initial submission stage and forward into the world of product development and investment, finding its way into the BNB Chain ecosystem. BNB Chain‚Äôs Strategic Push into AI and Web3 Integration The BNB AI Hack is part of a larger strategy from BNB Chain to blend new technologies‚Äîlike AI‚Äîwith the scalability and transparency of blockchain infrastructure. Startups working at this intersection are increasingly getting attention from venture capitalists. So BNB Chain is inking partnerships with the likes of Fireblocks and Chainlink to help developers build these future applications. The 13 winning projects are equipped with funding, incubator access, and marketing support. They are well-placed to push forward innovations in a space that is still very young. From AI tutoring agents to autonomous gaming environments, the diversity of concepts that these projects represent highlights just some of the frankly limitless ways that AI can enrich the blockchain space. As these initiatives develop and more hackathon seasons take place, BNB Chain‚Äôs initiative is likely to become an essential launchpad for next-generation AI x Web3 companies ‚Äî reiterating its place in my mind‚Äôs eye as a crypto innovation hub.

CoinDesk reported Friday that the downsizing affects ‚Äúhundreds of staffers.‚Äù The move follows a 15% workforce cut in October , which included the departure of key executives and a broader restructuring of internal teams. At the time, Kraken laid off 400 employees, including chief operating officer Gilles BianRosa and chief technology officer Vishnu Patankar. The company simultaneously appointed veteran tech investor Arjun Sethi as co-chief executive alongside Dave Ripley. In preparation for its U.S. IPO, Kraken has laid off hundreds of employees across various business units over the past few months as part of ongoing organizational streamlining. Last October, the company cut 400 jobs, representing approximately 15% of its workforce. Sources‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 18, 2025 Ripley took over as CEO in 2023 after founder Jesse Powell stepped down amid tensions with employees over company culture and leadership style. Kraken‚Äôs Restructuring Continues Under New Leadership Since Sethi joined the top ranks, the company has reportedly continued letting go of staff in waves, according to a report by CoinDesk. The exact number of recent job cuts has not been confirmed, but insiders described an ongoing ‚Äúrolling program‚Äù of layoffs. Despite the cuts, Kraken is said to be hiring selectively in areas viewed as critical to its future roadmap. The company has not issued a public statement addressing the latest restructuring and did not respond to Cryptonews‚Äô request for comment by press time. Kraken Renews IPO Push as Political Winds Shift in Washington Kraken has long eyed the public markets, but regulatory uncertainty under the Biden administration delayed earlier plans. Kraken‚Äôs operational tightening comes as it explores new fundraising efforts. The firm is reportedly in early talks to raise up to $1b in debt . Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are said to be leading the discussions. According to Bloomberg, a public listing could happen as early as the first quarter of 2025 . With Donald Trump back in office and promising a more business-friendly stance on digital assets, some in the industry now see a clearer runway for IPOs that were previously on hold.

Referencing how Wall Street responds to transparency, he suggested that if Ripple goes public, XRP could move beyond being seen as just a cryptocurrency and become a regulated bridge currency backed by a public company. The possibility of a Ripple IPO has been discussed for years. However, in early 2024, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated the company had no plans to pursue one due to regulatory uncertainty . Now, with the calendar deep into 2025 and the SEC lawsuit against Ripple concluded, market watchers are again focused on the potential of a public offering. A Shift Toward Regulatory Legitimacy The resolution of the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit removed a major legal obstacle for the company. With that behind them, the path to an IPO appears clearer than any recent memory. Should Ripple proceed with an IPO, it would be required to meet the rigorous financial and disclosure standards expected of any publicly traded company. This shift could bring institutional clarity that has been lacking since its inception. A Ripple IPO would mean open financial books and public scrutiny, which could reinforce confidence in the company‚Äôs long-term plans for XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If the digital asset is viewed as a bridge currency supported by a regulated and transparent firm, its market perception may shift. For institutions, this added legitimacy may translate into reduced risk concerns. Re-engaging Investors and Boosting Market Confidence According to All Things XRP, a Ripple IPO would provide legitimacy and energize market participants. Some experts believe Ripple could have the largest IPO in history , and All Things XRP believes it will re-energize speculators and draw interest from institutions. The broader transparency that comes from an IPO could also lead to significant capital inflows. As a public company, Ripple would also be better positioned to form strategic partnerships, scale its enterprise solutions, and expand XRP use cases. Each of these developments would likely directly impact XRP‚Äôs valuation. According to All Things XRP, ‚ÄúIf Ripple lists, XRP doesn‚Äôt just go up‚Ä¶ it graduates.‚Äù While there is still no official confirmation from the company, the groundwork appears more solid than in previous years. If Ripple does choose to go public, XRP could benefit substantially. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The proposal, which was made public on April 17, is now open for public consultation until May 5. Under the draft law, the tax would apply when crypto assets are sold for fiat currency or used to purchase goods and services. Crypto Wallet Transfers by Same Owner to Remain Exempt Under New Rules However, crypto-to-crypto transactions and transfers between wallets owned by the same individual would be exempt. The Finance Ministry stated that the new tax would align with existing tax policies, requiring taxpayers to track all their transactions and report them in annual returns. Profits would be calculated by subtracting the purchase price from the sale price. Finance Minister Klemen Bo≈°tjanƒçiƒç defended the proposal, stating that it was unreasonable for one of the most speculative financial instruments to remain untaxed. ‚ÄúThe goal is not necessarily to increase revenue but to ensure fairness in the tax system,‚Äù he said in a statement to the Slovenia Times . ‚ÄúCrypto assets should not be treated differently from other forms of investment.‚Äù However, the draft has already met with criticism from opposition lawmakers. Jernej Vrtovec, a member of the National Assembly and the New Slovenia opposition party, argued that the proposal could undermine Slovenia‚Äôs potential to become a crypto-friendly nation. ‚ÄúWith excessive taxation, we will once again see young people and capital fleeing abroad,‚Äù Vrtovec posted on X. ‚ÄúTaxes should encourage innovation, not suppress it.‚Äù Spet brez obƒçutka! Slovenija ima prilo≈ænost postati kripto prijazna dr≈æava, ampak z vladnimi predlogi bomo spet zamudili vlak. S previsoko obdavƒçitvijo bomo spet gledali, kako mladi in kapital be≈æijo v tujino. Davki naj spodbujajo, ne du≈°ijo! https://t.co/dN1fOEcSuU ‚Äî Jernej Vrtovec (@JernejVrtovec) April 17, 2025 If passed, the law would take effect on January 1, 2026. Slovenia currently imposes a 10% tax on crypto withdrawals and payments, but profits from casual trading are untaxed unless deemed part of business activity. Mining and staking profits are already subject to income tax, while personal crypto activities classified as a hobby remain exempt. A previous attempt to tax crypto in April 2022 proposed a 5% levy on annual profits exceeding ‚Ç¨10,000 ($11,372), but it failed to advance. Slovenia Leads EU with First Blockchain-Based Sovereign Bond in 2023 Meanwhile, Slovenia continues to play a notable role in digital finance, having issued the EU‚Äôs first blockchain-based sovereign bond in 2023. According to Statista , Slovenia is expected to have around 98,000 crypto users by 2025, representing 4.6% of its population, with projected market revenue reaching $2.8 million. Last year, Slovenia became the first member of the European Union to issue a sovereign digital bond. The issuance involved a 30 million euro note, worth around $32.5 million, which offers a 3.65% coupon. The bond was settled on-chain through the Bank of France‚Äôs tokenized cash system.

43474385,https://nulltx.com/?p=148083,1744952519,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Smart Money Wallets Show Targeted Accumulation in AI, DeFi, and Meme Sectors",https://nulltx.com/smart-money-wallets-show-targeted-accumulation-in-ai-defi-and-meme-sectors/,"In the last 24 hours, on-chain data has shown a concentrated accumulation of assets by smart money wallets. These wallets have been making a series of directed purchases across three main crypto narratives: AI and robotics; DeFi and staking; and gaming assets correlated with memes. This wave of accumulation shows how influential crypto wallets are positioning themselves within the narrative economy. The information available suggests that 19 wallets, all monitored as ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù based on historical trading results and wallet actions, made significant accumulations in certain sectors. The first area provoked an obvious response from these wallets: AI and robotics. Those niches attracted eight wallets. Accumulations in DeFi and staking next caught the attention of six wallets. Finally, the five wallets that collectively added to the totals across the meme and gaming category rounded out the big moves in these sectors. AI Projects Draw Attention with Context-Aware Tech The artificial intelligence sector keeps capturing investor interest, particularly as crypto projects start to incorporate actual AI capabilities. One prime example is AGiXT, a project that has been steadily gaining traction due to its aim of deploying AI agents with real-world, memories that are contextually aware. In the last day, a prominent smart money wallet picked up AGiXT tokens to the tune of $49,000, signaling that institutional players are taking a closer look at the token. AGiXT presently has a market cap of $10.2 million, making it a play on a relatively small market with the potential for big upside if the AI Web3 utilities it provides gain traction across the mainstream. The accumulation of this token by experienced wallets suggests confidence in the long-term viability of the kind of AI integrations that go to memory and personalization and beyond the next big thing. I mean, how many industries can you name that already have chatbots? DeFi and Staking Revive Interest Through Maple‚Äôs SYRUP Token Within the decentralized finance and staking category, Maple Finance has caused quite a stir with its recent unveiling of the new token, SYRUP. The altcoin was designed to underpin the next layer of staking to be deployed within Maple‚Äôs lending ecosystem, and it did net Maple $47,000 in accumulation from a single smart money wallet. What sort of market cap does SYRUP have? Well, at the moment, it boasts a healthy $128.9 million. So, just where does SYRUP slot within the DeFi landscape? The DeFi project Maple Finance is slowly but surely gaining traction in the decentralized finance market, and this latest interest could stem from its upgraded staking mechanics or possibly its upcoming governance functions tied to SYRUP. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: AI & Robotics (8 wallets) DeFi & Staking (6 wallets) Meme & Gaming (5 wallets) Top accumulations and reasoning: $AGiXT -> @AGI_XT is gaining traction with its AI agents‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/QKS6vnqtBp ‚Äî CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) April 17, 2025 Carried by what is almost assuredly a smart-money crowd, this accumulation is looking less like a speculative pump and more like a bet on Maple‚Äôs evolving roadmap. Memes Still Rule: Italianrot Sees Multi-Wallet Accumulation Expectation-defying meme coins continue to draw serious capital, especially when viral, community-driven campaigns boost their visibility. The latest example: Italianrot, a meme token whose profile has recently soared thanks to a very bold x100 call by the prominent influencer account Milagrosdegencalls. The day‚Äôs most widespread wallet accumulation came from Italianrot, where five smart money wallets collected a total of $67,000 in tokens. Despite having a market cap of only $6 million, and being a low-cap, high-risk bet, Italianrot seems to have struck a chord with some seasoned investors looking to ride the next token viral cycle. The accumulation here may also reflect an understanding of the memecoin playbook: get in early, follow community sentiment, and ride the wave before retail FOMO kicks in. Emerging Narratives Signal Strategic Positioning What‚Äôs most telling about this latest spurt of activity is how varied the accumulation patterns are. AI and robotics present a future-forward narrative with actual tech applications. Meanwhile, DeFi draws steady interest as protocols innovate around yield and staking. And meme tokens remain a play for explosive ‚Äî if risky ‚Äî gains, driven by community fervor and social media. The distribution of investment across these areas demonstrates that savvy investors are not tied to a single strategy. Instead, these portfolios seem to be betting across various high-upside narratives, blending faith in technology with good old-fashioned momentum plays. As these projects keep on moving like they always have in the past, there‚Äôs no reason to think they won‚Äôt keep on gathering traction. This raises the question of whether the smart money will flow in behind them. The possibility exists that retail traders will once again find themselves behind the eight ball, chasing the moves made by their more expedient predecessors ‚Äî the so-called early movers.

Yet, the currents of this marketplace are subtly shifting, starting to reveal initial signs of investor caution and hesitance that could foreshadow a forthcoming period of Bitcoin price stagnation. Current inflows of capital still appear healthy, but the rate of growth has almost halved, leading some to question just how much longer this price rally can keep going. #Bitcoin ‚Äôs realized cap has reached an all-time high of $872B, yet monthly growth has slowed to +0.9%. This indicates that while capital inflows remain positive, investor appetite is softening ‚Äì signaling continued risk-off sentiment. pic.twitter.com/XBgZP7NoWo ‚Äî glassnode (@glassnode) April 17, 2025 In the past month, Bitcoin‚Äôs realized market cap has only grown by 0.9%. This tepid growth reflects a subtle but significant shift in sentiment among the digital currency‚Äôs holders: while new money continues to enter the market and push prices ever upward, the enthusiasm that once propelled Bitcoin higher seems to be waning. Such a slowdown often signals a ‚Äúrisk-off‚Äù environment, where investors reduce their exposure to unstable, wild assets in favor of something more solid and safe. Investor Behavior Suggests Market Saturation One of the clearest indicators of this shift comes from Bitcoin‚Äôs Realized Profit and Loss, which, when adjusted for volatility, now shows a balance that‚Äôs nearly even. This equilibrium suggests a period of saturation, where neither buyers nor sellers appear to hold an outstanding advantage. In past market cycles, we‚Äôve often seen the periods like this precede a phase of price consolidation. Another crucial metric adds to the saturation: the volatility-adjusted net realized profit and loss for Bitcoin. This gauge has returned to the long-term median, a level that historically separates bullish from bearish realms. When the market hangs around this median, it often indicates a lack of clarity about the continuation or the reversal of the current trend. In this instance, it seems to represent that Bitcoin is at a make-or-break moment, hanging between two adjacent possible states: either a swing back to the strong uptrend that‚Äôs been interrupted or a deep dive. Indicators based on equilibrium are somewhat ignored, compared to the immediate price actions we see. But I trust them over long timeframes so much that I consider them valuable indicators of the market‚Äôs health. Taken together, these equilibrium-based tools are suggesting that Bitcoin is not in a state of emergency. Instead, it‚Äôs in one of those moments that happen from time to time, where indecision runs rampant and the market sits still, waiting for a news event or some other catalyst to spark action. ETF Outflows Add to Uncertainty Recent developments in institutional investment flows add to the market tension. On April 16, U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net outflow of $170 million. The most significant withdrawal came from Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC, which alone accounted for $114 million in outflows. These numbers highlight a broader trend: while ETFs had been seen as a major gateway for institutional capital into the crypto market, their recent performance indicates that even larger investors are stepping back to reassess their positions. Subsequently, this has and could continue to negatively affect the price of Bitcoin. On April 16, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net outflow of $170 million, with Fidelity's FBTC leading the outflows at $114 million. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net outflow of $12.0062 million, marking the seventh consecutive day of outflows. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 17, 2025 ETF flows are often seen as a stand-in for institutional sentiment. While sustained outflows might not crash the market immediately, they can exert downward pressure on momentum and limit upside potential. In this instance, a big outflow from a major ETF issuer like Fidelity suggests that institutional players are taking a more defensive posture, which obviously contributes to a market with a risk-off tone. A Market Poised for a Break‚ÄîBut in Which Direction? Bitcoin, with its cap realized at record highs, and momentum that is softening, is at a crossroads. The metrics are not pointing to an imminent collapse, nor are they indicating that a strong breakout is just around the corner. Instead, what the data is telling us is that the market is caught between bullish conviction and bearish caution. As market participants look for unambiguous signals from the economy or a fundamental change in the flows of capital, Bitcoin might keep moving sideways, consolidating. For now, this market balance is in place, but it won‚Äôt last forever, and historically, when metrics like these align, clear price action tends to follow. Typically, the direction that price action takes after a move like this, either up or down, is contingent on the same kind of external catalysts listed above. At present, Bitcoin is still in a holding pattern, its next move too uncertain to define. But with so many indicators at crucial thresholds, the decision it makes could set the market on a defined path for months to come. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

On-chain data shows that some of the biggest players ‚Äî whales, institutional entities, and even some early participants of the ICO ‚Äî have really stepped up their selling over the past week. Combined with price dips, we now see some previously dormant accounts stirring back to life. And despite all the optimism around the ETH upgrade, the Ethereum-focused ETFs are seeing capital flight. Altogether, this paints a pretty cautious-looking picture for market sentiment around Ethereum. In the past week, Ethereum whales have altogether gotten rid of about 143,000 ETH. This has been happening, and it‚Äôs an increasing trend, in the context of growing uncertainty for traders and holders of ETH. Some of the whale movements we see might just be profit-taking or risk management. But the scale and the timing of these whale actions suggest a much larger shift in sentiment‚Äîone that could significantly impact the direction of the price in the short to medium term. Whales have offloaded 143,000 #Ethereum $ETH over the past week! pic.twitter.com/n8cmwyUpER ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) April 17, 2025 Galaxy Digital Leads Whale Activity with $79M in ETH Deposits A prominent digital asset management firm, Galaxy Digital, which is led by Mike Novogratz, is one of the most noticeable contributors to the surge of ETH transfers lately. On-chain data indicates that G|alaxy deposited 12,181.161 ETH, which is worth around $19.02 million, to Coinbase just eight hours ago, which seems to be taking advantage of a recent price dip. [Update] Galaxy Digital deposited an additional 12,181 $ETH (~$19.02M) to #Coinbase ~8 hours ago, during the dip. This brings their total $ETH moved to CEXs over the past 5 days to 49,681 $ETH (~$79.36M) at an average price of $1,597. Follow @spotonchain for more updates now! https://t.co/iXxCBveTPA pic.twitter.com/fY4JHzCCo8 ‚Äî Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) April 17, 2025 This deposit represents Ethereum sent to centralized exchanges by Galaxy Digital over the last five days to the tune of 49,681 ETH. That translates into approximately $79.36 million worth of deposited Ethereum. Galaxy has now sent nearly 50,000 ETH to CEXs in just half of a week. This average price translates to around $1,597 per ETH. That‚Äôs the same price we see on Coinbase right now. What this signals is anyone‚Äôs guess. Considering Galaxy‚Äôs sway and past of being actively involved in the digital asset market, large transfers like this are hardly ever without meaning. When big deposits hit an exchange, they are usually taken as the sign of something nasty on the way for the price of that asset‚Äînasty, that is, if you‚Äôre long the asset in question. That‚Äôs because big deposits mean big potential sales, and the implication of these potential sales is that the prices of the assets are going to go down. Once again, though, it‚Äôs important to note that correlation is not causation. Dormant Whale Awakens: Ethereum ICO Participant Moves $47.8M After 3 Years What adds even more bearish pressure is the activity from an early Ethereum investor who participated in the project‚Äôs 2015 Initial Coin Offering (ICO). After three years of dormancy, the investor transferred 30,000 ETH ‚Äî worth around $47.85 million ‚Äî out of cold storage. Of that amount, 3,000 ETH, or approximately $4.78 million, was moved to Kraken, a leading U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange. This investor started off with 76,000 ETH at Genesis. They received it during the Ethereum ICO, when the effective cost of that much ETH was just $23,560. That translates to the original purchase price of around $0.31 per ETH, which is kind of astonishing to think about. At current prices, their remaining holdings are still worth more than $121 million. Although just a portion of the shifted ETH has arrived at exchanges, the transfer of these hitherto idle funds usually signals direct sales or liquidation of some kind. Taken with other recent market developments, it made for a suspect scenario: Old wallets were waking up and moving funds, and the market was going down, which also made it somewhat more likely that these old wallets were selling. An Ethereum ICO participant transferred 30K $ETH ($47.85M) out after 3 years of dormancy, of which 3K $ETH ($4.78M) was deposited to #Kraken . He received 76K $ETH (costing $23,560, now worth $121M) at Genesis. The ETH ICO price is ~$0.31. https://t.co/ZI1QqtDDF2 pic.twitter.com/DVTInCUzN7 ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 17, 2025 Ethereum ETF Outflows Extend into Seventh Consecutive Day Institutional investment flows are proving to be another headwind for Ethereum. On April 16, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs saw net outflows totaling $12 million, which means that for the last seven days, these products have been seeing withdrawals. The spot ETF is supposed to be another flagship product for institutional use. On April 16, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net outflow of $170 million, with Fidelity's FBTC leading the outflows at $114 million. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net outflow of $12.0062 million, marking the seventh consecutive day of outflows. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 17, 2025 The recent trend in ETF inflows and outflows being viewed as a reliable indicator for gauging institutional sentiment around an asset is definitely a departure from what had become the norm for Ethereum this past year. We had seen it become a go-to for inflow-driven sentiment around Ethereum, serving as an almost real-time indicator for how investors were thinking about the protocol. But the lack of capital entering the ecosystem from this source ‚Äî particularly now when other sources of capital seem to be drying up ‚Äî speaks volumes. Market Faces Mounting Uncertainty as Sell-Side Pressure Builds The collective forces of whale selling, reactivated ICO-era wallets, and steady ETF outflows give a rather gloomy market picture for Ethereum at the moment. Even as the price held steady during the last few sell-offs, the combined volumetric pressure of these three detrimental factors emerging at the same time strongly suggests that confidence in the long-term prospects of Ethereum (and, by extension, the Etherean state machine) is deeping along with the price. In less than a week, more than $140 million worth of ETH has been shifted toward potential sales. The market is now in a state of heightened uncertainty. What we may be looking at here is either a deeper-than-expected correction that‚Äôs unfolding in real time or just a temporary shakeout before the ETH price rebounds. This will be determined largely by overarching macro factors, how investors feel about the market, and whether Ethereum can maintain critical support levels in the face of such intense sell pressure.

The billionaire American media mogul filed a counterclaim against Sun on April 16, calling the Tron founder‚Äôs suit a ‚Äúsham‚Äù and adding claims of ‚Äúunethical and/or illegal business activities.‚Äù Sun sued Geffen in February, claiming that the statue was stolen from him by a former employee who then sold the artwork to Geffen in a deal worth around $65 million in artwork and cash. Sun purchased the Alberto Giacometti sculpture titled ‚ÄúLe Nez‚Äù at a Sotheby‚Äôs auction in 2021 for $78 million, working with the assistance of his former art adviser, Xiong Zihan Sydney. In the 100-page countersuit, Geffen claims that Sun and Xiong ‚Äúcontrived this fraudulent lawsuit‚Äù after they couldn‚Äôt profitably sell two paintings that Geffen had exchanged for the sculpture, along with $10.5 million in cash. ‚ÄúSun‚Äôs claims concerning Le Nez, a sculpture by the artist Alberto Giacometti, are utterly without merit and constitute a bad-faith, tortious attempt to interfere with Geffen‚Äôs ownership of Le Nez,‚Äù the counterclaim read. Geffen also claims that Sun was eager to sell the sculpture because crypto markets were crashing throughout 2022 and 2023 and his crypto platforms Poloniex and HTX were repeatedly hacked for hundreds of millions of dollars in 2023. Alberto Giacometti‚Äôs Le Nez. Source: Fondation Giacomett Key disputes include whether Xiong confessed to stealing the sculpture, inconsistencies in Sun‚Äôs claims about how much money Xiong allegedly stole, and Geffen‚Äôs claim that Sun still has the money and the paintings, which are being held by art dealers. Fraudulent behavior allegations Geffen takes things further by alleging Sun has a history of fraudulent behavior, such as being sued by former employees for punishing them for refusing to engage in ‚Äúunethical and/or illegal business activities,‚Äù and making false statements in other lawsuits. Related: Justin Sun ‚Äònot aware‚Äô of circulating reports about CZ plea deal On April 17, Sun‚Äôs lawyer, William Charron, refuted essential aspects of Geffen‚Äôs countersuit, according to ArtNet. Ms. Xiong confessed to her theft, was arrested in China, and is in detention in China today, he said before adding: ‚ÄúIn spite of these facts, Mr. Geffen goes all-in on the idea that Ms. Xiong was not a thief; that she supposedly spoke for Mr. Sun at all times; and that she is walking freely in China today. Mr. Geffen‚Äôs pleading is extremely misguided.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe eagerly look forward to litigating this case and to recovering Mr. Sun‚Äôs property,‚Äù he said. In November, Sun bought Maurizio Cattelan‚Äôs Comedian ‚Äî a banana taped to the wall ‚Äî at Sotheby‚Äôs New York for $6.2 million, and then ate the banana at a press conference in a publicity stunt.

In Wyoming, the state‚Äôs Stable Token Commission is considering language changes to ensure its proposed WYST stablecoin remains outside the SEC‚Äôs definition of a security. Meanwhile, Kyrgyzstan has formally granted legal tender status to its digital som and plans to begin a pilot project later this year, placing the country among a small but growing group of nations moving from research to implementation in central bank digital currency development. Kyrgyzstan Approves CBDC Pilot, Grants Legal Tender Status to Digital Som Kyrgyzstan is stepping firmly into the future of finance with a new constitutional law signed by President Sadyr Zhaparov that authorizes a pilot project for the country‚Äôs central bank digital currency ( CBDC ). The digital version of the national currency ‚Äî the digital som ‚Äî has also been granted legal tender status, signaling a historic shift in the nation‚Äôs monetary policy and digital infrastructure. The legislation, signed into law on April 17, hands the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic exclusive authority over the issuance, regulation, and operation of the digital som. It empowers the central bank to build and oversee the digital currency‚Äôs platform, while laying the foundation for secure implementation and national usage. Though the pilot project is expected to begin later this year, officials have stated that a final decision regarding a full-scale launch will not be made until late 2026. In the meantime, the National Bank will focus on rigorous testing and the development of cryptographic security measures aimed at preventing fraud and ensuring data integrity within the digital ecosystem. Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs foray into digital currency mirrors a broader global trend ‚Äî but also comes with its own strategic motivations. According to the International Energy Agency, Kyrgyzstan has significant untapped hydroelectric potential, with only 10% of its estimated capacity currently in use. This provides a compelling case for a digitally powered economy, particularly one that could intersect with green-friendly crypto mining initiatives. The CBDC pilot is the latest in a series of blockchain-forward developments under Zhaparov‚Äôs administration. Just weeks ago, Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs parliament, the Jogorku Kenesh, approved amendments to the constitutional law that made this CBDC initiative possible. The March 18 vote marked the legal foundation for this transformative move. International Collaboration and Economic Potential The law‚Äôs passage comes amid Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs growing interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain-based innovation. Earlier in April, former Binance CEO Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao signed a memorandum of understanding with the Kyrgyz foreign investment agency, committing to advise the government on crypto and blockchain regulatory frameworks. President Zhaparov praised the partnership. As the country positions itself as a potential hub for blockchain activity, Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs abundance of renewable energy and emerging legal frameworks could attract global interest in both mining operations and crypto-based entrepreneurship. Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs digital som pilot makes it one of over 115 countries exploring central bank digital currencies, according to data from cbdctracker.org. However, only four countries have so far officially launched their CBDCs ‚Äî the Bahamas (Sand Dollar), Nigeria (e-Naira), Zimbabwe (ZiG), and Jamaica (JAM-DEX). The vast majority of CBDC initiatives remain in the research or development phase, with over 90 countries yet to progress to pilot testing or implementation. Balancing Innovation With Caution Despite the optimism surrounding the pilot, the initiative is not without controversy. Many critics within the global cryptocurrency community have flagged CBDCs as a potential threat to financial privacy, raising concerns about state surveillance, centralized control, and reduced anonymity in digital transactions. To address these concerns, the Kyrgyz government is expected to introduce robust privacy protections and user-centric security protocols as part of its phased rollout strategy. Still, the success of the pilot and public adoption may hinge on how effectively these concerns are addressed. With the legal green light now in place, Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs central bank is poised to begin the technical testing of the digital som platform later this year. These trials will focus on evaluating user functionality, security protocols, interoperability with traditional banking systems, and potential use cases for citizens and businesses. If the digital som proves successful during testing, Kyrgyzstan could become one of the first nations in Central Asia to launch a CBDC with legal tender status ‚Äî a move that could reshape financial inclusion, digital commerce, and cross-border transactions in the region. As President Zhaparov continues to align Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs national interests with cutting-edge technology, the country‚Äôs cautious but ambitious approach to digital currency may well set a precedent for other emerging economies looking to navigate the evolving landscape of financial innovation. Wyoming Stable Token Commission Considers Language Tweaks to Align with SEC Stablecoin Guidelines In related news, during an April 17 meeting held in the extension of the Wyoming Capitol building, Commissioner Joel Revill raised the possibility of adopting alternative language in the commission's official communications and documents to better align with the SEC‚Äôs recent guidance on what constitutes a ‚Äúcovered stablecoin.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking to kind of create our own vernacular around some of this,‚Äù said Anthony Apollo, Executive Director of the Wyoming Stable Token Commission. ‚ÄúWe want to clarify our approach internally and use that as a jumping-off point for the commission‚Äôs discussions going forward.‚Äù Apollo noted that although the commission is actively interpreting the SEC‚Äôs evolving stance, any substantial action or clarification would be formally addressed in a memo expected in May. These adjustments come in the wake of the SEC suggesting that some categories of stablecoins could be deemed ‚Äúnon-securities,‚Äù thereby exempting them from stringent disclosure and registration requirements. The proposed WYST token would be pegged 1:1 to the US dollar and redeemable for fiat currency, making it the first stablecoin fully issued and managed by a US state government. Originally slated for a launch in Q1 2025, the stablecoin‚Äôs debut has since been pushed to July 2025, pending further legal and operational refinement. Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon remains a staunch advocate for the initiative, emphasizing its potential to make state-level financial infrastructure more modern and accessible. However, as with most crypto projects operating in a murky regulatory landscape, WYST‚Äôs trajectory now hinges on its ability to navigate federal rules ‚Äî especially as the SEC continues to exert oversight over various digital assets. Wyoming Eyes Federal Legislation for Long-Term Clarity In addition to interpreting SEC guidance, the Wyoming commission is closely monitoring developments in Congress, where two bills seek to formalize stablecoin regulation. These include the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) introduced in the Senate, and the STABLE Act (Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy) in the House of Representatives. Should either bill pass, it could offer more concrete parameters for state-level issuers like Wyoming, while potentially shielding compliant projects from SEC scrutiny. Until then, Wyoming‚Äôs approach is one of preemptive caution, seeking to make its stablecoin regulation robust enough to withstand both state and federal review. Despite its small population of just over 600,000 residents, Wyoming has become a surprising epicenter for crypto innovation. The state is home to Custodia Bank, a digital asset institution founded by crypto advocate Caitlin Long, and boasts one of the most progressive blockchain regulatory frameworks in the US. Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of crypto‚Äôs most vocal proponents in Washington, also hails from Wyoming and has been instrumental in shaping crypto legislation and pushing for digital asset clarity at the federal level. This backdrop has allowed Wyoming to attract startups and investors looking for a jurisdiction with clear ‚Äî and favorable ‚Äî rules. The WYST stablecoin is seen as an extension of that broader effort to maintain Wyoming‚Äôs position as a regulatory sandbox for blockchain innovation. A Model for Other States? As the Wyoming Stable Token Commission prepares its next steps, its experience could serve as a template for other US states exploring similar digital currency ventures. If successful, WYST would become the first US state-issued and state-backed stablecoin, a move that could redefine the interplay between state sovereignty and federal regulatory authority in the digital currency age. With a May memo on SEC guidance forthcoming and a mid-year launch still on the table, Wyoming‚Äôs bold experiment in state-issued digital currency may soon be put to the test ‚Äî not just in technology, but in legal precedent as well.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-18 05:30:00

XRP is currently trading above $2, sparking renewed hope among investors. Analysts are buzzing about the possibility of it becoming the next cryptocurrency to get a spot ETF approval in the U.S ., right after Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, while the long-term narrative sounds bullish, the short-term mood among traders is more cautious than confident. What‚Äôs Next For XRP Price? Despite the growing excitement, options data has another story. On Deribit, one of the largest crypto options exchanges, traders seem more interested in buying put options, a type of trade usually used to hedge against or profit from falling prices. In simple terms, more people are betting that XRP could dip further rather than rally soon . XRP options skew. (Amberdata/Deribit) This sentiment is backed by what‚Äôs known as a ‚Äúnegative options skew.‚Äù That means the demand for puts is higher than for calls across several timeframes. It‚Äôs a signal that traders are still nervous about XRP‚Äôs near-term performance, even with ETF discussions in play. XRP‚Äôs price chart isn‚Äôt helping ease the nerves either. The coin recently dropped out of an ascending wedge, a technical pattern that often indicates a weakening uptrend. As a result, some analysts believe that XRP could revisit lows around $1.6, unless something bullish shifts the tide. XRP ETF News: Stability from Strong Order Book Not everything looks gloomy. One positive for XRP is its strong order book depth. Unlike tokens such as Solana, XRP can handle large trades without triggering volatile price swings‚Äîa level of stability that regulators may favor when evaluating ETF readiness. This liquidity advantage is one reason XRP remains in ETF discussions . Ripple, the company behind XRP, also continues to promote it as a global payments solution‚Äîa real-world use case that many altcoins still lack .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Beats Ethereum for 6 Months Straight ‚Äì Will XRP Become Next Largest Altcoin? , Will XRP Price Hit ATH? While ETF optimism is giving XRP fans something to look forward to, short-term traders seem to be playing it safe. Until the market sees clearer signs of upward momentum or regulatory progress, the price may stay under pressure. On the other side, crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO believes this week could be a game-changer for XRP‚Äôs trend. He points out that XRP‚Äôs weekly candle is sitting above the key $2.10 level and the 21-week EMA, a positive sign. But the real deal, he says, is $2.25. If XRP can close the week with a solid candle above $2.25, it could officially confirm a bullish trend reversal and suggest that the April 7 bottom was the turning point. EGRAG sees $2.25 as more than just resistance, he calls it the ‚Äúlock-in‚Äù point for the uptrend. This week‚Äôs candle close could decide which direction XRP takes next. For now, XRP is caught between long-term hope and short-term fear. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a public letter to the SEC‚Äôs acting chairman , the company alleged that a UK-based firm, Qube, may be shorting DJT stock without properly disclosing its positions. TMTG believes this kind of trading could be damaging to its stock and wants regulators to step in. What Exactly Is Trump Media Accusing Qube Of? According to TMTG, Qube disclosed in Germany that it held a short position of six million DJT shares, worth over $100 million. But the issue, as Trump Media sees it, is that Qube didn‚Äôt make the same kind of disclosure to US regulators or in other major jurisdictions. The firm also claims Qube‚Äôs position has since nearly doubled to 11 million shares. If true, this would mean Qube is betting heavily against the stock, and without full transparency, raising concerns of potential market manipulation. Large-scale short selling, especially without disclosure, can put serious downward pressure on a stock. Trump Media believes this may be playing a role in the poor performance of DJT stock, which has dropped 35% this year. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump Calls for Fed Chair Powell‚Äôs Termination: ‚ÄòToo Late and Wrong!‚Äô , Stock Under Pressure, But Bigger Problems Remain While the short-selling concerns are getting attention, they come at a time when TMTG is already facing bigger issues. The company is struggling financially, closing last year with less than $4 million in revenue while racking up over $400 million in losses. The stock‚Äôs fall isn‚Äôt just about short sellers, but it also reflects the company‚Äôs deeper challenges, including ongoing investigations around possible misuse of its Truth Social platform. Despite the financial struggles, Trump Media continues to push into the crypto space. It recently partnered with Crypto.com for a future ETF project and received a boost in attention after market maker DWF Labs invested $25 million in World Liberty Financial, a DeFi platform linked to the Trump brand. Bottom Line While TMTG‚Äôs claims about Qube raise fair questions, it‚Äôs likely just one part of the bigger picture. The company is under heavy pressure from investors, regulators, and the market itself. Whether the SEC acts on this request or not, Trump Media will still need to prove it can build a sustainable business, both in tech and now in crypto. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, stablecoins account for billions in daily transaction volumes and traditional banks are unwilling to be left out of the loop. Tech giants like Tether and Circle already dominate the market, but traditional banks like the Bank of America, are moving fast to stake their claim. Bank of America‚Äôs stablecoin aspirations The CEO of the Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, stated on the February 26 that the Bank of America would issue a stablecoin as soon as Congress provides a clear legal framework. Since Moynihan made his statement, the bank has worked behind the scenes through industry groups like the American Bankers Association and Bank Policy Institute to attempt to persuade lawmakers to give traditional financial institutions a competitive edge. The bank has been attempting to get legislation that favors traditional banks while restricting non-bank issuers such as tech startups and fintech companies passed. Lawmakers are currently debating two key bills that could either positively or negatively impact the future of digital banking. The house‚Äôs STABLE act and the senate‚Äôs GENIUS act are both pending bills that could give federally qualified non-banks the permission to issue stablecoins. The Bank of America and other established financial institutions have argued that letting firms like Amazon or Meta into the financial space would create an unfair intersection between banking and commerce, which could potentially affect customer privacy. ‚ÄúThe reason why you do that is because if you don‚Äôt, a retail company, for example, could look at your bank account, your statements, your expenses, and make some really, really intrusive and anti-competitive decisions about how they market to you. And so Congress a long time ago decided to make that separation. There is no such separation for current payment stablecoin issuers under both bills,‚Äù The Block reported . So far, limiting non-banks from issuing stablecoins hasn‚Äôt gathered much traction with either the Senate or the House, as both bills still have provisions for non-banking institutions interested in issuing stablecoins. Tether and Circle face fresh competition While the BoA works towards its goal of launching a stablecoin, Tether and Circle, the dominant issuers in the stablecoin market, are making moves to expand the stablecoin ecosystem. Circle is a company based in the US and promotes itself as a compliance-friendly fiat-pegged token issuer. It has been actively lobbying for legislation that supports non-bank issuers and ensures consumer protection. Tether‚Äôs CEO, Paolo Ardoino, commented on the restriction of non-banks from issuing stablecoins. ‚ÄúIf a company like Meta can bring transparency, compliance, and user protection to the table, there‚Äôs no reason they shouldn‚Äôt participate. Creating artificial barriers only serves to protect incumbents‚Äînot users,‚Äù he said, as reported by the block. Tether, which is headquartered abroad has also hinted its interest in the US market. Ardoino recently visited Washington, DC and New York, where he suggested the creation of a US-based dollar stablecoin subsidiary that would cater to institutional clients. Tether‚Äôs USDT has over $145B in circulation, while Circle has around $60B in USDC issued. Circle is likely to benefit from legislation that enforces strict reserve and audit requirements, unlike Tether . ‚ÄúThe biggest compliance question is the one that everyone has talked about, which is the reserve and the auditing requirements on the reserve. Tether has not done that in the past in the same way that, say, Circle has. The general conventional wisdom is that the reserve auditing requirements are going to be more difficult for Tether to meet.‚Äù Jennifer Schulp, director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute‚Äôs Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, said.

Analysts have called it the largest crypto theft to date. Blockchain forensics linked portions of the stolen funds to eXch, prompting suspicions that the non-KYC exchange may have served as a laundering channel for the North Korean hacking group. eXch denied involvement in any large-scale laundering activity . However, it acknowledged that a small fraction of the stolen assets passed through its platform. The company said this was an isolated incident and promised to donate any fees collected from the transaction to the public good. The platform also pushed back against calls from Bybit to freeze the remaining stolen funds. In communications with Bybit‚Äôs risk team, eXch cited frustration over prior incidents where it claims Bybit froze funds belonging to its users without explanation.

It is the leading decentralized exchange for perpetuals futures trading, rivaling many of its centralized counterparts in terms of daily traded volume. This is mostly because Hyperliquid provides familiar trading interface, quick order settlements and, perhaps the most important part ‚Äì an order book, unlike many of the decentralized exchanges which operate with liquidity pools. You can read more about it in our Hyperliquid review . It runs on Arbitrum to ensure quick and cheap transaction fees and finality. The Hyperliquid bridge is a critical component of its ecosystem, allowing users to onboard funds to the blockchain and to the decentralized exchange. Hyperliquid Bridge: Moving USDC to Hyperliquid How to bridge USDC to Hyperliquid is perhaps one of the very first things a user must understand in order to start using the decentralized exchange. Keep in mind that all trading pairs on the platform are denominated against USDC. There are generally two ways to go about bridging funds to Hyperliquid: centralized and decentralized. In both cases you will need an EVM wallet such as MetaMask and an activated Arbitrum wallet. As we mentioned above, Hyperliquid operates on Arbitrum and you will need an address to receive the funds on. Check out some of the best DeFi wallets , most of which offer multi-chain support. The decentralized way to bridge USDC to Hyperliquid Although there are a few ways to go about this, perhaps the easiest is to use the solution provided by deBridge. It offers a nearly-instant solution to help you bridge any asset on any chain. Here is the step-by-step breakdown. Step 1: visit deBridge Step 2: select the source chain (the one that you have funds on) on top and the destination chain at the bottom. Hyperliquid operates on Arbitrum. Therefore, for your destination chain, you have to select Arbitrum from the chains tab and USDC from the assets tab as shown in the picture below: Source: deBridge Step 3: connect your EVM wallet as the source and the destination. Step 4: input how much USDC you want to bridge to Hyperliquid and make sure to review the transaction details. Step 5: confirm the transaction and in a few minutes the funds will be right into your Arbitrum wallet. Step 6: Open Hyperliquid , connect your wallet and click on ‚ÄúDeposit‚Äù from the top right navigation menu. From there, you will see the available USDC in your Arbitrum wallet and you can deposit as much as you want from it to Hyperliquid and start trading immediately. The centralized way to bridge funds to Hyperliquid The above allows you to bridge funds without going through a single centralized party, but what if you already have funds on a popular exchange like Binance, for example? Well, the process to bridge to Hyperliquid might even be easier. Simply go to your withdrawals tab and in the destination address input your Arbitrum wallet‚Äôs address. Select how much you want to withdraw, confirm it, and once the transaction is through, you will see your funds directly in your wallet. From there, follow Step 6 from the above to deposit funds into your Hyperliquid account. General Information about Hyperliquid‚Äôs Bridge There are a few things that you need to know about the Hyperliquid bridge. Deposits to Hyperliquid Bridge First, the deposits to it are signed by the validators and are credited as soon as more than 2/3 of the staking power has signed the deposit. The deposit flow itself is very simple. The user has to send USDC to the bridge (as described in the process above) and it is credited to the account that sent it in less than a minute. There is a minimum deposit amount, which is 5 USDC. If you happen to send less than this, it won‚Äôt be credited and you will lose the funds forever. Withdrawals from Hyperliquid Bridge Withdrawals from the Hyperqliuid bridge would require a user wallet signature on the Hyperliquid DEX only. It does not trigger a transaction on Arbitrum and are handled entirely by validators. The funds will arrive in your Arbitrum wallet in about 3 to 4 minutes. Withdrawals from Hyperliquid are deducted from your L1 balance immediately and validators sign them as separate transactions. Once 2/3 of the staking power has effectively signed the withdrawal requres, an EVM transaction can be sent to the bridge, which will request the withdrawal. Once this happens, there is a dispute period, during which the Hyperliquid bridge can be locked for a malicious withdrawal. 2/3 of the stake-weighted validator set is required to properly unlock the bridge. Once the dispute period is over, finalization transactions are being sent, which then distribute the USDC to the destination address. You don‚Äôt pay any ETH fees for this transaction and it shouldn‚Äôt take more than 3-4 minutes, as explained above. However, there is a withdrawal gas fee of 1 USDC that is paid on Hyperliquid to cover the Arbitrum gas costs of the validators.

Industry leaders like Barry Silbert and Michael Saylor are reinforcing the long-term value of holding BTC. While BTC had a tough start to the year, AI and meme coins dominated Q1 2025 investor interest, though scandals like the Libra token collapse raised questions about the sustainability of meme-driven hype. Bitcoin Optimism Rises Bitcoin-related sentiment on social media took a noticeable bullish turn, despite the cryptocurrency continuing to fluctuate around the $85,000 mark. According to crypto analytics platform Santiment , traders are showing renewed optimism that Bitcoin could soon reclaim the $90,000 price level, which is a milestone that was last reached on March 6. The optimism seems to be closely tied to broader economic conditions, including developments around global tariffs and macroeconomic indicators. Santiment‚Äôs social sentiment tracker registered a big shift on April 16, moving from neutral territory‚Äîbelow a score of 1.606‚Äîinto bullish territory with a score of 1.973. This change in sentiment happened even as Bitcoin continued to see high volatility, with price movements climbing as high as $86,000 on April 15 before retracing to $83,000 the next day. At press time, Bitcoin was priced at $84,792 after its price managed a slight 0.69% climb over the past 24 hours. BTC‚Äôs price was also in the green by just over 5% on its weekly time frame. BTC‚Äôs price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) A potential move back above $85,000 could trigger the liquidation of approximately $254 million in short positions, based on data from CoinGlass . This looming risk is contributing to the optimism among traders who believe Bitcoin may soon break out of its current price range. The upbeat sentiment is shared by several voices in the crypto space. Samson Mow‚Äôs firm Jan3 claimed that a $500,000 Bitcoin price target ‚Äùisn‚Äôt crazy,‚Äù while crypto trader ‚Äú Ted ‚Äù argued that an increasing global money supply will eventually find its way into Bitcoin. Another trader, known as Titan of Crypto , said that Bitcoin continues to follow Dow Theory, and is still in an uptrend with consistent higher highs and higher lows. Despite this wave of bullish commentary, not all sentiment indicators are aligned. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently reflects a ‚ÄúFear‚Äù score of 33 out of 100, which means that there is still some caution among a large portion of the market. This comes after a disappointing first quarter for the crypto market, where Bitcoin and Ethereum fell by 11.82% and 45.41%, respectively. This made it one of the weakest Q1 performances in recent years. Crypto fear and greed index (Source: Alternative ) Just Hold Your BTC Barry Silbert, the CEO of Digital Currency Group, recently reflected on his early Bitcoin journey during an appearance on Raoul Pal's Journey Man podcast . Silbert bought Bitcoin at $7‚Äì$8 back in 2011, and shared that while he invested in early-stage crypto companies like Coinbase using Bitcoin, simply holding onto his BTC would have yielded much better returns . Raoul Pal‚Äôs podcast (Source: YouTube ) Silbert‚Äôs comments come during the latest surge in Bitcoin optimism, with some industry leaders predicting dramatic price increases in the years to come. Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, repeatedly forecasted a seven-figure Bitcoin price, and other influential voices are beginning to agree with his projections. Zach Shapiro , head of the Bitcoin Policy Institute, recently said that if the United States were to buy one million Bitcoin, it could send the price soaring to $1 million per coin. Speaking on Bitcoin Magazine‚Äôs podcast, Shapiro said a move like this will trigger a ‚Äùglobal seismic shock.‚Äù His comments were reinforced by Bo Hines, executive director of the White House Crypto Council under President Trump, who said that the administration is evaluating budget-neutral strategies for adding Bitcoin to the nation‚Äôs strategic reserves. One strategy under discussion includes revaluing the US Treasury's gold reserves, which are currently pegged at $43 per ounce on the books despite trading at over $3,300 per ounce in the market. Another involves using trade tariffs to fund the purchase of Bitcoin. These ideas reflect the narrative where Bitcoin is being positioned as a potential tool to address the United States‚Äô $36 trillion national debt. VanEck estimated that Bitcoin-backed long-term bonds could help reduce the national debt by as much as $14 trillion. As the idea of nation-state Bitcoin accumulation gains momentum, Silbert‚Äôs hindsight about the value of simply holding BTC rather than deploying it for venture capital may prove more relevant than ever. AI and Memecoins Dominate Even though Bitcoin had a rocky start to the year, a new report by CoinGecko revealed that artificial intelligence tokens and meme coins continued to lead investor interest. In fact, they accounted for a combined 62.8% of attention during Q1. Q1 trending categories (Source: CoinGecko ) AI tokens alone captured 35.7% of global investor interest, surpassing meme coins, which held 27.1%. Among the top 20 crypto narratives for the quarter, six categories were related to meme coins, while five focused on AI. CoinGecko co-founder Bobby Ong shared in an April 17 post that the market is still clinging to trends from previous quarters, which suggests fatigue from a lack of innovation in crypto storytelling. The spike in meme coin interest earlier in the year was partly driven by political events, particularly around the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. His team launched the Official Trump (TRUMP) and Official Melania tokens in mid-January on the Solana network, WHICH briefly injectED SOME excitement into the meme coin space. Despite this surge, concerns are rising about the impact of meme coins on more fundamentally driven projects. Utility tokens like Solana have seen major capital outflows after briefly peaking above $270. Some critics argue that the meme coin frenzy diverted investment away from long-term blockchain infrastructure and application development. SOL‚Äôs price action over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The decline in enthusiasm was accelerated by the collapse of the Libra token,which is a meme coin that was endorsed by Argentine President Javier Milei. The token lost 94% of its value in a matter of hours after insiders reportedly withdrew more than $107 million in liquidity, erasing $4 billion in market capitalization. This scandal marked the sudden fall of political memecoins and led to a sharp drop in token creation activity on Solana‚Äôs Pump.fun platform. Despite the turbulence, seasoned traders are still drawn to speculative meme coin opportunities. Nicolai Sondergaard of Nansen noticed that while the meme coin supercycle may be over, smart money is still looking for quick gains from these tokens, which tend to operate outside traditional macroeconomic pressures. While the broader market appears weary of repeating narratives, meme coins continue to serve as a playground for risk-tolerant investors chasing outsized returns.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-18 06:00:00

As of the time of writing, BTC is trading at $84,449, down 0.7% in the past 24 hours. Despite recovering from previous corrections, the price has struggled to break through the current resistance level, signaling weak buying momentum and cautious sentiment among traders. Related Reading: Bitcoin At $1 Million? BPI Says One US Move Could Make It Happen Bitcoin STH-SOPR and Realized Price Indicate Capitulation The current phase of consolidation follows weeks of volatile swings driven by broader macroeconomic uncertainty and mixed signals across risk assets. While long-term holders remain steady, short-term participants in the market appear to be under pressure. Insights into the behavior of these short-term holders may offer valuable clues on the overall direction of the market and possible entry or exit points for investors. According to a recent analysis shared by CryptoQuant contributor CryptoMe, data from short-term holders (STHs) reveals key indicators that could help define Bitcoin‚Äôs current cycle. The first metric highlighted is the STH Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR), which measures whether STHs are selling at a profit (above 1.0) or at a loss (below 1.0). Currently, this metric is below 1.0 based on a 14-day moving average, indicating that many STHs are offloading BTC at a loss‚Äîa signal often associated with capitulation phases. While this suggests bearish sentiment in the short term, CryptoMe points out that similar dips in STH-SOPR during past bull markets often presented accumulation opportunities. Historically, these periods of loss-taking by STHs have marked temporary bottoms, with prices rebounding shortly after as stronger hands absorb supply. Accumulation Opportunities and Strategy Outlook Another key metric shared is the STH Realized Price, currently around $92,000. This figure represents the average cost basis for coins held by short-term investors. When Bitcoin trades below this level, it can indicate undervaluation relative to recent buyer activity. In CryptoMe‚Äôs view, red zones (in the chart), periods when the spot price dips below the realized price, have often coincided with long-term accumulation zones during previous bullish phases. However, CryptoMe cautions that these indicators do not confirm a market bottom. Instead, they suggest that some investors are exiting positions under stress, creating potential buying opportunities for those with a long-term outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Pressure As Report Flags Chinese Sell-Off Plans Given the broader macroeconomic pressures, the analyst maintains a hedged strategy: accumulating in spot markets while maintaining short positions in derivatives to manage downside risk. He concludes by stating that if macroeconomic conditions improve and liquidity returns to the market, Bitcoin could resume its upward trajectory.

Right now, Pi is trading around $0.61 , which is nearly 400% lower than its all-time high. But some experts say the price could drop even more ‚Äî maybe by 35% to 50%. Let‚Äôs see why they think this might happen. Why Pi Coin Dropping Continuously Popular crypto expert Dr. Altcoin says Pi Coin is on the verge of falling even more, maybe 35% to 50% lower than where it is now. He thinks the main reason is that too many new Pi tokens are being released into the market. If you are still wondering why Pi's price is down today, it's because millions of unlocked Pi are now flooding the CEXs. I have been saying this all along, the available circulating supply on CEXs dictates the price of Pi since: Price = demand/supply. Unless the PCT‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/IblIpVv3Mq ‚Äî Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) April 15, 2025 This month alone, over 100 million Pi coins will be released. This year, more than 1.5 billion new coins will come into circulation. With so many new tokens and not enough people buying, the price might keep falling. Dr. Altcoin also warned that if the Pi Core Team doesn‚Äôt do something to stop the supply from growing, the price could drop all the way down to $0.30 in the next few months. Too Many Tokens, Not Enough Buyers Other experts agree and say this is basic supply and demand. When there are more coins to sell, but not more people to buy them, prices go down. Right now, many people can‚Äôt even buy Pi Coin because it‚Äôs not listed on big exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, so the demand is still low. What‚Äôs the Possible Solution? Some experts suggest that the Pi Foundation could burn some tokens to reduce the supply. Right now, the team holds over 70 billion Pi coins, and burning even a small part could help support the price. Another idea is to burn some of the transaction fees collected from Pi‚Äôs app ecosystem, like other blockchain projects already do. Pi Coin Price Eying 50% Drop The price of Pi Coin has dropped a lot, mainly because hundreds of millions of Pi tokens have been unlocked and added to the market. Recently, it lost 20% in value after failing to move above the strong resistance level at $0.778 last week. Looking at the 1-day price chart, Pi Coin is seen forming a ‚Äúfalling wedge pattern,‚Äù which usually means the price will keep going down. If this happens, the coin could drop to $0.38, its lowest point this month. But if Pi Coin goes above $0.78, it might start going up again and could even reach $1.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-18 06:08:27

Rug pulls have dropped in frequency year-over-year, with early 2024 recording 21 separate incidents, compared to only seven so far in 2025, according to an April 16 report from blockchain analytics platform DappRadar. However, since the beginning of 2025, the Web3 ecosystem has lost nearly $6 billion to rug pulls, according to DappRadar‚Äôs report. However, the report attributes 92% of that to Mantra‚Äôs OM token collapse , which the founders have strongly denied was a rug pull. In comparison, during the same period in early 2024, three months into the year, total losses from rug pulls hit $90 million. ‚ÄúThis shift suggests that rug pulls are becoming less frequent, but far more devastating when they do occur,‚Äù DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said. ‚ÄúThe scams are increasingly sophisticated, often orchestrated by teams with polished branding and well-planned narratives.‚Äù Memecoins main culprit for rug pulls Gherghelas says the nature of rug pulls is evolving. In the first quarter of 2024, most originated in DeFi protocols, NFT projects, and memecoins. In the same time frame for 2025, most rug pulls occurred in memecoins. Libertad project‚Äôs native Solana token, Libra (LIBRA), is one of the more recent high-profile cases of a rug pull ; it rallied to a market capitalization of $4.56 billion on Feb. 14 after Argentina‚Äôs president, Javier Milei, posted about it on X. The token then fell by over 94% after he deleted the post , prompting accusations of a pump-and-dump scheme . ‚ÄúRug pulls and exit scams remain a persistent threat, especially in ecosystems where projects can rapidly gain traction through hype, only to disappear with user funds overnight,‚Äù Gherghelas said. ‚ÄúDespite increasing awareness and more tools to detect suspicious behavior, rug pulls remain a recurring issue, particularly in DeFi and newly launched token ecosystems.‚Äù Gherghelas says red flags for rug pulls can include a sudden spike in unique active wallets without an apparent reason or unusually high volume paired with low user activity. DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas says several red flags could signal a project is a rug pull. Source: DappRadar At the same time, projects with unverified smart contracts, limited GitHub activity, or anonymous developer teams or DApps that spike overnight can also be a red flag.

But the tools available to users are also getting stronger,‚Äù Gherghelas said. ‚ÄúWhile rug pulls may never be fully eradicated, their impact can be drastically reduced when users are equipped with the right information.‚Äù Magazine: Mystery celeb memecoin scam factory, HK firm dumps Bitcoin: Asia Express",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|OM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-18 06:10:39

With a total trading volume of about $8.39 trillion, Binance accounted for 36.5% of the global CEX market share, according to TokenInsight‚Äôs Q1 exchanges report . This was a decrease from the $9.95 trillion volume in Q4 2024 in line with the general market trend. Because of the waning hype after Trump‚Äôs inauguration, overall cryptocurrency trading volumes dropped 12.5% during the quarter. Total spot trading volume across the top 10 exchanges was $4.6 trillion, a 13.1% decrease from Q4 2024. The average daily spot trading value decreased as well, from $58 billion in Q4 to $51 billion in Q1. Despite this, Binance‚Äôs spot market share at the end of the quarter was 45%, a slight increase from the beginning of the quarter. A few rivals made slight progress. The spot market share of MEXC increased from 6.1% to 8%. While the majority of other platforms saw a decline, HTX, Bitget, and Bybit also reported modest gains.

Its stock price dropped 30.6% to $172.23, and daily trading volumes plummeted, indicating that investors were becoming more cautious. Binance maintained its dominant position in the derivatives market, holding a 30.3% share. It also showed the most stability between spot and derivatives volume, indicating its steady platform structure. Over the quarter, derivatives trading reached $21 trillion, with an average daily volume of $233 billion. Traders leaned heavily into derivatives to manage risk in an increasingly uncertain macro environment. According to TokenInsight, the market became more logical and balanced as a result of the falling hype surrounding meme coins and AI tokens, with trading volume distributed more fairly among platforms. The report cited U.S. tariff concerns as one of the key changes that may continue to weigh down on the crypto market in this quarter.

US interest rates remain stubbornly high at 4.5%, which makes the cost of borrowing expensive. Powell warned that Trump‚Äôs newly imposed tariffs, particularly those on China, could lead to a dangerous economic mix of rising prices and slowing growth, or ‚Äústagflation.‚Äù The central bank usually cuts interest rates to stimulate a flagging economy and job market. It increases rates, or keeps them higher for longer, in an attempt to lower inflation. However, it does not appear to be having the desired effect as aggregate US inflation, derived from the Consumer Price Index, is at 2.4%, which is above the Fed‚Äôs target of 2%. Some items, such as food, have even higher inflation rates, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. According to prediction markets, the probability of Powell actually being fired this year is still low. Eliminate the noise and look at what the market is saying: Despite all of the ‚Äúfire Powell‚Äù headlines, prediction markets have been steady.

Trump claims that Chinese officials have shown interest in negotiations, and he appears to be using this narrative to reassure markets further, reported Santiment. However, sentiment could change at the whim of what the POTUS decides to say next. ‚ÄúThe retail crowd‚Äôs sentiment toward crypto still very much matters, but many would admit that their bullish or bearish narratives could be thrown out the window at any time with a quick pivot by Trump.‚Äù As crypto traders wait for a reason to confidently FOMO in on prices, Trump has taken aim at Jerome Powell for not cutting rates.

Accordingly, Kraken will support four trading pairs for BNB: BNB/EUR, BNB/USD, BNB/USDC, and BNB/USDT.

The prime brokerage and credit network already handles over $10 billion in daily transactions across more than 300 institutional accounts. What Does FINRA Approval Mean for Hidden Road Clients?

Both started small‚Äîthen exploded once momentum aligned with market conditions. Now in 2025, another project is beginning to stir up similar energy: MAGACOINFINANCE . While coins like Solana (SOL) and Hedera (HBAR) continue to deliver steady tech growth, traders with higher appetite for early-stage ROI are shifting focus.

In a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 892,000 YouTube subscribers that the total market cap of altcoins (Total3) when paired against Bitcoin is going to continue on a downtrend. Total3 is the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies with the exception of Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ). ‚Äú‚Ä¶now altcoin/Bitcoin pairs are somewhat flat. I think they‚Äôre probably going to spend the next few weeks dropping just like they did last year‚Ä¶ ‚Äú Source: Benjamin Cowen/X Cowen further says that Bitcoin is likely to continue outperforming altcoins until the US monetary policy eases. ‚ÄúMy base case right now for Bitcoin dominance is that it will likely go higher until quantitative tightening is over‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm bullish on Bitcoin dominance because quantitative tightening has not ended. If the Federal Reserve were to end quantitative tightening at the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, then it‚Äôs possible that my opinion would change.‚Äù Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of the total market capitalization of BTC relative to all other crypto assets. A rising Bitcoin dominance indicates that Bitcoin is either rising faster relative to other crypto assets or its decline is relatively muted compared to the rest of the digital asset market. On when the Federal Reserve could ease the US monetary policy, Cowen says, ‚ÄúNow, I don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôs going to take them to end quantitative tightening, it‚Äôs possible they end it this summer.‚Äù Bitcoin is trading at $84,270 at time of writing.

After breaking above the $0.60 mark, many believe the Pi crypto price is preparing for a potential move toward the $1 level , although not everyone agrees on the timeline. Pi Network Price Gains Momentum Amid Bullish Indicators Crypto analyst Xia recently highlighted a rapid rise in Pi Coin‚Äôs momentum, pointing to its price jump past $0.63 and a local high of $0.6441. She emphasized that trading volume is strong, and key technical indicators like the RSI and MACD are turning bullish, which could signal the start of a larger upward trend. Xia also cited Pi‚Äôs strong ecosystem activity. During the recent Pi Fest, over 1.8 million users participated, with more than 58,000 sellers contributing to network engagement. She questioned why traders were still hesitant about Pi despite these promising fundamentals. Pi Coin Value May Dip Without Strategic Actions While Xia is optimistic, analyst Dr. Altcoin offered a more cautious outlook, warning that Pi could face sharp corrections if certain issues are not addressed. Drawing lessons from the recent OM price crash , he outlined three key moves the PiCoreTeam should take to protect Pi Coin‚Äôs price. First, he recommended expanding the number of KYB-approved exchanges and enabling broader market access, including platforms like OKX in restricted regions. Second, he called for more institutional buyers to absorb the Pi supply, with firms like BANXA suggested as potential large-scale buyers. Third, he stressed the importance of regular updates from the Pi Core Team, including new partnerships or product rollouts that could boost demand. Pi Network Price Prediction Analyst Moon Jeff believes Pi Coin is holding its $0.61 support well and could be poised for a move back to $1 if momentum continues. Another analyst, PiNewsZone , echoed this sentiment, suggesting that Pi would become ‚Äúunstoppable‚Äù once it breaks above $1, encouraging users to accumulate during this phase. 108 Million PI Tokens Unlock in April The biggest headwind for Pi Coin isn‚Äôt just technical, it‚Äôs the incoming supply shock. According to Pi scan , as of April 17, over 108.9 million PI tokens are scheduled to be unlocked during the month, putting further pressure on the already struggling coin. On April 16 alone, 2.8 million PI were released into circulation. The unlocks will continue daily, with between 5 to 6 million tokens being unlocked each day. For example, 5.74 million tokens are expected to be unlocked on April 20, followed by 5.14 million on April 21 and 5.91 million on April 22. All these factors could drive Pi Coin sharply higher if momentum sustains, and investors are eyeing every move it makes. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Every piece of economic news, every whisper from financial institutions can send ripples through your portfolio. Today, we‚Äôre diving deep into a significant forecast that could shape your crypto strategy for the next year and beyond: Fitch Ratings‚Äô projection of Fed rate cuts anticipated in Q4 2025. Let‚Äôs unpack what this means for you, the savvy crypto investor. Decoding the Fitch Forecast: Anticipated Fed Rate Cuts Fitch Ratings, a globally recognized credit rating agency, has released a forecast suggesting that the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to initiate interest rate cuts in the fourth quarter of 2025. This prediction, reported by Odaily News, hinges on their analysis of current and projected economic conditions, particularly concerning inflation. But what exactly does this mean in plain English? Essentially, Fitch believes that the Fed, after a period of maintaining high interest rates to combat inflation, will see enough economic cooling by late 2025 to justify easing monetary policy. This potential shift from a hawkish stance to a more dovish one is crucial for understanding future market movements, especially in the cryptocurrency space. Why? Because interest rates are a fundamental lever that influences investment decisions across all asset classes. Why Q4 2025 for Fed Rate Cuts? Unpacking the Economic Outlook Why is Fitch pointing to Q4 2025, and not sooner? It boils down to the complex interplay of several economic factors. Let‚Äôs break down the key elements influencing this economic outlook : Persistent Inflation: While inflation has shown signs of moderation from its peak, it remains above the Federal Reserve‚Äôs target of 2%. Fitch likely anticipates that bringing inflation sustainably down to this target will take time, necessitating continued higher rates for a significant period. Economic Resilience: The U.S. economy has demonstrated surprising resilience despite the high interest rate environment. Strong labor market data and consumer spending have kept the economy from slipping into a recession. This resilience might delay the Fed‚Äôs urgency to cut rates. Lag Effect of Monetary Policy: Monetary policy actions, like interest rate hikes, typically take time to fully filter through the economy. Fitch‚Äôs forecast likely considers this lag effect, suggesting that the full impact of current high rates might not be fully realized until late 2025, justifying rate cuts then. Global Economic Conditions: The global economic landscape also plays a role. Slowdowns in other major economies could influence the Fed‚Äôs decisions, potentially pushing them to consider rate cuts to support overall economic stability, albeit with a delay until Q4 2025 according to Fitch. The Crypto Connection: How Fed Rate Cuts Could Impact Your Investments Now, let‚Äôs get to the heart of the matter for crypto enthusiasts: how do these Fed rate cut projections impact the cryptocurrency market? Historically, changes in interest rates have a significant inverse relationship with risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Here‚Äôs why: Increased Liquidity: Lower interest rates generally make borrowing cheaper. This can lead to increased liquidity in the financial system, some of which can flow into higher-risk, higher-reward assets like cryptocurrencies. Reduced Appeal of Bonds: When interest rates are high, government bonds and other fixed-income securities become more attractive due to their higher yields. Conversely, when rates fall, the appeal of these lower-yielding assets diminishes, potentially driving investors towards assets like crypto in search of better returns. Weakening Dollar: Rate cuts can sometimes lead to a weaker U.S. dollar. A weaker dollar can make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more attractive to international investors, potentially boosting demand and prices. Risk-On Sentiment: Lower rates often foster a ‚Äúrisk-on‚Äù sentiment in markets. Investors become more willing to take on risk, and cryptocurrencies, being a high-beta asset class, tend to benefit from this environment. However, it‚Äôs crucial to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond just interest rates . Regulatory developments, technological advancements, adoption rates, and overall market sentiment also play significant roles. Navigating the Q4 2025 Outlook: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, with Fitch‚Äôs Q4 2025 forecast in mind, what actionable steps can crypto investors take? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on economic data releases, especially inflation figures, GDP growth, and employment reports. These indicators will provide clues about the Fed‚Äôs likely path and the validity of the Fitch forecast. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different cryptocurrencies and even traditional assets can help mitigate risk and capitalize on various market conditions. Long-Term Perspective: Crypto investing is often a long-term game. While rate cuts can provide a boost, focus on the fundamental value and long-term potential of the projects you invest in, rather than solely relying on macroeconomic factors. Risk Management: Always practice prudent risk management. Understand your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially in the volatile crypto market. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Given the uncertainty in market timing, DCA can be a useful strategy. Regularly investing a fixed amount can help smooth out price volatility and potentially improve your average entry price over time. Potential Challenges and Alternative Scenarios While Fitch‚Äôs forecast provides a valuable perspective, it‚Äôs essential to acknowledge that economic predictions are not set in stone. Several factors could alter the timeline of Fed rate cuts : Inflation Rebound: If inflation proves more persistent than anticipated or even rebounds, the Fed might delay rate cuts beyond Q4 2025 or even consider further rate hikes. Unexpected Economic Slowdown: Conversely, if the economy weakens more sharply than expected, the Fed might be forced to cut rates sooner than Q4 2025 to stimulate growth. Geopolitical Events: Unforeseen geopolitical events can significantly impact global economies and financial markets, potentially influencing the Fed‚Äôs monetary policy decisions. It‚Äôs crucial to remain adaptable and prepared for different scenarios. Relying solely on one forecast can be risky. A balanced approach involves considering various perspectives and continuously reassessing the evolving economic landscape. Conclusion: Navigating the Future with Insight Fitch‚Äôs projection of Fed rate cuts in Q4 2025 offers a valuable glimpse into the potential future trajectory of interest rates and their implications for the crypto market. While it‚Äôs just one forecast, it highlights the importance of macroeconomic factors in shaping the crypto investment landscape. By staying informed, adopting a long-term perspective, and practicing prudent risk management, crypto investors can navigate the evolving market dynamics and position themselves for potential opportunities that may arise as monetary policy shifts. The key takeaway? Anticipation and preparation are your strongest allies in the ever-dynamic world of cryptocurrency investing.

At the same time, the company is still hiring in critical areas, according to a spokesperson. The company regularly assesses its staffing to ensure it supports its strategic goals. The staff reductions affect all company areas and are part of an ongoing restructuring process that started late last year. This comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dismissed a civil lawsuit¬†in March, which had accused Kraken of operating illegally as an unregistered securities exchange. Trump‚Äôs promise to enact more business-friendly laws has been instrumental in Kraken‚Äôs growth In a blog post, Kraken referred to the SEC‚Äôs dismissal as a crypto turning point that ended a wasteful, politically driven campaign that had been started during the Biden administration and acted as a barrier to investment and innovation. The spokesperson added that the company‚Äôs business is thriving, adding that they were launching more new products than ever before, increasing revenue, and quickly growing their whole product line, including announcing their acquisition of NinjaTrader earlier this year. Earlier this year, the cryptocurrency exchange announced that it would pay $1.5 billion to acquire the retail futures trading platform NinjaTrader to increase its user base and diversify into other asset classes. Moreover, in its most recent effort to broaden its product offerings, the San Francisco, California-based company started a phased nationwide rollout of commission-free trading for more than 11,000 stocks and exchange-traded funds listed in the United States. Notably, U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs pledge to more industry-friendly regulations has prompted cryptocurrency companies like Kraken to look into expanding traditional financial markets. At the end of 2024, Kraken cut 400 positions‚Äîroughly 15% of its workforce‚Äîshortly after Silicon Valley investor and board member Arjun Sethi was appointed co-CEO alongside David Ripley. Ripley had stepped up the CEO position in 2023 following the departure of founder Jesse Powell. Kraken offers U.S. stock and ETF trading while getting ready for potential IPO Kraken started offering commission-free trading for U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to compete more directly with platforms like Robinhood. This allowed users to access traditional financial markets from within the platform they used for cryptocurrencies. The company has not publicly confirmed its IPO plans, but the internal changes suggest the exchange is preparing itself for increased scrutiny and investor readiness. Kraken now joins other U.S.-based crypto firms like Coinbase, Marathon Digital, and Bitdeer in pursuing public market ambitions. Furthermore, with intentions to extend access nationwide and to foreign markets like the U.K., Europe, and Australia, the Kraken stock trading rollout started in ten U.S. jurisdictions, including New Jersey, Connecticut, and Alabama. As a result, clients in these states could use the web interface, Kraken Pro, or mobile app to buy and sell stocks straight from their Kraken account. A co-CEO of Kraken, Arjun Sethi, declared in a statement that cryptocurrency was recently the foundation for trading in various asset classes, including stocks, commodities, and currencies. Sethi added that customers sought a smooth, all-in-one trading experience as the need for round-the-clock worldwide access increased. He further acknowledged that it made sense for them to move into the equity market, opening the door for asset tokenization. As a result, Kraken was among the few crypto-native businesses that provide digital and traditional asset trading through a single account.

43478260,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150628,1744961115,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Surging Crypto Interest: Bitcoin and Ethereum Google Searches Explode to 2025 Highs,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-ethereum-google-searches-surge/,"Is crypto winter finally thawing? Signs are pointing towards a potential resurgence of interest in the digital asset space as Google search data reveals a surge in queries for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Are we witnessing the dawn of a new crypto spring, or just a fleeting moment of renewed curiosity? Let‚Äôs dive into the numbers and explore what‚Äôs fueling this exciting uptick. Bitcoin Search Interest Skyrockets to 2025 Peak Data from The Block paints a compelling picture: Bitcoin search interest on Google experienced a significant jump in March, climbing by 26% compared to February. This impressive leap propelled the search score to 34, marking the highest point we‚Äôve seen so far in 2025. What does this mean for the broader crypto market? It suggests a renewed wave of attention is being directed towards the flagship cryptocurrency, potentially signaling a shift in market sentiment. This resurgence in Bitcoin search interest could be attributed to several factors. Let‚Äôs break down some potential drivers: Renewed Retail Enthusiasm: The most likely culprit is a simple resurgence of retail investor interest. After periods of market correction or consolidation, price movements and positive news cycles often draw individuals back into the crypto space. ‚ÄúDigital Gold‚Äù Narrative Revival: Economic uncertainties and geopolitical events frequently lead investors to seek safe-haven assets. The recent U.S. tariff announcements seem to have inadvertently breathed new life into Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù narrative. As traditional markets react to these announcements, Bitcoin‚Äôs perceived independence from traditional financial systems might be attracting attention as a hedge against potential economic headwinds. Broader Crypto Market Recovery: Bitcoin often acts as a bellwether for the entire cryptocurrency market. Increased interest in Bitcoin can spill over into other cryptocurrencies, indicating a general revitalization of the digital asset space. Ethereum Joins the Party: Search Interest Hits Yearly Highs It‚Äôs not just Bitcoin basking in the Google search limelight. Ethereum search interest is also on the rise, mirroring Bitcoin‚Äôs upward trajectory. February saw a score of 16, which then climbed to 19 in March, also reaching a yearly peak. This upward trend in Ethereum search interest suggests that the renewed curiosity isn‚Äôt limited to Bitcoin alone but extends to the broader crypto ecosystem, particularly towards the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The synchronized increase in search interest for both Bitcoin and Ethereum strengthens the argument for a broader resurgence of retail investor interest . It suggests that people are not just curious about the most well-known cryptocurrency but are also exploring the wider landscape of digital assets and decentralized technologies. Digital Gold Narrative vs. Reality: Gold Still Reigns Supreme? While the revived ‚Äú digital gold narrative ‚Äù for Bitcoin is intriguing, the data suggests that traditional gold remains the preferred safe-haven asset, at least for now. Since the U.S. tariff announcements, gold has outperformed both Bitcoin and equities. Let‚Äôs examine the ratios: Ratio Percentage Increase Gold-to-BTC 8% Gold-to-SPX (S&P 500) 10% These figures indicate that gold has strengthened its position relative to both Bitcoin and the broader stock market (represented by the S&P 500) in the wake of the tariff news. This doesn‚Äôt negate the long-term potential of Bitcoin as a digital gold narrative , but it highlights that in times of immediate economic uncertainty, traditional safe-haven assets like gold often remain the initial choice for investors seeking stability. Decoding Crypto Market Trends: What Does it All Mean? So, what actionable insights can we glean from these crypto market trends ? Increased Volatility Potential: A surge in retail interest can often lead to increased market volatility. Newcomers to the crypto space might be more prone to emotional trading decisions, potentially amplifying price swings. Opportunity for Education: The rise in search interest presents a valuable opportunity for crypto educators and platforms to provide accessible and reliable information to newcomers. Guiding new users through the complexities of crypto investing is crucial for sustainable market growth. Monitor Macroeconomic Factors: Keep a close eye on macroeconomic developments and geopolitical events. These factors can significantly influence both traditional and cryptocurrency markets, impacting investor sentiment and asset allocation strategies. Diversification Remains Key: While the renewed interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum is encouraging, diversification remains a cornerstone of sound investment strategy. Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. Consider a balanced portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope or a False Dawn? The recent surge in Google searches for Bitcoin and Ethereum offers a compelling glimpse into the evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. While it‚Äôs too early to definitively declare a full-blown bull run, the data undeniably points towards a resurgence of interest and engagement. Whether this translates into sustained market growth remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the crypto conversation is heating up once again. Keep your eyes peeled, stay informed, and navigate this exciting space with caution and informed optimism.

Analysts Rank SOL, LINK, and MUTM for 2025 ROI Potential",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-cryptos-to-buy-now-analysts-rank-sol-link-and-mutm-for-2025-roi-potential/,"As market momentum picks up mid-2025, crypto analysts are starting to sharpen their outlooks‚Äînot just for short-term gains but for long-term return on investment. With Bitcoin testing new highs and liquidity entering the space again, experienced investors are looking beyond the top few names. Three cryptocurrencies consistently making analysts‚Äô shortlists for top investment picks are Solana (SOL), Chainlink (LINK), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM). All three bring something different to the table. While SOL and LINK have established histories, MUTM represents a new opportunity, currently in its presale phase and gaining traction for its practical DeFi use case. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at why these tokens are being positioned by analysts as some of the best cryptos to buy now. What Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance is a decentralized, non-custodial protocol under development that aims to bring flexibility and transparency to lending and borrowing. Built on Ethereum, the protocol is being designed to support both passive income for depositors and capital access for borrowers‚Äîwithout intermediaries. The platform plans to issue mtTokens when users deposit assets like ETH, BTC, or USDT. These mtTokens will represent their deposited amount and accumulate value based on real-time borrowing activity. Borrowers will be able to use their assets as collateral to access liquidity without selling, with the protocol supporting both mainstream and more volatile assets under separate borrowing conditions. The team behind Mutuum is preparing to roll out a beta version of the platform shortly after token launch, and the project has already attracted early interest from DeFi users and private investors alike. Solana (SOL) Solana is once again trending across trading platforms. With prices recently hovering near $137, the token saw a 40% surge on April 15, recovering from prior declines. Though still below its January peak of nearly $294, SOL is finding renewed support as institutional interest returns. One of the biggest catalysts came with the approval of Canada‚Äôs first spot Solana ETF, which went live on April 16. Analysts now project SOL could rise toward $252 by the end of 2025, as investor confidence rebuilds and developers continue building within the ecosystem. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink has faced downward pressure through the first half of the year. Currently trading at around $12.25, LINK remains under its yearly high. Analysts, however, remain optimistic about its long-term potential. Predictions suggest that LINK may reach $15.13 in the short term, with long-range expectations extending toward $48‚Äì$100, depending on the pace of enterprise adoption and broader DeFi integration. Despite its recent pullback, Chainlink continues to play a critical role in enabling smart contract infrastructure across multiple blockchains. Why MUTM Is the One to Watch Right Now While SOL and LINK continue to recover and position themselves for a strong Q3, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly gaining attention for its early-stage potential. Currently in its 4th presale phase, the token is available at $0.025, offering an accessible entry point for investors looking to get in before the protocol officially goes live. So far, the project has raised over $6.8 million and onboarded more than 8,300 on-chain holders, indicating strong early support. The presale progresses through set phases, with each stage bringing a price increase‚Äîthe next one scheduled to rise to $0.03. That means those joining now are still catching MUTM at its lowest valuation. Shortly after launch, Mutuum Finance is expected to see its token price surge to around $0.50‚Äì$0.70, according to multiple analysts tracking early-stage DeFi projects. From the current presale price of $0.025, that represents a potential short-term increase of 1,900% to 2,700%. This growth is largely attributed to the combination of platform rollout, growing holder base, and expected listings on major exchanges, all of which are likely to boost both visibility and liquidity. Looking further ahead, projections for year-end 2025 suggest that MUTM could reach up to $4, backed by the platform‚Äôs buy-and-distribute mechanism. This model allocates a portion of the protocol‚Äôs revenue to actively repurchase tokens from the open market and redistribute them to mtToken holders. This creates sustainable demand without relying on inflationary emissions‚Äîoffering both price strength and long-term participation benefits. A move from $0.025 to $4 reflects a 15,900% increase, positioning MUTM among the top contenders for high-ROI crypto investments this year. The platform is also undergoing a CertiK audit, one of the most trusted security verification processes in DeFi. This not only brings added credibility to the protocol but also reassures new investors that the team is focused on long-term integrity and transparency. Beyond development and audit preparation, the team has already launched a live dashboard, giving users a view into protocol progress, presale data, and roadmap updates. It‚Äôs a level of clarity not often found in new crypto coins‚Äîand a sign that Mutuum is prioritizing trust from day one. Solana and Chainlink remain compelling for their roles in infrastructure and scalability, with solid forecasts for the months ahead. But when it comes to ROI potential, Mutuum Finance is standing out for one major reason‚Äîit hasn‚Äôt launched yet, and everything is still on the table. With a product already in progress, a committed roadmap, and a presale structure designed for early growth, MUTM is quickly being recognized as one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now. Analysts say that once listings and platform functionality go live, demand could rise significantly‚Äîand so could the price. As Q3 approaches, the real winners might not be the ones making headlines today, but the ones laying the groundwork for sustainable use tomorrow. That‚Äôs exactly where Mutuum Finance fits in.

Bitcoin Unrealized Loss Hasn‚Äôt Spiked For Long-Term Holders Yet In its latest weekly report, Glassnode has discussed about the trend in the Unrealized Loss for the two major Bitcoin cohorts. The ‚ÄúUnrealized Loss‚Äù is an on-chain indicator that measures the total amount of loss that the BTC addresses as a whole are carrying. The metric works by going through the transfer history of each coin in circulation to see what price it was last moved at. If this previous trading price is more than the current spot price for any token, then that particular token‚Äôs assumed to be holding a net loss. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Cap Sets New Record, But Momentum Fades The indicator takes the difference between the two prices to find the exact measure of this loss. It then adds up this value for all coins part of the circulating supply to find the network total. In the context of the current topic, the usual version of the Unrealized Loss isn‚Äôt the one of interest, but rather a new variant known as the Unrealized Loss per Percent Drawdown. As the analytics firm explains, As the market continues to contract, it‚Äôs reasonable to expect the absolute size of unrealized losses to grow. To account for this and normalize across drawdowns of varying magnitudes, we introduce a new variant of the metric:¬†Unrealized Loss per Percent Drawdown, which expresses losses held in BTC terms relative to the percentage decline from the all-time high. First, here is a chart that shows the trend in this Bitcoin indicator specifically for the short-term holders: ‚ÄúShort-term holders‚Äù (STHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. BTC is currently trading under the levels that it was at during most of this window, so these holders would majorly be in a state of loss. The Unrealized Loss per Percent Drawdown showcases this trend, as its value has shot up recently. Interestingly, the indicator is already at a high-enough level to be comparable with values seen during the start of previous bear markets. While the STHs are in substantial losses, the same isn‚Äôt true for the other side of the market: the ‚Äúlong-term holders‚Äù (LTHs). These investors, who have been holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago, are carrying no unrealized loss at all right now. In the past, the LTHs have generally seen their loss spike up during the transition to a bear market. As the report notes, Historically, substantial expansions in unrealized losses among long-term holders have often marked the confirmation of bear market conditions, albeit with a delay following the market peak. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Still Close To Extreme Fear‚ÄîGreen Sign For Recovery? So far, this signal hasn‚Äôt appeared for Bitcoin. Something to keep in mind, though, is the fact that the top buyers will soon promote into the LTHs. Once that happens, the loss among the group is probable to register an increase. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen a pause in the recovery rally as its price has taken to sideways movement around $85,000.

It‚Äôs a rollercoaster, isn‚Äôt it? One day you‚Äôre soaring with excitement, the next you‚Äôre bracing for a dip. To navigate these waves, seasoned crypto enthusiasts often turn to market sentiment indicators. One such crucial tool is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . Let‚Äôs dive into the latest reading: the index has inched up to 33, a three-point rise from yesterday. Sounds like good news, right? Well, hold your horses! Despite this slight improvement, the index is still firmly planted in the ‚ÄòFear‚Äô zone. What does this mean for your crypto portfolio and the overall market? Let‚Äôs break it down. Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Think of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index as a sentiment compass for the cryptocurrency market. It‚Äôs not just a random number; it‚Äôs a weighted compilation of various market indicators, meticulously crafted by Alternative.me. This index helps us understand the overarching emotions driving the crypto market ‚Äì are investors feeling greedy, potentially leading to inflated prices, or fearful, possibly signaling a buying opportunity? The scale ranges from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear ‚Äì This zone often indicates a potential bottom in the market, where investors are excessively worried, and prices might be undervalued. 25-49: Fear ‚Äì Still a bearish sentiment, suggesting caution among investors. Prices might be under pressure or consolidating. 50-74: Greed ‚Äì A bullish sentiment emerges as investors become optimistic. This can lead to price appreciation. 75-100: Extreme Greed ‚Äì This zone signals a potential market top or bubble territory. Euphoria reigns, and prices might be overvalued, prone to corrections. Currently sitting at 33, the index reflects a state of ‚ÄòFear‚Äô in the crypto market sentiment . While it‚Äôs a notch above ‚ÄòExtreme Fear‚Äô, it‚Äôs still far from neutral or greedy territory. This suggests that a significant portion of the market remains apprehensive about the immediate future of cryptocurrencies. What Factors Drive the Fear and Greed Index? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index isn‚Äôt based on guesswork. It‚Äôs a data-driven metric that analyzes six key factors, each contributing a specific weight to the final score. Understanding these components is crucial to interpreting the index effectively: Factor Weight Description Volatility 25% Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, compared with the corresponding average values of the last 30 and 90 days. Unusually high volatility can contribute to fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares the current market momentum and trading volume to the last 30 and 90-day averages. High buying volume can indicate greed, while low volume during price drops can signal fear. Social Media Sentiment 15% Analyzes social media platforms for sentiment related to cryptocurrencies. Positive sentiment can indicate greed, while negative sentiment can reflect fear. Surveys 15% Periodically conducted crypto polls to gauge investor sentiment directly. These surveys provide a snapshot of how crypto traders and investors are feeling. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance relative to the broader crypto market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a ‚Äòflight to safety‚Äô during fearful times. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google Trends data for crypto-related search queries. Surges in searches like ‚ÄúBitcoin crash‚Äù can indicate fear, while increased searches for ‚Äúbuy Bitcoin‚Äù might suggest greed. By combining these diverse data points, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index provides a holistic view of market sentiment, moving beyond just price action. Why Does the ‚ÄòFear‚Äô Zone Persist Despite the Index Rise? It‚Äôs interesting that the index nudged upwards, yet remains in ‚ÄòFear‚Äô. This seemingly contradictory situation highlights the nuances of market analysis and sentiment interpretation. A three-point increase is indeed a move in the positive direction, suggesting a slight easing of bearishness. However, it‚Äôs crucial to remember: Small Increments in Sentiment: A three-point rise, while statistically significant, is relatively small in the grand scheme of the 0-100 scale. It might indicate a temporary reprieve rather than a fundamental shift in market psychology. Lagging Indicators: Sentiment indices often react to, rather than predict, market movements. The slight increase could be a delayed reaction to some positive price action or news from the previous day, which might not be sustained. Broader Economic Concerns: The overall global economic climate, including inflation, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical uncertainties, heavily influences crypto market sentiment . These macroeconomic factors can override short-term positive crypto-specific news, keeping fear levels elevated. Specific Crypto Events: Events within the crypto space itself, such as regulatory announcements, exchange hacks, or project-specific failures, can quickly trigger fear, offsetting any minor improvements in general sentiment. Therefore, while the slight increase in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a positive tick, it‚Äôs essential to view it within the context of the broader market landscape. The ‚ÄòFear‚Äô zone persistence suggests underlying anxieties still dominate investor thinking. Actionable Insights: Navigating the ‚ÄòFear‚Äô Zone So, what should you do when the Crypto Fear and Greed Index signals ‚ÄòFear‚Äô? Here are some actionable insights for crypto investors: Exercise Caution, But Don‚Äôt Panic: ‚ÄòFear‚Äô doesn‚Äôt automatically mean a market crash is imminent. It simply indicates prevailing negative sentiment. Avoid impulsive selling based solely on fear. Review Your Portfolio: Periods of fear can be opportune times to reassess your crypto holdings. Are your investments still aligned with your long-term goals? Is your portfolio diversified enough to weather potential downturns? Look for Buying Opportunities (Carefully): As the adage goes, ‚Äúbe fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.‚Äù ‚ÄòFear‚Äô zones can present potential buying opportunities for fundamentally strong cryptocurrencies at discounted prices. However, thorough research is paramount. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): In a fearful market, DCA can be a prudent strategy. Instead of trying to time the bottom, DCA involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, averaging out your entry price over time. Stay Informed and Analyze: Don‚Äôt rely solely on the Fear and Greed Index. Stay updated on market news, technical analysis, and fundamental developments in the crypto space. Use the index as one tool in your broader market analysis toolkit. Remember, market sentiment is cyclical. Fear phases are often followed by periods of greed, and vice versa. Understanding and strategically navigating these cycles is key to long-term success in the crypto market. Conclusion: Cautious Optimism in a Fearful Market The Crypto Fear and Greed Index at 33, remaining in ‚ÄòFear‚Äô, paints a picture of cautious crypto market sentiment . While the slight uptick is a glimmer of positivity, it‚Äôs not yet a signal to throw caution to the wind. The market remains influenced by a complex interplay of factors, from macroeconomic uncertainties to crypto-specific events. For investors, this environment calls for a balanced approach: prudence, diligent research, and a long-term perspective. The ‚ÄòFear‚Äô zone can be challenging, but it also presents opportunities for those who are prepared and informed. Keep a close eye on market indicators, stay adaptable, and remember that sentiment is always in flux in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

43478679,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150665,1744962033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Safeguarding Wyoming Stablecoin: How Language Tweaks Can Avoid SEC Security Tag,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/wyoming-stablecoin-sec-regulation-fix/,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, states are stepping up to carve their niche. Wyoming, known for its crypto-friendly stance, is now proactively refining the language surrounding its state-backed stablecoin, WYST. Why? To ensure it neatly sidesteps any potential classification as a security by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Let‚Äôs dive into Wyoming‚Äôs strategic move and what it means for the future of state-level digital currencies. Why is Wyoming Fixing its Wyoming Stablecoin Language? The Wyoming Stable Token Commission isn‚Äôt just sitting back; they‚Äôre actively working to preempt any regulatory hurdles. Their goal is clear: to launch the WYST stablecoin, pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, by July 2025. But in the current regulatory landscape, especially with the SEC‚Äôs increased scrutiny over digital assets, proactive measures are crucial. During an April 17th meeting, commissioners openly discussed strategies to minimize crypto security risks. This isn‚Äôt just about compliance; it‚Äôs about ensuring the smooth operation and adoption of WYST. A follow-up memo in May is expected to further detail these strategic language adjustments. This forward-thinking approach is vital because: Clarity is Key: Precise language can be the difference between regulatory green light and red flag. By clarifying the token‚Äôs characteristics, Wyoming aims to ensure WYST is recognized for its intended purpose ‚Äì a stable means of exchange, not an investment security. Avoiding SEC Scrutiny: The SEC‚Äôs classification of a digital asset as a security carries significant regulatory baggage. Wyoming wants to avoid this, ensuring WYST can operate without facing stringent securities regulations that could hinder its utility and adoption. Smooth Launch and Adoption: By addressing potential regulatory concerns upfront, Wyoming is paving the way for a smoother launch and wider acceptance of WYST within and potentially beyond the state. Navigating SEC Guidance : What‚Äôs the Real Concern? The elephant in the room is always the SEC. While clarity on SEC guidance specifically for state-backed stablecoins might still be evolving, the general principles of how the SEC classifies digital assets are well-established. The core concern revolves around the Howey Test, which determines if an asset is an investment contract and thus a security. Key factors the SEC considers include: Investment of Money: Is there an investment of money involved? In the case of stablecoins pegged to fiat, this aspect is nuanced but still relevant. Common Enterprise: Is there a common enterprise where investors pool their money? For WYST, the structure and operation will need to clearly define this aspect. Expectation of Profits: Is there an expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others? This is where Wyoming needs to be particularly careful. Stablecoins are designed for stability, not profit generation in the traditional sense. Wyoming‚Äôs language refinement is likely aimed at ensuring WYST‚Äôs structure and marketing materials clearly emphasize its utility as a stable medium of exchange, rather than an investment vehicle promising profits. This delicate balance is crucial in the eyes of regulators. Stablecoin Regulation Landscape: GENIUS and STABLE Acts on the Horizon Wyoming isn‚Äôt operating in a vacuum. Federal efforts to regulate stablecoins are gaining momentum. The commission is closely monitoring proposed legislation like the GENIUS and STABLE Acts. Understanding these acts provides crucial context to Wyoming‚Äôs proactive stance on stablecoin regulation . Let‚Äôs break down these proposed acts: Act Name Key Focus Potential Impact on WYST GENIUS Act (Guidance, Education, and National Initiatives for Understanding Stablecoins Act) Focuses on research and reporting on stablecoins, mandating studies on their use and risks. Indirect impact. Could shape the broader regulatory understanding of stablecoins, potentially influencing future SEC stances. STABLE Act (Stablecoin Taxonomy Act of 2022) Aims to regulate stablecoin issuers more like banks, requiring them to obtain banking charters and adhere to federal banking regulations. Potentially significant. If passed, WYST might need to comply with federal banking regulations, impacting its operational structure. Wyoming‚Äôs current moves could be seen as preemptive adaptation. These acts, along with other potential federal regulations, underscore the increasing regulatory attention on stablecoins. Wyoming‚Äôs efforts to clarify WYST‚Äôs language are not just about addressing current SEC guidance , but also about future-proofing its stablecoin against potential federal mandates. WYST: Wyoming‚Äôs State-Backed Crypto and Crypto Security Considerations WYST, at its core, represents Wyoming‚Äôs ambition to be a leader in the digital asset space. A state-backed stablecoin could offer several potential benefits: Enhanced Financial Innovation: WYST could foster innovation within Wyoming‚Äôs financial ecosystem, providing a digital dollar alternative for businesses and residents. Reduced Transaction Costs: Utilizing blockchain technology, WYST could potentially offer faster and cheaper transactions compared to traditional payment systems within the state. State Revenue Generation: While not the primary goal, successful implementation and adoption could indirectly benefit Wyoming‚Äôs economy. However, with innovation comes responsibility, especially in crypto security . Ensuring the security and stability of WYST is paramount. This includes: Robust Technology Infrastructure: Building a secure and scalable blockchain infrastructure to support WYST transactions. Transparency and Audits: Regular audits and transparent reporting to maintain public trust and demonstrate the peg to the U.S. dollar is consistently maintained. Compliance with Regulations: Navigating not just SEC concerns, but also broader financial regulations related to anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. Wyoming‚Äôs proactive language adjustments are a testament to their commitment to responsible innovation. By addressing potential regulatory hurdles head-on, they are not just safeguarding WYST, but also setting a precedent for other states exploring state-backed digital currencies. Conclusion: Wyoming‚Äôs Calculated Steps in the Stablecoin Arena Wyoming‚Äôs strategic approach to refining the language around its WYST stablecoin is a masterclass in proactive regulatory engagement. By anticipating potential SEC guidance and closely monitoring federal stablecoin regulation efforts, Wyoming is demonstrating a commitment to responsible innovation in the digital asset space. Their focus on crypto security and clarity is not just about launching a stablecoin; it‚Äôs about building a sustainable and compliant digital financial ecosystem within the state. As Wyoming moves closer to its July 2025 launch target, the crypto world will be watching closely, learning from their carefully calculated steps in navigating the complex regulatory landscape of digital currencies.

Technical indicators give out a neutral hint, whereby the price charts show support for the bulls. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically tailored for rapid and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The extent of adoption and Ripple‚Äôs strides in forging strategic partnerships are pivotal in shaping XRP‚Äôs value trajectory. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as the buying influx was abruptly taken, recovering the price to $2.084 during the day. The RSI increased up to 47.43 at the same time but remains in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $3.14 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to double. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP‚Äôs price action, a surge to $5 by the middle of next year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it‚Äôs crucial to remember that XRP‚Äôs all-time high stands at $3.84, achieved on January 7, 2018. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple‚Äôs price prediction, XRP has a lesser chance of reaching $20 by 2031. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $16.69 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Ripple‚Äôs USD-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, has hit a record high market cap of $170 million, according to the firm‚Äôs attestation report for February by Ripple‚Äôs Senior Vice President, Jack McDonald. According to analysts, the stablecoin is eyeing a top five spot in the industry. Read more about it here . Pro-XRP attorney John Deaton has called on the SEC to release the Inspector General (IG) report on William Hinman‚Äôs speech in 2018. The lawyer has urged SEC officials Paul Atkins, Mark Uyeda, and Hester Peirce to push for the release, as he called out the SEC for holding on to the report for too long. Have a detailed look at the news here . XRP price prediction April 2025 According to XRP price prediction, in April 2025, XRP could reach a maximum price of $2.82.

XRP historic price sentiment Before 2017, the asset‚Äôs value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. XRP price history Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of¬†2020 pushed the coin‚Äôs value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC¬†announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March. At the start of April, XRP is trading near the $2.1 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-18 07:45:00

The dispute centers on ‚ÄúLe Nez,‚Äù a sculpture Geffen acquired in a 2022 deal valued at approximately $65 million in artwork and cash. Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, originally purchased the piece at a Sotheby‚Äôs auction in 2021 for $78 million, with the help of his then-art adviser, Xiong Zihan Sydney. Le Nez. Source: Fondation Giacomett Justin Sun Alleges Trusted Adviser Stole Sculpture Sold to David Geffen Sun‚Äôs February lawsuit alleges that Xiong stole the sculpture and sold it to Geffen without his authorization. But in a 100-page filing on April 16, Geffen fired back, calling the suit a ‚Äúsham‚Äù and accusing Sun of fabricating the claim after being unable to resell the two artworks he received in exchange for the sculpture. Geffen also claims he paid Sun an additional $10.5 million in cash as part of the deal. ‚ÄúSun‚Äôs claims are utterly without merit and represent a bad-faith attempt to interfere with Geffen‚Äôs lawful ownership of the sculpture,‚Äù the countersuit states. Geffen suggests that Sun, under financial strain following a series of crypto market crashes and multimillion-dollar hacks targeting his exchanges Poloniex and HTX, attempted to reclaim the artwork as part of a broader effort to recover losses. The case raises several key disputes, including whether Xiong admitted to theft, inconsistencies in the amount allegedly stolen, and whether Sun is still in possession of the exchanged paintings and funds, which Geffen asserts are being held by dealers. 5/ Sun‚Äôs Empire = Cracking ‚Äì Tron is ultra-centralized, mostly Sun-controlled ‚Äì Poloniex hasn‚Äôt paid users back ‚Äì HTX volume down 60% since 2023 This isn‚Äôt FUD ‚Äî the cracks are already showing. pic.twitter.com/PA92uqlv3B ‚Äî BTC_Chopsticks (@BTC_Chopsticks) April 18, 2025 Geffen‚Äôs filing further alleges a pattern of misconduct by Sun, referencing lawsuits filed by former employees who claimed they were punished for refusing to engage in unethical or illegal business practices.

In response, Sun‚Äôs legal counsel, William Charron, strongly rejected Geffen‚Äôs narrative. ‚ÄúMs. Xiong confessed to the theft, was arrested in China, and is currently in detention,‚Äù Charron told ArtNet . He dismissed Geffen‚Äôs version as ‚Äúextremely misguided‚Äù and maintained that Xiong acted independently of Sun.

In another development, Sun has also claimed that First Digital Trust, the entity overseeing FDUSD, was involved in the misappropriation of nearly $500 million. He alleged that First Digital, in partnership with entities such as Dubai-based Aria DMCC, misled FDUSD‚Äôs issuer into wiring funds to an unrelated third party. However, earlier this week, First Digital Labs published a new attestation report confirming that its FDUSD stablecoin remains fully backed by reserves, even as it faces fraud accusations from Tron founder Justin Sun.

In a detailed post on April 17 , Li described how attackers used prerecorded videos of familiar individuals to impersonate them in what appeared to be a legitimate meeting. Li said the video feed showed recognizable faces with cameras turned on, adding to the illusion of authenticity. No Audio, Fake Update However, he noticed the audio was missing, and the participants prompted him to download a suspicious script file under the guise of a Zoom update. ‚ÄúI could see their legit faces.

Last year, a detailed report by blockchain security firm SlowMist revealed that a sophisticated phishing attack disguised as a fake Zoom meeting link has stolen crypto assets worth millions. The scam, first identified on November 14, 2024, targeted users by distributing malicious software through links that mimic the legitimate Zoom interface. In March, Kaito AI, an artificial intelligence-driven platform providing crypto market analysis, and its founder, Yu Hu, were targeted in a social media hack on X .

Think of it as a toolbox for programmers who want to create Bitcoin wallets, manage transactions, or build apps that interact with the Bitcoin blockchain . Since its launch, it‚Äôs been downloaded over 1 million times, showing just how widely trusted and used it is in the crypto community. Here‚Äôs what Bitcoinlib does in a nutshell: Creates and manages wallets: It lets developers build Bitcoin wallets to store, send and receive Bitcoin securely. Handles transactions: It simplifies the process of creating, signing and broadcasting Bitcoin transactions. Supports multiple networks: Bitcoinlib works with Bitcoin‚Äôs main network (where real money is involved) and test networks (for experimenting without risk). Open-source and flexible: Being open-source , anyone can use, modify or contribute to its code, making it a go-to for developers worldwide. For beginners, Bitcoinlib is like a user-friendly bridge to Bitcoin‚Äôs complex world. Instead of wrestling with the blockchain‚Äôs technical details, developers can use Bitcoinlib‚Äôs ready-made functions to get things done quickly. For example, this library automates tricky tasks like generating private keys or signing transactions, saving developers hours of coding. Bitcoinlib under fire: How PyPI typosquatting put crypto wallets at risk In early April 2025, security researchers raised alarms about a malicious attack targeting Bitcoinlib users. Hackers didn‚Äôt attack the Bitcoinlib library itself but instead used a sneaky trick to fool developers into downloading fake versions of the library. This attack involved uploading malicious packages to PyPI, the platform where developers download Python libraries like Bitcoinlib. For developers and enthusiasts, tools like Bitcoinlib make it easier to interact with Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain, create wallets , and build applications. But with great power comes great responsibility ‚Äî and unfortunately, great risk. The 2025 Software Supply Chain Security Report by ReversingLabs reveals that software supply chain attacks grew more sophisticated in 2024, with particular intensity around cryptocurrency applications. The report highlights 23 malicious campaigns targeting crypto infrastructure, primarily through open-source repositories like npm and PyPI (Python Package Index). Attackers employed both basic typosquatting and advanced tactics, such as creating legitimate-looking packages that were later updated with malicious code. Examples include the ‚Äúaiocpa‚Äù package, which initially appeared benign but was later weaponized to compromise wallets, and the attack on Solana‚Äôs web3.js library. ReversingLabs calls cryptocurrency a ‚Äúcanary in the coal mine,‚Äù noting that the financial incentives make crypto platforms an attractive target ‚Äî and a preview of future threats to other industries. The report urges organizations to move beyond trust-based assumptions, especially when dealing with third-party or closed-source binaries. Let‚Äôs break down how it happened and why it‚Äôs a big deal. How hackers targeted Bitcoinlib Here‚Äôs a step-by-step look at the attack: Fake packages uploaded to PyPI: Hackers created two fake Python packages called ‚Äúbitcoinlibdbfix‚Äù and ‚Äúbitcoinlib-dev.‚Äù These names were deliberately chosen to sound legitimate, tricking developers into thinking they were updates or fixes for the real Bitcoinlib. Masquerading as solutions: The fake packages were marketed as solutions to a supposed issue with Bitcoinlib that caused error messages during Bitcoin transfers. Developers, eager to fix their code, downloaded these packages without suspecting foul play. Malware embedded in the code: Once installed, the fake packages unleashed wallet-draining malware . This malware replaced a legitimate command-line tool (called clw) with a malicious version. The fake tool was designed to steal sensitive data, such as private keys and wallet addresses, which are the keys to accessing and moving Bitcoin. Stealing crypto assets: With private keys in hand, hackers could access victims‚Äô Bitcoin wallets and transfer funds to their own accounts. Since Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, victims had little chance of recovering their money. Thankfully, security researchers used machine learning to spot the malware. By analyzing patterns in the fake packages, they identified the threat and warned the community, helping to limit the damage. Why does this attack matter? This hack wasn‚Äôt about breaking Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain (which remains secure) but about exploiting human trust. Developers who downloaded the fake packages thought they were getting the real library and ended up with malware that could wipe out their Bitcoin ( BTC ) savings. It‚Äôs a reminder that even trusted platforms like PyPI can be used for scams if you‚Äôre not careful. How typosquatting made the Bitcoinlib attack so effective The Bitcoinlib attack worked because of a tactic called typosquatting . This is when hackers create fake package names that look almost identical to the real ones (like ‚Äúbitcoinlibdbfix‚Äù instead of ‚Äúbitcoinlib‚Äù). Developers, especially those in a rush, might not notice the difference. Here‚Äôs why this trick was so effective: Trust in PyPI: PyPI is the go-to place for Python libraries , so developers assume packages there are safe. Clever naming: The fake packages sounded like official updates, making them seem legitimate. Targeting beginners: New developers, less familiar with spotting scams, were more likely to fall for it. The attack also highlights a broader issue: Open-source platforms rely on community oversight, but they can‚Äôt catch every bad actor. Hackers know this and use it to their advantage. New to crypto? Here‚Äôs what the Bitcoinlib incident teaches about staying safe If you‚Äôre new to crypto, the Bitcoinlib hack might sound scary, but it‚Äôs not a reason to avoid Bitcoin or development tools. Instead, it‚Äôs a chance to learn how to stay safe in a space that‚Äôs full of opportunities ‚Äî and risks. Bitcoinlib is still one of the ways to dip your toes into blockchain development, as long as you take precautions. Here‚Äôs why this matters for you (as a beginner): Crypto is growing: With Bitcoin‚Äôs value soaring and governments exploring digital currencies , learning tools like Bitcoinlib can open doors to exciting careers. Security is key: Understanding scams now will make you a smarter, safer crypto user in the future. Community power: The crypto world thrives on collaboration. By staying informed, you can help protect others from scams. Bitcoinlib is a game-changer for developers who want to explore Bitcoin‚Äôs potential. It‚Äôs easy to use, powerful and backed by a vibrant community. But as the Bitcoinlib attack showed, even the best tools can be targeted by hackers if you‚Äôre not careful. By sticking to trusted sources, double-checking package names and keeping security first, you can use Bitcoinlib to build amazing things without worry. The crypto world is full of surprises ‚Äî some good, others not so good. The Bitcoinlib hack reminds one to stay curious but cautious. Whether you‚Äôre coding your first wallet or just learning about Bitcoin, take it one step at a time, and you‚Äôll be ready to navigate this exciting space like a pro. Have you used Bitcoinlib before, or are you thinking about trying it? During your engagement with Bitcoinlib, if you come across anything suspicious, don‚Äôt stay silent ‚Äî spread the word. In a decentralized world, community awareness is one of the strongest defenses. How to protect yourself from similar crypto hacks If you‚Äôre a developer or crypto user worried about falling for scams like this, don‚Äôt panic. Here are some beginner-friendly tips to stay safe: Double-check package names: Always verify the exact name of the package you‚Äôre downloading. For Bitcoinlib, stick to the official package (just ‚Äúbitcoinlib‚Äù) and avoid anything with extra words like ‚Äúfix‚Äù or ‚Äúdev.‚Äù Use trusted sources: Download libraries only from reputable platforms like PyPI‚Äôs official site, and check user reviews or download counts to gauge trustworthiness. Keep software updated: Regularly update your Python environment and libraries to avoid bugs that hackers could exploit. Use antivirus software: A good antivirus can catch malware before it causes harm, even if you accidentally download a bad package. Store private keys safely: Never store private keys on your computer or in code. Use a hardware wallet (like a Ledger or Trezor ) for extra security. Learn to spot scams: If a package claims to fix an urgent issue or seems too good to be true, take a moment to research it. Google the package name or check crypto forums for warnings. Above all, the lesson is clear for Bitcoinlib users: Stick to the official package and verify everything. For the broader crypto world, this attack underscores the need for better security on open-source platforms.",Bitcoinlib,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|WALLET,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-18 07:50:00

Bittensor ( TAO ) hit an intraday high of $259.2 during Asian trading hours, according to crypto.news, while daily trading volume jumped over 42% to more than $113 million, signaling renewed interest from traders. The gains followed news that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang visited Beijing this week and met with Chinese trade officials. During the visit, Huang reaffirmed the company‚Äôs commitment to the region, saying Nvidia would ‚Äúspare no effort‚Äù to build compliant products and ‚Äúunswervingly serve the Chinese market.‚Äù This comes after the U.S. blocked exports of Nvidia‚Äôs H20 chip to China, a model designed specifically to comply with earlier export limits. The policy reversal could cost Nvidia a projected $5.5 billion in revenue and has already led to a 7% drop in its stock price as of Wednesday. Following Nvidia‚Äôs confirmation of its continued commitment to China, the broader AI market also reacted positively, rising nearly 4% over the past day. Besides TAO, other top AI coins such as Near Protocol ( NEAR ) recorded a 3.1% gain, while Internet Computer ( ICP ), Render ( RENDER ), FET, and Arweave ( AR ) posted gains between 4% and 9%. These projects often react to Nvidia-related developments , given the chipmaker‚Äôs key role in powering the AI infrastructure many of them rely on.

For that reason, they are now scrambling to rework once reliable supply chains. While many companies, such as Nvidia, will look to manufacture in the US, they will also look to manufacture in whichever jurisdiction is best suited to create specific products, as well as wherever tariffs do not eat too much profit,‚Äù he added. TAO price analysis Nvidia‚Äôs recent move has clearly been taken as a bullish cue by traders, with TAO‚Äôs open interest surging over 20% in the last 24 hours. According to Santiment data, its weighted social sentiment also turned positive during the same period. On the 1-day TAO/USDT chart, the token has successfully reclaimed the $218 support level, which has been acting as a key support level on multiple occasions in the past. TAO price, MACD and RSI chart ‚Äî April 18 | Source: crypto.news According to market commentator Bitcoinsensus, TAO has formed a double-bottom pattern on the weekly chart, a formation often seen as a trend reversal signal. A confirmed breakout above the pattern‚Äôs neckline could open the path toward a medium-term price target of $1,330, according to the analyst. Looking back at the daily chart, TAO also seems to be breaking out of a multi-month falling wedge setup, another bullish reversal sign. With the pattern nearing convergence, the recent breakout suggests sellers are losing control. If the move holds, it could trigger a sustained uptrend, with momentum already backing the breakout. TAO‚Äôs RSI has climbed above 55, and its MACD lines have formed a bullish crossover. Therefore, the initial target will likely be at $470, which is up by 82% above the current level. Some analysts have set even more ambitious price targets. Per trader , Crypto General TAO could continue $760 as the next major psychological resistance, with a secondary target at $1,340 should strong bullish momentum persist.

RWA: From Hype to Infrastructure Real-world asset (RWA) crypto projects have been a major topic of discussion in recent years, but according to Ejodame, 2024 marked a turning point. Major asset managers like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton began to reveal the depth of their tokenization strategies, many of which had been years in the making. ‚ÄúThe winners last year were money market funds tokenizing treasury assets,‚Äù Ejodame observed. But looking forward, he believes stablecoins are poised to dominate the RWA conversation. While often overlooked in this context, he argues stablecoins are ‚Äúthe ultimate real-world asset‚Äù due to their utility in global financial rails. Another area he highlighted is the tokenization of private credit markets. A new product, a tokenized collateralized loan obligation with secondary trading capabilities, is expected to launch soon. This move could mark a new phase in blockchain adoption within institutional finance. On the retail front, Ejodame emphasized accessibility. Through tokenized equities, individuals in emerging markets can gain fractional exposure to publicly traded companies like Tesla or Google‚Äîan opportunity previously out of reach. The focus, he explained, is on enabling everyday investors in countries like Nigeria, Argentina, or the Philippines to invest in global markets for as little as $10. The Role of INX in a Broader Ecosystem Though the conversation was not promotional in nature, Ejodame briefly addressed INX‚Äôs recent acquisition by Republic. While the deal awaits regulatory approval, it represents a notable moment in the digital asset space. INX, previously a publicly listed company in Canada, had established itself as an end-to-end digital asset service provider‚Äîfrom token issuance to listing and dividend distribution. The acquisition by Republic, a firm known for its crowdfunding footprint in both the U.S. and Europe, opens up new possibilities for integrated, global capital markets infrastructure. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre combining capabilities,‚Äù Ejodame noted, ‚Äúand creating an ecosystem that supports the full lifecycle of a digital asset‚Äîfrom advisory and issuance to trading and distribution.‚Äù Conclusion From regulatory clarity in the U.S. to institutional breakthroughs in private credit, and increased access for retail investors globally, the RWA narrative is no longer theoretical. Bob Ejodame‚Äôs insights offer a confirmation of a rapidly maturing market where real-world assets are becoming central to the next wave of blockchain adoption.

Threshold Network (T), a key player in decentralized privacy and bridging solutions, has just dropped some thrilling news. They‚Äôre not just sitting still; they‚Äôre actively reshaping their future with a strategic network restructuring and a significant T token buyback initiative. This isn‚Äôt just routine maintenance; it‚Äôs a bold move designed to supercharge the network‚Äôs efficiency and pave the way for exciting reinvestment opportunities. Let‚Äôs dive into what this all means for the Threshold Network and the wider crypto community. What‚Äôs the Buzz Around Threshold Network Restructuring? In a nutshell, Threshold Network is hitting the refresh button on its operational framework. Why? To become leaner, more agile, and ultimately, more effective. Think of it like decluttering your digital workspace ‚Äì getting rid of unnecessary expenses and focusing on what truly drives value. According to their official announcement via Chainwire, this network restructuring is primarily aimed at: Cutting Annual Operational Expenses: Streamlining operations to save costs. This is crucial for any project aiming for long-term sustainability in the volatile crypto landscape. Halting Treasury Sales of T Tokens: No more selling pressure from the treasury! This signals confidence in the T token‚Äôs future value and reduces potential market supply. Accumulating T Tokens via Buybacks: This is the exciting part. Threshold Network is actively buying back T tokens from the market. This can potentially increase demand and positively impact the token‚Äôs price. These changes aren‚Äôt just cosmetic; they represent a fundamental shift towards a more robust and economically sound Threshold Network. It‚Äôs a clear signal that the team is serious about long-term growth and value creation for its community. The Power of a Crypto Buyback: Why is Threshold Network Doing This? A crypto buyback , especially in the current market, is a powerful statement. It‚Äôs like a company buying back its own stock ‚Äì it often indicates undervaluation and a belief in future growth. For Threshold Network, the T token buyback serves multiple strategic purposes: Demonstrates Confidence: By investing in their own token, Threshold Network is showing strong faith in the project‚Äôs potential and future success. This can boost investor confidence and attract new participants. Reduces Token Supply: Buybacks reduce the circulating supply of T tokens. Basic economics tells us that with reduced supply and stable or increasing demand, the price can potentially rise. Strategic Reinvestment Tool: The acquired T tokens can be strategically reinvested back into the network‚Äôs ecosystem. This could involve incentivizing community participation, funding development initiatives, or supporting ecosystem growth. While the exact scale of the buyback remains undisclosed, the very act of initiating it speaks volumes about Threshold Network‚Äôs strategic direction. It‚Äôs a proactive move to strengthen the token‚Äôs value proposition and reward its holders. Strategic Reinvestment: Fueling Future Growth in the DeFi Space The restructuring and buyback are not isolated events; they are part of a larger strategy focused on DeFi reinvestment . Threshold Network is positioning itself to capitalize on the burgeoning Decentralized Finance (DeFi) landscape. How does this reinvestment manifest? Accruing tBTC: The Threshold DAO treasury will continue to accumulate tBTC (Threshold Bitcoin) through bridge fees. tBTC is a crucial component of their ecosystem, enabling Bitcoin to be used in the DeFi realm. Accumulating T Tokens: Through the buyback program, the treasury will also amass more T tokens. This dual accumulation strategy strengthens the DAO‚Äôs financial position and provides resources for future development. Focus on Core Technologies: With reduced operational expenses, Threshold Network can channel more resources into developing and enhancing its core technologies, such as tBTC and privacy-preserving solutions. This strategic reinvestment is about more than just financial maneuvering; it‚Äôs about building a stronger, more resilient, and more innovative Threshold Network within the DeFi ecosystem. They‚Äôre not just reacting to market conditions; they‚Äôre proactively shaping their future. What Does This Mean for T Token Holders? If you‚Äôre holding T tokens, this news is likely music to your ears. The restructuring and buyback initiative carries several potential benefits for T token holders: Potential Benefit Description Potential Price Appreciation Buybacks can reduce token supply, potentially leading to increased demand and price appreciation. Increased Confidence The buyback signals the team‚Äôs confidence in the project, which can boost investor sentiment and attract new buyers. Long-Term Value Growth Strategic reinvestment and cost efficiency measures contribute to the long-term health and growth of the Threshold Network, benefiting token holders over time. Stronger Ecosystem A more robust and efficient network with a healthy treasury benefits the entire ecosystem, including token holders who participate in governance or utilize network services. However, it‚Äôs crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile. While buybacks can be a positive catalyst, they are not a guaranteed path to price increases. Do your own research and consider your risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. Looking Ahead: Threshold Network‚Äôs Bold Future Threshold Network‚Äôs decision to restructure and implement a T token buyback is a significant step forward. It demonstrates a proactive approach to network management and a commitment to long-term sustainability and growth within the competitive DeFi landscape. By focusing on cost efficiency, strategic reinvestment, and strengthening the T token‚Äôs value proposition, Threshold Network is positioning itself for continued success and innovation. This move isn‚Äôt just about surviving market fluctuations; it‚Äôs about thriving and leading the charge in decentralized privacy and cross-chain solutions.

One of the factors is the burn rate explosion on a 24-hour scale. Ready for Liftoff? Despite its brief price increase towards the end of March, SHIB has been on an evident decline in the past 30 days. Currently, it trades at around $0.00001192 (per CoinGecko‚Äôs data), representing a 5% drop for the timeframe. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko However, some essential factors suggest a surge could be just around the corner. SHIB‚Äôs burn rate, for instance, has exploded by almost 2,000% in the last 24 hours, resulting in over 17.6 million tokens sent to a null address. Interestingly, a single transaction from a mysterious entity contributed to over 90% of the destroyed stash. The ultimate goal of the mechanism is to reduce the tremendous circulating supply of SHIB, thus potentially making it more valuable. Burning alone, though, doesn‚Äôt guarantee a stable price increase as it also requires a consistent or rising demand. Next on the list of possible price catalysts is the advancement of Shibarium. In the past weeks, daily transactions processed on the layer-2 blockchain solution have skyrocketed above three million, signaling strong user engagement and increased activity within the ecosystem. Shibarium supercharges the Shiba Inu ecosystem ‚Äì slashing fees, speeding up transactions, and burning SHIB along the way . As such, some believe its evolution could ignite fresh momentum for the price of the underlying token. Among the examples is the popular Bitcoin advocate Jeremie Davinci, who said : ‚ÄúI like Shiba Inu, as you know, and I think it will do relatively well in this cycle, but it may not go as high as you expect. I think Shiba Inu has a lot of utility now that they have Shibarium, and basically, it‚Äôs a chain that you can actually run all kinds of applications. However, nobody is using it, and there are no applications for using your tokens on Shibarium yet. If they get that solved , Shiba Inu will go to the moon.‚Äù Exchange Netflows SHIB‚Äôs exchange netflow is also worth observing. Outflows have been dominating inflows lately, suggesting holders are moving tokens off centralized platforms and into self-custody. This development could be considered bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure. Generally, when investors transfer their crypto holdings to exchanges, it is to dispose of them, and vice versa. SHIB Exchange Flows.

In its Q2 2025 investment outlook, Sygnum said the space has seen ‚Äúdrastically improved‚Äù regulations for crypto use cases, creating the foundations for a strong alt-sector rally for the second quarter. However, it added that ‚Äúnone of the positive developments have been priced in.‚Äù In April, Bitcoin dominance reached a four-year high, signaling that crypto investors are rotating their funds into an asset perceived to be relatively safer. Still, Sygnum said regulatory developments in the US, such as President Donald Trump‚Äôs establishment of a Digital Asset Stockpile and advancing stablecoin regulations, may propel broader crypto adoption. ‚ÄúWe expect protocols successful in gaining user traction to outperform and Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance to decline,‚Äù Sygnum wrote. Increased focus on economic value ignites competition Sygnum also said that competition would increase as the market focuses on economic value. Increased competition in a market often results in better products, ultimately benefiting consumers: ‚ÄúThe market‚Äôs increased focus on economic value compels greater competition for user growth and revenues, with rising protocols such as Toncoin, Sui, Aptos, Sonic, or Berachain taking different approaches.‚Äù Sygnum added that while high-performance blockchains address limitations of the Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana blockchains, they find it challenging to achieve meaningful adoption and fee income. Sector breakdown by market capitalization. Source: Sygnum The report highlighted that some approaches have been more sustainable. These include Berachain‚Äôs approach of incentivizing validators to provide liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, Sonic‚Äôs rewarding developers that attract and retain users, and Toncoin‚Äôs Telegram affiliation to access 1 billion users. Aside from layer-1 chains, Sygnum highlighted that layer-2 networks like Base also have potential. The report pointed out that while the memecoin frenzy on the blockchain pushed its users and revenue to new highs, it made an equally sharp decline after memecoins started losing steam. Despite this, Sygnum noted that Base remains the layer-2 leader in metrics like daily transactions, throughput and total value locked.

The crypto data company said memecoins had 27.1% of global investor interest, second only to artificial intelligence tokens, which had 35.7%. While retail investors are still busy with memecoins, institutions have a different approach. Asset manager Bitwise reported on April 14 that publicly traded firms are stacking Bitcoin.

The protocol allows users to make social media posts into tradable tokens, automatically minting them. After Base‚Äôs post was turned into a token, the crypto community quickly skyrocketed its market capitalization to $17 million. However, online reports showed that the memecoin collapsed by around 92% after the top holders, who owned 47% of the supply, sold the memecoin just over an hour after launching. Some community members noted that the token was ‚ÄúHORRIFICALLY sniped,‚Äù while on-chain data analytics platform Lookonchain highlighted that ‚Äú3 wallets bought a large amount of ‚ÄòBase is for everyone‚Äô before Base posted and sold them, making a profit of ~$666K.‚Äù As a result, the community criticized the network‚Äôs team for the memecoin, calling the incident a rug pull and asking them to ‚Äústop launching worthless tokens that will all inevitably go to 0.

Base‚Äôs Public Experiment Base responded to the backlash, clarifying they will never sell their holdings, but they weren‚Äôt an official network token either. The team explained that they posted on Zora because they believe everyone should bring content on-chain and use the tools that make it possible. Memes. Moments. Culture. If we want the future to be onchain, we have to be willing to experiment in public. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing. To be clear, Base will never sell these tokens, and ‚Äã‚Äãthese are not official network tokens for Base, Coinbase, or any other related product. The content we share is creative, and we‚Äôre going to keep bringing culture onchain. The public on-chain experimentation opened a debate about memecoin culture and on-chain content, with Base‚Äôs creator, Jesse Pollak, weighing in. In a series of X posts, Pollak explained that ‚Äúnot all coins are the same,‚Äù outlining the differences between these two types of tokens. Is On-Chain Content The Future For Creators? According to his posts, a contentcoin is one piece of content with singular value and no expectations. Additionally, multiple of them can be created by the same person, with ‚Äúbig ones‚Äù potentially turning into memes.

43480896,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150685,1744966850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Decoding the sUSD Depeg Crisis: Synthetix Founder‚Äôs Alarming ‚Äòkain.depeg‚Äô X Rebrand Signals Uncertainty,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/susd-depeg-synthetix-founder-uncertainty/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is once again buzzing with activity, but this time, it‚Äôs tinged with a hint of uncertainty . All eyes are on Synthetix, a prominent synthetic asset issuance platform built on the Ethereum network, and its founder, Kain Warwick. Why? Because Warwick has made a rather eyebrow-raising move ‚Äì he‚Äôs changed his X (formerly Twitter) handle to ‚Äòkain.depeg‚Äô. Yes, you read that right: ‚Äòkain.depeg‚Äô. What‚Äôs the Buzz About ‚Äòkain.depeg‚Äô and the sUSD Depeg? This name change isn‚Äôt just a quirky social media update; it‚Äôs a direct signal, a digital flare in the night, pointing towards a significant issue: the sUSD depeg . For those unfamiliar, sUSD is Synthetix‚Äôs stablecoin, designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. However, since late March, sUSD has been struggling to hold that peg, and the situation seems to be escalating. As of the latest data, sUSD is trading at approximately $0.6895 . That‚Äôs not just a minor wobble; it‚Äôs a substantial deviation from its intended $1 value. To put it in perspective, that‚Äôs a downward spiral of 12.25% in just the past day , according to CoinMarketCap. For a stablecoin, such volatility is anything but stable and raises serious questions about its underlying mechanisms and future. Why is the sUSD Depeg a Big Deal? The concept of a stablecoin is pretty straightforward: it‚Äôs a cryptocurrency designed to have a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. They are crucial for the DeFi ecosystem because they provide: Stability in Volatile Markets: Stablecoins act as a safe haven amidst the wild price swings often seen in the crypto market. They allow traders and investors to park their funds without exiting the crypto ecosystem entirely. Facilitation of Trading and Lending: Stablecoins are used extensively in trading pairs on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and as collateral in lending protocols. A depeg can disrupt these crucial functions. On-ramps and Off-ramps to Crypto: Stablecoins bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world, serving as easier entry and exit points. When a stablecoin like sUSD experiences a depeg , it undermines the trust in the entire system. Traders become wary, liquidity can dry up, and cascading effects can ripple through the DeFi space, potentially impacting other protocols and assets. Synthetix Founder‚Äôs ‚Äòkain.depeg‚Äô: A Cry for Help or a Bold Statement? Kain Warwick‚Äôs decision to change his X handle to ‚Äòkain.depeg‚Äô is undoubtedly a deliberate act. It‚Äôs a highly public way to acknowledge the elephant in the room ‚Äì the sUSD depeg . But what exactly is he trying to communicate? Transparency and Accountability: Changing his name to reflect the crisis could be seen as a move towards transparency. It‚Äôs a public declaration that he, as the founder, is aware of and taking responsibility for the situation. Urgency and Focus: The name change might signal a heightened focus on resolving the sUSD depeg . It‚Äôs a way to grab attention and rally the community and development team around the issue. A Call to Action: ‚Äòkain.depeg‚Äô could be interpreted as a call to action for the Synthetix community to come together and find solutions to restore sUSD‚Äôs peg. Potential Frustration or Despair: While less optimistic, it‚Äôs also possible that the name change reflects frustration or even despair at the severity of the situation. It could be an expression of the immense pressure he‚Äôs under. Regardless of the exact motivation, ‚Äòkain.depeg‚Äô has undeniably amplified the conversation around the sUSD depeg and put the spotlight squarely on Synthetix and its founder. Decoding the Reasons Behind the sUSD Stablecoin Crisis Understanding why sUSD is losing its peg is crucial. Stablecoin depegs can stem from various factors, often a combination of these: Liquidity Issues: Insufficient liquidity in the trading pools where sUSD is exchanged can lead to price slippage and difficulty in maintaining the peg. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: While less common, vulnerabilities in the smart contracts governing sUSD could be exploited, leading to instability. Market Sentiment and Panic Selling: Negative market sentiment or fear surrounding sUSD can trigger panic selling, further driving down its price. Algorithmic Instability: If sUSD relies on algorithmic mechanisms to maintain its peg (though Synthetix primarily uses over-collateralization), flaws in these algorithms can lead to depegging. Collateral Concerns: If there are doubts about the collateral backing sUSD or its accessibility, it can erode confidence and trigger a depeg. It‚Äôs essential to investigate the specific mechanisms behind sUSD and Synthetix to pinpoint the root cause of this stablecoin crisis . Is it a technical glitch, a market-driven panic, or a more fundamental flaw in the design? Navigating the Uncertainty: What‚Äôs Next for sUSD and Synthetix? The sUSD depeg presents significant challenges for Synthetix and its community. However, crises can also be catalysts for innovation and resilience. Here‚Äôs what to watch out for and consider: Synthetix Team‚Äôs Response: Keep a close eye on official announcements and actions from the Synthetix team. How are they addressing the depeg? What measures are they taking to restore the peg and confidence in sUSD? Community Proposals and Governance: Decentralized communities often play a vital role in resolving crises. Look for community proposals and governance votes aimed at stabilizing sUSD. Market Monitoring: Track the price of sUSD closely. Are there any signs of recovery? Monitor trading volumes and liquidity across different exchanges. Risk Management: If you are holding sUSD or using it in DeFi protocols, assess your risk exposure. Consider strategies to mitigate potential losses if the depeg persists or worsens. Learning from the Crisis: The sUSD depeg provides valuable lessons for the broader stablecoin ecosystem. It highlights the importance of robust mechanisms, transparency, and community resilience in maintaining stablecoin pegs. Conclusion: A Crypto Wake-Up Call? Kain Warwick‚Äôs ‚Äòkain.depeg‚Äô X handle is more than just a name change; it‚Äôs a symbol of the uncertainty currently gripping the sUSD stablecoin and the Synthetix ecosystem.

The post challenges the prevailing narrative that the lawsuit, filed in December 2020, was purely a matter of regulatory enforcement aimed at investor protection. Instead, it proposes that the lawsuit may have been strategically timed and executed to delay XRP‚Äôs rise as a low-cost, high-efficiency financial infrastructure that posed a direct threat to traditional banking institutions and SWIFT‚Äôs global payments network . WILD SEC LAWSUIT THEORY. What if the SEC‚Äôs case against Ripple wasn‚Äôt about investor protection‚Ä¶ but about protecting banks from losing billions in fees? Let‚Äôs follow the money, the timing, and the silence. You decide. pic.twitter.com/l1z25fjLsu ‚Äî All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) April 15, 2025 XRP‚Äôs Disruption and the Financial Threat to SWIFT The theory centers on several points, beginning with the SEC‚Äôs decision to sue Ripple and label XRP as an unregistered security. Following the announcement, XRP‚Äôs value plummeted by 66% in a single day, and Ripple lost significant business partnerships while exchanges began delisting the asset. At the time, XRP was facilitating approximately $70 billion in cross-border transactions every quarter, with each transaction costing just a few cents. This cost-efficiency sharply contrasted with traditional SWIFT wire transfers, which reportedly incurred fees between $20 and $50 per transaction, often accompanied by settlement delays stretching over several days. The Timing of the Lawsuit and the Role of Key Officials The tweet draws attention to the lawsuit timing, which was filed only days before then-SEC Chairman Jay Clayton resigned. It also highlights Clayton‚Äôs previous professional ties to major financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Barclays, through his former law firm. The commentator notes that Clayton‚Äôs wife was employed by Goldman Sachs and claims that various sources detailing these connections have been removed from the internet. According to ‚ÄúAll Things XRP,‚Äù the SEC‚Äôs enforcement action halted Ripple‚Äôs progress just as it was gaining significant traction. MoneyGram, which had partnered with Ripple for cross-border payments, suspended its use of XRP shortly after the lawsuit. Meanwhile, SWIFT began exploring blockchain-based settlement technology, with pilots reportedly starting in 2022. The implication is that the lawsuit created a window for traditional institutions to develop their blockchain initiatives without being disrupted by XRP‚Äôs rapid scaling. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Comparisons to Ethereum and the Issue of Regulatory Consistency The post also questions why XRP faced intense regulatory scrutiny while Ethereum‚Äôs 2014 ICO, which bore structural similarities, was effectively cleared by the SEC. Former SEC official William Hinman publicly stated that Ethereum was not a security, despite allegedly receiving financial compensation from a law firm connected to Ethereum-related enterprises during his time at the SEC. Ripple, for its part, continued to fight the lawsuit, ultimately spending over $200 million in legal expenses. In July 2023, a judge ruled that XRP‚Äôs sales on secondary exchanges did not constitute securities transactions. The news sent XRP‚Äôs price up 73% in one day. However, ‚ÄúAll Things XRP‚Äù said by that time, the damage had already been done. Between 2020 and 2023, XRP was largely absent from U.S. trading platforms, and many institutions opted not to engage with it, effectively delaying its adoption during a critical window for financial innovation. A Shift in Political Tone and the Settlement Outcome All Things XRP presents a scenario in which the lawsuit settles for $50 million under a new SEC chair appointed by President Trump. Also, the commentator suggests that the timing and intensity of the lawsuit under the Biden administration may have had more to do with protecting financial incumbents than safeguarding retail investors. According to the thread, XRP was never eliminated‚Äîit was delayed. The argument concludes that this delay is to protect the profits of legacy banking institutions and payment systems like SWIFT. With SWIFT now handling around $5 trillion per day in transactions, the stakes in maintaining its dominance were considerable. The tweet ends on a forward-looking note, suggesting that those same institutions are now beginning to embrace XRP‚Äôs underlying utility, possibly setting the stage for broader institutional adoption soon.

43481138,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150687,1744967454,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary DeFi Platforms Offer Vital Lifeline to Yemenis Amid Civil War,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/defi-platforms-yemen-civil-war/,"In a world grappling with conflicts and humanitarian crises, innovative solutions often emerge from the most unexpected corners. Yemen, a nation ravaged by civil war, presents a compelling case study in the resilience of the human spirit and the transformative power of decentralized finance (DeFi). As traditional financial systems crumble under the weight of conflict and sanctions, Yemenis are increasingly turning to DeFi platforms as a vital lifeline, offering a glimmer of hope in the face of adversity. Why are Yemenis embracing DeFi Platforms? For years, Yemen has been embroiled in a devastating civil war, exacerbating existing issues of poverty, lack of infrastructure, and limited access to basic services. The latest blow comes in the form of renewed U.S. sanctions targeting the Houthi group, further crippling the nation‚Äôs already fragile financial infrastructure. According to a recent report by TRM Labs, this turmoil is pushing Yemeni citizens towards DeFi platforms at an accelerating rate. But what exactly is driving this shift? Disrupted Traditional Financial Services: The civil war has left Yemen‚Äôs banking sector in tatters. Many banks are either inaccessible due to conflict zones or simply non-functional. This makes it nearly impossible for ordinary citizens to conduct basic financial transactions, receive remittances, or manage their meager savings. Sanctions and Economic Isolation: International sanctions, while aimed at specific groups, often have a ripple effect, impacting the entire population. These measures can further restrict access to global financial networks, making it harder for Yemenis to participate in international trade or receive aid. Limited Access to Centralized Exchanges: While centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs) offer an alternative to traditional banking, they still operate within regulatory frameworks and can be subject to geopolitical pressures. In regions like Yemen, access to and usability of CEXs can be inconsistent and unreliable. The Appeal of Decentralization: This is where DeFi platforms step in. Decentralized finance, by its very nature, operates outside the control of central authorities and traditional financial institutions. This makes it inherently more resistant to censorship, sanctions, and political instability. The Stark Numbers: DeFi vs. Centralized Exchanges in Yemen The TRM Labs report provides compelling data illustrating the rapid shift towards DeFi in Yemen. Consider these striking statistics: Platform Type Web Traffic Share (Yemen) DeFi Platforms Over 63% Centralized Exchanges 18% These figures paint a clear picture: DeFi platforms are not just a niche alternative; they are becoming the dominant form of cryptocurrency engagement in Yemen. The dramatic difference in web traffic share ‚Äì 63% for DeFi versus a mere 18% for centralized exchanges ‚Äì underscores the urgency and necessity driving this adoption. Challenges to Crypto Adoption in Yemen While the rise of DeFi in Yemen is remarkable, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge the significant hurdles that still exist. Initial crypto adoption in Yemen was slow, hampered by several factors: Poor Internet Access: Reliable internet connectivity is essential for accessing and using DeFi platforms . In Yemen, infrastructure is severely damaged, and internet access remains limited and often unreliable, particularly in conflict-affected areas. Low Financial Literacy: Understanding cryptocurrencies and DeFi requires a certain level of financial and technological literacy. In a country with widespread poverty and limited access to education, navigating the complexities of DeFi can be a significant challenge. Security Concerns: The crypto space, while offering immense potential, is also fraught with risks, including scams, hacks, and volatility. For individuals with limited resources, these risks can be particularly daunting. Regulatory Uncertainty: The legal and regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies in Yemen, like in many regions experiencing conflict, is likely unclear or non-existent. This lack of clarity can create uncertainty and hinder wider adoption. Benefits of DeFi in Conflict Zones: Beyond Yemen The Yemeni experience offers valuable lessons about the potential of DeFi platforms in conflict zones and regions facing economic hardship. The benefits extend beyond simply providing an alternative financial system: Financial Inclusion: DeFi can provide access to financial services for the unbanked and underbanked populations, a crucial aspect in conflict zones where traditional banks are often absent. Cross-Border Transactions: Crypto adoption facilitates easier and potentially cheaper cross-border transactions, vital for remittances and humanitarian aid delivery. Transparency and Traceability: Blockchain technology, the foundation of DeFi, offers enhanced transparency and traceability of transactions, which can be beneficial for aid distribution and reducing corruption. Empowerment and Resilience: By giving individuals greater control over their finances, DeFi can foster a sense of empowerment and financial resilience in communities facing immense challenges. Examples of DeFi Use Cases in Yemen While specific on-the-ground examples are still emerging, we can envision how DeFi platforms are likely being utilized in Yemen: Remittances: Yemenis abroad can send remittances to family members back home using stablecoins and DeFi protocols, potentially bypassing traditional, expensive, and unreliable remittance channels. Local P2P Exchanges: Decentralized exchanges can facilitate peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies within Yemen, enabling local economic activity despite the collapse of formal markets. Aid Distribution: Humanitarian organizations could potentially leverage DeFi for more efficient and transparent distribution of aid directly to those in need, reducing leakage and ensuring funds reach their intended recipients. Savings and Asset Preservation: In an environment of hyperinflation and currency devaluation, cryptocurrencies, despite their volatility, can offer a store of value and a means to preserve savings. Actionable Insights: What Can Be Done to Support DeFi Adoption in Yemen? The story of crypto adoption in Yemen is still unfolding, but its potential to alleviate suffering and empower communities is undeniable. To further support this positive trend, several actionable steps can be considered: Improve Internet Access: Investing in infrastructure to improve internet connectivity in Yemen is paramount. This will not only facilitate DeFi adoption but also support education, communication, and economic development in general. Promote Financial Literacy: Educational initiatives focused on digital literacy and financial literacy, specifically tailored to the Yemeni context, are crucial to empower citizens to safely and effectively utilize DeFi tools. Develop User-Friendly DeFi Solutions: Creating DeFi applications and platforms that are specifically designed to be user-friendly for individuals with limited technical expertise and potentially low internet bandwidth is essential. International Support and Collaboration: International organizations and the global crypto community can play a vital role in providing resources, technical assistance, and funding to support DeFi initiatives in Yemen and similar conflict-affected regions. Conclusion: A Beacon of Hope in a Time of Crisis The increasing reliance on DeFi platforms in Yemen is more than just a technological trend; it‚Äôs a testament to human adaptability and the enduring quest for financial freedom, even amidst the horrors of civil war. While challenges remain, the data is clear: DeFi is providing a vital lifeline, offering a glimmer of hope and a path towards greater financial inclusion for Yemenis in their time of critical need. This situation underscores the revolutionary potential of decentralized finance to empower individuals and communities facing systemic disruptions and humanitarian crises worldwide. The Yemeni experience serves as a powerful reminder that innovation, even in the darkest of times, can offer pathways to resilience and recovery.

A new report by blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs reveals a surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) usage among Yemen citizens, particularly in the wake of U.S. sanctions targeting the Houthi group, a faction now officially relisted as a terrorist organization by the U.S. government. Yemen People Turn to DeFi for Financial Survival Historically, Yemen‚Äôs crypto adoption has been hampered by unreliable internet infrastructure and limited digital literacy. But that is changing. TRM Labs notes a shift driven not by hype or FOMO, but by urgent necessity. ‚ÄúThe ability to bypass the disruption in local financial services offers a modicum of financial resilience,‚Äù the report states, highlighting the increasingly vital role that crypto is playing in the daily lives of Yemenis. With many banks inoperable or inaccessible due to the ongoing conflict, DeFi platforms have emerged as the most visited crypto-related services in the region, accounting for over 63% of observed activity. Centralized exchanges, by comparison, make up just 18% of the traffic. The rest comes from peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, often used for cross-border remittances or moving funds away from surveillance. How U.S. Policies May Be Fueling Crypto Uptake The link between geopolitical action and digital financial behavior is particularly evident in Yemen. Following the Biden administration‚Äôs decision in January 2024 to relist the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group, a local Yemen-based crypto exchange saw its volume skyrocket by 270%. Though the spike eventually cooled, another significant 223% increase followed after Donald Trump was re-elected and reaffirmed the Houthi group‚Äôs terror designation. While the majority of Yemen crypto users appear to be everyday citizens seeking access to stable financial tools, TRM Labs warns that more sophisticated usage could be on the horizon. As sanctions tighten and international banking routes close, the Houthis and their backers‚Äîsuch as Iran‚Äîcould increasingly turn to crypto for funding. In a region where financial access is fractured, and traditional banking channels are either failing or restricted, decentralized finance is emerging not just as a workaround‚Äîbut as a necessity.

Trump Hints at Easing China Tariffs, Crypto Market Eyes Positive Shift",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-tariffs-china-trade-crypto/,"In a surprising turn of events that has global markets on edge, former U.S. President Donald Trump has indicated a potential softening stance on tariffs against China. This news arrives as a welcome sign for many, especially those in the cryptocurrency market, who are keenly observing how geopolitical tensions influence market sentiment and investment strategies. Could this be the relief the global economy and crypto markets have been waiting for? Let‚Äôs dive into the details of Trump‚Äôs recent statements and what they might mean for the future of trade and digital assets. Why Trump‚Äôs Tariff Comments Matter to the Global Economy For years, the world has witnessed a tense back-and-forth between the U.S. and China, largely characterized by escalating Trump tariffs on various goods. These tariffs, imposed under the Trump administration, were aimed at reshaping trade balances and protecting American industries. However, they‚Äôve also sparked concerns about inflation, supply chain disruptions, and overall economic instability. Trump‚Äôs recent remarks suggest a potential shift away from this aggressive tariff policy. According to Reuters, Trump stated, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want them to go higher because at a certain point you make it where people don‚Äôt buy.‚Äù This acknowledgment that high tariffs can backfire by suppressing consumer demand is a significant departure from his previous rhetoric and could signal a major policy adjustment. The Potential Benefits of Easing the China Trade War If Trump follows through with his hint to lower or halt tariff increases, the benefits could be widespread. Here are a few key advantages to consider: Reduced Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods, which are often passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Lowering tariffs could help ease inflationary pressures, a major concern for economies worldwide. Boosted Consumer Spending: As Trump himself pointed out, high tariffs can deter consumer spending. Lower prices on goods could stimulate demand, benefiting businesses and the economy as a whole. Improved Business Confidence: The uncertainty surrounding the China trade war has been a drag on business investment. A move towards de-escalation could boost business confidence, encouraging investment and expansion. Strengthened Global Trade Relations: Easing trade tensions could improve diplomatic relations and foster a more stable global trade environment, benefiting all participating nations. Challenges and Uncertainties Ahead While the prospect of easing tariffs is promising, it‚Äôs crucial to acknowledge the potential challenges and uncertainties: Political Volatility: Trump‚Äôs statements are just hints at this stage. Policy can change rapidly, and there‚Äôs no guarantee that tariffs will actually be lowered or even remain stable. Political developments can swiftly alter the trade landscape. Existing Trade Imbalances: Even with reduced tariffs, underlying trade imbalances between the U.S. and China may persist. Addressing these long-term issues will require more than just tariff adjustments. Geopolitical Tensions: Trade is just one aspect of the complex relationship between the U.S. and China. Other geopolitical tensions could still impact economic stability and tariff impact indirectly. Market Reactions: While initial market reactions to Trump‚Äôs comments might be positive, sustained positive sentiment will depend on concrete actions and policy changes. Examples of Tariff Impact and Market Reactions To understand the real-world implications, let‚Äôs consider some examples of how tariffs have previously affected markets: Event Impact on Markets Example Imposition of Tariffs in 2018 Market Volatility, Sector-Specific Impacts The initial imposition of tariffs in 2018 led to significant stock market volatility and negatively impacted sectors heavily reliant on international trade. Escalation of Trade Tensions in 2019 Slowed Global Growth, Supply Chain Disruptions The escalation in 2019 contributed to a slowdown in global economic growth and caused disruptions in supply chains as businesses scrambled to adjust. Potential Tariff Reduction (Future) Positive Market Sentiment, Potential Economic Boost If tariffs are indeed reduced, we could see a boost in market sentiment , increased investment, and potentially stronger economic growth. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors For cryptocurrency investors, understanding the implications of potential tariff changes is vital. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Global Economic News: Keep a close eye on developments related to trade policy and the global economy . These macroeconomic factors can significantly influence crypto market trends. Assess Risk Appetite: Trade policy shifts can introduce volatility. Assess your risk appetite and adjust your portfolio accordingly. Diversification remains key in uncertain times. Watch for Market Sentiment Shifts: Pay attention to how market sentiment reacts to trade news. Positive signals could indicate potential upward trends in crypto markets, while negative signals might suggest caution. Consider Geopolitical Factors: Remember that trade is just one piece of the geopolitical puzzle. Broader geopolitical events can also impact market stability and investor confidence. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for Global Markets? Trump‚Äôs recent comments offer a glimmer of hope that the era of escalating tariffs might be nearing an end. For the cryptocurrency market and the broader global economy, this could represent a significant positive shift. However, it‚Äôs crucial to remain vigilant and informed, as policy landscapes can change rapidly. The potential easing of the China trade war could unlock new opportunities and foster a more stable economic environment, but it‚Äôs essential to approach this development with cautious optimism and a well-informed investment strategy.

This latest drop marks a stark deterioration from its already fragile state earlier this month, when it wobbled near $0.83. A System Under Stress Data from CoinGecko shows sUSD‚Äôs highest price in the last seven days at $0.9032. However, since April 14, it has dropped steadily, going to $0.86, then to $0.76, before finally hitting rock bottom on April 18 at $0.664. At the time of writing, the stablecoin had regained nearly 2% of its value in the last hour, although the current price of $0.70 is still an 8.8% dip in 24 hours. Its performance across longer time frames is just as bad, down 29.3% over 30 days and 29.2% year-on-year. The situation is no better with sUSD‚Äôs Optimism version. It hit a new all-time low of $0.6476 hours ago, after going down 6.9% in the past day and 32.7% over the previous month, raising fears of a potential death spiral reminiscent of Terra‚Äôs UST collapse. Meanwhile, a modest 0.5% uptick in the price of Synthetix‚Äôs native SNX token has not stopped it from plummeting almost 26% in the last 30 days and 77% from its yearly high. Cascading Risks sUSD is designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar and is backed by staked SNX tokens under a collateralized debt model. However, the recent passage of SIP 420, a protocol overhaul aimed at improving capital efficiency, seems to have inadvertently destabilized the stablecoin. The update slashed the collateralization ratio from 750% to 200% and transitioned to a collective debt pool, removing a key arbitrage mechanism: stakers can no longer profit from buying depegged sUSD to repay discounted debts. It has seemingly resulted in a vacuum of buy-side demand. As Okto Chain‚Äôs Minal Thukral noted , the absence of a peg stability module has left sUSD vulnerable to sustained sell pressure, with liquidity thinning and concentrated AMM pools only exacerbating price swings. The crypto community is divided on the issue. While some maintain that Synthetix‚Äôs treasury, which holds about $30 million in sUSD and other assets, could act as a backstop to stem the tide, others see little reason to hold sUSD without a clear repeg plan. Even Synthetix founder Kain Warwick seems to have embraced the dark humor of the moment, renaming his X account to ‚Äúkain.depeg.‚Äù The post sUSD Drops Below $0.7 as Synthetix Stablecoin Faces Prolonged Depeg appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Stablecoins,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|LUNA|SNX|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-04-18 09:25:15

Gold Outshines Bitcoin During Market Turbulence JPMorgan‚Äôs latest research casts fresh doubt on Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a reliable safe-haven asset, highlighting gold‚Äôs continued dominance in times of economic uncertainty. The banking giant‚Äôs analysts noted that, while investors have flocked to gold and other traditional safe havens like the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, Bitcoin has seen consistent outflows and diminished demand. Gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) registered $21.1 billion in net inflows globally in Q1 2025, according to World Gold Council data cited in the report. Of this, $2.3 billion originated from China and Hong Kong alone ‚Äî a region that accounted for 16% of total gold ETF assets under management. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs have seen three consecutive months of outflows, indicating a stark divergence in investor sentiment. Speculative Appetite for Bitcoin Wanes The report, led by JPMorgan managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, emphasized that Bitcoin‚Äôs recent performance has been hindered by waning speculative interest. This is evident not only in ETF outflows but also in declining activity in Bitcoin futures markets. Analysts wrote, ‚ÄúDespite a decline in market breadth and liquidity, gold continues to benefit from safe haven flows in a similar fashion to currencies like the Swiss franc and the yen. These safe haven flows are seen in both the ETF and futures spaces.‚Äù The analysts attributed gold‚Äôs resurgence to mounting macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, which typically push investors toward more stable assets. Bitcoin, which has long been touted by some as ‚Äúdigital gold,‚Äù is not currently reflecting those characteristics. Bitcoin‚Äôs Volatility Undermines ‚ÄòDigital Gold‚Äô Narrative JPMorgan‚Äôs skepticism around Bitcoin as a safe haven echoes concerns raised in an earlier report this month, where analysts flagged the cryptocurrency‚Äôs high volatility and close correlation with equities as key weaknesses. The report claimed, ‚ÄúThe volatility of Bitcoin and its correlation with the stock market raises questions about the narrative of Bitcoin as 'digital gold'.‚Äù Currently, Bitcoin has underperformed gold by approximately 29% in 2025, reinforcing doubts among skeptics. Canadian billionaire Frank Giustra recently commented that Bitcoin ‚Äúhas never traded like gold,‚Äù a sentiment that appears increasingly validated by recent data. Diverging Views on Bitcoin‚Äôs Dual Role Despite JPMorgan‚Äôs critical stance, some market participants maintain that Bitcoin can exhibit both risk-on and risk-off properties depending on broader market dynamics. Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee, for instance, has characterized Bitcoin as ‚Äúambidextrous,‚Äù capable of adapting to varying investor moods. However, the current trend appears firmly tilted toward traditional assets. JPMorgan also identified $62,000 as a key support level for Bitcoin in the near term, though its ability to reclaim ground as a safe-haven asset remains uncertain.

According to the company‚Äôs assessment, Bitcoin is under pressure for short-term investors.

One of the most iconic examples? Shiba Inu (SHIB) trading at just $0.00001 before skyrocketing to $0.000089 in late 2021. That leap delivered nearly 790% ROI, turning small bets into life-changing capital. But those opportunities are rare‚Äîand more importantly, they‚Äôre often only recognized in hindsight. Now in 2025, a new project is quietly gaining early momentum‚ÄîMutuum Finance (MUTM). But this time, the opportunity doesn‚Äôt rely on memes or momentum. Instead, it‚Äôs built around functionality, on-chain structure, and real progress. And while the presale price sits at just $0.025, investors who understand the fundamentals are already acting before it breaks out. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) At this moment, Mutuum Finance is in the middle of its presale‚Äîpriced at $0.025 with the next stage already scheduled to jump to $0.03. That means those buying in now are securing a 20% gain before the token even hits exchanges. More importantly, over 8,300 on-chain holders have already joined, and more than $6.8 million has been raised. This isn‚Äôt a speculative meme play. It‚Äôs a case of a project being built from the ground up with long-term mechanics and a fully transparent rollout. And unlike meme coins that rely solely on community hype, Mutuum‚Äôs demand curve is backed by actual protocol activity. This means once the token lists publicly, the price isn‚Äôt just expected to rise‚Äîit‚Äôs structurally designed to. Shiba inu (SHIB) For comparison, Shiba Inu (SHIB) surged on the back of viral exposure and speculative fervor. From $0.00001, it climbed to $0.000089, creating nearly 8x gains during its prime. But SHIB‚Äôs rise wasn‚Äôt tied to ecosystem development or utility at the time‚Äîit was a momentum play. That made it volatile, and its correction was just as sharp. Now, as SHIB trades at $0.0000115, many investors are left asking if they‚Äôve already seen the best it has to offer. While the token may still have room to grow depending on broader trends, it‚Äôs no longer early. That window closed years ago. MUTM Is Doing It Differently Mutuum Finance isn‚Äôt aiming to go viral overnight. Instead, the team is quietly building a platform that enables decentralized borrowing and lending‚Äîwhile preserving user ownership of assets and putting real yield back into their hands. One of the key features is the use of mtTokens‚Äîtokenized versions of deposits that automatically reflect both the initial value and the interest earned over time. Instead of relying on token emissions or inflationary rewards, mtTokens accumulate real-time value based on lending activity. This offers users full control and transparency over their earnings. The system also avoids the need for centralized control. All deposits stay in audited smart contracts, and users can withdraw at any time‚Äîassuming the protocol has available liquidity. Borrowers provide overcollateralized deposits and receive funds without selling their original assets, enabling access to liquidity without sacrificing long-term holdings. Mutuum isn‚Äôt stopping there. The team is working on an overcollateralized stablecoin, designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. Dollar and minted only when sufficient collateral is secured. The stablecoin will add flexibility to the lending model and serve as a reliable borrowing option once launched. On the revenue side, the protocol introduces a buy-and-distribute mechanism where a share of fees is used to purchase MUTM tokens from the market and reward users. This structure helps sustain demand and supports long-term token value‚Äîagain, a far cry from inflationary models seen in meme coins. Long-Term Potential and Analyst Sentiment With its presale still active, many believe this is the moment investors will look back on. Projections place MUTM‚Äôs short-term target between $0.40 and $0.70, while longer-term forecasts aim much higher. If it reaches even $2.50‚Äì$4 by late 2025, that would mean 100x to 150x gains from the current $0.025 price. Early contributors are also motivated by more than price. A live dashboard is already operational, and the beta version of the platform is scheduled to launch shortly after the token goes public. A CertiK audit is underway, reinforcing trust in the project‚Äôs architecture. Missed SHIB at $0.00001? That‚Äôs in the past. But Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at just $0.025 today‚Äîwith a product under development, utility being tested, and fundamentals in motion. It‚Äôs what meme coin investors wished they had: early access to a real DeFi solution with a roadmap, a revenue model, and adoption already underway. In a market full of noise, MUTM offers something rare‚Äîclarity and upside. Don‚Äôt miss it this time.

This immediately raised alarm bells, which pushed him to exit the call. After the Zoom session, Li tried to verify the person's identity via a Telegram call, but the impersonator refused, deleted all previous messages, and blocked him. He later shared screenshots of the interaction, which included a suggestion from him to move the meeting to Google Meet, which the attacker ignored. Li suspects the North Korean state-sponsored Lazarus Group was behind the attempted attack and believes that the real person's account was compromised. In an interview, Li placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that the video footage seemed genuine, not AI-generated, and resembled standard webcam quality. He believes the attackers used old recordings of actual team members to simulate a live call. The Manta executive warned others in the crypto space to be especially cautious of any unexpected requests to download files , and described these kinds of prompts as a major red flag. He also wanted people about just how emotionally manipulative and mentally taxing these attacks can be, particularly for busy executives that are used to spontaneous calls and messages. Other people in the crypto community reported experiencing similar scams. A member of ContributionDAO recounted how attackers tried to force a Zoom installation via a custom link, claiming it was a business-only version, and declined to switch platforms when asked to use Google Meet. Additionally, crypto researcher ‚Äú Meekdonald‚Äù shared that someone close to them fell for an identical scam that Li narrowly escaped. North Korean Hackers Target Crypto Devs The North Korean hackers linked to the $1.4 billion Bybit exploit are now also reportedly targeting cryptocurrency developers through a deceptive recruitment campaign involving fake coding tests that are embedded with malware. According to cybersecurity outlet The Hacker News , developers are being approached by people posing as recruiters, primarily through LinkedIn. These imposters offer enticing job opportunities and eventually send over a GitHub-hosted document that contains a supposed coding assignment. Once opened, the file installs stealer malware capable of compromising the developer‚Äôs device and gaining access to sensitive information. (Source: Hacker News ) The malicious campaign is attributed to the North Korean state-backed hacking group known as Slow Pisces, which is also referred to as Jade Sleet, Pukchong, TraderTraitor, and UNC4899. The primary goal of these attackers seems to be stealing credentials, SSH keys, iCloud Keychain contents, wallet access, API keys, and cloud configurations. These tools are then used to breach the employer‚Äôs infrastructure and identify vulnerabilities for future exploits. Security experts, including Hakan Unal of Cyvers and Luis Lubeck of Hacken, explained how these attackers build credible profiles on professional platforms like LinkedIn, and sometimes extend their activities to freelance platforms like Upwork and Fiverr. The scammers often present themselves as clients or hiring managers offering lucrative roles, especially in DeFi or Web3 security, to make the offers seem legitimate. (Source: Hacker News ) Hayato Shigekawa from Chainalysis pointed out that hackers even go as far as creating realistic resumes and employee personas to trick developers. Their ultimate objective is to gain a foothold in the target company through compromised developer credentials. Once inside, they conduct reconnaissance to identify and exploit weaknesses in the system. Cybersecurity professionals warned that developers should be extremely cautious when receiving unsolicited job offers or assignments. Yehor Rudytsia from Hacken stressed that attackers are evolving, and are using both psychological and technical tactics to bypass defenses. To minimize risks, developers are advised to use virtual machines and sandboxes for testing unknown code, verify the legitimacy of job offers through official channels, and avoid running or installing unverified code. Storing sensitive information securely and using robust endpoint protection can also serve as critical lines of defense. Fake Google Alerts Trick Users Nick Johnson, the founder and lead developer of Ethereum Name Service (ENS), also recently issued a warning about an extremely sophisticated phishing attack that impersonates Google and tricks users into revealing their login credentials. In an April 16 post on X , Johnson explained that the attack sends a fake security alert, claiming the user‚Äôs Google data is being shared with law enforcement due to a subpoena. The phishing email looks highly convincing, passing Google's DKIM signature check and showing up in Gmail alongside legitimate security alerts without any warning indicators. The scam lures users into clicking a link to ‚Äúview case materials‚Äù or protest the data request. The link leads to a Google Sites page‚Äîhosted on a Google subdomain‚Äîwhich increases its credibility. Johnson explained that while he didn‚Äôt follow the process all the way through, the goal is likely to harvest login credentials and compromise the user‚Äôs account. Though the use of Google‚Äôs domain name adds legitimacy to the scam, there are still some red flags , like the email being forwarded from a private address. According to a recent report by software firm EasyDMARC, the attack exploits Google Sites and the OAuth app infrastructure, allowing scammers to craft emails that seem to come from a genuine ‚Äúno-reply@google‚Äù address while masking the true reply address. (Source: X ) Because DKIM only verifies the message and headers but not the envelope, these emails pass Gmail‚Äôs validation checks and appear as authentic messages. According to Johnson, this loophole allows phishing emails to be threaded into conversations with real Google alerts, making detection even more difficult. Google acknowledged the threat and confirmed that it is working on countermeasures. A spokesperson said that the company is shutting down the mechanism allowing the inclusion of arbitrary-length text in the message, which will prevent the current form of the attack. Google also identified the threat actor behind the campaign as ‚ÄùRockfoils‚Äù and said that protective measures were rolled out over the past week, with full deployment expected soon.",News|Security,EN,0,0,ASIA|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|ENS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-18 09:30:00

The first focuses on price patterns and considers an asset‚Äôs volatility and volume to assess the possibility of price movement in a particular direction. The second, fundamental analysis, is used to appraise an asset‚Äôs intrinsic value. Fundamental analysis in traditional finance uses formal documents such as company reports. These can be of different types: earnings reports, job hiring reports, tax reports, etc. Expanding into new markets can also be viewed as part of it, as it suggests increased production and consumer growth. The emergence of cryptocurrencies brings its own advantages, which influence the traditional financial system as well. On-chain analysis tracks user activity on the blockchain. We cannot know exactly how many bank customers transferred their funds yesterday to another particular bank. With crypto ‚Äî yes, we can. But we don‚Äôt know who it was exactly, which is probably for the best. Although considered a part of fundamental analysis, on-chain analysis has its own perks, and let‚Äôs move on and have a quick look over the past few weeks at Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain activity. There are two types of HODLers (a.k.a. holders): short-term HODLers (STHs) and long-term HODLers (LTHs). As of now, when Bitcoin price is continuing to oscillate around $85,000, STHs‚Äô assets in loss have peaked at 3.4 million, comparable to July 2018, the post-bull-run period. Around 90% of all the STHs who have held for at least a month are now underwater. It is worth mentioning that STHs, due to their recent buy-ins, bear the most losses when correction phases begin, making them the most vulnerable to market disruptions. Since Bitcoin‚Äôs latest all-time high (ATH) at $109K, their combined realized profit and loss has dropped by 85% ‚Äî from $3.4 billion to approximately $508 million. Another key metric to follow is the miner reserve. Miners are the source of Bitcoin. As they mine, they accumulate Bitcoin in their wallets. Miners are highly sensitive to once-in-four-years halvings when their rewards are cut in half, and to electricity costs, as they consume a lot. When the price is favorable and allows them to cover mining and maintenance costs, they distribute coins and create selling pressure. Every time Bitcoin reaches an ATH, they sell their assets. This week, we‚Äôve seen a small rebound in miner reserves, with more than 1,300 Bitcoin accumulated ‚Äî modest but steady growth. However, overall on-chain activity remains weak, with 900,000 active addresses compared to the February peak of 1,200,000. The coming months will reveal whether Bitcoin and the broader crypto market will be able to attract new investors ‚Äî the only way a bull phase can persist. The recent introduction of Bitcoin ETPs by BlackRock to European customers, OKX being the first crypto exchange obtaining the MiFID II license in accordance with the MiCA framework, may pave the way for increased capital inflows.

Blockchain security firm PeckShield reported on X that approximately $1.4 million USDT has been sent back to the platform. This partial fund recovery offers a glimmer of hope amidst ongoing concerns about DeFi security and the risks associated with crypto exploit vulnerabilities. What Happened with the KiloEx Crypto Exploit? On April 15th, KiloEx, a decentralized exchange known for its perpetual contract offerings, fell victim to a sophisticated security breach. This crypto exploit resulted in a staggering loss of around $7 million, sending shockwaves through the DeFi community. Such incidents underscore the persistent challenges in maintaining robust DeFi security measures within the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of the key events: The Breach: KiloEx experienced a security exploit on April 15th. Significant Losses: Approximately $7 million was siphoned from the platform. Community Concern: The incident raised fresh questions about the safety of funds on decentralized exchanges. Partial Recovery: Around $1.4 million USDT has been returned by the exploiter. Why is Fund Recovery a Big Deal in Crypto Exploits? In the often-anonymous and irreversible world of cryptocurrency transactions, any fund recovery after a crypto exploit is considered a significant victory. Unlike traditional finance, where fraudulent transactions can sometimes be reversed through intermediaries, DeFi platforms operate on the principle of immutability. Once funds are stolen in a crypto exploit , tracing and retrieving them is incredibly difficult. Therefore, the voluntary return of funds, even a portion, can be interpreted in several ways: White Hat Move? It‚Äôs possible the exploiter is attempting to portray their actions as a ‚Äòwhite hat‚Äô hack, perhaps to mitigate potential legal repercussions or reputational damage within the crypto community. Pressure from Tracking: Blockchain analysis and tracing tools are becoming increasingly sophisticated. The exploiter might be feeling the heat from on-chain investigators and decided to return a portion to reduce scrutiny. Negotiation Tactic: In some past incidents, exploiters have returned funds as part of a negotiation for a bounty or to avoid further pursuit. It remains to be seen if this is the case with KiloEx. The Ongoing Challenge of DeFi Security The KiloEx crypto exploit is a stark reminder of the ever-present need for enhanced DeFi security protocols. While decentralization offers numerous benefits, it also introduces unique security challenges. Smart contract vulnerabilities, protocol design flaws, and even human error can be exploited, leading to significant financial losses. Key Challenges in DeFi Security: Challenge Description Smart Contract Vulnerabilities Code errors in smart contracts can be exploited to drain funds. Rigorous auditing and formal verification are crucial. Oracle Manipulation DeFi protocols often rely on external data feeds (oracles). If these oracles are compromised, it can lead to manipulation of the protocol. Rug Pulls & Exit Scams Malicious actors can create DeFi projects with the intent to abscond with user funds, known as rug pulls. Flash Loan Attacks Exploiters use flash loans (uncollateralized loans taken and repaid within the same transaction) to manipulate market prices or protocol logic. Centralization Risks Even in DeFi, some level of centralization can exist, creating single points of failure. What Does This Fund Recovery Mean for KiloEx and Users? The return of $1.4 million is undoubtedly positive news for KiloEx and its users. It demonstrates a degree of accountability, however unexpected, in the aftermath of a significant crypto exploit . However, it‚Äôs crucial to remember that a substantial portion of the stolen funds ‚Äì approximately $5.6 million ‚Äì remains unreturned. Implications of Partial Fund Recovery: Partial Relief: While not a full resolution, the recovered funds can help mitigate the financial impact on KiloEx and potentially compensate affected users to some extent. Reputational Boost (Slight): The return might slightly improve KiloEx‚Äôs reputation, showing some effort towards resolving the situation, although the initial exploit still casts a shadow. Ongoing Investigation: The investigation into the exploit will likely continue to determine the full extent of the vulnerability and prevent future incidents. Focus on Security: KiloEx, and the wider DeFi space, will need to double down on DeFi security measures, including enhanced audits, monitoring, and incident response protocols. Actionable Insights: Strengthening DeFi Security The KiloEx incident and subsequent partial fund recovery provide valuable lessons for both DeFi platforms and users: Robust Audits are Essential: DeFi projects must prioritize comprehensive and frequent smart contract audits from reputable security firms. Multi-Sig Wallets & Governance: Implementing multi-signature wallets for critical functions and robust governance mechanisms can reduce the risk of unauthorized access and exploits. Real-time Monitoring & Alert Systems: Deploying advanced monitoring tools and alert systems can help detect and respond to suspicious activity quickly. User Education: Educating users about DeFi risks, security best practices, and due diligence is crucial for fostering a safer ecosystem. Incident Response Plans: Having well-defined incident response plans in place allows platforms to react swiftly and effectively in case of a security breach. Conclusion: A Silver Lining in the DeFi Security Landscape The partial fund recovery in the KiloEx crypto exploit saga offers a rare silver lining in the often-turbulent world of DeFi. While the initial $7 million breach was a significant blow, the return of $1.4 million provides a glimmer of hope and underscores the evolving dynamics between exploiters and DeFi security efforts. It‚Äôs a powerful reminder that while the risks in DeFi are real, so too is the resilience and the ongoing pursuit of greater security within this innovative space. The incident should serve as a catalyst for continued vigilance and proactive measures to safeguard the future of decentralized finance.

Mullin, known for his transparent approach, is seeking input on what to do with his substantial allocation of 772,081 team-allocated OM tokens, currently staked on Fluxtra. This move highlights the growing importance of community governance in decentralized projects and sets a compelling precedent for other leaders in the space. Let‚Äôs dive into the details of this intriguing situation and explore what it could mean for Mantra DAO and the broader crypto ecosystem. Why is the Mantra DAO CEO seeking community input on his OM tokens? Transparency and decentralization are at the heart of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Mullin‚Äôs decision to involve the Mantra DAO community in this matter underscores these core principles. By seeking feedback on his OM token burn decision, he‚Äôs not just paying lip service to decentralization; he‚Äôs actively embodying it. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of why this is a noteworthy development: Empowering the Community: This action truly empowers OM token holders, giving them a direct voice in a decision that could impact the token‚Äôs ecosystem. It moves beyond passive holding and encourages active participation. Building Trust: Openly seeking community guidance builds trust and strengthens the relationship between the leadership and the community. It demonstrates that the CEO values the community‚Äôs perspective and is willing to act upon it. Decentralized Decision-Making: This initiative is a practical example of decentralized decision-making in action. Instead of unilaterally deciding the fate of the tokens, Mullin is leveraging the collective wisdom of the community. Setting a Precedent: Mullin‚Äôs move could set a new standard for leadership transparency and community involvement in crypto projects, encouraging other leaders to adopt similar practices. Decoding the Options for OM Token Management: What‚Äôs on the Table? Mullin presented four distinct options for the community to consider regarding his OM tokens . Each option carries different implications for the tokenomics and the future of Mantra DAO. Let‚Äôs break down each choice: Immediate Token Burn: Benefit: Immediately reducing the total supply of OM tokens could potentially increase scarcity and value for existing holders. This is a deflationary measure that is often viewed positively by token communities. Challenge: Burning such a significant amount of tokens at once might have unforeseen market reactions. It also removes a substantial amount of tokens from potential future use within the ecosystem. Extended Vesting Period: Benefit: Extending the vesting period for these tokens could signal long-term commitment from the CEO and alleviate any concerns about potential market dumping. It provides a more gradual release of tokens over time. Challenge: This option might not be as exciting to the community as a token burn, and it essentially maintains the status quo for a longer duration. Community Multisig Wallet: Benefit: Placing the tokens in a community multisig wallet offers a high degree of transparency and security. It ensures that the tokens can only be moved with the approval of multiple community-elected signatories. This fosters trust and collective control. Challenge: Deciding on the use of these tokens within the multisig wallet would require further community consensus and governance processes. Defining the exact purpose and operational framework of the multisig could be complex. Milestone-Based Unlock: Benefit: Unlocking tokens based on predefined milestones aligns incentives between the CEO and the community. It ties token release to the actual progress and success of the Mantra DAO project, encouraging development and growth. Challenge: Defining clear, measurable, and universally agreed-upon milestones can be challenging. There‚Äôs also the risk of disagreements on whether milestones have been adequately met. The Power of Community in Crypto: Why This Poll Matters This poll is more than just a temperature check; it‚Äôs a significant moment for community governance in the cryptocurrency space. It highlights a crucial shift towards more participatory and decentralized models of project management. Here‚Äôs why this community input is so important: Real Decentralization in Action: Many crypto projects talk about decentralization, but few actively involve their communities in significant decisions like this. Mantra DAO is taking concrete steps to walk the walk. Strengthening the Ecosystem: By involving the community, Mantra DAO is strengthening its ecosystem. A community that feels heard and valued is more likely to be engaged, supportive, and contribute to the project‚Äôs long-term success. Inspiration for Other Projects: This initiative can serve as an inspiration for other crypto projects to adopt more community-centric governance models. It demonstrates the benefits of transparency and participatory decision-making. Navigating Complex Decisions: Tokenomics and token distribution are complex areas. Community input can provide diverse perspectives and help navigate these complexities more effectively, leading to potentially better outcomes for the project as a whole. What‚Äôs Next for Mantra DAO and the OM Token Vesting Decision? The outcome of this community poll will be closely watched by the crypto community. While Mullin has clarified that the poll is non-binding, it will undoubtedly play a significant role in shaping his final decision. Here are some potential next steps: Analyzing Community Sentiment: Mullin and the Mantra DAO team will carefully analyze the results of the poll to understand the community‚Äôs preferred direction. Further Discussions: Depending on the poll results, there might be further community discussions and refinements of the proposed options. Final Decision and Implementation: Ultimately, Mullin will make a decision, likely taking the community feedback into strong consideration. The chosen course of action will then be implemented, affecting the future of his token vesting and the OM token ecosystem. Long-Term Impact on Governance: This event could have a lasting impact on Mantra DAO‚Äôs governance model, potentially leading to more structured and formalized community involvement in future decisions. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Decentralized Crypto Governance Mantra DAO‚Äôs CEO John Patrick Mullin‚Äôs move to seek community input on his OM token burn decision is a bold and commendable step towards true decentralized community governance . It exemplifies the spirit of crypto and sets a powerful example for other projects to follow. By empowering its community, Mantra DAO is not only making a crucial decision in a transparent and inclusive manner but also strengthening its foundations for long-term success in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. The crypto world will be keenly observing how this unfolds, as it could very well be a watershed moment in the evolution of decentralized governance.

Over the past decade, the tokenized credit market has soared to new heights. The industry, which converts traditional credit products, such as loans, bonds, or other debt instruments, into digital tokens that exist on a blockchain, has helped to democratize the world of investment for more participants, with each token issued representing a fraction of the underlying credit asset. This fractionalisation allows the token to be easily traded, transferred, and managed on decentralised platforms. You might also like: Tokenized securities are redefining compliance | Opinion To date, $10 billion in tokenized bonds have been issued by leading institutions, including the World Bank and the City of Lugano. The market‚Äôs growing popularity stems from the significant benefits it offers‚Äîenhanced liquidity, transparency, and accessibility. Investors can now buy and sell portions of loans or bonds, making these traditionally illiquid assets more flexible and tradable. Blockchain‚Äôs transparent, immutable ledger ensures that all transactions are secure and verifiable in real time, reducing fraud and increasing trust. Additionally, tokenized credit products open the door to a broader pool of investors by lowering entry barriers, allowing even small-scale participants to invest in assets that were once limited to large institutional players. As more financial institutions and platforms adopt tokenization, this market is expected to expand, transforming how credit products are issued, traded, and managed. Yet despite this advancement, the growth of the tokenised credit market is still constrained by one critical issue: return on investment. Decentralized finance lending currently offers lower yields when compared to traditional lending markets, especially in the current high-interest rate environment. This can be solved by providing funding for cross-border payments as it is an ideal use case to expand the tokenized credit market and unlock higher yields, offering consistent cash flows and a natural fit for blockchain‚Äôs speed and cost-efficiency. The core challenges: Low yields and volatility The total allocation of the tokenized credit market remains relatively small compared to the size of the multi-trillion-dollar global bond market. The limited allocation is largely due to challenges in liquidity, investor hesitancy concerning yields, and regulatory uncertainty. Concerning returns, the tokenised credit market currently offers an average yield of around 9.65% on $10 billion of tokenised credit assets. While this might seem attractive compared to traditional bond yields, tractional private credit markets saw average yields of 12% from 2018 to 2023, leading many investors to still view DeFi as volatile and uncertain. Therefore, to unlock further growth, it is critical that the industry addresses yield-related issues and enhances investor confidence in the pioneering asset class. Institutional investors demand not just high yields but also stability and predictability. In traditional credit markets, low volatility and reliable income streams are key drivers of investment flows, whereas the DeFi sector is still seen as nascent and volatile. The ecosystem needs to prove that it can generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns for both institutional and retail investors. This means improving the robustness of the platforms and expanding the range of available asset classes, such as into payments. Increasing yields to boost growth To drive greater adoption and attract more capital into tokenised credit markets, several strategies are necessary to make yields more attractive: Enhance liquidity. One of the key factors limiting yield attractiveness is liquidity, as tokenized assets must have deeper secondary markets to allow investors to exit positions easily without significantly affecting prices. This can be achieved by expanding the number of platforms that offer trading of tokenized debt assets, and increasing institutional participation can help create the necessary liquidity for more stable returns. Broaden asset classes. The tokenized credit market is currently focused on a narrow range of assets, such as mortgages and corporate bonds. However, to make yields more appealing, the market needs to diversify into other asset classes. Tokenizing revenue-generating assets like payments, real estate, and infrastructure projects could provide higher yields and open up new opportunities for investors who are seeking different risk-return profiles. Leverage stable asset classes. Integrating more stable, low-risk asset classes into the DeFi ecosystem could help balance the risk-reward equation. For example, tokenized government bonds or investment-grade corporate debt could offer lower but more stable yields, which may be attractive to institutional investors or pension funds looking for secure, long-term returns. Finding new asset classes for tokenization To ensure sustained growth in the tokenized credit market, new asset classes must be explored. The current landscape focuses heavily on fixed-income instruments, but there are untapped opportunities in sectors including real estate, intellectual property rights, royalties, and even carbon credits. However, the payments industry presents the best asset class for the expansion of the tokenized credit market. Playing a fundamental role in all global commerce, the payments industry handles extremely high transaction volumes with largely consistent returns. Cross-border payments are of particular interest; each provider must maintain sufficient liquidity in each jurisdiction in which it operates to provide fast and low-cost transactions, forming a significant burden for aspiring founders and scaling payment companies. This burden creates huge inefficiencies and locks up capital that could otherwise be invested or otherwise used more productively elsewhere. The tokenized credit market offers an effective solution to this problem, lending to cross-border payment companies to enable them to operate pre-funded accounts in more jurisdictions, reaching a market untapped by traditional lenders due to high perceived risks and archaic due diligence processes. Utilising on-chain collateral for loans and offering highly flexible lines of credit, the tokenised credit market can go where the traditional private lending market never could, gaining access to a key source of transaction volume and higher yields. The future of tokenized credit markets As the tokenised credit market continues to evolve, funding payments companies stand out as an important asset class that can generate higher yields and attract more capital, enabling the tokenised credit market to take the next step in its growth. To ensure the broader DeFi ecosystem thrives, the sector must focus on enhancing liquidity, stabilising yields, and diversifying into new asset classes, be that the payments industry or any other sector with high demand for flexible, on-chain liquidity.

An April 7 memo from the DOJ acknowledged that these investors are not getting the full value of their digital assets. According to the memo by the Deputy Attorney General (DAG), several crypto firms entered bankruptcy in 2022, causing investors losses. The memo noted that losses in some cases were due to fraud and theft, and the DOJ recovered the proceeds of this criminal activity, including digital assets, through forfeitures. However, it observed that the increase in the value of digital assets over the period was not reflected in the repayment to the victims, because regulations that require the return of forfeited assets to victims should be at their fair value at the time of the fraud. It said: ‚ÄúHowever, as a result of regulations, some digital asset investor victims have only been able to recover the value of their digital assets at the time the fraud was perpetrated.‚Äù The memo noted that this issue deserves to be addressed because it does not favor investors who bear all the risks of the loss. These investors do not benefit from the increase in the value of the digital assets when they could have possessed the assets if not for the loss. DOJ wants to evaluate the bankruptcy rules and propose changes In order to address this, the DAG has now directed the Office of Legal Policy and the Office of Legislative Affairs to evaluate the issue and propose regulatory and legislative changes that will improve asset forfeiture efforts in the digital sector. It is uncertain what proposals the DOJ will come up with to resolve this issue. A possible solution could be to return assets in kind, which could be risky as assets could decline to zero. Implementing any proposed changes could also prove tricky, as the Bankruptcy Code requires Congress to amend. Still, the department can issue regulations or rules. Ironically, the rule the DOJ referenced in its memo actually exists to protect investors against losses. It requires that losses returned to victims be at fair market value as at the date of loss, and where there are several victims, each will get a portion of the assets on a pro rata basis. However, the rule does not favor crypto investors as the value of crypto assets can increase, and the pro-rata refund means those who invested in valuable projects such as Bitcoin get the same as those who invest in memecoins. Crypto investors welcome the development Meanwhile, many in the crypto community consider the memo a good move, even if it is only guidance for the DOJ staff and does not have the force of law. Investors affected by the bankruptcy of crypto firms such as FTX, Voyager, Celsius, Genesis, Blockfi, and Gemini believe this was long overdue. FTX creditor champion Sunil Kavuri highlighted the development in a post on X, and followers‚Äô comments show that they support it even though they believe it might be too late to save victims of previous crypto bankruptcies. One user, Mr Purple on X, added that the Bankruptcy Code needs to be reformed to account for the unique nature of digital assets. He said: ‚ÄúSeriously (and critically) this needs also include a reform to the bankruptcy code to account for the unique nature of digital assets that may become subject to or inclusive of a bankruptcy proceeding.‚Äù With the majority viewing the idea as a common-sense move, all eyes are on the DOJ to see how it will modify the asset forfeiture rules to accommodate the crypto sector.

Despite the quiet session, BTC continues to consolidate within a tight $82,000‚Äì$87,000 range, reflecting cautious sentiment. Traders appear hesitant, awaiting a macro or crypto-specific catalyst to fuel the next directional move. Momentum has cooled, but bulls are defending key levels. A confirmed breakout above $85,500 could open the door to a fresh rally. Key Levels to Watch: Support: $83,879 Resistance: $85,508 Targets: $86,446 and $87,416 A confirmed close above $85,500 could open the door to a fresh rally, but until then, sideways action may dominate.

But one project called Remittix (RTX) is causing a stir for a different reason‚Äîand it‚Äôs not a meme. DOGE struggles to push higher despite trading uptick DOGE , the popular meme coin, is trading higher by a modest margin at $0.1568, while its trading volume increased by 8.03% to $838.09 million. In spite of its $23.36 billion market capitalization, DOGE appears to be consolidating as traders wait for a larger catalyst. Speculation remains about a possible Dogecoin integration with X (previously Twitter), which has been hinted at for months. Yet without confirmation, DOGE‚Äôs price action has been largely sideways. Dogecoin enthusiasts are loyal, but the market is getting saturated. As investors seek tokens that have more recent trends, DOGE might require more than hype to keep its spot in the market. Fartcoin rockets upward‚Äîcan it flip SHIB for good? The FARTCOIN vs. SHIB battle just got exciting. FARTCOIN is changing hands at $0.9448 following a 13.20% gain in the past 24 hours. That bullish momentum is accompanied by a $943.92 million market capitalization and a whopping $355.25 million daily trading volume. SHIB , meanwhile, is trailing behind at $0.00001190‚Äîup only 0.67% with $145.52 million in volume. Its $7.01 billion market cap still has it in front, but momentum is turning. As FARTCOIN gets exposed and SHIB remains in the same pattern of slow burns and long-term promises, it‚Äôs no wonder traders believe FARTCOIN might flip SHIB prior to Q3. Meme coins live and die by momentum, and right now, FARTCOIN has the spark. Remittix presale surges with real-world use cases Whereas DOGE, SHIB, and FARTCOIN headline the news for their volatility, Remittix is providing something that investors can truly utilize. Having raised nearly $14.5 million and sold over 528 million tokens, the Remittix presale is picking up some serious momentum. Now trading for just $0.0734, the project is gaining attention due to its real-world use case in cross-border payments. And, in contrast to meme coins, Remittix isn‚Äôt attempting to surf a joke‚Äîit‚Äôs addressing a billion-dollar issue. For example, a virtual worker in Latin America can now be paid by a European employer in minutes‚Äîat close to zero fees. Or consider a small business owner in Kenya paying for goods in Turkey without worrying about unstable currency exchanges. Remittix makes that possible using blockchain-enabled fiat settlements. Its primary mission? Remove delays, exorbitant fees, and intermediaries in the cross-border payment industry. This is particularly potent in areas where access to banks is insufficient or unstable. Most importantly, Remittix isn‚Äôt fluffy speculation‚Äîit‚Äôs constructing something with obvious demand. That‚Äôs why some analysts are calling for 10x by the end of April. Even amidst the meme coin-driven headlines, smart investors are redirecting funds to Remittix. They‚Äôre done with basing everything on market sentiment. They crave function‚Äîand Remittix provides it. Also to consider: while meme coins like DOGE and SHIB see-saw from hype within the community and Elon‚Äôs tweets, the value of Remittix lies in the number of lives that it is able to impact tangibly. The fundraising pace is indication enough that investors are taking notice. Is XRP actually going under $0.10? The prospect of purchasing XRP at under $0.10 would have been unthinkable in 2023. However, as altcoin corrections sweep across the market, some speculators are gambling on just that. Regulatory uncertainty and slow price action have weighed on XRP‚Äôs momentum. And although its use in institutional finance is still important, price support is still thinning at crucial levels. Nevertheless, this forecast is contentious. Most XRP enthusiasts believe the coin is already seriously undervalued. But the reality is, if the general market doesn‚Äôt bounce back, a drop below $0.10 isn‚Äôt entirely out of the question. For the time being, the more intelligent move might not be doubling down on XRP or even DOGE or SHIB‚Äîit could be putting capital into projects like Remittix that are still in the infancy stage. Beyond DOGE, FARTCOIN, and SHIB As meme token wars continue, DOGE remains the king‚Äîbut for how much longer? FARTCOIN has new momentum and will soon dethrone SHIB. However, during a bearish or doubting market, utility takes the day. That‚Äôs where Remittix steps in. With an increasing community, a $14.5M raise, and more than 528 million tokens sold, this presale isn‚Äôt just catching up‚Äîit‚Äôs running ahead. If you‚Äôre a DOGE fan, a would-be FARTCOIN fan, or just still clinging to SHIB, it may be time to start thinking about what‚Äôs actually next. And if the last few weeks are any guide, the answer could be Remittix.

Elizabeth Warren Predicts Market Crash,https://coinpedia.org/news/jerome-powell-may-be-fired-by-trump-elizabeth-warren-predicts-market-crash/,"The post Jerome Powell May Be Fired by Trump! Elizabeth Warren Predicts Market Crash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market in 2025 was supposed to boom, but reality hit differently. Bitcoin soared to $109K after Trump‚Äôs inauguration, only to crash back to earth as tariff fears and regulatory delays wiped out early gains. Now, as BTC struggles to hold the $84K level, Trump‚Äôs latest remarks about Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have sparked fresh concerns. ‚ÄúIt Will Crash Markets‚Äù: Warren Slams Trump‚Äôs Powell Threat Senator Elizabeth Warren, known for her sharp criticism of both Wall Street and the Federal Reserve, surprisingly stepped in to defend Powell, but only to a point. Speaking on CNBC , she made it clear that she still disagrees with Powell on many policies. However, she believes protecting the Fed‚Äôs independence is crucial for the health of the U.S. economy. ‚ÄúIf Chairman Powell can be fired by the president of the United States, it will crash markets,‚Äù Warren said bluntly from the New York Stock Exchange. Her main argument was that the central bank must operate free from political pressure. If it doesn‚Äôt, global investors could lose confidence in the U.S. system, comparing it to ‚Äúany other two-bit dictatorship.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs Truth Social Post Targets Powell, On Thursday, Trump posted on Truth Social , calling Powell ‚Äú always TOO LATE AND WRONG ‚Äù and adding that his ‚Äútermination cannot come fast enough.‚Äù Although a senior White House official later clarified that Trump‚Äôs post wasn‚Äôt an official firing attempt, the tone alone sent shockwaves through markets and among lawmakers. Powell has previously stated that a president cannot fire a Fed chair without cause , and no formal legal challenge has been made‚Äîyet. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Markets Slide as Powell Flags Stagflation Risks, Tariff Troubles; Warns of Tough Road Ahead , Trump‚Äôs Tariff Games and Powell Pressure Could Shake Global Confidence The Fed raised interest rates aggressively during Biden‚Äôs term to fight post-pandemic inflation, and while it began easing in 2024, Powell signaled recently that he‚Äôs not rushing more cuts, especially given the uncertainty surrounding Trump‚Äôs changing tariff plans. While Trump temporarily calmed markets with a 90-day pause on tariffs , once this window is over, this tariff mess can further crash the market. On the other side, if he tries to remove Powell, he might create further market instability, as warned by several senior senators. Warren‚Äôs warning isn‚Äôt just political, it‚Äôs a call to preserve the foundations of the global economy. As markets remain sensitive to both Fed signals and political noise, any future interference from the White House could do more than shake up leadership; in the long run, it might shake global investor confidence to its core. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While gold has attracted great interest among investors with its safe haven narrative amid the ongoing economic uncertainty, gold continues to see strong inflows as Bitcoin lags behind amid risk-off sentiment. At this point, while gold is rising to new record levels, Bitcoin is failing to make the expected explosion. Bitcoin Follows Gold! However, one analyst noted that the rise in gold is also a bullish signal for Bitcoin, saying that BTC tends to mirror gold‚Äôs highs over the past 150 days. While new records in gold have led to speculation on whether Bitcoin is about to rally, analyst Joe Consorti said that Bitcoin typically follows gold‚Äôs price movements within 100 to 150 days of gold reaching new ATHs. Consorti stated that when monetary expansion started, gold first reacted and rose, and then BTC followed the gold rise more strongly. As an example, Consorti pointed to the years 2027 and 2021. In 2017, Bitcoin rose to $19,120 a few months after gold witnessed a 30% increase. Similarly, gold reached a new peak near $2,075 in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic before Bitcoin surged to $69,000 in 2021. At this point, the analyst stated that Bitcoin has historically surpassed its previous ATHs during periods when gold rose, and that BTC follows the rise of gold with a 100-150 day delay each time. ‚ÄúBitcoin lags gold by about 100 to 150 days. When the uptrend starts, gold starts first, then Bitcoin follows more sharply.‚Äù Based on this trend, BTC is expected to potentially reach its new ATH between the third and fourth quarter of 2025. However, only time will tell if history repeats itself once again for Bitcoin. Although this data gives an upward signal, do not make your investment decisions based on a single data or signal.

Investors are keen to know if this token which claims to have strong fundamentals, has the capacity to recover in the near future or continue its downtrend? Let‚Äôs find out in this price prediction of The Graph. Table of Contents What is The Graph? The Graph price prediction The Graph coin price prediction: short-term outlook The Graph price prediction 2025 The Graph price prediction 2030 Since its launch, The Graph ( GRT ) has seen an all-time high of $2.84 followed by a 97.3% drop in price. At the time of writing, it is now trading at $0.0768, which is around a 80% decrease from its price of $0.03498 which was recorded 4 months ago in December 2024.

You might also like: Avalanche Incorporates The Graph to Advance Its Querying and Indexing What is The Graph? The Graph is a worldwide API and indexing protocol designed to arrange blockchain data and make it easily accessible using GraphQL. All of the public data required to create decentralized apps may be searched for, located, and published by developers using Graph Explorer. This enables developers to create serverless dApps that are fully reliant on public infrastructures. How does it work? A subgraph that outlines the structure of blockchain data for app and dApp developers to use can be defined by developers. With GRT tokens, app and dApp developers may use subgraph schemas with GraphQL to query the network. In order to guarantee that the API is constantly accessible in a decentralized fashion and that the data is served accurately, these indexers, who function as nodes, are rewarded with GRT tokens. Finding the subgraphs that are most helpful to developers is the curator‚Äôs job because there may be a lot of subgraphs available. GRT tokens are another incentive for curators to choose the best subgraph that would be helpful to others. Now let‚Äôs discuss GRT price prediction in this year and in the coming ones as well. The Graph price prediction What can be a realistic projection for the GRT token? Let‚Äôs dive into the GRT price prediction for 2025 and 2030. The Graph coin price prediction: short-term outlook According to CoinCodex‚Äôs The Graph price prediction for the near future, the token is projected to drop by -5.46% and reach $0.07355 by May 16, 2025. As of Apr. 16th, 2025, the overall sentiment of the GRT price outlook remains bearish, with 20 technical analysis indicators showing bearish signals, 6 indicating bearish trends, and 9 indicators showing neutral forecasts. The Graph price prediction 2025 For the remaining months of 2025, DigitalCoinPrice predicts that the GRT token‚Äôs price could fluctuate between $0.0690 and $0.17, and may likely hold a yearly average of $0.16. CoinCodex projects that the GRT token can trade in the price channel of $0.067349 and $0.077795 in 2025. According to Changelly‚Äôs analysis of GRT‚Äôs recent price trends, the coin is projected to have a minimum price of $0.0744 and a maximum price of $0.224 in 2025. While the general sentiment in the financial markets is that 2025 will be the year of the bull, it is important to understand that this prediction also has a chance of being wrong. BTC has already breached the $100k mark and there is a possibility that it may be at the top of this bull cycle. Hence it is advised to do your research before investing in GRT or any other cryptocurrency with the hopes of gaining on your investment in 2025. The Graph price prediction 2030 As per CoinCodex‚Äôs The Graph crypto price prediction for 2030, GRT‚Äôs price could vary between $0.001739 and $0.02186. DigitalCoinPrice expects that GRT‚Äôs price could climb to $0.36 or $0.42 by the end of 2030. Changelly‚Äôs predicts that by 2030, the GRT token could range between $1.90 and $2.24. Before trusting any source that is trying to predict The Graph price prediction for 2030, you should understand that it is a cryptocurrency and like all other tokens, the GRT token‚Äôs price can be highly volatile. 2030 is five years away and many cryptocurrencies can become obsolete in that time.

However, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications disclosed that Japan‚Äôs consumer price index (core CPI, excl. fresh food) rose to 3.2% YoY in March, up from February‚Äôs 3%. Japan‚Äôs core inflation accelerated in March due to persistent rises in food costs, complicating the central bank‚Äôs task of balancing mounting price pressures against economic risks from higher U.S. tariffs. The country‚Äôs ‚Äúcore-core‚Äù inflation rate‚Äîwhich excludes the prices of both fresh food and energy‚Äîalso increased by 0.3% (30 bps) to 2.9% in March, up from 2.6% in February. The data release coincided with ongoing trade negotiations between Japan and the U.S., as President Donald Trump announced ‚Äú big progress .‚Äù Japan faces significant 25% tariffs on auto imports from April 3 and another 25% on steel and aluminum starting March 12. Trump temporarily suspended his planned 24% ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs on Japan for 90 days, maintaining a base 10% tariff.

The inflation rate was, however, lower than the 3.7% seen in February, a drop of 0.1% (10 bps). The data released by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications came ahead of the BOJ‚Äôs policy meeting on April 30-May 1, when the bank is set to keep interest rates steady at 0.5% and cut its growth estimates as Trump‚Äôs tariffs cloud the economic outlook. According to the data, households also faced price hikes for a number of consumer goods, including gasoline, hotel bills, and chocolates. Food prices excluding fresh produce rose 6.2% in March, exceeding February‚Äôs growth rate of 5.6%. Rice prices spiked 92.5% in March from levels seen a year ago, while services prices rose 1.4% year-on-year. Of the 522 core items, 414 rose, 73 fell, and 35 remained unchanged. The number of core items that rose exceeded the previous month‚Äôs figure of 405. ‚ÄúFood prices will stay elevated for the time being due to global bad weather and higher imported food costs.‚Äù ‚Äì Takeshi Minami , chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. Non-glutinous rice (excluding Koshihikari) also rose 92.5%, marking the largest growth rate since January 1976. Additionally, hamburgers‚Äìwhose prices were revised in March due to rising logistics and labor costs‚Äìrose 5.7%, and chicken eggs surged by 5.6% due to the impact of avian flu. Kurihara says Japan needs to pay attention to Trump‚Äôs tariffs The deputy chief economist at UBS Securities, Tsuyoshi Kurihara, said Japan needed to pay close attention to the downside risk of an economic slowdown and decline in demand due to the effects of tariffs. According to Minami, Trump‚Äôs tariffs could hurt domestic and overseas economies, which the BOJ must scrutinize. He said there was an increasing chance that the BOJ‚Äôs next interest rate hike would be delayed to July or later. Analysts from Nomura Group noted on April 16 that they would adjust their forecast from expecting two rate hikes to anticipating just one hike by the BOJ between now and March 2027. The Nomura analysts also foresee Japan‚Äôs real GDP growing at nearly zero in the third quarter of 2025 due to the tariff impacts. As per Reuters, the hit to Japan‚Äôs consumption from rising living costs will add to headaches for policymakers struggling to quantify the potential damage from higher U.S. tariffs that threaten to derail a modest recovery in the country‚Äôs export-reliant economy.

The fund will offer professional investors regulated access to XRP without the need to hold or trade the cryptocurrency directly. HashKey‚Äôs XRP Tracker Fund Using CF Benchmarks as its reference index, the fund is designed to give institutional-grade exposure to XRP and allows monthly subscriptions and redemptions through either cash or in-kind contributions. ‚ÄúXRP stands out as one of the most innovative cryptocurrencies in today‚Äôs market, attracting global enterprises who use it to transact, tokenize, and store value,‚Äù said Vivien Wong, Partner, Liquid Funds at HashKey Capital. ‚ÄúWith the first XRP Tracker Fund available in the region, we simplify access to XRP, catering to the demand for investment opportunities in the very best digital assets.‚Äù XRP was chosen for its use in cross-border payments, offering faster and cheaper transactions than traditional systems like SWIFT. It also supports tokenization of real-world assets through the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and is already used by several financial institutions and businesses globally. This marks the venture capital firm‚Äôs third crypto tracking product, following previous Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) funds launched with Bosera. If it gets regulatory approval, the XRP Tracker Fund could be converted into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the next one to two years. Further, the two companies plan to collaborate on other investment products: DeFi solutions for cross-border payments and asset tokenization projects. Another idea under consideration is the creation of a money market fund on XRPL. Expanding Blockchain Adoption Wong said the partnership would combine both companies‚Äô strengths, HashKey Capital‚Äôs network of investors, regulators, and financial institutions in Asia, and Ripple‚Äôs experience in blockchain and digital payments. She added that this collaboration would support joint efforts in areas like enterprise blockchain adoption and financial infrastructure. Fiona Murray, managing director of APAC at Ripple, said more institutional investors are looking for regulated crypto products, and this fund is a step toward meeting that demand in Asia. She also noted that the Asian firm‚Äôs strong regional presence could help support broader crypto and blockchain growth. The announcement comes as the four-year legal battle between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reached a conclusion with the former agreeing to pay a $50 million fine. Now that the case has been resolved, the path appears open for XRP ETFs in the U.S., with at least seven firms preparing to launch them. Nate Geraci previously stated that companies like BlackRock and Fidelity may soon file for products tracking Ripple‚Äôs native token.

With markets on a shortened schedule for the Easter holiday, today‚Äôs update is shortened as well. CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas will be back to its regular size on Monday, April 21. Enjoy the holiday! By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) It's Easter. Traditional markets are closed in many parts of the world and plenty of people are taking a break from work, and that's keeping crypto markets in check as well. The CoinDesk 20 Index ( CD20 ), a measure of the biggest, most active cryptocurrencies, has gained less than 0.1% in the past 24 hours with bitcoin ( BTC ) up just 0.1%. That's a pretty muted response to calls from President Donald Trump for the removal of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell . Trump criticized Powell over his reluctance to cut interest rates, further adding to the economy uncertainty that has left bitcoin treading water and seen Wall Street piling onto gold. Trump, on his social media platform Truth Social, said Powell was ‚Äú too late ‚Äù in lowering interest rates, saying his ‚Äútermination cannot come fast enough!‚Äù The President‚Äôs words come after Powell said the central bank sees unemployment and inflation rising because of the tariffs Trump imposed on most other countries. The tit-for-tat has further raised uncertainty, to the point the S&P 500 closed the shortened trading week up just 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 0.1%. ""Right now, markets are extremely reactionary to White House decision making and are poised to remain that way for the foreseeable future,‚Äù Ira Auerbach, head of tandem at Offchain Labs and former head of digital assets as Nasdaq, told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúTrump's push for rate cuts amid tariff-driven inflation risks could reignite bitcoin's original 'hedge against eroding purchasing power' narrative. Its recent risk-off behavior may be short-lived as monetary policy uncertainty intensifies."" For the time being, though, the hedge against currency debasement and uncertainty appears to be gold. The precious metal‚Äôs recent bull run has meant that, over the last 20 years, it‚Äôs outperforming the S&P 500 . That‚Äôs including dividends. For crypto investors, signals are mixed . While on the macro front uncertainty reigns, under the Trump administration regulatory outlook has been improving and institutions have shown more comfort with the space. ‚ÄúIt is probably sound to 'let the dust settle' as tariff implementations and bilateral negotiations unfold,‚Äù dYdX Foundation CEO Charles d‚ÄôHaussy told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúMarket participants' consensus seems to signal central banks' action past the summer.‚Äù Stay alert!

Since token-launch protocol Pump.fun introduced its trading platform PumpSwap in March, volumes have skyrocketed. According to Artemis data , Solana-based Pump.fun was seeing roughly $110 million of trading volume a day before the PumpSwap debut. That figure exploded to $650 million on April 17, with $444 million being traded on PumpSwap. Daily transaction volumes on the platform now top 40,000, roughly double the figures seen before PumpSwap‚Äôs launch, Dune data shows. The heightened trading volume helped Pump.fun‚Äôs 24-hour revenue top that of layer-1 network Tron, bringing in roughly $2 million over the period. The figure is also above that of platforms like Hyperliquid and Aave. Outside of Solana, other networks have seen their share of trading activity. Even Nasdaq-listed exchange Coinbase found itself embroiled in alleged front-running after three wallets bought its ‚ÄúBase is for everyone‚Äù token before the launch was announced.

Bitwise‚Äôs Q1 2025 Crypto Market Review revealed that stablecoin transaction volume slightly exceeded Visa‚Äôs for the first time , signaling a major shift in how digital assets are being used. Although crypto prices declined following a brief post-election rally, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan described the quarter as politically and regulatorily ‚Äúhistorically positive,‚Äù thanks to a pro-crypto U.S. president and the SEC dropping several high-profile lawsuits. Stablecoin usage jumped 30% , with assets under management hitting a record $218 billion , and the total market cap reaching $237 billion . Hougan suggested the future potential of stablecoins is vastly underestimated. Meanwhile, the value of tokenized real-world assets grew from $14 billion to $19 billion, nearly doubling year-over-year, driven by rising demand for tokenized U.S. Treasuries. DeFi also saw renewed investor interest. Projects in the decentralized finance space drew 18% of Q1 venture capital funding, matching infrastructure investments.

It allows users to trade and launch tokens within the Pi ecosystem, without needing third-party platforms or external exchanges. Its launch is perfectly timed, coming just a few months after Pi Network entered its Open Network phase, which allows real applications and projects to go live on the blockchain. The launch of PiDaoSwap has already made waves in the Pi community. In the past 24 hours alone, PI‚Äôs price has risen by 1.1%, and in the last two weeks, the token is up more than 10%. Right now, PI is priced at $0.611, still about 79% below its all-time high, which shows there‚Äôs potential for future growth as the network and its apps gain traction. The Road Ahead With the release of PiDaoSwap, the Pi Network enters a new phase‚Äîone that supports real DeFi activity, deeper community engagement, and more serious development on the Mainnet. As more users and developers join the ecosystem, expect to see new projects, more tools, and increasing adoption.

43485005,https://timestabloid.com/?p=64408,1744975517,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Uphold CEO Drops A Bombshell About Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD and Gold,https://timestabloid.com/uphold-ceo-drops-a-bombshell-about-ripples-rlusd-and-gold/,"GA Spark (@1themoonshot), a well-known entrepreneur and crypto investor, recently shared a video clip featuring Nancy Beaton, the President of Uphold U.S. and Chief Revenue & Marketing Officer at Uphold Global. In the clip, Beaton discusses the versatility of Uphold‚Äôs trading platform, particularly emphasizing how users can convert RLUSD across multiple assets. According to Beaton, ‚ÄúYou can take RLUSD to Bitcoin, Bitcoin to RLUSD, you could take RLUSD to gold,‚Äù summarizing that users can trade ‚Äúanything to anything.‚Äù This comment led GA Spark to assert that users could convert RLUSD directly into gold and that every RLUSD transaction would automatically bridge through XRP. LISTEN UP! Uphold CEO Nancy Beaton just dropped a bomb: ""You could convert $RLUSD into GOLD!"" And guess what? Every $RLUSD transaction will automatically bridge through #XRP ! The future is unfolding right now are you paying attention? pic.twitter.com/2OyRNZKALz ‚Äî GA Spark (@1themoonshoot) April 16, 2025 He described the feature as a major development and urged followers to pay attention to a transformation in how digital assets interact. While XRP serves as a bridge currency in many cases, GA Spark‚Äôs assertion was wrong and was quickly corrected by experts in the community. Addressing the Misinterpretation In response, Crypto Eri (@sentosumosaba), a respected member of the XRP community, provided important clarification. She noted that while RLUSD can be used to buy various assets on Uphold, the assumption that every RLUSD transaction bridges through XRP is incorrect. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Crypto Eri pointed out that RLUSD is issued on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger (XRPL). She explained that bridging through XRP would only happen if the RLUSD transaction is on the XRPL and if the trading pair includes XRP or if it represents the most efficient path for the transaction. This mirrors previous statements made by Ripple‚Äôs Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz. Schwartz explained that each asset would be used where it fits best. Schwartz has previously highlighted XRP‚Äôs unique role in helping the ecosystem function. While the asset is crucial to the working of the XRPL, Beaton‚Äôs comments were primarily about the versatility of Uphold‚Äôs cryptocurrency exchange and not XRP or the XRPL. Clarifying Uphold‚Äôs Role and How Bridging Works Uphold allows users to trade between several assets, including cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, and commodities like gold. The ability to convert anything to anything is one of many features, but the mechanism by which these conversions occur depends on the platform‚Äôs routing logic and liquidity availability. While the XRPL is designed for interoperability and efficient asset exchange, it‚Äôs not a universal bridge for all RLUSD transactions by default. The automatic use of XRP as a bridge asset only occurs under certain conditions, including the presence of trading pairs and when it offers the best path in terms of cost and speed.

On April 18, Astar Network announced that it reduced the blockchain‚Äôs base staking rewards to 10% from 25% to curb token inflation. The company said the change promotes a more stable annual percentage rate (APR) for users as staking inches closer to a more ideal ratio. The firm said this ensures that rewards ‚Äúremain meaningful‚Äù without causing excessive inflation. ‚ÄúThis change lowers automatic token issuance, reducing overall inflationary pressure while maintaining strong incentives for users to stake their ASTR,‚Äù Astar Network wrote. Astar Network highlights key changes to its tokenomics. Source: Astar Network Astar Network implements inflation-control mechanisms Unlike Bitcoin, which has a fixed total supply, the ASTR token operates under a dynamic inflation model without a cap on its maximum token supply. As the blockchain operates, it emits more tokens, increasing the supply. Having no fixed supply can often create downward pressure on the token‚Äôs value over time. This is especially true if the demand for the token does not keep up. To address this, Astar is introducing several new inflation-control mechanisms. Apart from lowering staking rewards, Astar also started routing token emissions into a parameter that governs total value locked (TVL)-based rewards like decentralized application staking. This means that DApp staking APRs will become ‚Äúmore predictable‚Äù over time, offering stability to stakers. Astar also introduced a new minimum token emission threshold of 2.5% to ensure it doesn‚Äôt exceed a sustainable baseline. With continued transaction fee burning, Astar said it would also contribute to reward predictability. According to Astar, the changes have already lowered its annual inflation rate from 4.86% to 4.32%. It also lowered its total ASTR token emitted per block from 153.95 to 136.67 tokens. This reduces the token‚Äôs estimated annual emissions by 11%, going from 405 million to 360 million.

CoinGecko data shows that on April 7, the ASTR token declined to a new low of $0.02. The price is 93.8% lower than its peak three years ago, when it reached $0.42 on Jan. 17, 2022. In December 2024, the token rallied along with the rest of the market, hitting a high of $0.09. Since then, the crypto asset had continuously dropped in value before hitting the new all-time low.

However, the situation has not changed and the depeg in Synthetix-based stablecoin sUSD continues. This is the stablecoin‚Äôs second decline in less than a year, reigniting concerns about the issuer‚Äôs stability mechanisms. The recent decline of sUSD has been attributed to oversupply in the market, with Synthetix core developer Fenway saying that investors are dumping the asset in large quantities. Synthetix founder Kain Warwick said the team has put in place new mechanisms to lock in the fixed price. However, these measures did not work and the depeg in sUSD continued. CoinMarketCap data shows the sUSD depeg deepening further, with sUSD trading at $0.694. The Synthetix team has not been able to fully address the depeg and resolve the issue. The outlook for sUSD remains worrisome, making investors nervous. Because sUSD is not the only stablecoin that has experienced a downturn. While Bitcoin (BTC) and its altcoins suddenly lost their peg to the dollar in 2022 and then collapsed, Terra's algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) continues to be remembered as one of the biggest downturns. *This is not investment advice.

Either way, it was more than a typical scammer with bad grammar and worse audio; it was a next-level phishing attempt that could‚Äôve taken control of his device. The attacker showed up on Zoom using live recordings of someone Kenny knew, and the camera was on with a familiar face smiling‚Ä¶ but totally silent. Despite the cyber attack on the founder, Manta Network (MANTA) price rode an upward rally of around 5% in the last 24 hours. Kenny Li dodges Zoom hack trap Kenny Li in an X post stated that he got targeted by Lazarus after a known contact reached out to him for a chat over Telegram. The conversation turned into a scheduled Zoom call where the attacker asked him for camera access. In the call, there were team members who had their cameras on, and Manta founder could see their faces. He mentioned that ‚ÄúEverything looked very real. But I couldn‚Äôt hear them.‚Äù Then came the ‚ÄúZoom update required‚Äù prompt, with a script file download but Kenny dipped it instantly. The Manta founder tried verifying via Telegram and asked the attacker to call him. The scammer ghosted, deleted the chat, and vanished, but not before Kenny snagged screenshots of the whole thing. He is pretty sure the video wasn‚Äôt AI-generated, as it looked like real footage lifted from earlier Zoom calls. The real person‚Äôs accounts had been reportedly compromised by none other than North Korea‚Äôs infamous Lazarus Group. Be extremely careful.

The decision comes amid mounting pressure from international investigations and internal concerns over operating in an increasingly hostile environment. Meanwhile, Bybit, the direct victim of the February exploit, is moving to streamline its operations by shutting down a wide range of Web3 services, including its wallets, NFT marketplace, and decentralized exchange. Crypto Exchange eXch to Shut Down Amid Allegations of Laundering Funds From Historic Bybit Hack Crypto exchange eXch has announced it will permanently cease operations on May 1, following explosive allegations linking the platform to one of the largest crypto thefts in history ‚Äî the $1.4 billion Bybit exploit. In a public notice published on April 17, the embattled platform cited mounting international pressure and internal consensus as primary drivers for its decision to shut down. According to the statement, the exchange‚Äôs management voted to ‚Äúcease and retreat‚Äù after a series of reports alleged that North Korea‚Äôs notorious Lazarus Group used eXch to launder roughly $35 million of the stolen assets. The company said it is now the subject of ‚Äúan active transatlantic operation,‚Äù possibly involving intelligence agencies, which seeks to dismantle the exchange‚Äôs infrastructure and bring criminal charges against individuals connected to it. ‚ÄúEven though we have been able to operate despite some failed attempts to shut down our infrastructure... we don‚Äôt see any point in operating in a hostile environment where we are the target of SIGINT [Signals Intelligence],‚Äù the company‚Äôs statement read. Ties to the Lazarus Group: Denial, Then Concession The Lazarus Group, a state-sponsored hacking syndicate tied to the North Korean regime, has been responsible for numerous cyberattacks on financial institutions and crypto platforms. Initially, eXch denied any involvement with the Lazarus Group following accusations from prominent blockchain investigators. However, the platform later admitted to unknowingly processing what it called an ‚Äúinsignificant portion‚Äù of the hacked funds. While the platform‚Äôs leaders maintained that they were unaware of the origins of the tainted assets, critics argued that the exchange‚Äôs lax compliance and privacy-first posture created an ideal laundering route for cybercriminals. In its farewell message, eXch took aim at industry peers, claiming that exchanges which comply with strict anti-money laundering (AML) standards are ‚Äúabusing customers with nonsensical policies.‚Äù This stance, the company argued, positioned eXch as a target ‚Äî not just for regulators, but for sophisticated intelligence networks that have allegedly attempted to compromise or disable its systems. The wider saga began with the February 2025 hack of Bybit, which rapidly escalated into the largest digital asset heist in history. The attackers siphoned off $1.4 billion from the platform, triggering a massive wave of withdrawals that totaled over $5 billion in the days that followed. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou attempted to calm user fears by assuring the public that the company had sufficient funds to cover losses if recovery efforts fell short. Bybit offered more than $2 million in rewards for information leading to the recovery or freezing of stolen assets. As of April 10, the exchange had managed to claw back enough credibility to return to its pre-hack market share of roughly 7%. Privacy vs. Compliance: An Industry at a Crossroads The shutdown of eXch raises pressing questions about the balance between user privacy and regulatory oversight in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While many decentralized and privacy-focused platforms position themselves as defenders of financial freedom, their resistance to implementing stricter AML and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols has made them ripe targets for abuse by bad actors. The Lazarus Group‚Äôs continued targeting of under-regulated platforms sheds light on the geopolitical dimension of cryptocurrency crime ‚Äî a landscape where hacking isn‚Äôt just about profit, but also about state strategy. The group has been previously linked to the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack and the $600 million Axie Infinity (Ronin Network) hack in 2022. Bybit Winds Down Web3 Services Amid Strategic Overhaul Following $1.4B Hack Meanwhile, crypto exchange giant Bybit is taking another bold step in its post-hack restructuring strategy, announcing it will terminate nearly all of its Web3 services by May 31, including its multi-chain decentralized exchange, loyalty rewards program, and popular wallet features. The move follows the earlier shutdown of its non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace and comes just months after the catastrophic $1.4 billion exploit rocked the platform. In an April 16 statement , Bybit confirmed the phased sunset of key Web3 components, signaling a dramatic pivot away from its previously expansive on-chain ecosystem. ‚ÄúWe will be optimizing our current Web3 product and service offerings to focus on delivering high-quality services to our users,‚Äù the company said. The sweeping shutdown includes Cloud Wallet, a hosted custodial wallet for user assets, and Keyless Wallet, a non-custodial option based on multiparty computation that eliminated the need for seed phrases ‚Äî a flagship security product in Bybit‚Äôs Web3 suite. Both wallets will be decommissioned on May 31. Additionally, Bybit will shut down: DEX Pro, its multi-chain decentralized exchange Swap & Bridge, a cross-chain swapping widget Web3 Points, its loyalty program that rewarded on-chain activity with fee discounts and airdrop boosts NFT Pro, a decentralized NFT marketplace Inscription Marketplace, focused on digital artifacts and Bitcoin inscriptions Fiat-to-Crypto On-Ramp, the gateway for new crypto entrants Apex Pro Gateway, which allowed users access to a derivatives-focused DEX Initial DEX Offering (IDO) service, used for early-stage token fundraising The final shutdown date for these services is April 28, with all user data and assets expected to be safely retrievable or migrated prior to that date. Strategic Refocusing: Back to Core Competencies The decision to trim its Web3 ambitions appears to be a direct response to the immense operational stress caused by the February hack. Although CEO Ben Zhou assured users at the time that the exchange was ‚Äúsolvent‚Äù and able to cover the full loss ‚Äî with all client assets backed 1:1 ‚Äî the fallout has pushed Bybit into a leaner, more focused strategy. While the closures represent a retreat from its prior Web3 roadmap, Bybit is not turning its back entirely on crypto innovation. The exchange has recently partnered with Avalon, a Bitcoin-based yield protocol, to offer BTC yield products on its platform. The integration enables users to earn fixed returns through arbitrage opportunities within Avalon‚Äôs institutional-grade lending network. This selective approach hints that Bybit is moving from building its own Web3 infrastructure to leveraging external protocols that are already optimized for specific use cases. Bybit‚Äôs decision mirrors similar moves by other major crypto players in 2025. Earlier this month, NFT marketplace X2Y2 also shut down operations amid declining volumes and rising compliance costs. The once-hyped NFT space has faced a sharp contraction as speculative interest fades and regulatory scrutiny intensifies. Despite rumors that Bybit has begun charging up to $1.4 million to list tokens on its centralized exchange ‚Äî a claim made by an anonymous user on X ‚Äî the company strongly denied the accusation. The exchange insists its listing process remains merit-based and subject to rigorous due diligence. A Market Recovery and a Reputation to Rebuild Despite the hack, Bybit‚Äôs market share has already rebounded, signaling a resilient user base and strong institutional trust. Much of this recovery has been attributed to aggressive bounty programs, forensic investigations, and operational transparency in the aftermath of the hack. Bybit has paid over $2 million to bounty hunters who helped trace and freeze a portion of the stolen funds. By mid-March, approximately 89% of the $1.4 billion had been either recovered or frozen. The platform's decision to narrow its focus could further solidify its core offerings, especially at a time when crypto regulation, security, and reliability are becoming key differentiators in the eyes of both retail and institutional investors.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|AXS|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-18 11:30:00

The project demonstrates strong market potential through its acquisition of 8,400 investors who have already joined. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands in phase 4 at $0.025 per token but is prepared to advance to $0.03 during phase 5 while delivering quick profits to initial buyers. Mutuum Finance secured endorsements from Grok 3 and DeepSeek AI for a DeFi lending system that projects a remarkable 12,590% price increase to $3.15 after launch until 2025 when it will exceed Solana (SOL) value. A Certik smart contract audit currently takes place on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) while social channels prepare to disseminate audit results to increase user trust. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Ignites The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale moves quickly due to its exceptional lending model.

Each solitary investor can access decentralized finance solutions through Mutuum Finance (MUTM) while Solana (SOL) depends on institutional backing. MtTokens operated by the platform represent user deposits that build up interest for passive income generation. Investment demand intensifies due to the upcoming price increase to $0.03 which coincides with phase 4‚Äôs decline. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) solidifies its position as a top leader in DeFi 2025 through the continued Certik audit process. Skyrocketing Potential Awaits The cryptocurrencies MUTM and Grok 3 together with DeepSeek AI will fuel Mutuum Finance‚Äôs astonishing 2025 transformation which will generate a thrilling increase of 12,590%.

China‚Äôs ‚ÄòSecret‚Äô Bitcoin Strategy In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Leviathan claimed that China plans to sell off its Bitcoin holdings, potentially driving the price down to $40,000. According to the analyst, this move is just the beginning of a broader scheme. Despite the Chinese government‚Äôs public stance against cryptocurrency trading, local authorities have found a workaround, he alleges. The expert asserts that they have been quietly cashing in on confiscated Bitcoin, which has led to an ‚Äúunderground fiscal strategy‚Äù that operates in ‚Äúlegal ambiguity.‚Äù Related Reading: TRUMP Memecoin Unlock Set To Release 40 Million Coins This Thursday Currently, Chinese authorities are reported to hold approximately 194,000 BTC, making them the second-largest government holder of Bitcoin, just behind the United States. Leviathan highlights that while the Chinese government publicly denounces cryptocurrency, it simultaneously benefits financially from its underground sales. Local governments are reportedly improvising their strategies, with some engaging private tech firms to liquidate the confiscated Bitcoin on offshore exchanges. Others, allegedly maintain a more ‚Äúclandestine approach.‚Äù The expert provides an example of a relatively unknown company in Shenzhen, Jiafenxiang, that has allegedly facilitated over $400 million in crypto sales on behalf of various city governments, converting the proceeds into yuan and transferring the funds back to local finance departments. Hong Kong Emerges As Potential Haven For China‚Äôs Confiscated BTC In 2023, China witnessed a record surge in crypto-related crimes, with over $59 billion tied to illegal activities and more than 3,000 money laundering cases prosecuted. Amidst this backdrop, local governments are increasingly reliant on the revenue generated from fines and confiscations ‚Äî a significant portion of which comes from liquidated cryptocurrencies. However, the need for funds is at odds with the government‚Äôs public anti-crypto stance, forcing officials to offload coins abroad through intermediaries while hoping for minimal interference from Beijing. There have been discussions among judges, lawyers, and police about the need for a consistent national policy regarding seized cryptocurrencies. Some have proposed that the central bank take control over these assets, while others have suggested establishing a sovereign crypto fund. Related Reading: Trump‚Äôs World Liberty Financial Teams Up With DWF Labs For $25M WLFI Token Investment Leviathan has pointed to Hong Kong, which, with its more favorable legal framework for cryptocurrencies, has emerged as a potential destination for China‚Äôs Bitcoin stockpile. This situation presents a unique challenge for China, as the contradiction between its public denouncement of cryptocurrencies and its private profit from them becomes increasingly apparent. As the US moves toward legitimizing cryptocurrencies at the federal level, including discussions on strategic reserves under President Donald Trump and his ongoing support for crypto, China may find itself compelled to respond, the expert asserts. Ultimately, Leviathan said that the fate of China‚Äôs 194,000 Bitcoin holdings will not only shape national policies but could also send ripples across the global financial landscape. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $84,800, registering a 5% surge in the weekly time frame.

In 2024, scams spanned DeFi projects, NFTs, and memecoins. But this year, it‚Äôs the memecoins that have become the primary vehicle for deception. One standout example is the case of Libra, which skyrocketed to a $4.56 billion market cap on February 14 after Argentina‚Äôs President Javier Milei endorsed it on X. The endorsement, however, was short-lived. Once Milei deleted the post, the token crashed by over 94%, raising strong suspicions of a coordinated pump-and-dump. ‚ÄúProjects can now explode overnight with just a viral post,‚Äù Gherghelas warned. ‚ÄúThat speed makes due diligence more critical than ever.‚Äù While blockchain transparency offers tools to spot red flags‚Äîlike unverified contracts, anonymous teams, or sudden wallet activity‚ÄîGherghelas stressed that awareness is still the most powerful shield. ‚ÄúAs the industry evolves, so do the tactics of bad actors,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe may never eliminate rug pulls entirely, but we can blunt their impact through education and vigilance.‚Äù The post Rug Pulls Decline in Number, But Grow More Ruthless in 2025 appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Finance and Business News|Crypto pump and dump|Rug pulls,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|OM,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-04-18 11:30:22

The meeting began on Wednesday in Washington, where Japan‚Äôs economy minister Ryosei Akazawa sat down with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson to launch the bilateral discussions. The meeting took a sharp turn when Trump walked in unannounced and demanded that currency policy be addressed directly. This followed his public accusation last month that Japan had been intentionally weakening the yen to gain an unfair edge over US exporters. Kato denies currency manipulation before Washington trip The official agenda had already been shaped by Trump‚Äôs White House, which insisted on putting exchange rate manipulation front and center. That was after Trump accused Tokyo of playing dirty with its currency to gain a lopsided trade advantage. Although Akazawa later claimed the yen wasn‚Äôt discussed that day, he also said such issues were better suited for a different table‚Äîspecifically, the one that Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato is headed for next week. Kato is scheduled to fly to Washington for the IMF and World Bank spring meetings, where he may have a separate one-on-one with Bessent. He responded to the currency accusations on Friday while speaking in parliament, directly pushing back against Trump‚Äôs claim that Japan weakens its yen on purpose. ‚ÄúJapan does not manipulate the currency market to intentionally weaken the yen, as seen by the fact our latest action was to conduct yen-buying intervention,‚Äù Kato said when lawmakers pressed him on Trump‚Äôs comments. He acknowledged the US interest in discussing exchange rates but said no date had been set for his possible meeting with Bessent. These bilateral meetings are expected to be the main forum where the US and Japan get into the technical weeds of currency disputes, tucked under the broader umbrella of tariff negotiations. But the very mention of Trump‚Äôs demand has already kicked up tension among financial analysts and market watchers. Many of them say any forced change in the yen-dollar balance could blow back on both countries. Some of the risk, they warn , is baked into Japan‚Äôs fragile recovery. Forcing the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates faster to boost the yen could crush that recovery and stomp all over the central bank‚Äôs independence. Another risky decision would be dumping US dollars to raise the yen‚Äôs value. But that would involve Japan cashing out billions from US debt markets right when things are unstable, creating ripple effects neither country can afford. Wall Street watches for dollar devaluation threat Citigroup analysts are already watching the situation closely. In a note this week, Osamu Takashima, a currency strategist at the bank, warned that Japan would likely be a top target if Trump‚Äôs administration tries to engineer a global dollar devaluation. That plan, which has been unofficially labeled the ‚ÄúMar-a-Lago Accord,‚Äù would aim to make US goods cheaper overseas. ‚ÄúAt this point we do not see a ‚ÄòMar-a-Lago Accord‚Äô as a concrete risk,‚Äù Takashima wrote. ‚ÄúHowever, countries such as Japan, which have sizeable foreign currency reserves and whose currency is undervalued, would tend to be the target in this case.‚Äù The yen has already been gaining strength on the back of speculation that the US might pull Japan into a currency realignment plan. Traders and economists believe Trump is looking to shrink the massive US trade deficit, and going after the yen is one way to do it. When Trump spoke in March, he said he had warned both Japan and China not to keep devaluing their currencies. ‚ÄúThey could not continue to reduce the value of their currencies, as doing so would be unfair to the United States,‚Äù he said at the time.

Speaking in Milan, he said these digital assets let people make international payments in dollars without needing a U.S. bank account, which could reduce the euro‚Äôs role in global trade. He urged EU leaders to strengthen the euro‚Äôs global position , highlighting the digital euro project as a critical step in limiting Europe‚Äôs reliance on foreign financial tools. Meanwhile, the U.S. is working on new stablecoin laws.

Cryptocurrency research firm Galaxy Research has come up with a new proposal to solve the long-standing problem of how to reduce inflation under Solana‚Äôs administration. At this point, Galaxy Research suggested staggered voting to resolve the Solana inflation debate and increase consensus on the inflation rate. ‚ÄúTo reduce SOL inflation, we introduced a new Solana proposal called Multiple Choice Share Weighting Aggregation (MESA): a more market-based approach to reaching agreement on the rate of future SOL emissions. This system is simple: Even if most people agree that inflation should be reduced, they cannot agree on how much it should be reduced. This is what happened with the previous proposal, SIMD-228, which had support in principle but was rejected because of disagreement on the inflation rate.‚Äù The proposed MESA mechanism allows validators to vote on a range of deflation rate options rather than just a simple yes or no, with the final outcome being determined by a stake-weighted average rather than a binary vote. Galaxy Research‚Äôs MESA proposal aims to accelerate the Solana network‚Äôs progress toward its long-term inflation target of 1.5%. While the Solana network‚Äôs inflation rate currently sits around 4.6%, it does not change Galaxy Research‚Äôs ultimate inflation target of 1.5%, it simply provides the network with a more practical path to achieve that target.

Unlike the stock market which is closed on Good Friday, the cryptocurrency market does not close for the holidays . First things first ‚Äî let‚Äôs examine the present state of affairs. At press time on, April 18, Bitcoin was changing hands at $84,560, after a 0.28% uptick on the daily chart that has brought weekly gains up to 2.34%. BTC price 1-day and 1-week charts. Source: Finbold BTC volume has already seen a steady decline typical of holidays. Lower trading volume tends to weaken price movements in either direction. However, we have to work with what we have at hand ‚Äî so here‚Äôs our Bitcoin price prediction for Easter 2025. Bitcoin forecast for Easter 2025 The local level of resistance on the weekly Bitcoin chart stands at $85,500, while price has found local support at $83,000. Accordingly, it would take a 1.16% move to the upside to test resistance, and a 1.84% move to the downside to test support. As of the time of writing, BTC‚Äôs relative strength index ( RSI ) stood at 50.29 ‚Äî an almost perfect midpoint between oversold conditions seen at levels below 30, and overbought conditions seen at levels above 70. Moreover, plotting a line across the lower highs seen on April 17 and 18, as well as the lower lows, reveals what appears to be a falling wedge pattern. This is a bullish chart pattern ‚Äî but with volume having cooled off, its legitimacy is up for debate. If it is legitimate, however, then we will likely see a retesting of resistance by Easter 2025. BTC price chart with technical analysis. Source: Finbold / TradingView Currently, Bitcoin‚Äôs 50-day moving average ( MA ) stands at $87,039, while the 200-day MA is at $80,358, which supports a bullish outlook. A successful retest of resistance, followed by a move above the 50-day MA would further bolster the bull case. Renowned technical analyst Rudo Viljoen has highlighted the fact that no major stopgaps exist between $83,000 and $71,000 ‚Äî and that a fall below local support could lead to Bitcoin crashing 16% by Easter 2025. If #bitcoin falls below 83k, the probability is that we could see 71k this Easter weekend‚Ä¶ https://t.co/IxslPEOo10 pic.twitter.com/wNyTzuiSpV ‚Äî RudoViljoen (@TheChartArtist) April 17, 2025 With that being said, a true, meaningful break below $83,000 remains unlikely, especially with weakened volume, outside of a bearish catalyst in the form of a negative geopolitical or macro development.

In its April 17 LinkedIn post , DFX Swiss, a company which offers crypto-to-cash solutions, announced that the Spar location in the Swedish city of Zug has officially gone live on BTC Map ‚Äî a platform tracking businesses worldwide that accept Bitcoin ( BTC ). DFX Swiss has enabled this payment system using a new tool called OpenCryptoPay. ‚ÄúThis SPAR location is among the first supermarkets in Switzerland where you can pay directly at the checkout using Bitcoin (via LNURL), thanks to our new #OpenCryptoPay solution ‚Äì an open P2P standard for in-person crypto payments,‚Äù the company wrote.

In a LinkedIn post, Rahim Taghizadegan, director of the Bitcoin Association Switzerland, shared a video demonstrating just how simple it is to pay with BTC at Spar. If the pilot in Zug proves successful, Spar could expand Bitcoin payments across Switzerland ‚Äî or potentially roll it out globally.

Although physical gold is accessible in the form of jewelry, gold bars and coins, many industry executives are concerned about aspects like its quality, liquidity when selling, and buying at a premium above spot prices. On the other hand, gold advocates are confident that the precious metal is much easier to buy than Bitcoin ( BTC ), given the complexities of storing private keys and a steep learning curve for new crypto investors. Both Bitcoin and gold are available in the form of tokenized assets , exchange-traded funds (ETFs ) and other equity instruments, but the question of owning these assets in the physical form exposes some differences. Community: Buying Bitcoin is easier and faster ‚ÄúBuying Bitcoin is significantly easier and faster than buying physical gold,‚Äù Ross Shemeliak, co-founder of the tokenization platform Stobox, told Cointelegraph. He referred to Bitcoin‚Äôs instant and 24/7 availability, no need for vaults, while gold is associated with additional costs like transportation, storage, verification and resale. Adam Lowe, chief of product at the self-custody firm CompoSecure, agreed that buying physical gold is subject to many challenges and additional costs. ‚ÄúThe first is maintaining quality, assuring the purity is accurate,‚Äù Lowe said, adding that investors have to rely on the reputation of dealers and the supply chain when buying physical gold. Related: Bitcoin may rival gold as inflation hedge over next decade ‚Äî Adam Back ‚ÄúSelling liquidity is also an issue as you have to find a buyer and will most likely pay a discount relative to the market price per ounce,‚Äù he continued, adding that self-custodied Bitcoin has none of these issues. As well as limited liquidity, retail investors in physical gold face widened spreads, Shemeliak said, as they often have to buy at a premium above the market price of gold. Gold advocate: Bitcoin self-custody is not easy Unlike crypto investors, traditional finance (TradFi) investors and analysts are not so excited about self-custody opportunities offered by Bitcoin. ‚ÄúBitcoin could be very easy to buy if you have everything set up already, but if you don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs very difficult,‚Äù Rafi Farber, publisher of the gold-focused marketplace service End Game Investor, told Cointelegraph. Farber, who has emerged as one of the biggest Bitcoin critics , referred to challenges for investors around Bitcoin self-custody, which requires holders to safely store the private key or risk losing access to the coins entirely. While dealing with a self-custodial wallet, users have to ‚Äúremember a string of random words or copy it down and put it in a safe, then copy and paste a gibberish code,‚Äù Farber said. ‚ÄúAnd if you lose any of the codes or the power goes out for whatever reason you‚Äôre screwed,‚Äù he added. Self-custody wallet providers offer onboarding sessions for $99 per hour. Source: Trezor Farber‚Äôs concerns over the challenges of self-custody are not without reason. Trezor, one of the most prominent self-custody wallet providers, admits that usability remains one of the key issues faced by self-custodial wallets. While some have tried to offer simplified self-custody options , others insist that holding a private key is the only way to actually own a cryptocurrency, which requires onboarding and a learning curve ‚Äî but doesn‚Äôt come without its own costs, too. Is Bitcoin a direct competitor to gold? On the other hand, physical gold is ‚Äúvery easy to buy,‚Äù Farber said, suggesting options like coins or jewelry shops. ‚ÄúYes, buying a gold coin at a jewelry or coin shop is easy ‚Äî but that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve made a sound investment,‚Äù Stobox‚Äôs Shemeliak countered: ‚ÄúWithout verified origin, proper assay, secure storage, and a liquid resale market, you‚Äôve likely bought a souvenir, not a serious store of value.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn contrast, digital assets like Bitcoin or tokenized gold offer transparency, liquidity and verifiability,‚Äù he added. Shemeliak doesn‚Äôt see Bitcoin and gold as direct competitors either. ‚ÄúGold will always have historical value ‚Äî but Bitcoin is building financial infrastructure for the next 100 years,‚Äù he stated. At the time of publication, the price of spot gold stood at $3,327, up nearly 27% year-to-date (YTD) as it continues breaking new highs, according to TradingView. The picture is less appealing for Bitcoin, which reached new highs around $110,000 in December 2024. Bitcoin is down 10% YTD, trading at $84,525 at publication, according to CoinGecko.

With volume declining and price nearing a pivotal area, traders are watching closely for either a strong rejection or a volume-backed breakout. This move could define the short-term trend going into next week. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has spent most of the week consolidating at a critical resistance zone within a clearly defined descending channel. This area has consistently acted as a key pivot during the ongoing downtrend, and price action is now once again approaching this resistance level. With both structure and context aligning, the market is approaching a decision point. Key points covered Bitcoin is still trading within a descending channel of lower highs and lower lows Current price is retesting a significant resistance level Declining volume suggests a breakout or breakdown is nearing Source: TradingView Price action continues to respect the boundaries of the descending channel, with clear rejections at both the upper resistance and lower support zones. These repeated touches validate the channel and highlight its technical significance. As Bitcoin retests the upper band of this range, history suggests a rejection here would be the more probable outcome‚Äîunless proven otherwise. Volume plays a crucial role in confirming breakout attempts. Right now, volume is steadily declining, which is typical as a market approaches the end of a consolidation phase. This tightening range and waning volume are signs that volatility is being suppressed, often preceding a sharp move. You might also like: Is Fartcoin price winding up for breakout? Bullish pennant targets $1.52 on clean move A breakout to the upside, if backed by increasing and above-average volume‚Äîwould be the first sign of a potential trend reversal. This would suggest that buyers are stepping in with strength and could lead to a move out of the descending structure. However, a breakout that lacks volume would be considered weak, increasing the odds of a failed breakout and a return to lower channel support. With no volume confirmation yet, traders should remain patient. The market is sitting at a key resistance, and the next expansion‚Äîbullish or bearish‚Äîwill likely set the tone for the days ahead. What to expect in the coming price action Heading into the weekend, sideways movement may continue. Traders should watch for any volume-backed breakout above resistance or a rejection leading back toward channel lows. Until clear confirmation is seen, patience remains the most strategic approach.

Understanding Market Capitalization Market cap is one of the most critical metrics for evaluating a cryptocurrency. It is determined by multiplying the current price of a coin by its supply in circulation. A higher market cap is usually an indication of a more stable and widely adopted cryptocurrency, whereas lower market cap coins may offer higher growth potential but come with increased risk. 2. Analyzing Trading Volume Trading volume represents the total amount of a currency traded over a specific period. A higher trading volume usually suggests strong investor interest and liquidity, making it easier to buy or sell without changing the price significantly. On the other hand, low trading volume can indicate weak market confidence or low adoption. 3. Evaluating Price Trends with Technical Analysis Technical analysis involves studying past price movements to predict future trends. Key tools for technical analysis include: Moving averages (MA): Helps smooth out price fluctuations and identify trends. Relative strength index (RSI): Measures market momentum and helps determine if an asset is overbought or oversold. Candlestick patterns: Provide insights into potential reversals or continuations in price movements. By analyzing these indicators, investors can make more informed entry and exit decisions. 4. Assessing Market Sentiment Market sentiment plays a significant role in cryptocurrency price movements. Social media platforms, new articles, and online forums can influence investor perception. Sentiment gauges whether a cryptocurrency is gaining or losing favor. 5. Understanding the Role of Utility and Adoption A cryptocurrency‚Äôs real-world utility and adoption rate can directly impact its long-term value. For example, XRP is designed for fast transactions, making it a preferred choice for cross-border payments and institutional use. Cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin provide liquidity and accessibility for European investors looking to invest in it, and you can use platforms like Kraken to monitor its trajectory. Coins with strong use cases and active development teams tend to be more resilient in market downturns. 6. Keeping an Eye on Regulatory Developments Cryptocurrency regulations vary across countries and can significantly impact prices. Governments imposing strict regulations can create market uncertainty, while favorable policies often lead to growth. Staying updated on legal changes helps investors anticipate potential market shifts. 7. Diversification and Risk Management Even with strong data analysis, no investment is entirely risk-free. Diversifying your portfolio by investing in multiple cryptocurrencies can help mitigate losses. Additionally, setting stop-loss orders and only investing what you can afford to lose are essential strategies for risk management. 8. On-Chain Data Analysis for Deeper Insights Beyond price charts and market sentiment, on-chain data provides valuable insights into the health and activity of a cryptocurrency network . Metrics such as the number of active addresses, transaction volume, and whale movements (large holders buying or selling) can reveal underlying trends that aren't always visible in traditional technical analysis. For example, a sudden increase in active addresses might indicate growing adoption, while a spike in whale transactions could signal impending price volatility. By incorporating on-chain analysis into your research, you can make more data-driven investment decisions and stay ahead of market shifts. Endnote By leveraging market data, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis, investors can make smarter, more informed decisions in the crypto space. Understanding these factors will give you an edge in navigating the complexities of cryptocurrency investments.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-04-18 12:24:00

According to the firm, the funds were likely spent on weapons and other military equipment. TRM Labs disclosed this in its recent report, which analyzed the Houthis‚Äô crypto activity and their efforts to evade the US sanctions. Per the report, these eight addresses are the ones that the US Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) added to its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List on April 2. Transaction flow for Houthis sanctioned addresses (Source: TRM Labs) In its analysis of transaction flows from the addresses, TRM discovered over $900 million in outflows to various sources, including addresses associated with OFAC-sanctioned Iran-based financier Sa‚Äôid al-Jamal. The addresses also sent money to a Russian broker with ties to a Chinese manufacturer of unmanned aerial vehicles and anti-UAV equipment. Based on these transactions and the improvement in the Houthis‚Äô UAV and anti-UAV capabilities in recent years, the blockchain intelligence firm concluded that the group has been using crypto to buy drones and other military equipment. Houthis are increasingly using crypto to evade sanctions The Houthis are a political and armed group governing most of Yemen since 2014. However, the group has reached international prominence in recent years for targeting commercial ships in the Red Sea as retaliation against Israel‚Äôs actions in Gaza. In response to the group‚Äôs actions, the US has designated it as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) while deploying economic sanctions and military warfare against the group. With its financial infrastructure now facing pressure from sanctions, the Houthis appear to have increased their reliance on crypto. This move is not surprising given how several US-sanctioned groups have turned to crypto in the past. North Korea is a notable example, with the country sponsoring sophisticated crypto heists to fund its nuclear weapon program. OFAC had also highlighted how Iran-backed entities, including Hamas and Hezbollah, rely on crypto to bypass sanctions. It appears the Houthis have also developed an extensive network of facilitators and brokers using crypto and decentralized technologies. Interestingly, the group is not just using crypto to fund its operations. It has been mining crypto to generate more revenue, with available evidence showing that it has been doing so since 2017. However, its mining activity has required limited infrastructure because it relied on crypto mining services such as the now-defunct Coinhive. This allowed it to mine crypto using Yemen‚Äôs internet service provider, YemenNet. Crypto adoption grows in Yemen Meanwhile, the growing sanctions against the Houthis and state-backed financial institutions such as the International Bank of Yemen have boosted crypto adoption in the country. According to TRM Labs , many Yemenis are now turning to DeFi protocols and peer-to-peer services to move funds and for cross-border remittances. An analysis of website traffic shows that 63% of observed crypto activity among Yemen residents is from DeFi platforms, while global centralized exchanges account for only 18%. TRM Labs said: ‚ÄúThe interest in DeFi services may reflect the appeal of systems that allow users to transact without intermediaries, particularly where local banking institutions are inaccessible or unreliable.‚Äù Nevertheless, the country faces several challenges, such as poor internet infrastructure, limited knowledge about digital assets, and a lack of regulations on crypto, among others. All of which has not prevented adoption. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The metric shows that buyers are beginning to dominate transaction volumes on the platform. We are talking about the so-called Taker Buy Sell Ratio, i.e. the ratio of buys and sells on Binance, which calculates the ratio of buyers and sellers of BTC. According to a CryptoQuant analyst under the nickname DarkFost, the indicator ‚Äùhas returned to the neutral zone, which indicates a new balance in trading.‚Äù When will cryptocurrencies start to rise again? Currently, the aforementioned ratio is 1.008. When the ratio is above 1, it indicates a dominance of buyers, which in turn is usually an indicator of bullish sentiment. If the ratio is below 1, sellers dominate, which indicates a bearish sentiment. Currently, the aforementioned ratio is 1.008. When the ratio is above 1, it indicates a dominance of buyers, which in turn is usually an indicator of bullish sentiment. If the ratio is below 1, sellers dominate, which indicates a bearish sentiment. Today,¬†Bitcoin is trading around 83.8 thousand dollars. Thus over the past 7 days, the value of the major cryptocurrency has risen by 8.5 percent, which does hint at the beginnings of positivity among investors. Here is DarkFrost's comment on the situation. Over the past few days, the ratio has been mostly positive, indicating a return of bullish sentiment in derivatives trading on Binance. According to CoinGlass, if Bitcoin passes the $85,000 mark, short positions of nearly $637 million will be at risk of liquidation. In turn, these funds will become ‚Äùfuel‚Äù for the continuation of the bullrun wave.¬†When a short position is liquidated, it is forcibly closed by the exchange, and the trader's pledged funds are used to purchase assets, which exerts buying pressure and affects the value accordingly. According to Cointelegraph sources, the positive news so far is exclusive to Bitcoin. Still, the so-called altcoin season index from CoinMarketCap is now at 15 out of 100 points, indicating a lack of major interest in other digital assets. Meanwhile, market share for BTC capitalization has increased by nearly 10 percent since the beginning of the year. In general, the market is still in a negative mood. The Fear and Greed Index from Alternative portal analysts has dropped to a level of 29 out of 100 points, indicating ‚Äùfear‚Äù among traders. This means that Bitcoin fans are in no hurry to open new positions, as they are surely counting on further clarification of the situation with Donald Trump's tariffs and the economy. So far, experts disagree on the future direction of Bitcoin price movement. For example, Real Vision's chief crypto analyst Jamie Cootes admits the prospect of a sharp recovery of the former positions of coins. He said: The market may be underestimating how fast Bitcoin is able to grow ‚Äì perhaps to new all-time highs as early as the end of the second quarter. But Rob Hamilton, head of AnchorWatch, noted on Twitter the reason for the rather low volatility of BTC at the moment. Still, the cryptocurrency has somehow been in a fairly narrow price channel for several weeks now. ‚ÄùBitcoin's price is staying put because there is an epic battle going on right now between those who sell BTC to pay taxes and those who use tax refunds to buy the cryptocurrency.‚Äù he said. The deadline for filing tax returns in the US is April 15, 2025. The market is likely to get more upside stimulus after this season is over as investors can get back to work. Why China is selling crypto Meanwhile, local authorities in China are looking for ways to dispose of previously confiscated cryptocurrencies amid a total ban on digital assets in the country. The lack of clear rules on how to handle seized crypto has led to ‚Äùuncoordinated and non-transparent approaches.‚Äù According to lawyers , this may contribute to corruption. Officials use private companies to sell seized cryptocurrencies on offshore platforms in exchange for cash to supplement government budgets. It is reported that by the end of 2023, local governments owned approximately 15,000 BTC worth $1.4 billion, and coin sales have become an important source of revenue for budgets. In total, China owns about 194 thousand BTC worth about 16 billion dollars. It is the second largest holder of BTC after the United States. Chen Shi, a professor at Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, said the government does not have a clear understanding of how to capitalize on the volume of confiscated cryptocurrencies. Selling for cash is only a ‚Äùtemporary solution.‚Äù In addition, such transactions do not fully comply with China's current ban on crypto trading. Compounding the problem is the rise of cryptocurrency-related crimes in China, from online fraud to money laundering and illegal gambling. In particular, in 2024, the state filed lawsuits against more than 3,000 people involved in money laundering through cryptocurrency. According to lawyer Guo Zhihao, the central bank is better suited to manage seized digital assets and should either sell them overseas or set up a corresponding crypto reserve. Ru Haiyan, co-CEO of Hong Kong-based crypto exchange HashKey, supported the idea, adding that China should probably replicate the implementation of US President¬†Donald's Trump¬†idea with a national reserve. Against the backdrop of general market instability, Bitcoin is showing signs of revival: a positive shift in indicators on Binance, a rise in value and investor interest point to a possible continuation of the bullrun. If the selling pressure subsides after the tax season ends, BTC will have a real chance to enter a new round of growth.

On April 14, KiloEx suspended its perpetual futures trading platform following a severe security breach that resulted in attackers draining $7.5 million worth of cryptocurrency assets across the Base, opBNB, and BNB Chain networks. The exploit was traced to a flaw in KiloEx‚Äôs price oracle system, which allowed the attacker to manipulate the ETH/USD price feed. This enabled the attacker to open positions at absurdly low prices and close them at vastly inflated values, profiting millions in single transactions. Approximately $3.3 million was drained from Base, $3.1 million from opBNB, and $1 million from BSC. The breach prompted an immediate shutdown of the platform and an urgent call to arms. KiloEx mobilized a broad coalition of cybersecurity experts and blockchain partners, including SlowMist, BlockSec, SEAL 911, Manta Network, BNB Chain, and many others. They began forensic investigations to trace the stolen funds and identify the attacker. In the days following the attack, PeckShield identified associated wallet addresses, and on-chain activity showed that portions of the funds, approximately $5.5 million, were being returned, suggesting that negotiations were underway. #PeckShieldAlert #KiloEx exploiter -labeled addresses have returned ~$5.5M worth of cryptos to #KiloEx pic.twitter.com/snvitWs7ia ‚Äî PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) April 18, 2025 The Ultimatum That Changed the Course KiloEx‚Äôs swift response and aggressive public strategy likely played a crucial role in the resolution. Just hours after confirming the exploit, the platform issued a stern ultimatum to the attacker via X (formerly Twitter) , presenting a choice: return 90% of the funds within 72 hours and receive a 10% white-hat bounty, or face relentless legal and forensic pursuit. The DEX revealed that it had already identified blockchain addresses linked to the attacker and placed them under constant surveillance. These could be frozen at any moment, KiloEx warned, as they were actively working with exchanges and security partners. The hacker was offered safe passage if they complied, and KiloEx pledged not to pursue further legal action. Should they fail to respond, the matter would escalate into a full-blown criminal case, backed by law enforcement, cybersecurity firms, and international exchange networks. Apparently, the attacker decided the risk wasn‚Äôt worth the reward. By April 18, the full $7.5 million had been returned. KiloEx issued a statement expressing relief and gratitude, confirming that the matter was resolved. Dear Community, We are pleased to announce that we have successful recovery of all stolen funds related to the recent security incident. This outcome underscores our commitment to protecting user assets and fostering a secure ecosystem. 1. Case Resolution Progress ‚Äì The legal‚Ä¶ ‚Äî KiloEx (@KiloEx_perp) April 18, 2025 They also upheld their offer and awarded the attacker a 10% white-hat bounty of $750,000, thereby turning an exploiter into a contributor in a gesture of ethical closure. Recurring Oracle Exploits and White Hat Resolutions The KiloEx saga is the latest in a growing pattern of DeFi platforms falling victim to oracle-based price manipulation exploits. These attacks target the very system that delivers real-world data to smart contracts, and their manipulation can have devastating consequences. Similarly to this KiloEx incident, on October 25 last year, a hacker returned $6.1 million to a U.S. government wallet after initially stealing over $20 million in various cryptocurrencies. $6.1M in stolen crypto is back in a US government wallet. What‚Äôs the significance of this recovery? @OnchainLens dives into the details. #CryptoHack #BlockchainSecurity https://t.co/p8JOmwUq4p ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 25, 2024 That breach, although different in scale and nature, similarly concluded with the attacker voluntarily returning assets, likely under external pressure. In the case of KiloEx, the collaborative response from blockchain partners, law enforcement, and cybersecurity professionals helped ensure a swift outcome. The platform publicly acknowledged a long list of contributors, including SlowMist, SEAL 911, Binance, Sherlock, and dozens of others. With user funds fully restored, KiloEx now turns its attention to rebuilding community trust. The platform has pledged transparency and will share updates on the legal withdrawal process as it winds down the incident. Legal proceedings are being finalized with the support of judicial authorities and third-party experts.

Price action on the daily chart suggests buyers are gradually regaining control after a multi-week correction. XRP is trading between support at $2.05 and resistance at $2.23‚Äîwhich also aligns with the 50-day EMA ($2.21). This area remains a critical pivot. The trendline from March lows around $1.61 continues to act as a solid base for higher lows. A clean breakout above $2.23 could open the path toward $2.33, followed by $2.58. However, if $2.05 fails to hold, the bullish structure may break down in the short term. MACD Crossover Hints at Reversal; XRP to Rise? The MACD just flipped bullish, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line‚Äîmarking a green histogram for the first time in weeks.

Anticipation over a potential Ripple ETF approval has attracted investor interest, with projections of over $8 billion in inflows if greenlit.

All eyes are on the May 22 SEC decision‚Äîa pivotal date for XRP. In Summary: XRP is coiling above trendline support and needs to clear $2.23 to extend gains. MACD has flipped bullish, and RSI is showing early signs of a shift. Institutional narratives and ETF anticipation provide strong fundamental backing. Watch for a daily candle close above $2.23 with strong volume to confirm breakout.

The collaboration will bring a diverse portfolio of commercial and multifamily properties on-chain, using Blocksquare‚Äôs regulatory-compliant and scalable tokenization infrastructure. Collaboration Details According to a press release shared with CryptoPotato, Vera Capital will launch its own dedicated digital marketplace, powered by Blocksquare‚Äôs white-label technology, to offer tokenized ownership of U.S. institutional-grade real estate to global investors. The first property to be tokenized under this initiative is a $5.4 million commercial building in Fort Lauderdale that offers a 5% annual return and redevelopment potential. The upcoming marketplace, which is expected to go live in the coming weeks, will feature dozens of tokenized properties across seven U.S. states. ‚ÄúVera Capital‚Äôs $1 billion roadmap signals a major turning point for real estate tokenization in the United States,‚Äù said Denis Petrovcic, CEO of Blocksquare. He added that the collaboration brings together his company‚Äôs technical infrastructure with the investment firm‚Äôs real estate experience and network. The partnership began with Vera Capital‚Äôs campaign on Blocksquare‚Äôs Oceanpoint RWA Marketplace Launchpad, which raised over 100,000 staked BST tokens in just one hour. This was accomplished well ahead of the originally planned 29-day duration. The early success grants the former free access to the latter‚Äôs marketplace technology stack. In return, participants who staked BST will receive token rewards. Market Developments and Background Vera Group, founded in 2012, currently manages more than $100 million in real estate assets through a vertically integrated model that includes brokerage, development, property management, and investment services. Its subsidiary, Vera Capital, aims to make premium real estate investment more accessible by leveraging tokenization to offer lower minimum investments, increased liquidity, and transparency. Beyond its latest efforts, the investment firm has been expanding its presence in blockchain-based financial services. Some of its initiatives include private equity holdings that focus on Web3 infrastructure projects and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Blocksquare, which operates in over 20 countries, builds the infrastructure connecting the global $300 trillion real estate market to Web3. In addition to tokenization tools, its Oceanpoint site adds a DeFi layer that enables borderless access to real estate financing through blockchain integration. In March 2025, the company announced an upgrade to its RWA Marketplace Infrastructure, aimed at improving performance, user experience, and scalability across all platforms built with its technology. The enhancement features a redesigned user interface, smarter trading flows, improved wallet integration, and real-time blockchain indexing via Envio.

During an interview after a Q&A session at the ‚ÄúSatoshi Spritz‚Äù event in Turin on April 18, Back suggested that quantum computing may force Nakamoto to move their Bitcoin ( BTC ). That‚Äôs because, according to Back, Bitcoin holders will be forced to move their assets to newer, quantum-resistant signature-based addresses. Back said that current quantum computers do not pose a credible threat to Bitcoin‚Äôs cryptography but will likely threaten it in the future. Back estimated that quantum computers may evolve to that extent in ‚Äúmaybe 20 years.‚Äù Related: Bitcoin‚Äôs quantum-resistant hard fork is inevitable ‚Äî It‚Äôs the only chance to fix node incentives When the threat becomes real, Back said the Bitcoin community will have to choose between deprecating old, vulnerable addresses or letting those funds be stolen: ‚ÄúIf the quantum computers are here, and people at universities and research labs have access, the network has a choice to either let people steal them or to freeze them ‚Äî to deprecate the signature.‚Äú Back expects the community to go with the former option, forcing Bitcoin‚Äôs pseudonymous creator to move their funds if they wish to avoid losing them. Privacy upgrades could complicate proof Still, Back said that whether such a situation will reveal if Satoshi Nakamoto is alive also depends on Bitcoin‚Äôs future privacy features. ‚ÄúIt depends a bit on the technology, there are some research ideas that could add privacy to Bitcoin,‚Äù Back said. ‚ÄúSo, possibly there might be a way to fix quantum issues while keeping privacy.‚Äú Related: Lawyer sues US Homeland Dept to probe supposed Satoshi Nakamoto meeting Still, not everyone is convinced that ‚Äî privacy enhancements or not ‚Äî such a scenario would reveal whether Nakamoto was alive. An anonymous early Bitcoin miner and member of the Bitcoin community told Cointelegraph that he does not expect Nakamoto‚Äôs coins to be moved: ‚ÄúEven if he is alive and holds the private keys, I do not think he‚Äôd move them. Based on how he acted so far I would rather expect him to let the community to decide.‚Äù He added that, since this is a controversial choice, it makes sense to let the community decide. He said that he‚Äôd be surprised if Nakamoto came out of the woodwork to move the assets. A quantum-resistant Bitcoin Back explained that most quantum-resistant signature implementations are either unproven in terms of security or very expensive from a data perspective. He cited Lamport signatures as an old and proven design, but pointed out that they weigh tens of kilobytes. Consequently, he suggested that Bitcoin should be prepared to switch to quantum-resistant signatures but only do so when necessary. He suggested a Bitcoin taproot-based implementation allowing addresses to switch to quantum-resistant signatures when needed.

U.S. stablecoin regulation is poised to have a significant impact on issuers. On Friday, April 17, Nansen released a report highlighting the potential winners of the STABLE Act. According to the report, compliant issuers like Coinbase, PayPal, and Visa will likely be the biggest beneficiaries. The STABLE Act, which passed the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on April 2, provides comprehensive regulation for stablecoins. Its goals are to protect holders, ensure transparency by issuers, and strengthen the role of the U.S. dollar. You might also like: How stable are stablecoins? Some of its provisions mandate full reserves in cash or U.S. Treasuries, while prohibiting interest payments to holders. At the same time, stablecoin issuers must be licensed banks, approved state trusts, or companies regulated by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Coinbase, Visa, and PayPal to benefit from the STABLE Act These provisions suggest that if the STABLE Act passes, entities already focused on compliance stand to gain the most. The biggest likely winner among them is Coinbase, a major distributor of Circle‚Äôs USDC stablecoin. USDC is already aligned with what U.S. regulators are looking for. What is more, Circle focuses on transparency and has passed the test of the EU‚Äôs stringent MiCA regulation. For this reason, it dominates Euro-based stablecoin issuance. PayPal is another potential winner. It issued PYUSD in partnership with Paxos. While PayPal is a big player in digital payments, PYUSD currently controls only 0.38% of the stablecoin market share. However, with the STABLE Act in effect, PayPal could leverage PYUSD across its broader suite of services. Other winners include credit card giants Visa and Mastercard. These firms are already experimenting with stablecoins, and Visa even tested USDC for card settlements. In the future, these companies could integrate stablecoins into their core services. Notably absent from the report is USD1, a stablecoin recently issued by the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial. While it fits the criteria Nansen picked for the likely winners, it is not attached to a strong ecosystem like Coinbase, PayPal, and even Visa are.

Meanwhile, Ripple‚Äôs acquisition of prime brokerage firm Hidden Road has already led to a FINRA broker-dealer license, which perfectly positions the company to expand into traditional financial markets. With regulatory clarity improving and the SEC lawsuit behind it, Ripple appears well-poised to benefit from a broader altcoin resurgence that is predicted for Q2 of 2025. XRP Institutional Adoption Gains Momentum Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm HashKey Capital announced the launch of the HashKey XRP Tracker Fund, which is a first-of-its-kind product in Asia that is designed to track the performance of XRP. It was revealed on April 18, and the fund is a big step toward institutional adoption of the XRP token. It is also expected to pave the way for more regulated exposure to digital assets in the region. Ripple, the developer behind XRP, will act as the fund‚Äôs anchor investor. HashKey Capital stated that the fund‚Äôs ultimate goal is to transition into an exchange-traded fund (ETF), which is very similar to the firm‚Äôs previous product rollouts for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The XRP Tracker Fund is HashKey‚Äôs third tracker fund and will serve as a gateway for institutional capital to flow into regulated XRP-related financial products. The announcement also signals the start of a deeper strategic partnership between Ripple and HashKey Capital. In separate statements on social media, the firms revealed plans to explore new investment products, cross-border decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions, and tokenization opportunities. One of the potential developments that were discussed includes the launch of a money market fund (MMF) directly on the XRP Ledger. Vivien Wong , a partner at HashKey Capital, said that the company will leverage its strong relationships with regulators, financial institutions, and investors across Asia to support Ripple‚Äôs expansion and future collaborations. She believes in the unique opportunity Ripple presents in co-developing innovative financial products focused on enterprise blockchain adoption and cross-border payments. The launch attracted many positive reactions from the crypto industry. Hank Huang , CEO of Kronos Research, described the fund as a major milestone for institutional adoption in Asia. He explained that products like the HashKey XRP Tracker Fund, which offer both regulatory clarity and transparency, are essential when it comes to attracting institutional capital. Huang also pointed out XRP‚Äôs already established role in cross-border payments as a catalyst for broader acceptance of crypto assets. Ripple Targets TradFi Growth Ripple‚Äôs $1.25 billion acquisition of prime brokerage firm Hidden Road is already paying dividends as the firm recently secured a broker-dealer license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). This regulatory milestone was announced on April 17, and it greatly strengthens Hidden Road‚Äôs capacity in fixed-income markets and enables it to offer institutional clients compliant clearing and financing services across a broader range of traditional financial instruments. The FINRA license is an impressive achievement for any financial firm. According to Telos Capital Advisors, FINRA membership enhances a firm‚Äôs reputation among investment banks and increases its credibility in the broader financial ecosystem. Hidden Road processes over $10 billion in daily transactions for more than 300 institutional clients, and originally began as a foreign exchange-focused firm in 2018 before expanding into digital assets. Its robust infrastructure and deep institutional client base made it a very appealing target for Ripple, which finalized the acquisition on April 8. Ripple‚Äôs chief technology officer, David Schwartz, described the acquisition as a pivotal development for the XRP Ledger, expanding its use cases beyond just crypto and into traditional financial markets. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse agrees with this, and said Hidden Road‚Äôs integration will allow it to scale significantly and become the largest non-bank prime broker in the world. This move came during a wave of regulatory momentum favoring Ripple‚Äôs growth trajectory. In January, the company received money transmitter licenses in both Texas and New York, giving it the green light to handle capital transfers in key US markets. That progress continued in March when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its long-standing lawsuit against Ripple, which concluded the legal battle that hovered over the company since 2020. Legal experts like John Deaton saw the dismissal as confirmation that XRP should be treated as a digital commodity rather than a security. The regulatory environment is becoming increasingly favorable for Ripple, especially after the US Senate‚Äôs confirmation of Paul Atkins as the next Chair of the SEC. Once sworn in, Atkins is expected to bring a more crypto-friendly stance to the agency. Altcoins Set for Comeback in Q2 2025 The momentum might just keep building for altcoins like XRP. Altcoins could be poised for a strong resurgence in the second quarter of 2025, according to Swiss bank Sygnum. In its Q2 investment outlook , the bank pointed to improved regulatory clarity across the digital asset landscape as a key catalyst. Despite these advancements, Sygnum also pointed out that the market has yet to price in these positive developments. While Bitcoin dominance reached a four-year high in April,, Sygnum expects this trend to reverse as adoption of other crypto protocols grows. Overview of Sygnum‚Äôs Q2 report (Source: Sygnum Bank ) The report shed some light on the positive impact of regulatory progress in the United States, including President Donald Trump‚Äôs introduction of a Digital Asset Stockpile and the advancement of stablecoin legislation. These developments are expected to support broader crypto adoption and improve the outlook for altcoins. Sygnum believes that protocols able to capture user traction will be best positioned to outperform, potentially reversing the current Bitcoin-dominance trend. Sygnum also noticed a shift in market dynamics as the focus increasingly turns to economic value and competition among protocols. As the crypto market matures, new layer-1 blockchains like Toncoin, Sui, Aptos, Sonic, and Berachain are pursuing differentiated strategies to drive user growth and revenue. While these platforms offer solutions to scalability and efficiency issues that are usually seen in legacy chains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, they still struggle with adoption and fee generation. Among the emerging strategies, Berachain was praised for incentivizing validators to contribute liquidity to decentralized finance applications, while Sonic rewards developers who attract and retain users. Toncoin‚Äôs integration with Telegram provides access to over one billion users, which gives it a unique distribution advantage in the ecosystem. Beyond layer-1s, the report also identified potential in layer-2 networks, particularly Base. Although the meme coin frenzy that drove a surge in usage and revenue on Base subsided sharply, the network still leads in key metrics like daily transactions, throughput, and total value locked. (Source: X ) Despite the broader industry‚Äôs evolution, meme coins are still one of the leading narratives in the crypto space. In fact, a recent CoinGecko report found that meme coins accounted for 27.1% of global investor interest in Q1 2025, second only to artificial intelligence tokens.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-18 13:30:00

Worldcoin is capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts in equal measure. In the first week of May, Worldcoin‚Äôs token, WLD, saw a dramatic rise in its value, positioning it as one of the top-performing altcoins in the market. This surge coincides with heightened activity around artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, particularly those involving OpenAI, hinting at a significant correlation between WLD‚Äôs market movements and developments in AI technology. The buzz is partly attributed to speculative reports about potential collaborations and new ventures that could integrate more AI tools into cryptocurrency.

The push past $0.7100 signals a bullish momentum shift, with price holding above key levels. With WLD near $0.7243, bulls are targeting a move toward $0.7300 and possibly $0.7500 if momentum continues. On 18th April, Worldcoin (WLD) shows an uptrend, trading at $0.7197 after gaining 3.03% in 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The price ranged between $0.6824 and $0.7243 during the day. The WLD to USD converter showed that one token equaled $0.72. The token rating stood at 4.3 stars out of 5, and it was tracked on Ethereum through contract 0x163f‚Ä¶318753, with its analytics limited to the Ethereum chain, excluding Optimism or World Chain. The project, which features integrations with various wallets and explorers like Etherscan, continued to gain attention across social media channels. Its UCID is 13502; key user platforms include its website and whitepaper access. The latest hourly movements suggest renewed bullish sentiment, pushing the token‚Äôs value above the key $0.70 level after an earlier decline. WLD on the Daily Chart: Bulls Defend the $0.69 Level as Price Pushes Higher On the daily chart, Worldcoin (WLD) bounced off a low of $0.6824, forming a strong support zone around $0.68. Buyers stepped around this level and gradually raised the price, overcoming multiple intraday resistance zones. The price regained traction at nearly $0.6994, which had previously been a psychological pivot. Once breached, the move turned into a bullish reversal, with the price trending steadily upward. Throughout the trading session, WLD established higher lows and higher highs, indicating renewed demand. Price action also showed consistent bullish candles after 6 PM, reflecting increased volume from buyers re-entering the market. The token moved above the $0.7100 mark without significant resistance, confirming the shift in momentum. WLD now trades comfortably near the session high of $0.7243, suggesting traders are eyeing further upside. Worldcoin on the 4-hour chart: WLD builds bullish momentum above $0.7100, eyes key resistance at $0.7300 On the 4-hour chart, WLD reversed strongly after touching $0.6824 and quickly reclaimed the $0.7000 level. The price created a higher low, nearly $0.6950, and it has maintained a bullish structure. WLD‚Äôs push above $0.7100 confirmed the breakout, with momentum building into the midday session. The price now approaches the $0.7243 resistance level, where sellers may emerge. The $0.7000 round-number level now acts as a new intraday support, while bulls target the $0.7300 resistance next. Momentum indicators, such as RSI, are likely rising but not overbought territory, leaving room for continued gains. The strong daily close above $0.7100 would confirm bullish control going into the next session. Buyers must protect the $0.6994 pivot to maintain upward pressure.

Worldcoin (WLD) has shown strong short-term recovery momentum, rebounding from $0.6824 and trading above key levels like $0.7100. The project continues to gain traction, especially with its integrations on Ethereum and increasing social media buzz. Its price action suggests growing interest from traders, with bulls now eyeing the $0.7300‚Äì$0.7500 range. However, whether WLD is a good investment depends on your risk tolerance and time horizon. While recent price action is bullish, crypto remains highly volatile. Worldcoin‚Äôs unique identity-verification model and its global ambitions make it a compelling long-term project but also faces regulatory and adoption challenges. Will Worldcoin recover? The current WLD‚Äôs price action shows volatility and a slight recovery, suggesting that the cryptocurrency may have the potential for recovery. However, future performance will depend on the crypto market conditions and investor sentiment. Will Worldcoin reach $50? Reaching $50 for Worldcoin would be a significant challenge, as it would require substantial adoption, demand, and market growth. Given its current price and the broader cryptocurrency market dynamics, a jump to that level by 2025 seems unlikely without breakthroughs or widespread use Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin‚Äôs prediction shows that $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. What will be the value of Worldcoin in 2025 Based on current trends and market conditions, Worldcoin‚Äôs average value is predicted to be $1.05, with the potential to reach a high of $2.58 by 2025. Does Worldcoin have a good long-term future? WLD coin is showing some recovery trend; the token may have a promising long-term future. Continued development, adoption, and favorable market trends will be crucial for its success.

Technical Analyst Lays Out The Roadmap,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-to-50-technical-analyst-lays-out-the-roadmap/,"XRP owners experienced a rollercoaster ride last week as the cryptocurrency fought to remain above the $2 level. The altcoin, which recently exchanged hands at $2.13, fell by almost 20% between April 5 and 7, touching a five-month low of $1.78. However, the token soon regained its ground with a 15% jump the next day, reclaiming the $2 region ‚Äì although it still struggles to maintain this position. Related Reading: BNB Goes Up In Smoke: CZ Honors Nearly $1 Billion Token Burn Promise Market Analyst Unfazed By Volatility Technical analyst Cryptominder remains unfazed by recent price swings, boldly declaring he‚Äôs buying XRP at today‚Äôs prices. Though certain experts foresee levels between $12 and $15, Cryptominder has put forward an ambitious goal of $50 by 2030. This prediction is a whopping 2,330% climb from today‚Äôs levels around $2.06, with annual growth of over 80% for the next half-decade. This growth rate is within reach, says Cryptominder, citing last year‚Äôs 230% price appreciation of XRP as proof. The analyst went as far as to say that market observers would look back at his call with acknowledgment in the future. In 5 years from now $XRP will be over 50$ price. Today is the day you will remember. You will say to your friends that we never believed in XRP when it was 0.09$ we never believed at 0.35$ we never believed at 2$. I buy this XRP you are not. I bought at these prices! ‚Äî Cryptominder (@Crypt0minder) April 17, 2025 Skeptics Reminded Of Previous Missed Opportunities Cryptominder targeted risk-averse investors who are reluctant to purchase at $2. He compared it to the same sentiment during the time when XRP only cost $0.09 in May 2017 and then subsequently at $0.35. Both prices eventually realized significant returns for investors who purchased in, he asserted. The analyst pointed to his own experience purchasing at these lower levels, and indicated that the current $2 level might provide similar potential for expansion. This pattern in the past is the foundation for his lofty $50 target. Other Analysts Share Similar Optimism Cryptominder is not alone in being bullish. Following reports, Amonyx said last August XRP would beat $10 before hitting $50, stating ‚Äúno one could stop the momentum.‚Äù More recently, Edoardo Farina intimated that investors would kick themselves for failing to buy if and when XRP hits $50, so far even making a suggestion on the potential at $100. #XRP will quickly go above $10+ and then above $50+, there is nothing you can do about it. ü§Ø#XRPHolders #XRPCommunity pic.twitter.com/B8pFABeZLK ‚Äî Amonyx (@amonbuy) August 28, 2024 Some market experts seem to support these estimates, predicting a high price of $48 for XRP by 2030 ‚Äì similarly close to Cryptominder‚Äôs estimate. However, other analysts provide a more cautious timeline, estimating that XRP will not hit the $50 mark until 2033. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates Q1: Altcoin Season Nowhere In Sight‚ÄîReport Price Performance Shows Recent Recovery Efforts The recent price action indicates XRP making efforts to stabilize following its steep decline. Having recently retreated to $1.78, the altcoin was able to recover and drive back above $2, albeit holding on to this level has not been easy. Market observers point out that even with these challenges, bears have yet to fully take over the price action. Based on price charts, XRP must set stronger support higher than the $2 psychological mark in order to gain momentum towards any future expansion. The fact that the token managed to bounce back by 14.33% in a single day reflects the potential for sudden movements in either direction and illustrates the extremely volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets.

The market cap dropped to $2.5 trillion before rising to $2.71 trillion and then correcting to the $2.65 trillion zone. The market cap is up 0.79% and currently sits at $.266 trillion. Meanwhile, price action was mixed, with Bitcoin (BTC) trading marginally up while others, like Ethereum (ETH) marginally down. The flagship cryptocurrency is trading around $84,550, declining after briefly hitting $85,426 as it struggles to overcome the resistance at this level. ETH is down over 1% and trading at $1,579 as it attempts to reclaim $1,600. Ripple (XRP) registered a notable decline over the past 24 hours but has remained above $2 despite a drop of 2.10%. On the other hand, Solana (SOL) is marginally up, trading at $133. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Hedera (HBAR) , Polkadot (DOT) , and Litecoin (LTC) registered notable increases. However, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) registered substantial declines. Republican States Pause Lawsuit Against SEC A federal judge has agreed to pause an ongoing lawsuit between 18 state attorney generals and a decentralized finance (DeFi) lobbyist group against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday. The pause came after the parties noted the new SEC leadership. The state attorney generals, all Republicans, filed the lawsuit with the DeFi Education Fund last November after Donald Trump‚Äôs win, alleging the regulator had exceeded its authority in filing lawsuits against top crypto exchanges. The SEC suggested in a Wednesday filing that Paul Atkins‚Äô confirmation as new Chair could end the litigation. ‚ÄúAs support, the Defendants state that due to a leadership transition in the Securities and Exchange Commission, this case could potentially be resolved.‚Äù The judge ordered all parties involved to file a joint report within 30 days but paused all deadlines for 60 days. The original lawsuit argued that the SEC‚Äôs enforcement actions intruded on state legislators‚Äô abilities to police digital asset firms operating within their borders. ‚ÄúSome States, for instance, have enacted regulatory regimes for financial institutions focused on digital assets; others have required digital asset platforms to obtain money-transmitter licenses and security bonds to guarantee liquidity. While state regulatory approaches have varied in accordance with local needs, they have consistently endeavored to provide transparent and administrable rules of the road. And Congress has repeatedly declined proposals to give federal agencies broad regulatory power over digital assets.‚Äù The US Congress is expected to pick up market structure legislation that could address the role of federal regulators in overseeing crypto. Until then, the SEC has dropped investigations and lawsuits into over a dozen companies. Crypto Markets Calm The crypto market has stabilized after witnessing considerable movement over the past seven days. The market cap tumbled to a low of $2.5 trillion before rising to $2.71 trillion and ultimately settling at $2.66 trillion. Markets lost momentum around the previous consolidation zone, failing to overcome the descending resistance line formed during its peak on Inauguration Day. The Fear & Greed Index is also gradually moving out of the ‚Äúextreme fear‚Äù zone and has started consolidating in the ‚Äúfear‚Äù zone. While this is a good sign, it is not enough to spark a full-fledged rally. BTC is trading in a relatively narrow range this week as it struggles to stay above the 50-day SMA and build momentum for a push above the 200-day SMA. Slovenia Considering 25% Tax On Crypto Slovenia‚Äôs Finance Ministry is considering a 25% tax on crypto trading profits under a new draft law. The draft law is open for public consultation. The bill proposes taxing crypto traders when they sell their crypto for fiat or use it to pay for goods and services. However, crypto-to-crypto transfers and transfers between wallets owned by the same users will be exempt under the new legislation. The crypto tax will align with existing tax laws, with taxpayers required to record all their transactions for annual tax returns. The tax base would be calculated on profits by subtracting the purchase price from the sale price. According to Slovenia‚Äôs finance minister, Klemen Bo≈°tjanƒçiƒç, it is unreasonable that crypto trading is not taxed in the country. ‚ÄúThe goal of taxation of crypto assets is not to generate tax revenue, but we find it illogical and unreasonable that one of the most speculative financial instruments is not taxed at all.‚Äù However, Jernej Vrtovec, a member of Slovenia‚Äôs national assembly and the New Slovenia opposition party, slammed the proposal, stating it could stifle crypto growth in the country. ‚ÄúSlovenia has the opportunity to become a crypto-friendly country, but with the government‚Äôs proposals, we will miss the train again. With excessive taxation, we will once again see young people and capital fleeing abroad. Taxes should encourage, not stifle.‚Äù Trump Slams Federal Reserve Chair US President Donald Trump slammed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for delaying rate cuts, accusing him of being too slow to cut interest rates. Trump‚Äôs rant against Powell could escalate a long-running conflict undermining the central bank‚Äôs political independence. Florida Senator Rick Scott agreed with Trump, stating it was time for new leadership at the Federal Reserve. The public criticism of the Federal Reserve breaks a decades-long convention in American politics intended to safeguard the central bank from political scrutiny, including any executive decision to replace the Fed Chair. Powell stated in his address at the Economic Club of Chicago that the Fed‚Äôs independence is a matter of law. He has also previously signaled his intent to serve the remainder of his tenure, which ends in May 2026. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) rally has stalled in recent sessions after coming across resistance around the $85,000 and $86,000 zone. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has shown resilience and has not ceded ground to the bears, holding firm above $80,000 and, in more recent sessions, above $83,000. BTC‚Äôs sideways momentum suggests that the price structure is stabilizing, and its next move either way could be decisive. One analyst believes BTC could be on the verge of its next breakout, which could see the flagship cryptocurrency surge to $137,000, setting a new all-time high. The analyst pointed to BTC‚Äôs weekly Relative Strength Index, which recently broke above a long-standing downward trendline. Such breakouts have historically preceded massive price rallies, implying that a bullish reversal could be underway. The analyst also flagged a bullish crossover in the Linear Moving Average Convergence Divergence on the weekly chart, pointing out that it is flipping from red to green, and the LMACD is crossing above the signal line, indicating that trends are turning positive. BTC registered a sharp drop after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that the level of tariff increases announced have been significantly larger than anticipated and that President Trump‚Äôs aggressive trade policies will result in slower growth and higher inflation. As a result, BTC fell from a day high of $86,533 but stabilized above $83,000 before entering a narrow trading range. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a sharp rally on Wednesday, rising over 8% to reclaim $80,000 and settle at $82,600. However, the rally lost momentum on Thursday, dropping almost 4%, slipping below $80,000 and settling at $79,592. Markets recovered on Friday as BTC rose nearly 5% to reclaim $80,000, cross the 20-day SMA and settle at $83,370. Buyers retained control on Saturday as the price registered an increase of 2.41% to cross $85,000 and the 50-day SMA and settle at $85,378. BTC was back in the red on Sunday, dropping almost 2% and settling at $83,776. Source: TradingView BTC started the current week positively, registering an increase of 1.01% and settling at $84,619. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday and fell to $83,701, slipping below the 50-day SMA. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $84,031. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price rose 1.11% to move past the 50-day SMA and settle at $84,962. The current session sees BTC marginally down as it attempts to overcome the resistance at $85,000. If it can cross this level, a move to $90,000 is likely. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is struggling for momentum as it trades below $1,600 after failing to establish itself above this level. Analysts worry the world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency could start a fresh decline after forming a low at around $1,540. However, buyers have failed to build momentum, with the price trading flat this week despite markets staging a recovery. ETH‚Äôs sluggish price action can be attributed to a 60% decline in Ethereum ETFs. According to data from SoSoValue, Ethereum ETFs shed $12.01 million on Wednesday and have seen outflows of $909 million since President Trump‚Äôs tariffs went live. Net total assets have plunged 60%, going from an all-time high of $14.28 billion in December to $5.25 billion this week. The sustained outflows indicate institutional risk-off sentiment, hampering price growth. The decline comes as ETF issuers seek approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow staking within their ETH ETF products. Meanwhile, Tron founder Justin Sun reiterated that he has no plans to sell his ETH holdings despite the cryptocurrency's weak price action. ‚ÄúETH is currently at a low price, but we have no intention of selling our ETH holdings. Tron will continue to seek opportunities to collaborate with more Ethereum developers and build our industry together.‚Äù ETH posted a rally on Wednesday, surging over 13% to cross $1,600 and settle at $1,668. However, it was back in the red on Thursday, dropping almost 9% and settling at $1,521. Market sentiment changed on Friday as buying pressure returned. As a result, ETH rose nearly 3% and settled at $1,566. Buyers retained control on Saturday, with the price rising almost 5% to reclaim $1,600 and settle at $1,644. ETH lost momentum after reaching this level thanks to selling pressure at higher levels and fell 2.92% on Sunday, slipping below $1,600 and settling at $1,596. Source: TradingView ETH started the current week positively, registering an increase of almost 2% to reclaim $1,600 and settle at $1,622. However, ETH was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 2.02% and settling at $1,589. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as ETH registered a marginal decline and settled at $1,577. Price action was muted on Thursday as ETH registered a marginal increase and remained muted during the ongoing session, with the price struggling to reclaim $1,600. If ETH fails to clear $1,600, it could start another decline and fall towards $1,400. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana‚Äôs (SOL) recovery has gained momentum over the past couple of sessions after breaking past $130 and the 50-day SMA. The jump came after Coinbase implemented crucial enhancements to its Solana network infrastructure, improving its speed, resilience, and scalability. The improvements are part of the crypto exchange‚Äôs efforts to enhance its transaction processing capabilities. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been hard at work scaling our @Solana infrastructure to be faster, more resilient, and more scalable.‚Äù The upgrade, coupled with growing institutional interest is a positive development for SOL, which could continue its upward trajectory after recently breaking out of a descending parallel channel. SOL registered a sharp jump on Wednesday, rising almost 13% to settle at $118. However, it lost momentum on Thursday, dropping over 5% to $112. Markets rallied on Friday, and SOL registered an increase of almost 8% to reclaim $120 and settle at $121. Bullish sentiment persisted on Saturday as SOL surged 9% to cross the 20 and 50-day SMAs and $130 to settle at $132. SOL was back in the red as buyers lost momentum, dropping 3% to slip below $130 and the 50-day SMA and settle at $128. Source: TradingView SOL started the current week with a marginal increase, settling at $129 after reaching an intraday high of $135. Price action turned bearish on Tuesday after SOL dropped 2.47% and settled at $126. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as the price registered an increase of over 4% to reclaim $130, cross the 50-day SMA, and settle at $131. Buyers retained control on Thursday as SOL rose almost 3% to $134. The current session sees SOL marginally up as it looks to build momentum and push towards $140. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) has traded downwards since its January peak, although it has attempted to reverse its trajectory. The price has established a support level at around $2. However, this level was breached last week after XRP fell to a low of $1.61 last Monday before rebounding to reclaim $2. Price action remained bearish on Tuesday as XRP fell over 5%, slipping below the 200-day SMA to $1.79. XRP recovered on Wednesday, rising over 14% to cross the 200-day SMA, reclaim $2, and settle at $2.05. Price action turned bearish on Thursday as XRP lost momentum, falling over 4% to $1.96. However, sentiment changed on Friday as the price rose over 2% to reclaim $2 and settle at $2.02. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified on Saturday as XRP rallied almost 7% to cross the 20-day SMA and settle at $2.15. Sentiment changed on Sunday as XRP fell nearly 2% after reaching a high of $2.24, ultimately settling at $2.11. Price action was muted on Monday as XRP registered a marginal increase. However, it was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping over 2% to $2.08. Sellers retained control on Wednesday and Thursday, with the price registering marginal declines. The current session sees XRP marginally up as it attempts to stay above the 20-day SMA and $2. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis Dogecoin (DOGE) was quite bullish towards the end of last week, as it raced to $0.167. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and failed to cross the 20-day SMA. As a result, sellers took control, driving the price to $0.153 by Tuesday. Price action has been relatively muted since, with DOGE struggling to push back above $0.160. DOGE registered a sharp rally last Wednesday, rising 12.90% to $0.160. However, it lost momentum on Thursday, dropping almost 5% to $0.152. Markets recovered on Friday, and the price registered an increase of 4.45% to $0.159. Buyers retained control on Saturday as DOGE registered a rise of 4.76% and settled at $0.167. Source: TradingView However, the bulls lost momentum after failing to cross the 20-day SMA.

The current session sees the price up over 3% and trading at $2.45. If buyers can maintain momentum, FIL could reclaim $2.50. Jupiter (JUP) Price Analysis Jupiter (JUP) registered an increase of almost 14% on Wednesday, rising to $0.378 as bullish sentiment picked up towards the end of last week. However, it was back in the red on Thursday, falling 4.01% to $0.363. Buyers returned to the market on Friday, and the price rose over 6% and settled at $0.385.

According to Bitwise Investment‚Äôs new report, titled ‚Äú Crypto Market Review #Q1.25 ,‚Äù the crypto industry just experienced what they call ‚ÄúThe Best Worst Quarter in Crypto‚Äôs History.‚Äù Ethereum may be down 45% this quarter, but its underlying infrastructure is powering one of the most explosive trends in the financial world, which is the rise of stablecoins . In Q1 alone, stablecoins settled a staggering $27.6 trillion on-chain, quietly surpassing Visa‚Äôs 2023 settlement volume of $12 trillion more than twice over. Source: Bitwise With their assets under management growing 13.5% quarter-over-quarter to reach $218 billion, stablecoins have proven their product-market fit. Ethereum is at the heart of this revolution. Even with median fees hovering around $0.66 per transaction, Ethereum‚Äôs throughput was bolstered by cheap and scalable rollups such as Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism, whose fees were often measured in fractions of a cent. Source: Bitwise With landmark stablecoin legislation expected by July 2025 and traditional financial institutions lining up to support stablecoins at scale, the so-called ‚ÄúStablecoin Summer‚Äù may just be beginning. From Crisis to Catalyst: Regulation, Institutional Moves, and a National Crypto Pivot Price action may have misled casual observers, but institutional and regulatory dynamics in Q1 2025 indicated a dramatic repositioning of the crypto narrative. The Bitwise report indicates that the quarter commenced with the inauguration of the first overtly pro-crypto U.S. president , who promptly signed an executive order declaring digital assets a national priority. This led to a cascade of events, including the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , the repeal of restrictive guidance such as SAB 121 , and the dismissal of the SEC‚Äôs major lawsuits against crypto firms. In tandem, banks were given the green light to custody digital assets, reversing the chokehold once known as Operation Choke Point 2.0 . @coinbase has uncovered @FDICgov documents revealing efforts to halt crypto banking activities, exposing a systematic push against the industry. #Coinbase #FDIC https://t.co/Wr6DByXffC ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 3, 2025 These regulatory breakthroughs laid the groundwork for capital to flow back into the crypto ecosystem. Perhaps most significantly, the Financial Accounting Standards Board revised its treatment of digital assets , providing corporations with clearer accounting clarity on holding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Inspired by MicroStrategy, even GameStop raised $1.5 billion to purchase Bitcoin , and Abu Dhabi‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund committed $437 million to BTC, marking a notable increase in global institutional interest in cryptocurrency. At the same time, the fundamentals of stablecoins experienced a surge. Beyond the $27.6 trillion settled, stablecoins saw massive institutional alignment as expectations of U.S. legislative clarity grew. Ethereum fundamentals, too, remained robust, with Ethereum‚Äôs transaction activity and layer-2 growth surging, as protocols like Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism logged explosive increases in both users and activity. Source: Bitwise Developer activity remained strongest on Ethereum, and though Solana temporarily surpassed Ethereum in revenue, Ethereum‚Äôs dominance in infrastructure and DeFi remained intact. Source: Bitwise The data suggest that while crypto investors suffered paper losses in Q1, the building blocks for a much stronger second half of 2025 are already in place. Regulatory clarity, national alignment, and stablecoin integration may have a greater impact on reshaping the industry‚Äôs long-term trajectory than any price rally. Ethereum‚Äôs Quiet Triumph: The Infrastructure Behind Trillions Ethereum, often dismissed for high fees or slow throughput, has emerged as the backbone of a new global financial system. Not only is it the primary settlement layer for stablecoins, but its layer-2 networks are handling a growing share of global crypto transactions at lightning-fast speeds and rock-bottom costs. According to Bitwise, Ethereum‚Äôs average developer count remains the highest in the industry. Source: Bitwise The blockchain‚Äôs vibrant ecosystem also hosts several of the top DeFi protocols by revenue, including Uniswap ($1.03 billion), Lido ($972.1 million), and others, all of which build on or integrate with Ethereum or its scaling layers. Source: Bitwise Transaction counts on Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism are climbing, even as Ethereum L1 remains the secure anchor for trustless computation. As stablecoins gain mainstream adoption and global regulatory winds shift in favor, Ethereum‚Äôs infrastructure is poised to become even more central to the industry. Already, it supports the largest share of the $2.5 trillion cryptocurrency economy, with Ethereum itself commanding a market capitalization of $217.78 billion.

To read full editions, subscribe . Bitwise summed up last quarter beautifully in one word: ‚ÄúFrustrating.‚Äù And it‚Äôs true. We entered the quarter naive and bullish, thinking every obstacle had been moved out of the industry‚Äôs way and that we were ready to really get working. Oh, how wrong we were. Everyone I speak to still says crypto‚Äôs in a better place than it‚Äôs ever been. Folks still think what‚Äôs being built will one day change the world. But no one can deny that this quarter was a bit of a reality check, meaning that people are still excited about the possibility, but they also understand it‚Äôs about putting in the work to grab user attention. How Bitwise‚Äôs top 10 index performed last quarter. Bitwise, in its first quarter review, looked at various datapoints across crypto. Some of it will seem familiar ‚Äî like the datasets on venture capital spending, given that we‚Äôve spoken extensively about how VC activity looked. Other parts gauged how the activity we saw in crypto last quarter translated into data. For example, take a look at daily active addresses. Base is still popping off in terms of dominance, but the volume of active addresses clearly dropped from its peak in the fourth quarter of 2024. Source: Bitwise Now, there‚Äôs also a stablecoin chart I want to bring to your attention, and it‚Äôs quite a bullish one. And it‚Äôs perhaps one of the few datasets in the report that paints a very positive picture despite overall activity at the beginning of the year. You see that, right? Stablecoins outperformed Visa last quarter. Need I say anything more? Even if you‚Äôre tired of the stablecoin discourse ‚Äî and I wouldn‚Äôt blame you if you were ‚Äî it‚Äôs a positive sign to see that crypto can go up against traditional payments. And this is the proof. If you‚Äôre looking for another dose of positivity, Amberdata found that daily trading volumes seem to be bouncing back after the dip we saw throughout February. ‚ÄúBitcoin (BTC) volumes‚Äîwhich had slumped below $20 billion/day in early March‚Äîhave steadily climbed back above $60 billion/day in recent sessions, a level more consistent with early February‚Äôs trading environment. Ethereum (ETH) follows a similar trajectory, with volumes rebounding from sub-$12 billion levels in mid-March to ~$26 billion/day, reflecting a broader return of trader interest,‚Äù analysts wrote. Source: Amberdata Solana, especially, has seen a boon. It‚Äôs bounced back from its lows of $4 billion a day to $9 billion as activity in DeFi picks up. But it‚Äôs not alone, both XRP and TRX have also seen a spike. Looking ahead, it seems like we‚Äôre on track for a bit of a recovery, though analysts cautioned that we‚Äôre not yet near the January highs. But that‚Äôs okay, perhaps a break out from this stagnant environment is enough to put some pep in everyone‚Äôs step. ‚ÄúThe bounce also coincides with a broader market stabilization following ETF volatility, miner distribution pressure, and macro uncertainty. Rising volumes are often a leading indicator of renewed risk appetite. Sustained recovery in spot trading volume may pave the way for stronger price action ‚Äî particularly if it continues alongside improving sentiment, lower miner pressure, and reduced volatility,‚Äù analysts wrote.

ETH is eyeing the $2000 mark, while SOL could surge to $150. Several factors are at play, hinting at a possible rally. This article delves into what could trigger these key price levels and which other coins might follow suit. Ethereum: Past Decline Meets a Cautious Current Range Ethereum experienced a significant drop over the last month with a decline of 18.22% and a half-year loss of 40.3%. The sold-off sentiment dampened momentum and left investors wary of the prolonged downturn. Price data from recent sessions reflect these steep losses and the weight of recent sell pressure while hinting at an opportunity for recovery if conditions stabilize. Currently, Ethereum trades between $1,538 and $2,325.86, with immediate support at $1,255.61 and resistance at $2,829.45. Bears dominate as the RSI hovers near 39, and technical signals indicate a modest bearish bias. Trading ideas include watching for dips near the support level and testing the resistance before committing to longer-term positions. SOL Price Dynamics Amid Shifting Momentum Solana saw a 7.14% gain over the past month while dropping 15.91% in the last six months. Price has moved between roughly $98 and $166, reflecting mixed performance during recent trading sessions. A one-week surge of 19.10% highlighted short-term gains, even as longer-term trends reveal some downside pressure. Current trading levels show clear markers, with support near $71 and resistance around $207, with a second resistance at about $275. Indicators suggest a cautious bullish outlook, with an RSI above 55 and modest moving averages. The overall trend remains uncertain, and traders might consider positions near these levels for short-term gains amid the volatile backdrop. Conclusion ETH and SOL show strong potential for significant growth in May. ETH is getting close to the $2000 mark, driven by increased investor interest and market activity. Meanwhile, SOL aims for $150 as it gains traction and attracts attention from both developers and users. These key factors suggest a promising upward trend for these tokens.

43489021,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=25060,1744983996,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,What is Babylon?,https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/what-is-babylon/,"Babylon Genesis is a newly launched Bitcoin-secured Layer 1 blockchain that enables native BTC staking without relying on custodial bridges or wrapped assets. Built with the Cosmos SDK and CometBFT consensus engine, Genesis allows Bitcoin holders to participate in staking while maintaining full self-custody of their coins. Through a dual staking model involving BTC and the native BABY token, users can earn rewards by supporting network security and finality processes. With over 57,000 BTC already locked in the system, Babylon is establishing a foundation for Bitcoin-native DeFi, offering a trust-minimised platform where Bitcoin‚Äôs economic weight can be used to secure decentralised systems, validate transactions, and unlock new opportunities for on-chain utility. Babylon‚Äôs Genesis Layer 1 Bitcoin Secured Network (BSN) Babylon Genesis is a newly launched Layer 1 blockchain designed to bring native staking capabilities to Bitcoin without requiring custodial bridges or wrapped assets. Built using the Cosmos SDK and CometBFT consensus engine, Genesis operates as a Bitcoin-secured chain where holders of BTC can stake their coins directly while maintaining self-custody. Unlike traditional proof-of-stake models, Babylon enables stakers to participate without relinquishing control over their funds. The platform has already attracted over 57,000 BTC in total value locked, creating a foundation for Decentralised Finance (DeFi) applications that utilise Bitcoin as economic collateral while reinforcing the security of associated networks. Babylon‚Äôs staking mechanism allows BTC holders to secure other decentralised systems, such as PoS chains, rollups, or Layer 2s, by delegating their bitcoin to entities known as Finality Providers (validator nodes). These providers participate in consensus rounds that validate and finalise blocks across Bitcoin Secured Networks (BSNs). The protocol includes slashing mechanics to penalise malicious behaviour, echoing similar accountability systems in existing PoS architectures but without compromising on Bitcoin‚Äôs non-custodial principles. Stakers receive rewards for their contributions, with Genesis supporting a dual-staking model that includes both BTC and the native BABY token, which is also used for gas fees, governance, and validator incentives. Babylon‚Äôs Genesis chain also functions as a coordination layer between Bitcoin and other decentralised applications. By integrating timestamping, finality, and liquidity management, Genesis serves as a hub for interoperable infrastructure where BSNs can share protocol data and revenue. This role as a ‚Äúcontrol plane‚Äù makes it a central pillar in Babylon‚Äôs vision of a multi-chain, Bitcoin-secured internet of blockchains. Projects integrating with Genesis gain access to Bitcoin‚Äôs economic weight and decentralised assurances, unlocking new utility for dormant BTC in wallets and treasuries. Babylon is preparing to introduce a trust-minimised bridge between Bitcoin and Genesis based on advancements in BitVM2 , eliminating the need for trusted multisignature intermediaries. The project‚Äôs roadmap includes expanding support for restaking, vaults, and BTC-based liquid staking tokens (LSTs), aiming to make Genesis a liquidity centre for Bitcoin-native DeFi. By leveraging Bitcoin‚Äôs existing security properties in new ways, Babylon Genesis proposes a fundamentally different model for extending Bitcoin‚Äôs relevance in a world increasingly dominated by programmable, yield-generating assets, without altering Bitcoin‚Äôs base-layer design. How Does Staking Bitcoin On Babylon‚Äôs Genesis BSN Work? Staking Bitcoin on Babylon introduces a novel mechanism that enables BTC holders to participate in network security and earn rewards without relinquishing custody of their coins or wrapping them into synthetic assets. Instead of relying on bridges or custodians, users lock their bitcoin in self-custodial contracts using the Babylon protocol. These staked coins then serve as economic backing for Babylon‚Äôs own layer-1 chain, Genesis, as well as a broader network of BSNs, such as rollups, and proof-of-stake chains. This approach maintains the trust-minimised ethos of Bitcoin while allowing participants to generate yield from otherwise idle assets. Validation on Babylon is carried out through a dual staking model. The Genesis chain operates with two types of validators: those staking the native BABY token and ‚Äúfinality providers‚Äù who are backed by staked BTC. Finality providers participate in consensus rounds, based on the CometBFT consensus engine, where they help secure block production, confirm transactions, and provide finality to BSNs. These providers may also receive delegated BTC from users who prefer not to run their own infrastructure, further decentralising the network while offering stakers a share of the validation rewards. Slashing mechanisms are in place to ensure validator accountability, reducing the risk of misbehaviour or downtime. What makes Babylon‚Äôs model transformative is that it allows Bitcoin, the most secure and widely held digital asset, to serve as a foundation for securing proof-of-stake ecosystems. Bitcoin‚Äôs lack of native programmability has historically limited its use in decentralised applications, but Babylon overcomes this by building staking and finality layers around the asset itself, rather than within Bitcoin‚Äôs base protocol. This opens up access to BTC‚Äôs immense economic weight, currently over $1.6 trillion in market capitalisation, to help bootstrap the security and liquidity of emerging decentralised applications, without sacrificing the principles of self-custody or decentralisation. From a DeFi perspective, Babylon‚Äôs Bitcoin staking protocol has the potential to fundamentally reshape the sector. It offers a path to unlock vast amounts of dormant capital for decentralised lending, trading, governance, and infrastructure security, activities that were previously dominated by Ethereum and its tokens. By enabling Bitcoin to act as an active asset in DeFi systems, Babylon bridges a longstanding gap between Bitcoin‚Äôs store-of-value function and the dynamic, composable world of smart contract platforms. In doing so, it paves the way for a more inclusive and capital-efficient decentralised economy where Bitcoin is not merely stored, but actively used to support and secure the future of open finance. Will Hardcore Bitcoiners Adopt Babylon‚Äôs Hybrid BTC/Web3 Use Case? Traditionally, decentralised finance (DeFi) has been rooted in the domain of Web3, primarily flourishing on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains. These ecosystems offer smart contract functionality and composability, enabling applications for lending, borrowing, decentralised exchanges, and derivatives. Web3 DeFi has evolved with an emphasis on experimentation, token-based governance, and rapid iteration, with protocols like Uniswap , Aave , and Curve becoming foundational pillars. However, Bitcoin, the largest and most secure blockchain by market cap, has remained largely separate from these developments due to its intentionally limited scripting language and conservative approach to protocol upgrades. Babylon introduces a significant shift by enabling native Bitcoin staking and providing infrastructure for Bitcoin-based DeFi without requiring bridging, wrapping, or relinquishing custody of BTC. Through the Babylon Genesis chain and its network of Bitcoin Secured Networks (BSNs), BTC holders can now contribute to the security of decentralised systems and earn rewards while maintaining self-custody. This represents a novel model in which Bitcoin is used productively within a DeFi framework, preserving its monetary and security principles while unlocking yield-generating opportunities typically associated with Web3 environments. Yet the question remains whether Bitcoiners, particularly those who identify as Bitcoin maximalists, will adopt these new capabilities. Bitcoin‚Äôs cultural community has historically been sceptical of DeFi and Web3 innovations, often viewing them as overly complex, insecure, or motivated by short-term token speculation. This ideological divide has led to a persistent tribal rivalry between Bitcoin advocates, who prioritise simplicity, censorship resistance, and hard money, and Web3 users, who embrace programmability, token economies, and governance experimentation. The rise of Ordinals and Runes has revealed a clear appetite within a subset of the Bitcoin community for Web3-style applications, and their technically cumbersome implementation has spurred a wave of venture capital investment into Bitcoin layer 2s and sidechains aiming to deliver more scalable and flexible programmability. As a result, even innovations like Babylon, which are designed with Bitcoin-native principles in mind, may face hesitancy or resistance from parts of the Bitcoin community. Despite these philosophical differences, Babylon presents a middle ground that may help bridge the divide. By offering staking and DeFi functionality that aligns with Bitcoin‚Äôs emphasis on trust minimisation and sovereignty, Babylon could attract a subset of users who are open to using BTC productively, so long as it doesn‚Äôt compromise core values like self-custody or protocol integrity. Whether or not this is enough to foster mainstream adoption among Bitcoiners is still an open question. What is clear, however, is that Babylon introduces a compelling new chapter in Bitcoin‚Äôs evolution, one that challenges traditional assumptions about what Bitcoin can and cannot do within the broader decentralised economy.

The country has approved a pilot project for its own digital money called the digital som. This new version of the national currency will be treated as legal tender if the CB goes ahead with issuing a CBDC. Kyrgyzstan Testing To Launch CBDC On April 17, President Sadyr Zhaparov signed a new constitutional law that not only gives the digital som legal status but also gives the country‚Äôs central bank full authority to manage its future. The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic will decide how it works, how people can use it, and when it will be available to everyone. Right now, the final decision to roll out the CBDC nationwide will be made next year, testing is expected to begin in 2025. The country will begin a pilot project soon to see how it works in real life. A final decision on whether to fully launch it will be made next year. What Makes This Special? Unlike regular digital wallets or cryptocurrencies, a CBDC is issued and backed by the country‚Äôs central bank. That means it offers the security of a traditional currency but with the speed and convenience of modern technology. Countries like Jamaica, the Bahamas, and the European Union are already testing or using CBDCs. Kyrgyzstan is now joining that list. On the other hand, countries like the United States are still thinking about it. Why is Kyrgyzstan Opting For CBDC? Kyrgyzstan wants to modernize its financial system and make digital payments easier and safer. Earlier this month, former Binance CEO CZ said he would help Kyrgyzstan build strong crypto rules. The government hopes this will help businesses grow and improve digital security. Kyrgyzstan is also a great place for crypto mining because it has lots of clean hydro energy. Even though only 10% of its hydro power is used today, over 30% of the country‚Äôs energy already comes from water sources.

Companies with manufacturing facilities in the US stated that international orders have declined. This resulted in plans for major budget reductions and layoffs. In March, China suspended soybean imports from 3 US companies due to contamination concerns. The Asian country has also halted Boeing aircraft imports, a severe hit to the US‚Äôs largest exporter. The US can‚Äôt industrialize overnight Trump‚Äôs argument is that having companies with manufacturing facilities will make America great again. Theoretically, this could work, but it will take decades, according to economist Ha Joon Chang. However, if enough Americans believe in Trump‚Äôs vision and are willing to pay the high price of inflation and tariffs, and if companies relocate to the States, would it work? Chang stated that the US doesn‚Äôt only need factories; it needs workers with the right skills, universities that support research and development, and infrastructure. The cost of manufacturing goods in the US is high , according to economist Will Shih . He said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still four , five times more expensive to do something in the United States.‚Äù Wired reported that several US businesses explored making products domestically, but they found out that it‚Äôs too expensive and difficult to source raw materials, plus the lack of skilled workers. Instead of bringing production back to America, the trade war diverted imports from China to other low-wage countries like Vietnam and the Philippines. In a recent CNBC survey, 61% of respondents said that it‚Äôs more cost-effective to move the supply chain to a low-tariffed country than to relocate to the US. The same percentage answered ‚ÄòYes‚Äô when asked if they feel Trump is bullying corporate America. Manufacturing jobs will not come back Industrializing America again through tariffs is a false promise, and trade isn‚Äôt the cause of the decline in manufacturing jobs in the US. Trump imposed tariffs on China during his first term, but that failed to attract companies and increase manufacturing jobs. Trump‚Äôs tariffs clearly hurt agricultural regions, especially those exporting to China. Though the US government rolled out $23 billion in farm subsidies, this support only partly offset the damage caused by China‚Äôs retaliatory measures. Interestingly, even though the tariffs did not revive manufacturing or protect agriculture effectively, they were politically successful. Voters became more supportive of the Republican Party and Donald Trump, seeing the policies as a form of solidarity with struggling local industries. In a recent academic paper, economists from Harvard University explained how countries move from agriculture and manufacturing to service jobs as they get richer. The paper stated: ‚ÄúWorld trade in goods expanded rapidly during the 1990s and 2000s, which contributed to a large decline in manufacturing employment in the United States‚Ä¶ and Europe.‚Äù Manufacturing jobs moved from richer countries to Southeast Asian countries like China and other parts of East and Southeast Asia . As the US and Europe become richer, technology advances while service work rises. The paper further explained that rising import tariffs have a positive impact on the service sector, particularly business services. The economists wrote that: ‚ÄúIn all cases, the main employment incidence of these tariffs and subsidies appears to accrue to the service sector rather than to the directly-targeted manufacturing and agriculture sectors.‚Äù Up to 81% of CNBC‚Äôs survey respondents stated that they would depend on automation rather than hiring people. Automation company Formic stated that customers increased their reliance on robots by 17% between January and February of this year . Manufacturing jobs will not come back because automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence provide a cost-effective alternative.

Table of Contents Ethereum gets called out ‚Äúagain‚Äù Stablecoins on Ethereum Political neutrality and policy engagement When ‚Äòpermissionless innovation‚Äô meets the law Does ETH need a price? Can Ethereum reconcile and move forward? Ethereum gets called out ‚Äúagain‚Äù On Apr. 17, Ameen Soleimani posted a detailed thread on X that sharply critiqued what he sees as Ethereum‚Äôs ( ETH ) growing detachment from practical concerns. Okay so I‚Äôm drunk, bored and on a plane, so I‚Äôm going to address this point by point. I‚Äôm doing this because I despise the part of the Ethereum religion that promotes euphemisms over reality, as in my view it gets in the way of real progress. Why do you think I named it‚Ä¶ https://t.co/Mu4hNVbDeb ‚Äî Ameen Soleimani (@ameensol) April 17, 2025 Soleimani‚Äôs comments were framed as a response to a values-oriented post by Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake, which had been endorsed and shared by co-founder Vitalik Buterin. In his posts, Soleimani challenged what he described as Ethereum‚Äôs reliance on abstract ideals and aspirational messaging, arguing that these narratives often obscure the real challenges facing the network. He expressed concern that the culture around Ethereum risks becoming too comfortable with vague slogans at the expense of accountability and grounded problem-solving. Soleimani is not new to Ethereum, nor is he speaking from the sidelines. He is best known as the creator of MolochDAO, a decentralized funding collective launched in 2019 to support Ethereum infrastructure. MolochDAO also distributed grants for Ethereum 2.0 research and contributed to resource coordination during the network‚Äôs transition to proof-of-stake . His involvement in Ethereum dates back further. He co-founded SpankChain, an adult content platform built on Ethereum that explored use cases in direct crypto payments and censorship resistance. He also backed RAI, a decentralized, non-pegged stablecoin developed by Reflexer Labs, and participated in public discussions around Tornado Cash , a privacy-focused protocol currently under legal scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe. Let‚Äôs examine the core arguments Soleimani laid out and evaluate how his concerns reflect deeper tensions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Stablecoins on Ethereum One of the more pointed issues raised in Soleimani‚Äôs post is Ethereum‚Äôs continued dependence on centralized stablecoins. While Ethereum presents itself as a platform for decentralized finance, a large share of its day-to-day activity is still conducted through assets issued by private companies. As of Apr. 18, stablecoins such as Tether ( USDT ) and USD Coin ( USDC ) account for a significant portion of Ethereum‚Äôs liquidity and trading volume. According to DeFiLlama , the combined value of USDT and USDC deployed across Ethereum exceeds $100 billion. These tokens serve as core collateral in lending markets, key trading pairs on decentralized exchanges, and settlement mechanisms across a wide range of DeFi protocols. Their widespread integration has made them foundational to many applications built on Ethereum. However, this level of dependence brings different trade-offs. Both USDT and USDC are issued by companies that operate under national regulatory regimes. Tether is managed by iFinex, while USDC is issued by Circle and governed through the Centre Consortium. These issuers maintain fiat-denominated reserves, publish regular attestations, and possess the authority to freeze or blacklist wallet addresses. While such powers are used sparingly, their existence introduces a form of counterparty risk that sits uneasily with Ethereum‚Äôs broader decentralization narrative. At the protocol level, Ethereum remains open, permissionless, and resistant to censorship. But the tools most commonly used within its application layer rely on infrastructure that can be altered or restricted by centralized actors. This distinction is important. It highlights how decentralization in Ethereum is not evenly distributed across all layers, especially in the context of financial instruments that are susceptible to regulatory oversight and issuer control. Political neutrality and policy engagement Another area of concern in Soleimani‚Äôs post is Ethereum‚Äôs evolving relationship with political systems. While the protocol is often described as apolitical and neutral, recent developments show that its broader ecosystem is increasingly interacting with legal frameworks and policy discussions across jurisdictions. This shift does not alter Ethereum‚Äôs core design, which remains permissionless and open. However, it reflects a growing need for engagement with regulators, particularly as the network supports more capital, users, and applications. Infrastructure tied to Ethereum ‚Äî including validator operators, custodians, and development teams ‚Äî frequently operates under national laws and is subject to local compliance requirements. Many of these entities are based in jurisdictions with active enforcement regimes. As of April 2025, Ethernodes data indicates that over half of all active Ethereum nodes are hosted in countries like the U.S., Germany, and Singapore, where crypto-related legal obligations are well established. The geographic distribution of these nodes gives Ethereum global reach, but also exposes it to varying degrees of regulatory oversight. Meanwhile, on the global front, Ethereum Foundation members have taken part in policy discussions with governments in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Over the years, Vitalik Buterin has held meetings with public officials in Montenegro and Argentina to explore national approaches to crypto governance. While these interactions remain informal, they suggest a deliberate effort to contribute to policy formation, without necessarily steering the protocol in any political direction. In functional terms, this engagement is not unusual. As Ethereum becomes more embedded in real-world finance and infrastructure, the need for legal clarity increases. Protocol developers, node operators, and wallet providers often require stable regulatory environments to mitigate operational risks. Meanwhile, policymakers increasingly seek technical input to inform emerging regulation. The result is a two-way exchange ‚Äî policy shaped by protocol insight, and protocol development influenced by regulatory context. Ethereum remains decentralized at the base layer and does not rely on state endorsement for its technical operation. Still, the individuals and entities building within its ecosystem often work within legal boundaries. The result is not full detachment, but conditional independence ‚Äî one where neutrality is preserved at the protocol level, even as engagement with political systems continues at the edges. When ‚Äòpermissionless innovation‚Äô meets the law Soleimani‚Äôs thread also takes aim at the Ethereum community‚Äôs embrace of ‚Äúpermissionless innovation,‚Äù a principle rooted in the idea that anyone should be able to build without needing approval. While this concept has driven much of Ethereum‚Äôs early growth, Soleimani argues that its consequences are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. One of the most prominent examples he cites is Tornado Cash, a privacy protocol launched via autonomous smart contracts on Ethereum. In 2022, the U.S. Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned the protocol, alleging that it facilitated money laundering for criminal actors, including North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus Group . The sanctions were followed by arrests. Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev, two of Tornado Cash‚Äôs developers, were detained in the United States and the Netherlands. Storm now faces charges related to money laundering, violations of international sanctions, and operating an unlicensed money services business ‚Äî charges that carry a potential prison sentence of up to 45 years. For Soleimani, the issue is not just the legal action itself, but how the Ethereum community has responded to it. Some defended the developers, while others leaned on the argument that ‚Äúcode is speech‚Äù and therefore beyond the reach of legal systems. Soleimani views this assumption as misguided. In his view, relying on the neutrality of code to shield developers from responsibility ignores how financial technologies are regulated in practice. He is especially critical of the belief that developers do not need legal support. In his post, he points to the legal teams and advocacy organizations that have submitted amicus briefs in defense of Roman Storm. These briefs argue that writing and deploying open-source code should be protected under free speech, and that creators of decentralized tools should not be held liable for misuse by third parties. While these positions have gained support within parts of the crypto industry, they remain legally uncertain. This case has broader implications for Ethereum‚Äôs development model. The right to build remains intact at a technical level, but the legal risks tied to privacy tools and cross-border transactions are growing. In Soleimani‚Äôs view, defending permissionless innovation now requires more than idealism. It demands legal foresight, active engagement, and a deeper understanding of the risks that come with building in a regulated world. Does ETH need a price? Soleimani also raises concerns about Ethereum‚Äôs reliance on the price of ETH to maintain network security. In his post, he revisits an earlier disagreement with Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake, who had previously suggested that ETH‚Äôs market price was not particularly important. Soleimani pushed back by asking a direct question: if ETH were to lose its value, how would Ethereum continue to secure its network? This is a fundamental issue within Ethereum‚Äôs current architecture. Since the network‚Äôs transition to proof-of-stake in 2022, Ethereum no longer uses miners. Instead, it relies on validators who stake ETH to verify transactions and keep the system operational. The effectiveness of this model depends on both the amount of ETH being staked and the market value of the token itself. If ETH‚Äôs price falls too low, the rewards for honest validation decrease, making it less attractive for participants to stake. At the same time, the cost of attacking the network becomes cheaper. This dynamic weakens both the incentive to secure the network and the deterrent against malicious activity. As of Apr. 18, ETH is trading around $1,570, reflecting a drop of over 52 percent from recent highs. According to data from Beaconcha.in, more than 34 million ETH is currently staked, representing roughly 28 percent of the total supply. Soleimani‚Äôs argument is that proof-of-stake systems do not separate monetary value from security. ETH‚Äôs price is not just a market metric. It is a core part of how the network stays resilient. Can Ethereum reconcile and move forward? Soleimani closes his post with a question that extends beyond any single disagreement. Can Ethereum, as a system and a community, recognize its internal contradictions and still find a way to move forward? Despite his strong criticism, he does not write off the network. Instead, he reflects on past moments where change did occur. For example, early debates around the importance of ETH‚Äôs price eventually led to the emergence of the ‚Äúultrasound money‚Äù narrative. He sees this as proof that the community is capable of adapting when it chooses to. His hope is that similar shifts can happen again. The challenges facing Ethereum today are different in nature ‚Äî they involve legal risk, coordination problems, and questions about how power is distributed. These are not technical issues alone. They require a broader view of how the protocol fits into the world around it. Whether Ethereum can reconcile these tensions depends on how it responds to them. That includes being realistic about the risks developers face, the tools it depends on, and the systems it interacts with. It also means accepting that decentralization comes with trade-offs that must be managed, not ignored.",Feature|Ethereum|Proof-of-Stake,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-18 13:58:50

XRP, struggling with regulatory headwinds and ETF speculation, and Yeti Ouro (YETIO) , a new meme coin with gaming utility, has seen its presale surge past $3.3 million.. XRP vs SEC: The Never Ending Saga XRP price is facing a challenge reaching the blockchain token‚Äôs target of $2.20, and is currently priced at $2.08 . This stagnation remains XRP due to the expected approval of XRP-spot ETFs and regulatory clarity of XRP-spot being recreated under the Trump administration. Ripple‚Äôs SEC lawsuit has certainly seen some movement, which brings cautious optimism. The SEC‚Äôs move to withdraw its appeal against Ripple‚Äôs programmatic sales ruling came into place due to the recent appointment of pro-crypto SEC Chair Paul Atkins. This development removed impediments towards institutional adoption. Proshares, Bitwise along with 10 other firms have submitted ETF XRP applications, with analysts forecasting approved ETF inflow to $8 billion. XRP‚Äôs symmetrical triangle pattern, analysed by multiple technical analysts, suggests a breakout toward $3.50 or higher. A noted strategist, Maelius, predicts a conservative target of $10 by late 2025 and an optimistic range of $15-20 if Elliott Wave patterns replicate the 2017 cycle. However, the momentum is at risk from U.S.-China tariff tensions and Fed policy shifts. While the ETF approvals and XRP tailwinds decide the fate of XRP, investors are allocating funds into YetiOuro (YETIO), a project that blends tangible utility with meme coin charm and distracts from the waiting game. Yeti Ouro: New Entrant To The World Of Utility-Based Cryptocurrency Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is an emerging cryptocurrency project that combines meme culture with real-world application through its racing game ‚ÄúYeti Go,‚Äù powered by Unreal Engine and its Play-to-Earn (P2E) mechanics. Unlike every other meme coin, Yeti Ouro focuses on utility, sustainable tokenomics with a capped supply of 1 billion tokens, built-in deflationary mechanisms, and staking rewards. This allows YETIO to stand out as a fun community-driven token alongside a practical investment opportunity which draws attention as a strong contender among emerging altcoins. Collected Funds Before The Deadline Yeti Ouro has also emerged as an alternative, raising $3.3 million in its ongoing presale and selling over 216 million tokens which are currently priced at 0.024 each in the current stage 3 of presale. Investors who bought during previous stages are now already in profit since the price has increased from one stage to the next with early bird investors seeing a 100% ROI from Stage 1 to Stage 3. Yeti Ouro is celebrating Easter weekend with a limited-time offer that‚Äôs hard to ignore‚Äîa 30% bonus on all token purchases. The promotion runs now through Tuesday, April 22nd, 2025, and marks the final five days of Stage 3. With Stage 4 around the corner and a steeper price increase than previously already confirmed, this is the perfect chance to maximize your token count and secure your position before the next phase begins. Limited Boosts: Presale Incentives And Tokenomics For Yeti Ouro Deflationary Model: Capped tokenomics supply of 1 billion with periodic burns of 5% enhanced scarcity. Strategic Allocation: 50% to presale buyers, 15% to ecosystem growth, and 15% to play to earn rewards. YETIO derives value from: Adoption In Gaming: Capitalising on the $250 billion estimate for blockchain gaming by 2028 Staking Incentives: Yield up to 45% APY for long-term holders, awarding loyalty within the ecosystem. And, the earned YETIO stakes can also be used to buy power ups and skin collectibles in the token hub. Partnerships of Institutional Quality: Alliance with major players in the gaming and audio industries ensures top-tier expertise. The presale victory of Yeti Ouro‚Äî surpassing competitors in the GameFi sector‚Äî indicates that investors trust its hybrid system of entertainment and financing. The project is additionally audited by one of the best audit firms SOLIDProof . The Play-to-Earn (P2E) game itself is centered around Yeti Go ‚Äì a racing game built in Unreal Engine 5. Yeti Go reimagines what a game can be, fusing cutting-edge visuals with cinematic sound design to create an experience that feels more like a high-octane film than a typical playthrough. Built in collaboration with the legendary studio behind titles like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space, every detail is designed to pull players deeper into its universe. The audio‚Äîcrafted by industry pros who‚Äôve worked with Grammy-nominated artists such as Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid‚Äîadds emotional depth and adrenaline-pumping energy to every moment. Yeti Go is giving its community the chance to leave their mark on the game with a newly launched character design competition. Participants can submit their own character designs, and the winner will see their creation featured in-game‚Äîalong with full credit and a $1,000 prize in $YETIO tokens. Ten runners-up will each receive $250 in tokens. For all the details on how to enter, visit Yeti Ouro‚Äôs official X platform . In Conclusion Yeti Ouro strikes the right tradeoff between risk and innovative opportunities. XRP‚Äôs fate rests on an ETF breakthrough and macroeconomic calm, whereas Yeti Ouro illustrates the shift towards utility-focused strategies in crypto. Analysts highlight YETIO‚Äôs presale buzz, deflationary tokenomics, and visuals as gold craftsmanship under a magnifying glass, poised as a prominent option for those seeking exposure to the next growth frontier in crypto.

While Bitcoin reached a new ATH following Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in November, most altcoins, especially Ethereum (ETH), are below their ATHs. While investors are wondering when the rally in altcoins will begin, major Swiss bank Sygnum claimed that altcoins will recover in the second quarter. In a recent report, Sygnum stated that altcoins are set to recover in the second quarter of 2025 amid improving crypto regulations and increasing user adoption. Sygnum analysts suggest that regulatory developments in the United States, including US President Donald Trump‚Äôs push to create digital asset reserves and advances in stablecoin regulations, could encourage wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äôs dominance reached a four-year high in April, signaling that crypto investors are shifting their funds to an asset perceived to be relatively safer. ‚ÄúHowever, we expect protocols that are successful in attracting and engaging users with Trump's incentives to outperform and Bitcoin's dominance to decline.‚Äù In its report, Sygnum highlights protocols such as Toncoin (TON), Sui, Aptos (APT), Sonic, and Berachain (BERA) among altcoins, while citing Base as a prominent layer-2 network. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $84,555 on Good Friday, up by 13% from its lowest point this year, giving it a valuation of over $1.68 trillion. It has dropped by 10% this year, outperforming the Nasdaq 100 index, which has fallen by 13%. Historical data suggests that Bitcoin remains in a bullish trend despite the 23% dip. Moreover, the coin has experienced bigger drops in the past. For example, it fell by 35% from its peak in March last year to its lowest point in August, before bouncing back. Bitcoin has seen deeper dives several times before. It dropped from $68,980 in November 2021 to its lowest level in 2022 as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and several prominent crypto companies like Celsius, Terra, and FTX collapsed. Therefore, while the ongoing pullback may continue, there are odds that it will bounce back, since its fundamentals remain strong.

In other words, 56.19% of the XRP positions opened within the last 12 hours have been shorts against the token. XRP long-short ratio chart. Source: CoinGlass This represents a significant bearish surge, as the preceding 12-hour period saw XRP shorts account for 51.55% of opened positions. Notably, this is the lowest and most bearish long/short ratio XRP has seen since the beginning of April. Recent price action points to XRP‚Äôs resilience Interestingly enough, price action does not correspond to this apparent bout of pessimism on the account of derivatives traders. At press time, XRP was changing hands at $2.08. A 1.36% loss on the daily chart has brought weekly gains down to 4.07%.

This indicates that derivatives trading volume has significantly diminished, which lessens the impact of the surge in XRP shorts.

Analysts Say a 3-Month Bull Run May Be Starting,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-dogecoin-about-to-explode-analysts-say-a-3-month-bull-run-may-be-starting/,"A popular trader on X revealed a technical setup that could indicate an upcoming Dogecoin (DOGE) rally that could last 93 days at least. In an X post published on Thursday, Trader Tardigrade, who is followed by nearly 73,000 users, shared an analysis of a 1-day chart that revealed the length of recent bearish and bullish cycles. Are you ready for a 93-day $Doge Bull Run? #Dogecoin pic.twitter.com/85T96AwHEv ‚Äî Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) April 17, 2025 According to his assessment, the price of DOGE could rise to around $0.75 within the next 3 months as the most recent bearish wave seems to be coming to an end. This implies a 384% jump for the meme coin, whose price currently sits at $0.1551. Meanwhile, another popular trader known as ali_charts on X shared on Tuesday that DOGE‚Äôs whales had accumulated more than 800 million tokens worth around $124 million based on today‚Äôs prices. Both predictions favor a bullish outlook for the top meme coin and could anticipate a trend reversal at a point when market sentiment has been progressively improving. Dogecoin Has Been Temporarily Trapped Between the 21D EMA and a Key Support In the past 24 hours, Dogecoin has dropped by 1% while trading volumes have dropped by 23% and currently stand at $570.5 million. Looking at the charts, we can see how DOGE recently rejected a move above the 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) in what is considered a value area as trading volumes are high at these levels. Although the price broke above a descending triangle that had been forming since December, momentum has not picked up its pace and DOGE seems to have entered consolidation as market participants wait for the next catalyst to decide where the price should be heading. For now, it seems that DOGE could be poised to trade range-bound for a while between the 21D EMA and its $0.1400 horizontal support. These two levels are the most relevant resistance and support areas to watch as a break below or above could indicate that the market is getting ready for its next big move. Momentum has stalled but currently favors bulls as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is standing above the 14-day SMA and trending higher. Meanwhile, the MACD‚Äôs histogram has shown a positive increase for two consecutive days ‚Äì including today. If a new bullish cycle is forming, top Web3 storage plays like Best Wallet (BEST) could be among the biggest winners, as investors look for secure, feature-rich wallets to store and grow their assets. Best Wallet (BEST) Presale Enters Final Stage ‚Äì Don‚Äôt Miss Out Best Wallet (BEST) is a next-gen crypto wallet offering low trading fees, a clean mobile interface, and powerful tools for discovering high-potential tokens early.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Pepe coin dips 30% from March highs, sparking investor interest in Codename:Pepe‚Äôs AI-powered alternative. Table of Contents Codename:Pepe: The Pepe on a mission for smarter crypto trading Codename:Pepe vs. Pepe Is Codename:Pepe a better investment than Pepe? Final takeaway One of the most iconic mascots in the memecoin world is Pepe the Frog, which gave rise to the original PEPE coin. The token has quickly gained popularity and saw explosive early success. However, despite its cultural momentum, PEPE has recently faced significant price volatility. By early 2025, PEPE was already trading well below its all-time high. Still, it maintained relatively stable performance through the first quarter. That changed in April, when according to CoinMarketCap, the token dropped by 5% on April 2nd. A more substantial decline followed shortly after, with a 12% price drop that brought PEPE down to $0.000006396 ‚Äî a 30% decrease from its late March peak of $0.000009137. Such fluctuations have raised concerns among investors, as the token‚Äôs unpredictable movements pose increased risk. In this environment, attention is beginning to shift toward newer and more reliable alternatives. Particularly, Codename:Pepe stands out as a promising project that draws inspiration from the same meme legacy but offers a fresh take through innovation, AI integration, and real utility. You might also like: Missed PEPE? Here is Codename:Pepe, a memecoin poised for a 10,000% breakout Codename:Pepe: The Pepe on a mission for smarter crypto trading Codename:Pepe is a frog with a purpose. The project introduces AI-driven intelligence into the unpredictable world of crypto speculation. Though still in development, its roadmap features an ambitious suite of tools, including AI-powered market insights, trading signals, and access to an exclusive DAO. All this positions Codename:Pepe as a forward-looking platform rather than a hype-driven trend. At the heart of Codename:Pepe is the AGNT token. The current presale offers investors a chance to buy AGNT at a lower price before its exchange debut: Current Stage (18th of 28): $0.018518 per token. Next Stage: Price will increase to $0.020833 (+12.5%). Target Listing Price: $1(+5,300.15%) With 17 presale stages already selling out in a matter of weeks, demand for AGNT is definitely rising. The community-driven hype surrounding the project is fueling speculation that Codename:Pepe could become one of the next breakout memecoins in the AI-crypto trend after listing. Codename:Pepe vs. Pepe Apart from sharing a frog as their mascot, Codename:Pepe and Pepe have little else in common. While both embrace the memecoin identity, their core goals, structures, and long-term visions diverge significantly. Let‚Äôs see how they compare: Feature Codename:Pepe Pepe Launch Stage Currently in presale Fully launched, trading live Token Price $0.013888 (presale stage 18) ~$0.0000064 (as of April 2025) Token Supply Capped supply of 5 billion tokens, no future minting planned Extremely high supply (420 trillion tokens), inflationary at launch Theme / Branding AI-powered meme coin inspired by Pepe the Frog Meme-based token with no functional utility at launch Utility AI trading tools, automated signals, DAO membership, launchpad access (in development) Primarily community-driven meme coin; limited utility added later Ecosystem Plans AI-backed launchpad, token utility expansion, DAO-led governance Added staking and community tools post-launch Market Entry Timing Positioned ahead of next bull cycle Gained momentum during 2023-2024 hype, now facing correction Is Codename:Pepe a better investment than Pepe? From a current standpoint, the answer may lean toward yes, particularly when considering investor sentiment and growth potential. PEPE‚Äôs recent price volatility and sustained decline have made its short-term outlook more uncertain. After a series of sharp drops, the token now faces resistance both technically and psychologically, which can deter new entrants and short-term investors. By contrast, Codename:Pepe enters the scene as a new presale opportunity, offering early-stage access at a low price point, with a vision centered around utility, AI integration, and long-term community engagement. Unlike PEPE, which launched purely as a meme, Codename:Pepe has outlined a roadmap involving AI-powered trading tools, exclusive investment networks, and a DAO-led ecosystem, and these features are aimed at providing value beyond virality. Final takeaway Codename:Pepe is not trying to copy PEPE but rather evolving the memecoin formula by combining viral branding with real technology and practical use. While PEPE still has cultural weight and a massive holder base, its short-term risks and limited growth ceiling may turn some investors away. For those seeking a fresh narrative, strategic entry point, and utility-backed roadmap, Codename:Pepe currently offers a more compelling case, especially while it‚Äôs still in the presale phase.

Specifically, large Dogecoin holders dumped a massive 570 million DOGE, worth approximately $88.8 million at press time, within a single week, as the prominent on-chain analyst Ali Martinez revealed in an April 18 X post. Whales have unloaded over 570 million #Dogecoin $DOGE in the past week! pic.twitter.com/rBhd4beokH ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) April 18, 2025 Considering the extensive selling and the fact that Dogecoin is, with its press time price of $0.15586, 50.70% down in the year-to-date (YTD) chart, with the recent trends being, at best, of stagnation, the question of where the meme coin is headed is more than open. Technical analysis insights into Dogecoin‚Äôs next move The basic technical analysis ( TA ) indicators are, unfortunately, inconclusive for hopeful DOGE traders. The relative strength index ( RSI ), for example, reveals that the cryptocurrency is in a neutral position with a reading of 44.33. Similarly, the meme coin is roughly equidistant from both its nearest support level at $0.153 and its nearest resistance level at $0.159, though both levels indicate where investors might anticipate a breakout. Does community optimism hint at a bearish breakout for DOGE? Elsewhere, recent community analyses Finbold retrieved from the TradingView trader network paint a more bearish picture. Earlier in April, multiple members noted that Dogecoin is bouncing off a supply zone, indicating it could enjoy a bullish breakout. Despite this, DOGE had, by press time on April 18, fallen slightly below its launchpad levels above $0.157, and the more long-term charts demonstrate that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs stability has been only ephemeral since the start of 2025. If the recent patterns remain strong, Dogecoin can be expected to drop below $0.15, with the trend pushing it toward $0.14. Still, if it retains stability at its current levels, there is a strong possibility it may soar once again towards $0.17.

US Treasury auctions may lead to a record supply in 2025, with implications for all other markets. US Treasurys may reach a record supply in 2025, based on planned auctions . In 2025, predicted Treasury placements may reach $31T, including refinancing and new emissions. The sheer scale of the US bond market will invite constant monitoring in 2025 for its effect on international finance. The US debt is over $36T, requiring new US Treasury issuance of over $31T in 2025. | Source: Fiscal Data The record issuance coincides with the need to service the peak US national debt of $36.21T. The projected issuance of $31T in US Treasury bonds makes up 109% of the projected US GDP for the current year. The debt is also equivalent to 140% of the M2 broad money supply. 1/ Over US$31T in Treasury Supply Expected in 2025 Significant financing pressure looms over the U.S. Treasury market in 2025, with expected auctions projected to surpass US$31T (including refinancing). The scale of this supply will demand close market attention. pic.twitter.com/fZqpBnKWt0 ‚Äî Binance Research (@BinanceResearch) April 18, 2025 Those near-record ratios of debt to GDP and M2 signal the outstanding effect of this year‚Äôs Treasury auctions. Binance‚Äôs research focused on potential foreign demand, as usually around 30% of auctions go to foreign buyers. As the USA changes its roles in both economy and geopolitics, the foreign demand component will be a big unknown for the bond market. High yields can hamper the crypto market The crypto market has shown a positive reaction during historical periods of M2 growth. However, debt issuance at this scale is a new challenge for investors. The record issuance may lead to increased yield, which would be attractive for buyers seeking risk-free assets. While crypto has higher growth potential and unexpected rallies, bond yields can help offset some of the uncertainty. However, too much yield can lead to a Fed intervention of printing more money, which would be good news for high-risk assets. So far, Bitcoin (BTC) has performed its biggest rallies during predominantly low interest rates. Binance‚Äôs research views crypto as the ultimate risk asset, which would usually move opposite to fixed income instruments. The bond market is closely watched for runaway yields, especially following the recent stock market crash. In the worst-case scenario, crypto may face another global financial crisis, and show its role either as a store of value or as a source of speculation. US Treasury debt tokenization expands to $5.9B US Treasury debt is one of the key components of the crypto market. Debt tokenization has expanded rapidly in the past year, reaching a total of $5.9B . The tokenized debt supports both asset-backed and algorithmic stablecoins as a reliable asset. Yield is also the main source of earnings for Tether Inc. the issuer of USDT. Due to the large number of RWA token holders, higher yields may become a net positive for the crypto market. The high yield and record available auctions may be a chance for crypto companies to lock some of their gains and benefit from the higher yields. The crypto market often relies on short-term bills and notes. For now, crypto projects are avoiding long-term bonds, aiming for a more agile yield strategy.

One renowned financial expert suggests that strategic exposure to crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ripple-affiliated XRP token is essential for India‚Äôs future economic resilience. As countries like the United States are building strategic crypto reserves, Aravind suggests India should too. The Case For India Allocating $10B Of Forex Reserve To Crypto Aravind took to the X social media platform on April 17 to urge India to immediately establish a strategic crypto reserve that would be run by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The pundit argued that India should begin with the four top cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). He said India could emulate the United States‚Äô crypto reserve plan to create its digital asset stockpile. This implies that India doesn‚Äôt have to develop its crypto reserve from scratch, as it can rely on the US‚Äôs already existing structure. Aravind recommends India kick off its reserve with a minimum allocation of approximately $10 billion, which is a modest figure considering India‚Äôs enormous foreign exchange reserve. The country‚Äôs forex reserve currently stands at nearly $700 billion, per data from Trading Economics. As such, he believes creating a crypto reserve with a $10 billion minimum allocation is not a big deal for India. He further pointed out that the Indian government could raise money by exchanging some of its forex, which is mainly held in ‚Äúsoon to be weak‚Äù fiat currencies. Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve Order It‚Äôs pertinent to mention that Aravind has been urging India to establish a strategic crypto reserve, particularly after United States President Donald Trump signed an executive order authorizing the creation of a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a separate Digital Asset Stockpile consisting of digital assets other than Bitcoin (namely Ether, Ripple‚Äôs XRP, Solana, and Cardano‚Äôs ADA). While Aravind calls for India to convert some of its forex reserves to crypto, the US intends to build its BTC reserve using coins already owned by the US government, specifically assets forfeited through criminal or civil procedures. The US is exploring several ‚Äúbudget-neutral‚Äù methods to get more Bitcoin, including from tariff earnings .",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|India|Solana|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|FIAT|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-18 15:12:41

US Government Buying 1 Million Bitcoins Could Trigger $1 Million BTC Price Earthquake In an interview with the Bitcoin magazine, the Bitcoin Policy Institute‚Äôs head of policy, Zach Shapiro, asserted that a 1 million Bitcoin buy by the US would have a remarkable effect on the price of the alpha crypto. ‚ÄúIf the United States announces that we are buying a million Bitcoin, that‚Äôs just a global seismic shock.

Pines cited tariff earnings as one of the ways the US government can acquire Bitcoin. ‚ÄúRevenues that the government can use to acquire more Bitcoin would be things like tariff revenue or other fees that the government collects that are not tax-based fees,‚Äù Pines stated.

Meanwhile, crypto adoption hit record highs as trading volume cooled. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key developments that shaped South Korea‚Äôs crypto sector in Q1 of 2025. South Korea‚Äôs economy limped into 2025 as local currency tanked. Source: Ki Young Ju South Korean crypto traders given yet another two-year tax exemption Jan. 1 ‚Äî Crypto tax postponed A planned 20% capital gains tax on crypto did not take effect on Jan. 1 after lawmakers agreed to delay it until 2027. This was the third postponement: first from 2022 to 2023, then again to 2025. Related: Crypto‚Äôs debanking problem persists despite new regulations The latest delay, reached through bipartisan consensus in late 2024 , came amid mounting economic uncertainty and political turmoil. Lawmakers cited fears of investor flight to offshore exchanges, challenges in tracking wallet-based profits, and shifting national priorities in the wake of Yoon‚Äôs failed martial law stunt and subsequent impeachment. Jan. 14 ‚Äî Warning against North Korean crypto hackers The US, Japan and South Korea published a joint statement on North Korean crypto hacks . Crypto firms were warned to guard against malware and fake IT freelancers. Lazarus Group, the state-sponsored cyber threat group, was named as a prime suspect in some of the top hacks in 2024, such as the $230-million hack on India‚Äôs WazirX and the $50-million hack against Upbit , South Korea‚Äôs largest crypto exchange. At least $1.34 billion of crypto stolen in 2024 has been attributed to North Korea. Source: Chainalysis Jan. 15 ‚Äî Companies wait on the sidelines for crypto greenlight South Korea‚Äôs Virtual Asset Committee, a crypto policy coordination body under the Financial Services Commission (FSC), held its second meeting. The FSC was widely expected to approve corporate access to trading accounts on local exchanges. Despite popular demand, the FSC held off on making an official decision, citing the need for further review. Instead, the FSC announced investor protections against price manipulation and stricter stablecoin oversight. Jan. 16 ‚Äî First enforcement of crypto market manipulation South Korean authorities indicted a trader in the first pump-and-dump prosecution under the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, the new crypto law effective from July 2024. Meanwhile, Upbit received a suspension notice for allegedly violating Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements in over 500,000 instances, prompting regulators to consider a ban on new user registrations. Jan. 23 ‚Äî Upbit, Bithumb compensate users after service outages during martial law Upbit and rival exchange Bithumb announced plans to compensate users following service disruptions triggered by the surprise declaration of nationwide martial law on Dec. 3, 2024. The shocking move caused panic across financial and crypto markets, leading to a surge in traffic that overwhelmed local trading platforms. Ex-President Yoon took his shot at martial law, which backfired and shaped South Korea‚Äôs 2025. Source: Kang Min Seok, Presidential Security Service South Korean crypto world finally opened to corporations Feb. 13 ‚Äî Charities and universities get first dibs on corporate crypto access The FSC unveiled its long-awaited plan to allow corporate entities to open crypto trading accounts in phases by late 2025. The rollout will require businesses to use ‚Äúreal-name‚Äù accounts and comply with KYC and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. Charities and universities are first in line and will be allowed to sell their crypto donations starting in the first half of the year. South Korea‚Äôs real-name financial transaction system, introduced in 1993, was designed to combat tax evasion and money laundering by requiring all bank accounts to be opened under verified legal names using national IDs. Related: Market maker deals are quietly killing crypto projects Crypto trading exploded in 2017, driven in part by anonymous accounts from businesses, foreigners and minors . Financial authorities responded by requiring crypto exchanges to partner with domestic banks and offer fiat services only through verified real-name accounts. To date, only five exchanges have met the requirements. Since there was no regulatory framework for real-name corporate accounts, this policy effectively shut out both overseas users and domestic companies from trading on South Korean exchanges. The new roadmap aims to fix that by creating a formal structure for institutional participation under tighter compliance standards. Feb. 21 ‚Äî Alleged serial fraudster busted again Police rearrested ‚ÄúJon Bur Kim,‚Äù identified by the surname Park, for allegedly profiting 68 billion won (approximately $48 million) in a crypto scam involving the token Artube (ATT). He allegedly employed false advertising, pump-and-dump tactics and wash trading to manipulate the market. This wasn‚Äôt Park‚Äôs first brush with the law. He was previously indicted in a 14-billion-won (around $10 million) token fraud case and was out on bail when he launched ATT. Park flashes supercars on social media. Source: Jon Bur Kim Feb. 25 ‚Äî Upbit operator Dunamu gets slapped The nation‚Äôs Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) formally notified Dunamu, operator of Upbit, of regulatory action. The sanctions were tied to KYC compliance failures and dealings with unregistered foreign exchanges. The FIU issued a partial business suspension , restricting Upbit from processing new customers‚Äô deposits and withdrawals for three months. Feb. 27 ‚Äî Crypto crime force formalized South Korean prosecutors formally launched the Virtual Asset Crime Joint Investigation Division, following a year and seven months as a temporary operation. As a non-permanent unit from July 2023, the task force indicted 74 individuals, secured 25 arrests, and recovered over 700 billion won (around $490 million) in illicit gains. The 30-person task force includes prosecutors, regulatory staff and specialists. Feb. 28 ‚Äî Upbit operator Dunamu files lawsuit to overturn business sanctions Dunamu said it filed a lawsuit against the FIU to challenge the sanctions imposed on the exchange . Bitcoin ETF next on checklist for South Korean crypto space March 5 ‚Äî Reconsidering Bitcoin ETF ban The FSC started reviewing legal pathways to allow Bitcoin ( BTC ) spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), citing Japan‚Äôs evolving regulatory approach as a potential model . This marks a notable shift from South Korea‚Äôs previous opposition to crypto-based ETFs. The Capital Markets Act does not recognize cryptocurrencies as eligible underlying assets for ETFs. However, in 2024, lobbying efforts from major domestic brokerages intensified amid rising client demand, especially after spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in the US . While the review remains in its early stages, regulators are no longer dismissing the possibility outright. March 21 ‚Äî Crackdown on unregistered exchanges begins The FIU compiled a list of illegal foreign exchanges and moved to block access via app stores and ISPs. Additionally, the agency warned of criminal penalties for trading platforms operating without a license. March 26 ‚Äî 17 exchange apps blocked (including KuCoin and MEXC) Google Play removed 17 unlicensed crypto exchange apps in South Korea at the request of regulators. The FIU said it is also working with Apple to block unauthorized crypto platforms. There are 22 unregistered overseas exchanges on the regulators‚Äô radar, and 17 have been banned from the Google Play store. Source: FSC March 27 ‚Äî Upbit scores three-month break A South Korean court temporarily lifted the Feb. 25 partial business suspension imposed on crypto exchange Upbit by the FIU. The court‚Äôs decision allows Upbit to resume serving new users while the case is under review. South Korean crypto expected to go from crackdown in Q1 to campaign trail in Q2 As March ended, more than 16 million investors ‚Äî roughly a third of South Korea‚Äôs population ‚Äî held crypto accounts, surpassing the 14.1 million domestic stock traders. But that surge in adoption came as trading activity cooled. Upbit, the country‚Äôs dominant exchange, saw volumes fall by 34%, dropping from $561.9 billion in Q4 2024 to $371 billion in Q1 2025, according to CoinGecko . By mid-April, the crackdown was still gaining steam. Apple followed Google‚Äôs lead in removing offshore exchange apps from its store , while prosecutors filed yet another round of market manipulation charges. South Korea‚Äôs crypto industry is now contending with tighter rules, rising institutional expectations and a government no longer content to watch from the sidelines. All this unfolds ahead of an early presidential election in June, following Yoon‚Äôs impeachment . Crypto played a visible role in Yoon‚Äôs successful 2022 presidential election campaign and is expected to remain a key issue with voters. One candidate in the upcoming election, former prosecutor Hong Joon-pyo of the People Power Party, recently pledged to overhaul crypto regulations in line with the pro-industry stance of the Trump administration, local media reported . Despite the pledge, Hong‚Äôs understanding of the technology came into question as he admitted to not knowing what a central bank digital currency is.

Shiba Inu: The memecoin turning heads in the crypto world Shiba Inu, or SHIB , began as a Dogecoin-inspired memecoin but is forging its own path. Launched in August 2020 by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, making it compatible with many decentralized applications. Starting with one quadrillion tokens, SHIB made headlines when half of the supply was sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, boosting SHIB‚Äôs credibility and stirring interest in its potential. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB‚Äôs Ethereum base allows it to support features like smart contracts. This led to ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange offering more utility than just holding the token. Plans for an NFT platform and a DAO-based governance system show SHIB‚Äôs ambition to be more than a meme. In a market valuing utility and technology, SHIB‚Äôs Ethereum connection adds to its appeal. As crypto evolves, SHIB‚Äôs progression could make it an interesting project to watch in current trends. Conclusion Though SHIB continues to perform well, XYZVerse stands out as a pioneering sports memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth, uniting fans in a community-driven ecosystem.

This marks a 6,499% increase in losses compared to early 2024. Earlier this month, the crypto industry was stunned by mounting allegations that the Mantra Network may have orchestrated a rugpull, raising urgent questions about the due diligence users apply when engaging with dApps and tokens. The Mantra incident rocked the crypto market Mantra Network recently came under scrutiny following accusations of a rugpull after the network‚Äôs MANTRA (OM) token suffered a catastrophic price collapse that saw its value fall by over 90% in under an hour on April 13. M antra‚Äôs OM token price chart. Source: CoinGecko The dump wiped out more than $5.5 billion in market capitalization and took OM from a high of $6.33 to below $0.50, causing many to draw comparisons to the infamous Terra LUNA case. According to multiple reports, the trigger is most probably a large token deposit linked to a wallet allegedly associated with the MANTRA team. And since the team reportedly controls close to 90% of the token‚Äôs total supply, the move raised immediate red flags as people worried an insider was about to dump. The OM community has long been worried about transparency and has, over the past year, alleged that the team manipulated the token‚Äôs price through market makers, changed tokenomics, and repeatedly delayed a community airdrop. There are also reports that MANTRA may have engaged in undisclosed over-the-counter (OTC) deals, which saw the team selling tokens at steep discounts. A rapid decline in OM‚Äôs price pushed these OTC investors into losses, sparking a mass exodus as panic selling became the order of the day. The panic created a ripple effect that triggered stop-loss orders and forced liquidations on leveraged positions, compounding the collapse. There were signs for anyone with access to on-chain data Investigations and community discussions are ongoing, but the on-chain activity is filled with signs that could have raised early concerns to any knowledgeable investor who cared to look. According to data from DappRadar, the platform‚Äôs all-time high in Unique Active Wallets (UAW) was 64, and this was recorded in December 2024. Besides that brief spike, daily wallet interactions consistently ranged between 1 and 11, with multiple days showing no activity altogether. The lack of consistent user engagement signals low traction, a potential red flag for any project claiming growth or adoption. Mantra Network‚Äôs consistently low user engagement was a signal of low traction, a potential red flag for any project claiming growth or adoption. Source: DappRadar A similar pattern can be noticed in the transaction data. While some days recorded as many as 66 transactions, activity regularly dropped back to zero. Such erratic fluctuations point to volatility in user behavior and possibly inorganic engagement ‚Äî common signs in dApps that may have been doctored to appear more active than they are. While none of these metrics can outrightly confirm shady business on their own, the combination of data points like low consistent user activity, unstable transaction trends, and limited transparency around token distribution can create a pattern worth taking a second look at, especially when combined with a narrative that may overpromise on development or utility.

This April, spot outflows have soared to a staggering $120 million. On the other hand, spot market inflows are underwhelming, with less than $5 million flowing into the market. The new development confirms the increased selling pressure among leading market investors. Dogecoin (DOGE) holders appear to be taking out their holdings from the spot market. As data from Coinglass shows, the sell-off has been recorded since the last quarter of the previous year and has only worsened in recent times. Massive outflows often indicate a decline in the demand for assets, which is typically reflected in the increased rate at which assets are sold and the slower rate at which assets are bought. The ongoing trend signals a weakening of confidence among Dogecoin proponents ‚Äîan alarming pattern for both small and large holders. Meanwhile, another new development suggests that long-term investors are unfazed by market volatility.

The latest move follows a failed attempt to reach consensus in a previous governance vote. The earlier vote ‚Äì SIMD-228 ‚Äì had sparked strong community engagement and broad agreement on the need to reduce inflation, but ultimately fell short due to limitations in the voting structure. The new proposal suggests replacing the traditional single-outcome voting method with a more flexible and representative system called Multiple Election Stake-Weight Aggregation, or MESA. Rather than asking voters to choose a binary ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù on a single deflation rate, MESA allows validators to select from a range of deflation options, such as maintaining the current 15% rate or increasing it to 17.5%, 20%, or more. Each validator‚Äôs vote is weighted by their stake, and the final outcome is a weighted average of all the selected rates. This market-driven approach is designed to better reflect the diverse preferences across the Solana ecosystem and aims to offer a middle ground instead of forcing the community to align around one predetermined figure. By doing so, it seeks to avoid repeated re-voting and governance deadlock, and aims for smoother decision-making without sacrificing predictability. The fixed, time-dependent disinflationary structure ‚Äì with a 1.5% terminal inflation rate ‚Äì would remain in place, to preserve long-term consistency while giving the community more influence over how quickly that terminal rate is reached. The proposal also outlines practical steps for implementation, such as clearly labeling different voting options and setting an appropriate quorum and supermajority threshold. If adopted, this method is expected to not only streamline Solana‚Äôs inflation decisions but also serve as a model for other decentralized protocols facing similar governance challenges. The proposal is currently under discussion and invites feedback on key parameters like vote weighting, choice intervals, and thresholds for implementation.

On Monday, a notable market indicator flipped bullish for the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Despite the ongoing market turmoil, as shown on the 24-hour chart on Monday, XRP successfully moved to the middle line of the Bollinger Bands and gradually moved upwards. The Bollinger Bands are an indicator that highlights the volatility of the leading asset, Bitcoin, displaying breakout moves and helping traders plan market entries and exits. The recent movement, while mild, signals a major turnaround for the bulls, pointing to what could potentially give the bulls the upper hand and aid in the highly anticipated bullish reversal. Bitcoin slowly steps out of troubled waters Cryptoquant has noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs apparent demand over the past 30 days has begun to shift from an intense negative ferocity, which points to a major change in market behavior. However, an analyst from the on-chain analytics firm maintains that the new development need not be interpreted as the beginning of a new bullish phase. The analyst points to the 2021 cycle top, which displayed a similar pattern: demand remained volatile for months, prices stabilized temporarily, and structural recovery began only after an extended consolidation period was recorded. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ while this current bounce is noteworthy, it‚Äôs more likely a pause in pressure, not a definitive signal of accumulation or a macro bottom.‚Äù Momentum might be shifting, but time and confirmation are still needed.‚Äù The analyst noted.

The Bitcoin (BTC) price trades below the 200-day moving average, signaling a bearish trend that puts traders on high alert. Furthermore, the COIN50 index dropped in several key metrics, indicating caution in a range of altcoins. Bullish Outlook Wanes A new Coinbase institutional report depicts the current market realities amid evolving macro trends. According to the release, converging signals may be forming at the start of a crypto winter, as negative sentiments overshadow the bulls. This year, Bitcoin has faced major obstacles to its potential uphill run. The crypto leader by market cap saw crashing prices spilling into altcoins. After breaking a new all-time high above $108k, the asset bowed to the macro trends as the stock market correlation continued. As a result, Bitcoin recorded flash dips and sits at $83,700. The asset‚Äôs 200-day moving average shows a sharp decline, highlighting a bearish phase that kicked off in March after a previous deep. While the first quarter had its fair share of headwinds, Q2 2025 kicked off with President Trump‚Äôs sweeping tariffs. A look at the COIN50 index reiterated crashing trader sentiments, as assets have been trading under bearish zones since late February. This marked the end of speculations for an altcoin season, at least for the short term, as prices fell through multiple support levels. In January, altcoin bulls predicted a massive altcoin season that would fuel assets to multiple all-time highs. ‚ÄúIndeed, this is consistent with the total crypto market cap (ex-BTC) falling by 41% from its December 2024 high to $950B, compared to a (less than) 20% decline in bitcoin over the same period. This disparity underscores the higher volatility and risk premium inherent to altcoins further down the risk curve‚Ä¶ Thus, we think this warrants taking a defensive stance on risk for the time being.‚Äù Crypto VC Funding Declines The dwindling market cap lowered bullish expectations ahead of the second quarter. Meanwhile, institutional capital brought fresh shock to the market. In recent months, institutional funds have triggered massive asset growth, leading to mass adoption. According to the report, crypto VC funding grew from the last quarter, but it‚Äôs still at a 60% low compared to the 2021/2022 cycle. A low capital inflow reduces investment and limits large accumulation for institutions. Overall, this delays market expectations for a bull cycle.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-18 15:36:57

On Friday, his top economic adviser confirmed that removing the Federal Reserve chair is now a live option. ‚ÄúThe president and his team will continue to study that matter,‚Äù said Kevin Hassett, head of the National Economic Council, during a press briefing, when asked if Powell‚Äôs dismissal is on the table. That answer followed Trump‚Äôs latest outburst just one day earlier, where he openly threatened to fire Powell. Trump told reporters: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not happy with him. I let him know it and if I want him out, he‚Äôll be out of there real fast, believe me.‚Äù The president nominated Jerome Powell to lead the Fed during his first term. Since then, Powell has raised interest rates, resisted Trump‚Äôs demands, and warned that the president‚Äôs trade policies could damage the economy. Now, Federal Reserve governors are appointed for 14-year terms. Presidents can‚Äôt just fire them. To legally unseat Powell, Trump would have to prove ‚Äúcause,‚Äù something the law reserves for misconduct or major failure. Donald Trump with Jerome Powell. Official White House Photo by Andrea Hanks (Via Flickr) Trump tests legal limits as frustration builds with Fed leadership Trump‚Äôs administration is actively looking at how to bypass that rule. He‚Äôs already challenging similar restrictions in court. There‚Äôs a pending Supreme Court case where Trump is trying to remove limits on his power to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board. If the court sides with him, the ruling could give him legal cover to boot Powell too. Powell himself mentioned the case during a talk at the Economic Club of Chicago, saying: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a case that people talk about a lot. I don‚Äôt think that that decision will apply to the Fed, but I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs a situation that we‚Äôre monitoring carefully.‚Äù In 2018, the Fed raised rates many times, which infuriated Trump and made him consider firing Powell even back then. That threat spooked markets, but Trump eventually backed off. Now he‚Äôs back at it again, only this time he seems more serious, and he has fewer people trying to stop him. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been warning people inside the White House that firing Powell could wreck financial markets. Two people with direct knowledge of internal conversations told reporters that Bessent has delivered that message repeatedly. But Trump isn‚Äôt listening. His anger is building because Powell isn‚Äôt cutting rates, and Trump thinks he should‚Äôve done it a long time ago. Behind the scenes, the president has been talking to others about replacing Powell before his four-year term ends in May 2026. He met with Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to discuss the possibility. Warsh reportedly advised Trump not to interfere with Powell‚Äôs tenure and warned him against removing the Fed chair. But the idea didn‚Äôt die there. Others close to Trump have brought up firing Powell as recently as early March, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The US President Donald Trump revealed on Thursday that they were engaged in trade talks with China, but did not give evidence of any progress. Additionally, the Trump administration has shaken up trade waters with another announcement to introduce new fees on Chinese vessels, escalating the geopolitical tensions between the two. US measures touch markets in China in ‚Äòa difficult spot‚Äô According to local reports , the US‚Äô move is also further clouding the growth outlook. While the US could strain the Chinese logistics industry, it is also hurting the markets in many ways. Stocks tumbled on Friday with the Shanghai Composite Index closing 0.1% lower as it reversed the weekly gains to 1.2%. The CSI 300 was little changed while Hong Kong‚Äôs market was closed for a public holiday on Friday. According to SCMP, most of the country‚Äôs biggest companies traded lower on Friday, with liquor maker Moutai, slowing by 0.3% to 1,565.94 yuan. Coal producer China Shenhua Energy went down 0.2% to 39.20 yuan while electric vehicle manufacturer BYD let up by 1.1% to 346 yuan. Zhejiang Dingli Machinery saw its stock fall 8.6% after it reported a 13% decline in net profit last year, despite a 24% boost in operating income. In the meantime, Shaanxi Energy Investment suffered a 29% drop in its Q1 profits, further highlighting the ongoing challenges in the energy sector. Volatility in China to send ripples across global markets To worsen an already shaky relationship between the two countries, the US Trade Representative‚Äôs Office announced that Chinese-owned or Chinese-built ships will now be required to pay fees for docking at US ports. Charges are also expected to increase based on the vessel‚Äôs size and cargo. According to the SCMP, a second phase which is due to take effect in three years, will gradually limit the amount of liquefied natural gas (LNG) that foreign vessels can transport. The increasingly tough rules are phased in to boost American shipbuilding. And while the two powerhouses fight, industries across the globe, including manufacturing and energy, brace themselves for the potential impacts, which will most likely result in reshaped trade alliances and market strategies. The effects are already being felt on stock markets. ‚ÄúConfrontation is still the main theme of China-US trade war and there‚Äôll be lots of back and forth,‚Äù said Dongxing Securities analyst Lin Yang. ‚ÄúExternal factors still constitute the biggest uncertainty facing the market. The market is likely to trade sideways until the dust settles.‚Äù According to Finimize , the new port fees could worsen the volatility in Chinese logistics and trade stocks, sending waves across global markets. Investors are also closely watching the trade developments, weighing their effects on shipping costs and supply chain dynamics. As for Chinese stocks, they have been resilient even after the US rolled out tariffs on global trading partners this month. According to SCMP, several state-backed investment banks have intervened in the market to prop up stocks. Meanwhile, expectations are that China will introduce more forceful stimulus measures to boost domestic demand and offset the negative impact of the 145% tariff imposed by the US. Elsewhere, in Asia-Pacific, Nikkei 225 in Japan rose by 1% while South Korea‚Äôs Kospi added 0.5%. In Australia, markets were closed for a public holiday.

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) giant is looking to rival Elon Musk‚Äôs X and Meta as competition tightens globally. Recently, Musk and Altman have engaged in a social media rift after the former offered to buy ChatGPT. Open AI Eyes Social Network OpenAI is developing an X-like social platform focused on ChatGPT‚Äôs image generation. Citing sources familiar with the matter, The Verge wrote that Sam Altman is seeking feedback about the project. At the moment, little is known whether it will become a standalone application or integrated into ChatGPT. Adding a social feed to its AI model will help it scale, allowing it to access real-time, unique data. Simultaneously, it fosters user engagement amid growing competition across AI and social media giants. Musk‚Äôs X integrated Grok with real-time data to train the AI model effectively. X users showed optimism that Grok would receive diverse responses for both educational and entertainment purposes. This received massive reactions, with some executives saying it made everyone jealous, especially due to its high use cases. Meta is also planning a social feed for its incoming AI assistant. The launch of the platform will create fierce competition between X and OpenAI. In February, Altman hinted at OpenAI‚Äôs social app after reports of Meta‚Äôs upcoming platform gained traction. OpenAI looks to introduce new products to stay ahead of the market amid recent headwinds. In January, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek shook the US market after launching at a fraction of ChatGPT‚Äôs cost. The backlash raised scrutiny on OpenAI, with Altman pledging better models in the future. Sam Altcoin and Elon Musk Rivalry Mounts Reports of OpenAI launching an X-like social feed add to the growing tension between Musk and Altman. In February, Musk offered to buy OpenAI for $ 30 billion, a move that started a new chapter in the rift. Altman wrote on X ‚Äú No thank you, but we will buy Twitter for $9.74 billion if you want,‚Äù in response to the Tesla CEOs offer. Afterward, Musk filed a lawsuit accusing OpenAI of deviating from its non-profit structure. On their part, the company accused Musk of being the first to advocate for a profit model and also counter-sued Musk, citing attempts at a hostile takeover and bad faith tactics.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Elon Musk|OpenAI,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-18 15:45:59

In this article, we‚Äôll break down the latest developments from the past few days. Pi Network increases its global presence Earlier today (April 18), Pi News (a news channel dedicated to covering Pi Network activities) revealed that the project was added as an official sponsor of Consensus 2025. The annual conference, which will cover cryptocurrencies, Web3, and AI, will take place in Toronto, Canada, from May 14 to 16. Other entities that appear as sponsors alongside Pi Network include Nomyx, OpenFortune, Rootstock, Stacks, and others. According to X user Pioneer, Pi Network‚Äôs Founder & Head of Technology, Nicolas Kokkalis is set to take the stage at the conference. Some prominent names expected to attend the event are Eric Trump (the son of US President Donald Trump) and Robert Hines (Executive Director of the President‚Äôs Council of Advisors for Digital Assets at the White House). Listing signals from HTX, PI staking, and more One of the leading crypto exchanges ‚Äì HTX (formerly known as Huobi) ‚Äì recently uploaded a mysterious post on X. A pyramid stands at the center of the picture, while a skyline of towering skyscrapers is in the background. The Pi Network community quickly spotted PI‚Äôs logo on one of the buildings, speculating that HTX might become the next trading venue to list the token. Backing from this high-profile exchange could significantly enhance the asset‚Äôs liquidity and accessibility, which may positively impact the price. However, HTX‚Äôs hint should not be regarded as a guaranteed listing, as the community has seen previous similar moves from Binance and perhaps even Coinbase. For now, the exchanges providing services with the token include OKX, Gate.io, MEXC, CoinEx, and others. Separately, MOON JEFF (an X user who frequently touches upon Pi Network) revealed that the PI on-ramp has become available on the Zypto App. ‚ÄúYou can now buy PI with your bank card or mobile money. Very simple,‚Äù he said. Pi News, on the other hand, noted that PI staking is now available on OhPlay, where users can get up to 192% APY under certain conditions. The same news channel bragged about the network‚Äôs speeds and transaction costs, which are reportedly faster than those on Ethereum and even cheaper than those on Ripple. PI price outlook The native token of Pi Network has recorded a slight increase in the last 24 hours, and it currently trades at around $0.61. However, this represents a severe decline compared to the local top of $0.77 witnessed last week and a massive collapse from the all-time high of almost $3 observed at the end of February. PI Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the pullback, some analysts are optimistic that a new all-time high is just a matter of time. MOON JEFF claimed PI is ready to explode to $5, adding that BANXA has been buying more tokens to sell to fiat users. On the other hand, investors should beware of the major release of 212 million tokens scheduled for the next 30 days. The unlock might be followed by a price drop should investors decide to sell their long-awaited assets.

According to Coinbase's chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, the lawsuit is an exact ""copycat case"" of SEC‚Äôs 2023 lawsuit against the exchange , which the federal agency agreed to drop in February. Grewal added : ""In case you think I‚Äôm jumping to conclusions, the attorney general's office made it clear to us that they are literally picking up where the Gary Gensler SEC left off ‚Äî seriously. This is exactly the opposite of what Americans should be focused on right now."" The lawsuit signals that the crypto industry still faces regulatory hurdles and pushback at the state level, even after securing several legal victories on the federal level.

Gensler's exit triggered a wave of dropped lawsuits, enforcement actions and investigations against crypto firms, including Coinbase, Uniswap, and Kraken. Several US states followed the SEC's lead and also dropped their lawsuits against Coinbase in the first quarter of this year. Vermont, one of the 10 US states that filed litigation against the exchange, dropped its lawsuit on March 13. Vermont drops legal action against Coinbase.

Kentucky's Department of Financial Institutions became the third state-level regulator to dismiss its Coinbase lawsuit , ending the litigation on March 26. Despite the legal victory, Coinbase's Grewal called on the federal government to end the state-by-state approach of crypto regulation and focus on passing clear market structure policies at the federal level.

How Will Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Be Affected?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/fitch-announces-when-fed-will-start-cutting-interest-rates-how-will-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies-be-affected/,"The FED, which started the interest rate reduction cycle with a 50 basis point cut in September 2024, has been keeping interest rates constant since January. While Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors are waiting for the FED to start cutting interest rates to revive the market, US President Donald Trump is also pressuring the FED to cut interest rates. However, FED Chairman Jerome Powell stated in his statements that they are focused on a permanent decrease in inflation and their 2% target, and that they will act according to future economic data for interest rate cuts. Related News: Donald Trump Calls on Powell to Resign! ""Agenda: Interest Rate Cut!"" While the FED continues its cautious approach, Fitch Ratings, a globally recognized credit rating agency, estimated when the FED will start reducing interest rates. According to Reuters, Fitch said the Fed is likely to cut interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2025. According to Fitch, the Fed is expected to delay cutting interest rates until the fourth quarter of 2025, citing ongoing economic conditions and inflation trends. How Do FED's Interest Rate Cuts Affect Cryptocurrencies? The Fed‚Äôs rate cuts are expected to have a positive impact on Bitcoin and altcoins, as lower interest rates generally make borrowing cheaper, which can lead to increased liquidity in the financial system. Some of this liquidity could flow into higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, lower interest rates could weaken the dollar. A weaker dollar could make riskier assets like Bitcoin more attractive to investors, potentially pushing up their prices. Finally, low interest rates generally create a greater sense of risk in the markets. Investors are more willing to take risks, and cryptocurrencies could benefit from this and see a rise. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin falling wedge breakout hints at $100K Bitcoin has broken out of a multimonth falling wedge pattern, signaling a potential bullish reversal that could drive its price toward the $100,000 mark by May.

Recently,a wallet maintenance that was scheduled for April 17 happened and BNB‚Äôs 3.28% price surge due to the KernelDAO Megadrop has got everyone talking. But while BNB is making moves Ruvi AI has been quietly positioning itself to change the blockchain game with a $1 valuation prediction after launch. Ruvi AI: The Next Big Thing in Blockchain Ruvi AI is a cutting edge platform that combines blockchain with artificial intelligence. At its core is the superapp , an all in one platform for businesses and creators with advanced AI powered tools. From automated media production to scalable AI solutions for marketing, development and content creation. The ecosystem runs on the native $RUVI token which facilitates smooth and transparent transactions within its decentralized network. Unlike tokens that rely on market sentiment, Ruvi AI has practical applications and a clear long term vision which has already got global attention even before launch. Record Breaking Presale Within days of the presale launch Ruvi AI sold over 10 million $RUVI tokens and raised over $100,000 . This is a great start and shows investor confidence in the project and its future. Analysts point to Ruvi AI‚Äôs innovative design and achievable goals as the reason for its early success. Unlock VIP Tier 3 Ruvi AI takes investor incentives to the next level with its VIP reward system which offers tiered bonuses based on presale contributions. For example VIP Tier 3 offers great benefits for first time investors entering the market with medium contributions.Imagine investing $1,000 at $0.01 per token. This would give you 100,000 $RUVI tokens and with the 60% VIP Tier 3 bonus an additional 60,000 tokens . Ruvi has already confirmed its listing price to be $0.07 per token. So the initial $1,000 investment would turn into $11,200 when the token becomes available to be traded. Upon Ruvi AI‚Äôs predicted post-listing price of $1 the combined 160,000 tokens would be worth $160,000 and the initial $1,000 investment would be a 16,000% ROI . This level of accessibility and reward is attracting micro-investors and first time participants in ways larger cryptocurrencies can‚Äôt. Leaderboard Rewards Offer Bigger Stakes Ruvi AI is adding a competitive twist to its incentives with its leaderboard rewards program . Top contributors to the presale will be rewarded with massive token bonuses. The Top 10 investors will get 500,000 $RUVI tokens worth $35,000 at launch price. The Top 50 and Top 1,000 will get 250,000 and 20,000 tokens respectively. This will encourage broader participation and strategic investments during the presale period. Why Ruvi AI Stands Out While Binance and its BNB Smart Chain is focused on network stability and short term growth, Ruvi AI is planning for the future. Its innovative blockchain and AI integration ensures sustained utility across industries. With a presale performance that shows stability and a $1 valuation target post launch, Ruvi AI is redefining what success looks like in the cryptocurrency space. The Choice for Investors Ruvi AI‚Äôs trajectory offers innovation, practicality and high returns. With its record breaking presale, robust VIP rewards and widespread use cases, Ruvi AI is shaping up to be a serious player in 2025. Investors now have a choice as the blockchain space is moving fast. Will they take the opportunity Ruvi AI is offering for groundbreaking long term gains?

The non-custodial liquidity protocol lets users receive passive income through its borrowing participants who can access funds by providing assets worth more than their loan amounts. The platform implements an automatic interest rate control system which helps operate the ecosystem in a sustainable and optimized manner. Mutuum‚Äôs unique dual-lending framework combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems for maximum flexibility: P2C System: Smart contracts through P2C System regulate lending pools by modifying interest rates according to market trends which provides lenders with financial stability while securing loans for borrowers. P2P System: The decentralized framework removes middle actors to establish peer-to-peer lender-borrower linkages that grant borrowers and lenders total freedom and command over the process.

Simonetti, senior vice president and private wealth advisor at Morgan Stanley, downplayed Trump ‚Äôs attacks on Powell during an interview with CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄòFast Money‚Äô. According to Simonetti, this isn‚Äôt the first time Trump is slamming the Fed chair. According to Simonetti, this isn‚Äôt the first time Trump has slammed the Fed chair. He did so in 2019 as well, at the time describing Powell as a ‚Äúgolfer who can‚Äôt putt.‚Äù The latest outburst comes amid Trump‚Äôs dissatisfaction with how the Federal Reserve under Powell has handled the issue of interest rates, criticizing the central bank chief as always being ‚Äútoo late.‚Äù You might also like: U.S. stocks mixed as Trump calls for Fed to act Despite inflation data showing a slowdown, stocks have remained largely negative though the past week. Powell, who Trump says will soon be gone, maintained he will not step down. ‚ÄòMad Money‚Äô host Jim Cramer told CNBC he sees Powell ‚Äústuck between a rock and a hard place.‚Äù Earlier in the week the U.S. president posted on his Truth Social account that Powell‚Äôs ‚Äútermination cannot come fast enough.‚Äù Trump has reportedly considered firing Powell via the U.S. Supreme Court. Simonetti‚Äôs perspective is that Trump‚Äôs threats amount to ‚Äúnoise‚Äù that‚Äôs unlikely to have any immediate impact either on the markets or the Federal Reserve‚Äôs policy. According to her, it‚Äôs data‚Äînot political rhetoric‚Äîthat dictates what the Fed does.

That is the course of action Powell is rightly focusing on before taking steps. Given this, Simonetti says she does not expect any rate cuts in 2025, and believes Powell will likely serve out the remainder of his term. The Morgan Stanley exec‚Äôs comments come as markets have tanked amid negative investor reactions to tariffs and the trade war between China and the United States. Notably, Trump bashed Powell for not cutting interest rates even as the European Central Bank cut its key deposit facility rate by another 25 basis points. White House has pushed tariffs against China to 245% and seen risk asset markets plummet.

Now, Project 11, a quantum research firm founded in 2024, has launched a bold challenge: crack a simplified version of Bitcoin‚Äôs encryption using a quantum computer, and win 1 BTC (currently ~$85,000). Their goal? Understand how close quantum computing is to becoming a real threat. The contest‚Äîcalled the QDay Prize ‚Äîis open until April 5, 2026, and allows teams to attempt breaking ECC keys from 1 to 25 bits. BTC uses 256-bit ECC, so the challenge is symbolic, but meaningful. We just launched the Q-Day Prize. 1 BTC to the first team to break a toy version of Bitcoin‚Äôs cryptography using a quantum computer. Deadline: April 5, 2026 Mission: Protect 6M BTC (over $500B) ‚Äî Project 11 (@qdayclock) April 16, 2025 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not trying to break Bitcoin,‚Äù said Project 11‚Äôs Alex Pruden. ‚ÄúBut if quantum computing can break even a small key, we need to prepare now.‚Äù Why Quantum Could Break Bitcoin Traditional computers would need centuries to crack Bitcoin‚Äôs encryption. A quantum computer, however, could theoretically do it in minutes using Shor‚Äôs algorithm, a mathematical method that turns ECC‚Äôs strength‚Äîcomputational asymmetry‚Äîinto a vulnerability. That could expose users‚Äô private keys, forge signatures, and allow attackers to drain wallets. It‚Äôs not sci-fi anymore. As quantum technology accelerates, even blockchain titans are hedging their bets. Solana launched its Winternitz Vault earlier this year‚Äîusing hash-based, quantum-resistant signatures. Ethereum‚Äôs Vitalik Buterin has proposed a quantum-resistant hard fork for ETH. Bitcoin? So far, no active hard fork plans, but initiatives like Project 11‚Äôs challenge are pushing the community toward preparedness. A Wake-Up Call for the Industry Project 11‚Äôs competition is more than a coding contest. It‚Äôs a stress test for the future of crypto security. Even a 5-bit key breach would signal that quantum computing is advancing faster than anticipated. Key Takeaways: Project 11‚Äôs 1 BTC bounty is live until April 2026. The challenge uses scaled-down ECC keys to assess risk. A real-world quantum breach could compromise billions in crypto. Ethereum and Solana are already investing in quantum defenses. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know how far off ‚ÄòQ-Day‚Äô really is,‚Äù said Pruden. ‚ÄúBut when it arrives, we need to be ready.‚Äù Curious to see how close we are to the crypto cliff? Follow Project 11‚Äôs updates on X, or dive into their challenge page. It‚Äôs not just about Bitcoin‚Äîit‚Äôs about the security of everything built on top of it. Bitcoin Coils Within Triangle, Eyes Breakout From $84.5K Zone Bitcoin (BTC) is tightly consolidating within a symmetrical triangle on the 1-hour chart, suggesting an imminent breakout. Price is hovering around $84,588, testing the triangle‚Äôs apex while holding just above the 50 EMA at $84,587‚Äîa key short-term support level. This compression pattern, formed from the A-B-C-D wave sequence, reflects indecision but typically resolves with a sharp directional move. A confirmed close above $85,508 could unleash a rally toward $86,385, while a breakdown below $84,454 might expose $83,774 or $83,111. The MACD shows a fading bullish momentum, with the histogram weakening and the lines nearing a bearish crossover‚Äîadding caution to the near-term outlook. Trade Setup: Entry: Buy on breakout above $85,508 with strong volume Target: $86,385 Stop Loss: Below $84,450 Wait for confirmation‚Äîbreakouts without volume often fail. Patience is key in tight-range setups like this. BTC Bull Token Presale Tops $4.77M as Bitcoin Hovers Near $85K As Bitcoin edges closer to the $85,000 mark and macro uncertainty intensifies, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) continues to gain traction with retail and crypto-savvy investors. This Ethereum-based meme coin stands out by offering real Bitcoin airdrops every time BTC hits key price milestones‚Äîaligning directly with Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term upside. Earn Bitcoin with 86% APY Through Staking Beyond the airdrop rewards, BTC Bull‚Äôs staking program remains a major draw. Investors can earn up to 86% APY in passive income, while also contributing to the token‚Äôs network strength. The ability to unstake anytime makes it flexible for new and seasoned holders alike. Staking Snapshot: Annual Yield: 86% APY Total Staked: 1,222,531,969 BTCBULL Unstake Anytime: Yes With over 1.22 billion tokens already staked, momentum continues to build ahead of the next price milestone. Presale Nears Final Stretch as Demand Surges The presale is now approaching full subscription, with $4,769,780.40 raised out of the $5,466,194 target. The current token price remains at $0.002465, but with limited supply left and rising demand, a price hike could be imminent. Latest Presale Stats: Token Price: $0.00247 Raised So Far: $4.77M of $5.47M This window may be one of the last chances to secure BTCBULL before the next pricing tier kicks in. With its high-yield staking, real BTC rewards, and growing ecosystem engagement, BTC Bull is emerging as a top contender in the meme coin space‚Äîbacked by actual Bitcoin utility. With limited time remaining and demand accelerating, this is a key window to secure BTCBULL at presale rates before the next price jump.

The conversation around a possible XRP rally to $20 has increased amid reports that the Fed may incorporate Ripple‚Äôs blockchain network into its future payment infrastructure. While the rumor mill is churning, the implications of such a move are substantial for XRP‚Äôs valuation and its standing within the broader financial ecosystem. Fed Integration Rumors Trigger XRP Hype The idea that U.S. banks might be allowed to utilize Ripple‚Äôs blockchain has electrified the crypto community. This speculation, which centers around the Fed‚Äôs interest in incorporating distributed ledger technology (DLT) into its real-time payment systems, could mark a seismic shift in how traditional banking interacts with digital assets. One blockchain network gaining attention in this context is Ripple. Crypto analyst CryptoGeek drew attention to a recent publication by the Federal Reserve discussing how blockchain infrastructure could enhance the bridge between conventional financial institutions and decentralized protocols. Ripple, being U.S.-based and compliant with several regulatory frameworks, was mentioned among the viable technologies. Notably, the Fed‚Äôs upcoming update to its Fedwire Funds Service‚Äîslated for July 14‚Äîhas further fueled speculation that Ripple could be part of the implementation roadmap. Whispers of a Ripple-SWIFT collaboration add another layer of intrigue. The convergence of Ripple‚Äôs international reach and SWIFT‚Äôs banking network could set the stage for an expansive integration that would amplify XRP‚Äôs use in cross-border settlements. Forming such alliances could unlock enormous utility and liquidity for XRP across global banking systems. Could XRP Reach the $20 Mark? The big question is whether XRP can achieve a price target of $20 .If the Fed adopts Ripple‚Äôs infrastructure for real-time payments, XRP could become crucial to institutional finance. For $20 and a circulating supply of approximately 60 billion tokens, XRP‚Äôs market cap would exceed $1.2 trillion, potentially placing it as the most valuable altcoin, surpassing even Ethereum. Crypto veteran Davinci Jeremie , known for his early advocacy of Bitcoin at $1, has joined the conversation, projecting a possible XRP valuation of $24 by year-end. He attributed this optimistic forecast to growing governmental support for Ripple‚Äôs ecosystem. Jeremie believes increased XRP adoption within the U.S. government could spark a significant surge. Technical Picture: Where XRP Stands Now Despite the bullish backdrop, XRP must overcome several technical obstacles to enter a sustained uptrend. At present, its price action reveals hesitation among buyers. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator used to gauge market sentiment, shows a downturn after a recent upswing, indicating waning bullish momentum. A decline to a new lower low on the RSI could validate increased bearish control. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Nonetheless, XRP maintains a stronghold above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA)‚Äîa key long-term support level. This positioning provides a safety net against aggressive selling. Should the price hold above this level, XRP would avoid falling into a deeper correction. A bullish breakout, however, will only be confirmed if XRP decisively climbs above its 50-day EMA, currently acting as dynamic resistance near $2.21. This level also aligns with the upper boundary of a descending trend channel. A breakout here would reverse the short-term bearish structure and spark a fresh rally. Looking Ahead: From Hype to Possible History The convergence of institutional interest, regulatory clarity following Ripple‚Äôs partial legal win against the SEC, and the possibility of integration into the Federal Reserve‚Äôs payment rails paints a promising picture for XRP‚Äôs future. While nothing is officially confirmed, the mere discussion of Ripple becoming part of the U.S. financial system is enough to ignite investor interest and strategic accumulation. The potential upside is enormous. If the Fed were to greenlight Ripple as a cornerstone for next-gen banking architecture, it would signify a historic endorsement of blockchain technology. For XRP, such a move could validate years of development and advocacy, pushing it into an entirely new valuation tier. While short-term traders may remain cautious due to current resistance levels and momentum metrics, long-term holders may see this as a defining moment. Whether XRP hits $20 this year or not, the foundation is being laid for its role in shaping the future of digital finance‚Äîand possibly making history in the process.

The company recently introduced the region‚Äôs first tracker fund focused on the XRP token. Ripple, the company behind XRP , supports the fund with the first investment round. This new fund is designed for professional investors and is expected to help XRP attract the attention of large institutions. HashKey‚Äôs Strategic Move Toward Institutional Growth HashKey Capital, which also launched tracker funds for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), has added XRP to its portfolio. The company chose XRP because many businesses and institutions worldwide already use it for cross-border payments. In a statement, HashKey said XRP is leading the way in modern payment systems. The digital currency offers a faster and cheaper option than traditional services like SWIFT. By launching this fund, HashKey is showing confidence in XRP‚Äôs future. This is especially true as more banks and payment providers seek better alternatives to old systems. What Makes a Tracker Fund Different From ETF A tracker fund is different from an exchange-traded fund (ETF). While ETFs are traded on stock markets throughout the day, tracker funds work differently. Investors can only buy or sell shares once a day, so tracker funds are usually less liquid than ETFs. However, they are still useful tools for professional investors who want exposure to crypto without directly buying tokens. HashKey believes that, if regulators approve, this XRP tracker fund could eventually become a full ETF. Depending on market conditions and legal changes, that could happen within a year or two. That development could open the door to even more institutional investment. Hong Kong‚Äôs Role in Crypto Investment This announcement is part of a larger effort by HashKey to build investment products in Hong Kong. Earlier this year, the company and Bosera received approval to launch the world‚Äôs first tokenized money-market ETFs in the city. In April 2024, Hong Kong‚Äôs financial regulators approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, making it one of the first regions in Asia to allow such products. HashKey has predicted that Hong Kong‚Äôs crypto ETF market could grow to one-fifth the size of the U.S. market. Hong Kong has pledged to remain open to digital assets . The region is positioning itself as a leader in regulated crypto finance, offering investors more secure ways to enter the market.

Analysts Say Momentum Is Gaining Fast,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-pi-network-about-to-explode-toward-10-analysts-say-momentum-is-gaining-fast/,"Pi Network (PI) is up over 3% in the past 24 hours, showing a strong bounce from key support in recent days. Some traders now believe this recovery could mark the start of the next leg higher, as selling pressure begins to ease. Popular crypto trader Xia, followed by over 135K on X, noted that PI recently broke above the $0.63 resistance with strong volume ‚Äì a sign that bullish momentum may be building. Momentum‚Äôs building fast $PI smashes through $0.63 with strong volume, touching a high of $0.6441 before settling into consolidation RSI climbing, MACD turning bullish Over 58K sellers and 1.8M users on Map of Pi during #PiFest adoption is undeniable Still fading‚Ä¶ https://t.co/7HqB02RgSp pic.twitter.com/GyyNAJRzIQ ‚Äî Xia (@xiaweb3) April 16, 2025 Meanwhile, the pseudonymous user also highlighted that users‚Äô interest in Pi is strong with 1.8 million active participants during the most recent PiFest, which indicates strong community support. Similarly, crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin believes that Pi could recapture some of the territory it has lost during the recent selling spree as more exchanges list the token . Top crypto exchanges like Binance have so far held off on listing PI, citing concerns around verification and compliance. Pi Network has formally asked Binance to complete Know Your Business (KYB) verification in place of standard Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. Still, according to Dr. Altcoin, growing demand could eventually force major exchanges to comply in order to capture PI‚Äôs rising trading volumes. Pi Network Needs to Clear $0.72 for a Bullish Breakout Pi Network is consolidating within a clear symmetrical triangle, holding firm above the $0.60 support zone. Price action shows higher lows forming steadily, suggesting bullish pressure is building beneath the surface. The RSI is climbing and now sits at 54.5, reflecting growing strength without entering overbought territory. MACD momentum has also shifted slightly positive, with histogram bars turning green ‚Äì signaling a possible bullish crossover ahead. A breakout above $0.6375 could trigger a quick move toward $0.72, offering more than 10% upside in the near term. The bullish setup has some analysts speculating that PI could be gearing up for a much larger move ‚Äì with long-term targets as high as $10. While PI continues to find its footing, a new AI agent token called MIND of Pepe (MIND) has quietly gained traction, drawing millions into its presale. MIND of Pepe (MIND) Turns Viral Trends into Real-Time Insights for Token Holders MIND of Pepe (MIND) is designed to interact with high-profile social media accounts on platforms like X and discuss relevant topics associated with meme coins to capture insightful information about the market. These insights are passed to $MIND investors exclusively to help them identify trading and investing opportunities at an early stage. In addition, once MIND of Pepe has gained enough influence, it can launch its own meme coins to capture top social trends. $MIND holders will also get privileged access to the presale events of these assets to reap the highest returns once they are offered to the general public. To buy $MIND, simply head to the MIND of Pe p e website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either convert USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to make your investment.

Despite remaining approximately 36% below its highest price in the last three months, market watchers continue to express confidence in the asset‚Äôs future performance, citing potential catalysts that could spark renewed price momentum. A recent conversation between Abdullah Nassif‚Äîknown as ‚ÄúAbs,‚Äù the host of the Good Morning Crypto podcast‚Äîand Bradley Kimes, who runs the Digital Perspectives X account, shed light on some of the expected developments that may influence XRP‚Äôs trajectory. How XRP/ETfs and Market Makers will fight over XRP. Lock in. https://t.co/Gb3l4GoRNH ‚Äî Digital Perspectives (@DigPerspectives) April 16, 2025 ETFs as a Potential Market Driver Both commentators pointed to the potential approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on XRP as a critical factor. According to Kimes, ETFs could create significant market demand by reducing the available circulating supply. This occurs when investors buy ETF shares, requiring the fund managers to hold the underlying XRP tokens. Kimes stated that more than ten asset managers have shown interest in launching XRP ETFs. These include firms such as Bitwise , which manages approximately $12 billion in assets, and Grayscale, with around $50 billion in assets under management. Franklin Templeton , a trillion-dollar firm, has also reportedly applied to launch an XRP ETF. This level of institutional attention toward a single crypto asset, apart from Bitcoin or Ethereum, is notable. Proponents argue that consistent inflows into XRP ETFs could significantly increase demand, placing upward pressure on the price. Additional Demand from Payment Infrastructure Beyond the ETF applications, Kimes also mentioned that ongoing demand from market makers and payment processors, who rely on XRP for daily liquidity operations, could strengthen buying interest. These operational requirements, coupled with institutional investment, are seen as reinforcing each other to support long-term growth. Forecasts and Speculation While some analysts refrain from making definitive predictions, past reports have modeled various scenarios. One projection suggested that if XRP ETFs received $500 million in daily inflows, the price could potentially rise to $23. Another scenario proposed that capturing even half of Bitcoin‚Äôs ETF inflow levels could result in XRP‚Äôs value tripling. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Prominent voices in the space, including John Deaton of CryptoLaw and Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, believe the introduction of XRP ETFs could help the asset gain significant market share and possibly become the top altcoin by market capitalization. Diverging Opinions: Is BlackRock the Key Player? However, not everyone agrees on the broader impact of ETF approval. Analyst Joshua Jake argues that unless BlackRock‚Äîthe largest ETF issuer‚Äîenters the market with an XRP product, other applications may not generate the desired effect. He emphasized that BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF has vastly outperformed those offered by competitors, attracting nearly $40 billion in inflows. In contrast, ETFs from issuers such as Invesco and WisdomTree have garnered comparatively modest attention. Rumors continue to circulate about BlackRock‚Äôs potential interest in developing an XRP ETF, although the firm has previously expressed disinterest‚Äîparticularly during the period when Ripple‚Äôs legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was unresolved. Whether BlackRock revisits that decision remains unknown. Although the digital asset has not yet returned to recent highs, the current developments suggest a complex but promising landscape. ETF applications, increased utility in financial infrastructure, and growing institutional interest present multiple opportunities for price growth. Regardless, the outcome will depend on regulatory decisions, investor response, and participation from major financial entities in the ETF space.

The complaint filed in November alleges that the SEC acted beyond its authority in filing enforcement actions against crypto exchanges, arguing that the power the regulator asserts over digital assets belongs to individual states. ‚Äú[W]ithout Congressional authorization, the SEC has sought to unilaterally wrest regulatory authority away from the States through an ongoing series of enforcement actions targeting the digital asset industry, premised on the theory that practically all purchases and sales of digital assets are ‚Äòinvestment contracts.‚Äô‚Äù On April 16th, Judge Gregory Van Tatenhove of the Eastern District of Kentucky ordered a 60-day pause on the deadlines and legal proceedings related to the case following the appointment of pro-crypto businessman Paul Atkins as the new SEC chair.

Recall that bitcoin‚Äôs price ended last week on a positive note, after dumping below $75,000 to mark a five-month low. The tariff pause for almost all countries (aside from China) led to a significant bump on Thursday and Friday, and BTC entered the weekend at around $82,000. Unlike the previous one, last weekend was even mildly bullish as bitcoin jumped to $85,000 on Sunday evening. It continued its ascent on Monday by tapping $86,000, where it faced immediate rejection. Although it dropped by $3,000 within a day, it went back on the offensive later that day and jumped to a multi-week peak of $86,500. However, another rejection followed that brought a similar decline. Wednesday saw some more muted volatility (compared to the previous week) when BTC aimed at $86,000 but was quickly stopped by Fed Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs hawkish comments about the interest rates, as well as highlighting the dangers of the tariff war. Nevertheless, bitcoin has remained range-bound and its price now stands between $84,000 and $85,000 as it has been throughout most of the week. Although some altcoins, such as Bitcoin Cash and Solana, have outperformed BTC on a weekly scale, the largest cryptocurrency‚Äôs market dominance has only strengthened lately.

Be Part of the Codename:Pepe DAO and Shape the Future of AI-powered Trading Solana‚Äôs Soaring Journey: Is SOL the Next Big Thing in Crypto? Solana‚Äôs story shows a different arc. Founded in 2017 by engineer Anatoly Yakovenko, the network uses proof‚Äëof‚Äëhistory to time‚Äëstamp transactions and advertises more than 50,000 settlements per second at low cost. That speed helped lift SOL from near $40 in mid‚Äë2021 to a record $263.83 on 2 November 2024, a gain of roughly 600 percent. The chain‚Äôs low fees‚Äîoften measured in fractions of a cent‚Äîhave led some users to nickname it an ‚ÄúEthereum killer.‚Äù Solana‚Äôs strengths are speed, scalability, and low costs. It‚Äôs attracting developers and users seeking efficient decentralized applications. Called an ‚ÄúEthereum Killer,‚Äù Solana offers better performance and interoperability for smart contracts. Solana‚Äôs token, SOL, has grown impressively. By November 2024, it hit an all-time high of $263.83, surging over 600% since mid-2021. This growth shows strong investor interest. Forecasts compiled by analysts suggest an average SOL price of $431 in 2025 and above $1,000 by 2030, pending continued developer interest. Those projections rely on steady growth of decentralized applications, including non‚Äëfungible tokens, gaming platforms and high‚Äëfrequency finance tools. Recent sessions, however, have seen SOL drift lower, reflecting both profit‚Äëtaking and concerns about broader economic conditions. Cardano‚Äôs Rise: Is ADA the Future of Sustainable Blockchain? Cardano, launched the same year, focuses on sustainability. Its Ouroboros proof‚Äëof‚Äëstake system is promoted as energy‚Äëefficient while keeping security tight. ADA reached $3.10 during the 2021 bull run and has since cooled. Some models see new highs after future Bitcoin halvings, pointing to a possible transfer of gains from the largest coin to altcoins; others urge caution, citing market swings that have repeatedly reset price floors. The Cardano team highlights peer‚Äëreviewed research backing each update and says its roadmap could expand the chain‚Äôs reach into identity management, supply‚Äëchain tracking and public‚Äësector records. Analyst price targets for ADA cover a broad range. Optimistic charts project the token near $10 by decade‚Äôs end, while conservative models place it closer to today‚Äôs levels. Most agree that Cardano‚Äôs appeal lies in staking rewards, where token holders lock coins to secure the network and receive periodic payouts. The platform‚Äôs next expansion phase, known as ‚ÄúVoltaire,‚Äù would add on‚Äëchain governance designed to hand long‚Äëterm control to the user base. Historically, ADA saw significant growth during the crypto bull run of 2021, reaching an all-time high of $3.10. While the market experienced corrections, experts speculated that events like Bitcoin halvings could ignite new bull markets, benefiting altcoins like ADA. Predictions varied, with some forecasts suggesting substantial increases in ADA‚Äôs value over the following years. Looking ahead, analysts have offered diverse long-term price predictions for ADA. Some foresee the token reaching impressive heights, highlighting its strong fundamentals and market positioning. Others adopt a more conservative outlook, reflecting the inherent uncertainties in the crypto market. These varying predictions underscore both the potential and the unpredictability of ADA‚Äôs future performance. In the current market cycle, ADA‚Äôs focus on sustainability and technological advancement makes it an attractive option for investors and developers alike. As Cardano continues to evolve and expand its ecosystem, it could play a significant role in the blockchain industry. While future price movements are uncertain, ADA‚Äôs potential for growth keeps it on the radar of many in the crypto community. Conclusion As the bullish trend strengthens, Codename:Pepe crypto is poised to deliver maximum profits through its advanced AI-driven trading strategies and automated systems. Its community-focused approach and innovative features position it as a standout asset, suggesting that it may continue to outpace other coins in the market.

43494805,https://blockworks.co/news/arbitrum-timeboost-live-dao-revenue,1744995832,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,"Arbitrum‚Äôs Timeboost goes live, generates $2,491 in DAO revenue on day 1",https://blockworks.co/news/arbitrum-timeboost-live-dao-revenue,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . More than a year after its initial announcement, Arbitrum launched Timeboost yesterday. Timeboost is a new way of ordering transactions on Arbitrum. That seems pretty boring and unexciting on the surface, but hopefully we can show you why it‚Äôs a pretty big deal. Transactions today on Arbitrum are ordered on a simple first come, first serve (FCFS) basis. Seems fair! But it‚Äôs problematic in practice: Financial systems need a way to efficiently process transactions. When markets crash, a lending application like Aave needs a way to quickly liquidate pledged collateral before prices plummet further. Since transactions are cheap and not regulated by prices due to the FCFS mechanism, MEV searchers repeatedly spam the network to increase their chances of transaction inclusion. This degrades the overall network user experience. Think Uber without surge pricing. Sounds fair, but then everyone ‚Äî regardless of their priority ‚Äî would be calling for cabs, and a pregnant woman in labor who needs to get to the hospital asap struggles to get a ride. Timeboost tries to mitigate this problem by introducing an auction where MEV searchers can bid for transaction priority. The winner of the auction gets their transaction fast-tracked in an ‚Äúexpress lane.‚Äù This is roughly how it works: Tony and Janice are MEV searchers. Both compete for priority inclusion ‚Äî Tony pays 1 ETH and Janice pays 2 ETH in the auction. Neither knows how much the other is bidding because transactions sit in a private mempool. Janice wins the auction and pays the price of Tony‚Äôs bid (1 ETH). Tony‚Äôs transaction is delayed by 200ms while Janice‚Äôs transaction receives immediate inclusion in the express lane. Hence the name: Timeboost. Timeboost in effect introduces an optional market pricing mechanism into its fee market. It‚Äôs similar to what EIP-1559 and Flashbots‚Äô MEV-Boost software does for the Ethereum L1, FastLane does for Polygon, and what Priority Gas Auction does for Optimism. Timeboost is generally perceived as bullish because it creates value accrual for the ARB token by taking it back from MEV searchers. How much are we talking? About a $30m opportunity for ARB stakers, Entropy Advisors estimates . Arbitrum MEV searchers extracted an estimated $29.3m in March alone. After a mere one day of being live, Timeboost has generated $2492 in DAO revenue. Source: Dune OK, so Timeboost is great. But there are broader complaints. Some worry that the ability to monetize sequencer revenue means a shrinking incentive for Arbitrum to decentralize the sequencer. Max Resnick, for instance, has previously made that argument on the Bankless podcast. Personally, I think the hand-wringing around centralized sequencers is somewhat overblown. Recall back in January how users were able to bypass sequencer-level censorship on the Soneium chain by triggering a forced transaction inclusion on the L1. Sequencer centralization is a problem, but it‚Äôs not quite as important as, say, having fraud proofs. Yet, Arbitrum has plans to make Timeboost compatible with decentralized sequencing. It‚Äôs all part of the roadmap, Offchain Labs CEO Steven Goldfeder told me at ETHDenver . The complexity of Timeboost‚Äôs design and making it eventually compatible with a decentralized sequencer set was part of the reason the launch was delayed, Arbitrum CTO Harry Kalodner told Blockworks. A September 2024 blog points to Arbitrum‚Äôs collaboration with Espresso to create a decentralized Timeboost. Rollups using Timeboost would be able to auction off the right to sequence blocks on the Espresso marketplace (see the formal specs here ). That‚Äôs essentially an auction (Timeboost) inside of an auction (Espresso) inside of an auction (L1 settlement). But hey, at least everything is decentralized. Get the news in your inbox.

The Donald Trump administration has been working with Congress to enact bi-partisan clear crypto regulations. The U.S. SEC under Paul Atkins has been dropping crypto cases to await clear directions from Congress. In a surprising twist of events, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, who is affiliated with the Democratic Party, filed a securities enforcement action against Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN) on Friday, April 18. Rayfield will be picking up from where former SEC Chair Gary Gensler left in asserting that Coinbase has over the years operated an unregistered securities exchange and a broker-dealer. ‚ÄúIn case you think I‚Äôm jumping to conclusions, the AG‚Äôs office made it clear to us that they are literally picking up where the Gary Gensler SEC left off. Seriously,‚Äù Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, noted . Grewal pointed out that the lawsuit may hamper efforts by bipartisan lawmakers to pass comprehensive federal legislation for digital assets. ‚ÄúOregon‚Äôs holdout campaign is obstruction for the sake of obstruction. It is a desperate scheme that does nothing to move the crypto conversation forward, and in fact takes us a giant leap backward from hard-won progress,‚Äù Grewal added.

43495748,https://timestabloid.com/?p=64440,1744996358,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Forecasts XRP Could Reach $50 By This Date,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-forecasts-xrp-could-reach-50-by-this-date/,"A prominent technical analyst and crypto trader has made bold price predictions for XRP, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could see substantial growth over the next few years, despite its current struggles to maintain a foothold above the $2 mark. At present, the token is trading at $2.07 , but it has experienced significant volatility recently. Between April 6 and 8, the price dropped sharply by over 17%, falling to a low of $1.79‚Äîits lowest level in five months. However, the coin managed a strong recovery, increasing by 14.33% the following day and regaining its position above the $2 threshold. Despite fluctuating around this level, XRP has found it challenging to hold steady above it, although bearish pressure seems to be losing strength. Price Prediction: $50 for XRP by 2030? In the face of this uncertainty, market analyst Cryptominder has expressed a high level of confidence in XRP‚Äôs potential . While other analysts have set their sights on more conservative targets‚Äîranging from $12 to $15‚ÄîCryptominder believes that XRP could reach as high as $50 by 2030. This would represent an increase of approximately 2,340% from its current price of $2.07. In 5 years from now $XRP will be over 50$ price. Today is the day you will remember. You will say to your friends that we never believed in XRP when it was 0.09$ we never believed at 0.35$ we never believed at 2$. I buy this XRP you are not. I bought at these prices! ‚Äî Cryptominder (@Crypt0minder) April 17, 2025 According to Cryptominder, achieving this $50 price target would require XRP to experience consistent annual growth, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 90%. Considering XRP‚Äôs impressive 237% growth in the past year, the analyst suggests that such a trajectory is not only possible but also highly plausible. He is confident that market participants who invest in the token at this price point will see significant returns, much like those who purchased XRP when it was trading at $0.09 or $0.35 in previous years. Cryptominder points out that similar cautious sentiments surrounded XRP during these earlier price points, with many investors dismissing its potential at the time. However, those who believed in its long-term value were rewarded with substantial profits, and Cryptominder expects the same outcome for those currently purchasing XRP around $2. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other Analysts Echoing Optimism Cryptominder‚Äôs optimistic outlook is not isolated. Other analysts share similar bullish sentiment about XRP‚Äôs future potential. For example, Amonyx, a well-known crypto analyst, has predicted that XRP could surpass $10 and potentially reach $50, asserting that nothing could halt the coin‚Äôs momentum. In addition, Edoardo Farina, another market pundit, suggested that once XRP hits the $50 mark, investors might begin clamoring for it to reach $100. Additionally, Telegaon, a market analysis platform, has made projections similar to Cryptominder‚Äôs , indicating that XRP could achieve a peak of $48 by 2030. Meanwhile, analysts from Changelly have a more cautious outlook, forecasting that the token may not hit $50 until 2033. Despite the asset‚Äôs recent price fluctuations and challenges in maintaining its position above $2, several prominent analysts remain confident in its long-term potential. With projections ranging from $48 to $50 by 2030, it is clear that many market participants believe in XRP‚Äôs ability to achieve substantial growth over the next several years. Investors currently holding XRP may have reason to be optimistic, as similar bullish predictions for the coin have proven accurate in the past.

The fledgling meme coin has announced several key updates and hit key milestones since the beginning of its development. Let‚Äôs recap some of the project‚Äôs biggest announcements and milestones. The Wildly Successful Presale The Husky Inu presale has been a resounding success, with the project having already raised $742,648. The presale stage will end once the project‚Äôs fundraising goal is completed or all the tokens are sold out. The HINU token price increases with every new presale stage, with the project inching towards its next milestone of $750,000. The Husky Inu presale owes its presale success to several unique features. Husky Inu is committed to creating a reliable token ecosystem by using a carefully designed distribution model and capping its token supply to 100 billion, ensuring scarcity and value. The project has also integrated a deflationary mechanism, with plans to allocate 50% of all platform fees collected from the upcoming decentralized exchange to buy back HINU tokens and reduce their supply over time. The Official HINU Token Launch Date Husky Inu set the meme coin ecosystem alight on April 1, when it announced the official launch date of the HINU token. The project announced the launch in a blog post addressed to the community, revealing that the official launch date of the Husky Inu (HINU) token is set for March 27, 2026. The team behind the project thanked users and the larger meme coin community for their unwavering support, dedication, and enthusiasm, stating that the project had witnessed unprecedented growth in numbers, strength, vision, and community engagement. ‚ÄúOver the recent period, the Husky Inu project has experienced remarkable growth not only in numbers but in strength, vision, and community engagement. We are sincerely grateful for the overwhelming support, dedication, and enthusiasm shown by every member of our ecosystem. Your belief in the Husky Inu mission has been the driving force behind our momentum.‚Äù Earn App Update The project also issued an update about the Earn App, revealing that its launch date is set for May 14, 2025. The Earn App will allow users to earn HINU tokens by completing tasks, including liking, commenting, sharing, and viewing videos. Users can also create original videos. The Earn App‚Äôs primary goal is to drive organic engagement, expand the project‚Äôs reach, and increase visibility. By rewarding users for their efforts, the Earn App empowers the community and contributes to the viral growth of the Husky Inu project. The Pre-Launch Phase The project also announced its pre-launch phase, which officially began on April 1. The pre-launch phase picks up where the presale left off and continues the project‚Äôs fundraising efforts. It marks the next strategic step in the Husky Inu roadmap, designed to raise additional capital to fund ongoing development, platform improvements, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. Activating Card Payments The Husky Inu project also announced a partnership with Wert.io, enabling card payments to make HINU token purchases simple, secure, and accessible. The partnership allows anyone with a credit or debit card to seamlessly purchase the HINU token and behind the fledgling meme coin project.

On April 17, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Manufacturing Index ‚Äî a monthly survey of 250 US-based manufacturers ‚Äî reported the sharpest declines in overall business activity since 2020. The data puts Bitcoin ( BTC ) ‚Äúunder short term pressure,‚Äù researchers at Bitunix, a crypto exchange, said in a post on the X platform. They added that Bitcoin could still see a ‚Äústrong comeback‚Äù if its price holds above $83,000 per coin. As of April 18, Bitcoin has been trading at approximately $84,000 per coin, according to data from Google Finance. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs bearish report comes as factories brace for the impact of US President Donald Trump‚Äôs plans to impose sweeping tariffs on US imports, potentially raising production costs for manufacturers. ‚Äú[I]ndicators for general activity, new orders, and shipments all fell and turned negative‚Ä¶ suggest[ing] subdued expectations for growth over the next six months,‚Äù the report said .

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 ‚Äî an index of US stocks ‚Äî is still down by around 7%. ‚ÄúEven in the wake of recent tariff announcements, BTC has shown some signs of resilience, holding steady or rebounding on days when traditional risk assets faltered,‚Äù Binance said.

He still wants to place high taxes on many Chinese imports, causing concerns among crypto executives who fear a trade war could harm blockchain networks.

Enter Qubetics, a groundbreaking platform that focuses on interoperability, allowing seamless transactions across various blockchain ecosystems. While Bitcoin remains the king of crypto with its unmatched market dominance, its scalability and environmental concerns limit its potential in today‚Äôs fast-moving digital landscape. On the other hand, Mantra is making waves in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world, but it faces stiff competition from larger platforms. Qubetics stands out with its non-custodial, multi-chain wallet, offering secure and hassle-free transactions across various blockchains. With its presale gaining significant traction and analysts predicting impressive returns, Qubetics is quickly becoming one of the best cryptos to invest in today for short-term growth. Qubetics: Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet for Blockchain‚Äôs Future Blockchain technology continues to innovate, but a major hurdle remains: the lack of seamless integration between various blockchain networks. Enter Qubetics. Unlike Bitcoin or Mantra, Qubetics is designed with interoperability at its core, making it a true pioneer in blockchain technology. With the inclusion of a non-custodial multi-chain wallet, Qubetics addresses the essential need for businesses, professionals, and everyday users to interact across different blockchain platforms without worrying about custody risks or transaction limitations. Qubetics‚Äô non-custodial multi-chain wallet offers users complete control over their assets. This unique feature allows for secure and flexible transactions across multiple blockchain ecosystems, eliminating the need to rely on centralized platforms. The wallet is designed with user experience in mind, simplifying the process for anyone looking to send or receive cryptocurrency across various blockchain networks seamlessly. Whether you‚Äôre a developer working on decentralized applications or a business exploring blockchain for cross-border payments, Qubetics‚Äô wallet ensures that all operations are streamlined and hassle-free. Currently in its 30th stage, the Qubetics best crypto presale has already seen more than 508 million tokens sold to over 24,900 holders, raising over $16.2 million. At just $0.1729 per token, it‚Äôs an opportunity for early adopters to get in on a blockchain network designed to overcome the shortcomings of its predecessors. Analysts predict significant ROI as the project evolves, with $TICS tokens potentially seeing up to 8567% ROI after the mainnet launch. Analysts‚Äô Predictions for $TICS: $TICS at $1 = 477% ROI $TICS at $5 = 2789% ROI $TICS at $6 = 3367% ROI $TICS at $10 = 5678% ROI $TICS at $15 = 8567% ROI Qubetics is undeniably one of the best cryptos to invest in today for anyone looking for long-term, secure, and scalable blockchain solutions. With its advanced features and future-ready architecture, it‚Äôs set to become a major player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. Bitcoin Set to Follow Gold‚Äôs Surge: Analyst Predicts BTC to Reach New Highs Within 150 Days Gold reached a new all-time high of $3,357 per ounce, sparking speculation that Bitcoin (BTC) could follow suit, as historical data shows a consistent pattern of Bitcoin rallying within 100-150 days of gold‚Äôs price surges. Past trends include Bitcoin‚Äôs rise to $19,120 after gold‚Äôs 30% hike in 2017 and its subsequent surge to $69,000 in 2021 following gold‚Äôs rally during the pandemic. Analysts, including Joe Consorti from Theya, suggest that Bitcoin often mirrors gold‚Äôs directional bias with a lag, driven by economic uncertainty and investors seeking alternatives to the US dollar. Based on this pattern, Bitcoin is expected to hit new all-time highs between Q3 and Q4 of 2025, with some analysts predicting a parabolic rise, potentially reaching as high as $400,000. Mantra (OM) Token Faces Liquidity Crisis After 90% Crash; Plans Burn Program to Restore Confidence The OM token of the Mantra project experienced a dramatic 92% decline within an hour, plummeting from over $6 to under $0.45. This sharp drop has been attributed to forced liquidations during low-liquidity periods on centralized exchanges, resulting in significant market turmoil. In response, Mantra‚Äôs CEO, John Mullin, announced plans to implement a comprehensive burn program, including burning team tokens, to reduce the circulating supply and rebuild investor trust. The project has also committed to transparency by releasing detailed reports on tokenomics and circulating supply, aiming to address community concerns and strengthen market resilience. Understanding Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallets: The Future of Digital Finance As cryptocurrencies continue to gain popularity, the need for secure and efficient ways to manage digital assets becomes more apparent. Non-custodial wallets are the answer. These wallets give users complete control over their private keys, ensuring that only they can access their funds. Unlike custodial wallets, which rely on third-party services to hold your private keys, non-custodial wallets eliminate the risk of hacks or failures from centralized entities. Qubetics takes this a step further by offering a non-custodial multi-chain wallet, allowing users to manage assets across multiple blockchains without needing to trust a third party. This multi-chain capability is crucial for anyone who uses different blockchain ecosystems, making transactions and asset management smoother and more secure. For businesses, professionals, and everyday crypto users, non-custodial multi-chain wallets like Qubetics‚Äô offer unmatched convenience and security. They enable seamless interactions across various blockchain networks, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as newer platforms like Qubetics, all within a unified platform. Conclusion: Why Qubetics is One of the Best Cryptos to Invest in Today In conclusion, while Bitcoin and Mantra offer unique advantages in the cryptocurrency space, it‚Äôs Qubetics that stands out as the top choice for the future. Its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and non-custodial multi-chain wallets provides a level of flexibility and security that its predecessors simply can‚Äôt match.

Following its strong rally in late 2024, the price entered a prolonged consolidation phase, forming lower highs and higher lows. This coiling structure has compressed price action between descending resistance and horizontal support in the $1.80‚Äì$2.00 range. As the apex nears, market pressure is building (hinting at a powerful upward breakout that could erupt at any moment). History Favors Aggressive Upside XRP has previously delivered massive gains from similar wedge setups. In crypto, falling wedges often precede sharp upward moves, especially when they form after sustained uptrends. The current chart reflects that same structure. Moreover, declining volume during the wedge formation reinforces the bullish case ‚Äîit often precedes a sudden surge in interest once resistance breaks, unleashing pent-up momentum. Strong Support, Weakening Resistance XRP‚Äôs base support has remained rock-solid through multiple tests, showing buyer conviction at key levels. Meanwhile, resistance is losing its grip. Price action is increasingly crowding the upper wedge boundary, signaling bullish dominance. Each test weakens resistance further, and with the apex approaching, XRP appears set to breach the barrier‚Äîpotentially before the end of May. Measured Targets: $4 Conservative, $10+ Possible Technically, the wedge‚Äôs height‚Äîfrom $0.85 to $3.00‚Äîprojects a minimum breakout target of around $4.15. However, the steep trajectory marked on the chart suggests a much more aggressive upside. If volume surges post-breakout and sentiment accelerates, XRP could rapidly climb to $5‚Äì$6. Should a full parabolic phase kick in, $8.50 to $10 become a realistic short-term target before any correction emerges. Momentum and Market Catalysts Align Investor psychology plays a pivotal role in wedge breakouts. As XRP presses against resistance, buy orders stack above the line, while short sellers prepare to exit. A breakout could unleash a wave of momentum driven by both long entries and short covering. On top of that, catalysts such as a favorable SEC ruling, Ripple partnerships, or institutional adoption could supercharge the rally. The setup is primed‚ÄîXRP just needs a spark. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Macro Conditions Fuel the Setup Zooming out, broader market trends bolster XRP‚Äôs breakout scenario. Bitcoin continues its bullish lead, attracting institutional flows and driving overall sentiment. Historically, altcoins like XRP follow Bitcoin‚Äôs surge, often with explosive lag rallies. As retail attention returns and liquidity deepens, XRP stands ready to ride the wave. The market environment is ideal ‚Äì breakout conditions are firmly in place. Projection: XRP Hits $10 Before Pullback If XRP breaks above $2.15 with convincing volume, the move could escalate rapidly, reaching $4‚Äì$6 within days or weeks. Given the strength of the pattern, bullish market conditions, and historical behavior, XRP may spike as high as $8.50 to $10 before facing meaningful resistance. This would represent a 4x‚Äì5x move from current levels. A pullback is likely at that point, as profit-taking sets in but the breakout itself could be the defining move of 2025.

Chainlink ( LINK ) was trading at a crucial resistance point at $12.60 on Friday, up from this month‚Äôs low of $10.15. A potential catalyst for LINK is that its exchange outflows have continued rising as investors move their tokens to self-custody. Nansen data shows that Chainlink tokens on exchanges dropped by 1.1% in the last seven days to 260 million, compared to 263 million tokens the same day last week.

SPX6900 historic price sentiment SPX6900 price history SPX6900 was launched in August 2023 with an opening price of $0.003 but remained under the radar for over a year. In October 2023, SPX6900‚Äôs value spiked to $0.023, which was a considerable growth trajectory, but still, it remained far from market attention. December of 2023 saw a low price of $0.008, which was quite low as compared to the price in October as per crypto market historical data. SPX6900 saw a stagnating price movement from January to May 2024, only to rise periodically to $0.015. In September 2024, SPX6900 gained an enormous 5600% from September 12 to October 14, reaching $0.913, resulting in a massive market capitalization. The token has been making higher spikes since November 7, 2024, after which its value has deteriorated. On November 21, SPX6900 stooped to $0.450, losing 50% of its value, which made holders cautious. However, the token regained its lost value and ended the year at $0.856. SPX6900 entered January 2025 with a price tag of $0.866, but it soon jumped to $1.55.

The token has reached phase 4 with a selling price of $0.025 and set to rise 20% to $0.03 in phase 5. Token purchasers rush to purchase Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prior to its price increase because they expect up to 140% earnings when the exchange listing settles at $0.06. The market leader Ethereum (ETH) shows conflicting clues to investors because analysts predict both price growth and future declines. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has entered the market as a strategic DeFi opportunity that delivers promising gains. Investors need to pay attention to this project within the active crypto market filled with investment potential. Ethereum‚Äôs Uncertain Path The prediction for Ethereum (ETH) varies between opposing market analyst perspectives. Experts predict a quick price surge since price patterns indicate bearish underwater conditions that could push the market value to $2,000. Research shows that the project could potentially fall to $1,100 market value while alternative data implies a possible upward trend to $2,000. The technical chart presents a descending triangle pattern that might consequently break up or down. The market strength will decide whether ETH can maintain its position at $1,550. Yet, the unpredictability lingers. The possession of ETH serves long-term believers strategically although investors move toward novel crypto possibilities because of market instability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) bridges the shortcoming between central banks and digital currencies by providing a usable structured financing structure. Mutuum Finance‚Äôs Presale Momentum The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform is moving fast in phase 4 as its tokens currently trade at $0.025. The project has accumulated $6.9 million of investor capital through intense demand for financing. The total sellout speed of Phase 4 creates an urgent dynamic before Phase 5 launches because it increases token prices by 20% to $0.03 which will yield an instant 20% return for current buyers. The original token value distribution framework guarantees investors will achieve a 140% profit as tokens start trading at $0.06. The company expects investor receipts from $2.50 after launch which translates to a staggering 9,900% return. The team strives to build trust by actively seeking a Certik audit on smart contracts which will provide results that get announced on social channels. The market benefits from this transparent information in its effort to develop confidence. Innovative Features Driving Demand His DeFi solutions distinguish Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from other platforms. Mutuum Finance connects two different lending strategies through its dual-lending model which incorporates both peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer systems to allow users to obtain passive income and collateralized loans. The recent dashboard release from the team displays holders ranked from 1st to 50th position where holders receive bonus tokens when they keep their ranking. By creating this system MUTM can both keep its users coming back and raise their overall involvement. Through its buy-and-distribute process the system draws revenue to repurchase tokens which it distributes to staking participants for maintaining constant market demand. The duration for acquiring MUTM tokens at their current price of $0.025 continues to diminish during Phase 4 while the market remains actively dynamic. Do Not Lose This Chance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands at a pivotal juncture. Potential investors now have the rare chance to acquire Mutuum Finance at $0.025 during Phase 4 prior to the impending Phase 5 adjustment of 20%. The project maintains strong credibility through its current $6.9 million fundraise which supports over 8,400 holders. Ethereum (ETH) demonstrates strong long-term potential despite short-term uncertainties that remain inferior to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) planned growth trajectory.

Ethereum ( ETH ) was trading at $1,580 on Friday, where it has remained throughout the week. It has risen by 14% from its lowest point this month. Ethereum continues to face many challenges, especially the rising competition from layer-2 networks like Base and Arbitrum ( ARB ). Other layer-1 networks like Sui ( SUI ) and Solana ( SOL ) have continued to gain market share in industries like decentralized finance and gaming. Most tellingly, spot Ethereum ETFs have continued to shed assets this year. These funds attracted zero inflows on Thursday, following seven consecutive days of net outflows.

Further data shows that some Ethereum investors have started to capitulate by selling their holdings at a loss. The chart below shows that the Network Realized Profit/Loss has remained in the red for a while. This metric measures the net profit or loss of all coins moved on the blockchain. ETH NRP data | Source: Santiment Ethereum price technical analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Ethereum remains in a strong bearish downtrend after peaking at $4,100 last year. It continues to trade below both the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages and below the key support level at $2,140. This support is notable since it was the neckline of the triple-top pattern on the weekly chart. On the positive side, Ethereum has formed a bullish divergence pattern as the two lines of the MACD continue to rise. The Relative Strength Index has also moved slightly above the descending trendline. The coin has also formed a giant falling wedge pattern, comprising two descending and converging trendlines. As these lines approach convergence, there is a likelihood of a strong bullish breakout in the near term. If this happens, the next level to watch will be $2,140, the lowest swing in August and September last year. This target is about 35% above the current level.

The announcement is in line with the country‚Äôs strategy to embrace digital finance systems. In recent times, digital currencies have gained more traction globally as more nations seek to modernize their financial systems. These nations are turning to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to achieve this modernization and prepare for the future. Countries like Nigeria, China, and Sweden have already taken significant steps by launching or piloting their own national digital currencies. Now, the Kyrgyz Republic is joining the ranks with the introduction of its own CBDC‚Äîthe digital som. Digital som becomes legal tender The Kyrgyz Republic has officially recognized its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital som, as legal tender. On March 20, 2025, the Jogorku Kenesh adopted the constitutional law, which President Sadyr Zhaparov then signed. The purpose of the law titled ‚ÄúOn Amendments to the Constitutional Law of the Kyrgyz Republic ‚ÄòOn the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic‚Äô‚Äù is to establish a clear legal and operational framework for the launch of the digital som. The law outlines that the digital som is the national currency in digital form and will be a recognized legal means of payment throughout the Kyrgyz Republic. The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic has exclusive rights to issue, regulate, and manage the digital currency, and will serve as the sole operator of the digital som platform. The law also includes additional provisions for the digital currency‚Äôs use and operation. For instance, the digital som can only be circulated through a specialized digital platform. The national bank will set up crypto-related security measures to ensure transaction security and prevent fraud. The bank will also clearly establish the rules of operation for commercial banks and regulate the financial institutions using the platform. These measures are part of the Kyrgyz Republic‚Äôs attempt to secure its financial systems while introducing innovative, digital payment solutions. Pilot program rollout expected in 2026 Following the legalization of the CBDC through a signed Constitutional Law, a pilot project for the prototype of the digital som is scheduled to launch in 2025. This trial phase is aimed at testing the technical and practical performance of the CBDC system. The pilot project will evaluate everything from user experience to platform security and interoperability with the existing traditional banking system of the Kyrgyz Republic. The Deputy Chairman of the National Bank, Mels Attokurov, emphasized security as one of the main features of the digital som‚Äôs design. The deputy chairman also referred to the digital currency as a step forward for the Kyrgyz Republic‚Äôs financial stability and modernization. The Kyrgyz Republic‚Äôs government also views the digital som as a step towards financial inclusion, especially in remote areas. The results of the pilot will inform the decision on a full rollout of the CBDC. Authorities are expected to make the final decision by the end of 2026, depending on the outcomes of the trial.

Runes are fungible tokens on the bitcoin blockchain, and Ordinals are like NFTs, but on bitcoin. Swapping tokens on Magic Eden will also help traders climb the leaderboard, according to a post from the firm. The post suggests the rewards for this season will consist of ME tokens again, like in Season 1. This time, Magic Eden has said rewards are based on staking power and trading volume per user.

Staking ME and completing quests in Season 1 granted users rewards. Season 2‚Äôs top participants are expected to receive rewards at the end of the season in mid-August. ‚ÄúLong-term, we‚Äôre super bullish on NFTs,‚Äù Magic Eden CEO Jack Lu previously told Blockworks in an interview, adding that the company is profitable despite broader bearish sentiment in the crypto industry (Lu said Magic Eden made $70 million to $75 million in 2024). Magic Eden still sees more success with Solana than Ethereum. On Thursday, daily Ethereum NFT volume from Magic Eden was around just $14,800, or 0.56% of the total ETH NFT volume traded. The trading platforms of OpenSea, Blur, and CryptoPunks are in the lead by volume, according to data from one Dune dashboard that filters out wash trading. Magic Eden‚Äôs Solana roots make it a popular place to trade SOL-based NFTs, though. On March 31, it saw over $3 million in daily volume from Solana NFTs alone (it saw just $12,651 in ETH NFT volume that day). OpenSea is one of Magic Eden‚Äôs biggest competitors, because both marketplaces target new and seasoned traders and offer a range of NFT art, profile pictures and gaming assets. But Tensor is arguably Magic Eden‚Äôs biggest competitor when it comes to Solana NFT trading (though both will have to compete with OpenSea in that category soon, too). OpenSea has trailed Magic Eden when it comes to adding a native token. OpenSea announced SEA in February 2025, six months after Magic Eden unveiled ME in August 2024. OpenSea recently enabled Solana token trading, but still doesn‚Äôt support trading Solana-based NFTs yet. OpenSea supports a slew of other chains, though, whose native tokens are all smaller than Solana by market cap. Magic Eden has taken steps to adapt to the changing market. Earlier this month, the marketplace announced the acquisition of mobile trading app Slingshot. No integrations between Magic Eden and the app are in the works ‚Äî at least for now.

The surge appears mainly fueled by strong spot market activity, with little influence from derivatives. According to Bitfinex Alpha, this suggests genuine interest from real-money investors, rather than speculative bets, indicating confidence in the market‚Äôs direction. Textbook Mid-cycle Reset Bitcoin has now spent 88 days in a correction phase since hitting its all-time high of $109,590 on January 20th. The cryptocurrency has dropped just over 25% during this period. Bitfinex‚Äôs latest report revealed that, historically, the depth and duration fit well within typical bull market retracements, and make the current move more of a healthy pause than a major trend shift. Past Bitcoin cycles often featured 25-35% drops from local highs, followed by 3-4 months of consolidation before fresh rallies emerged. By those standards, this correction matches prior market behavior both in magnitude and timing. While the decline is sharp, it remains consistent with a mid-cycle pause rather than a breakdown of the ongoing bullish trend. Broad-Based Buying Amidst Consolidation A notable trend over the last week has been the persistent rise in Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD), which reflects the net imbalance of aggressive buy versus sell orders. Across top spot exchanges, buyers were found to have been consistently lifting offers, which depicts a strong intent to absorb supply, even from large-scale sellers. Despite this clear buying pressure, Bitcoin‚Äôs price action continues to stay trapped in a tight $75,000 to $85,000 range, with high-timeframe charts reflecting sideways consolidation rather than any decisive directional shift. This ‚Äúdivergence‚Äù between strong buying activity and stagnant price action points to quiet but meaningful accumulation. Despite aggressive buy orders, prices remain capped, which suggests that supply is not being met with significant resistance from sellers. This rising Spot CVD, observed across a wide array of exchanges, signals that accumulation is taking place on a broad scale, not isolated to a single platform or region. This type of steady accumulation, which is occurring beneath the surface, can create conditions for a powerful breakout. If the order book starts to thin and passive sell pressure declines, the market may see a sharp upward reaction. However, a macroeconomic catalyst may be necessary to trigger this shift. Similar setups in the past, which are marked by rising CVD and price consolidation, have been followed by sharp upward moves once resistance breaks. So while the surface appears quiet, there‚Äôs growing potential energy building beneath the market structure.

The exchange announced the launch of forex perpetual futures (FX perps) with initial support for EUR/USD and GBP/USD trading pairs. Forex perpetual futures are a form of derivative contract enabling traders to speculate on the price changes of foreign exchange (forex) currencies, offering the advantage of no expiration date. The move marks the crypto exchange‚Äôs expansion into traditional financial markets, offering clients leveraged access‚Äîup to 20x‚Äîto two of the world‚Äôs most traded currency pairs. The FX perps are perpetual contracts benchmarked against DxFeed‚Äôs Composite Forex Index, enabling real-time trading without expiries. Traders can place orders 24/7 via Kraken Pro, though index prices only update during traditional forex market hours. Kraken recently announced commission-free trading for stocks and exchange-traded funds, expanding its product suite beyond crypto.

In 2024, Kraken clients traded $5.4 billion in FX spot markets, with EUR/USD and GBP/USD making up $3.5 billion of that volume. FX perps allow for tighter strategy execution and continuous market access, while also incorporating safeguards like zero funding during stale pricing and price collars to prevent trades outside a 4% range.

This classic chart formation, characterized by converging trendlines of lower highs and higher lows, often acts as a pressure booster for price action ‚Äî the longer the squeeze, the more powerful the breakout tends to be. The symmetrical triangle squeeze is a technical signal that often precedes sharp breakouts, and in BONK‚Äôs case, it couldn‚Äôt come at a more pivotal moment. With the broader meme coin market showing signs of strength and sentiment slowly shifting, a decisive move from this setup could define the next chapter for BONK. A breakout above the upper trendline might ignite fresh bullish momentum and open the door to new highs, while a break below support could trigger a sell-off toward lower key levels. Bonk‚Äôs Recent Price Action: The Setup For A Big Move According to a recent post by Whales_Crypto_Trading on X (formerly Twitter), Bonk is currently forming a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 1-hour chart. The price has just rebounded from the lower support trendline of the triangle, suggesting that buyers are stepping in to defend the structure and potentially build momentum for an upward breakout. Related Reading: BONK Flashes Buy Signal After Crashing 40% In One Week ‚Äì Time To Get In? What makes this pattern particularly noteworthy is the potential upside. Whales_Crypto_Trading highlighted a profit target range of 70‚Äì80%, should BONK successfully break above the upper resistance trendline. With volatility tightening and volume starting to show signs of recovery, such a breakout could offer a substantial short-term trading opportunity. However, traders are advised to keep a close eye on volume confirmation and key breakout levels to avoid possible fakeouts, as symmetrical triangles can break in either direction. Will The Meme Coin Explode Or Fizzle Out? Bonk‚Äôs symmetrical triangle pattern has reached a critical stage, raising speculations about whether the meme coin will break free with force or lose steam under pressure. The recent bounce off the support trendline suggests bullish interest is still alive, and if momentum continues to build, BONK could be gearing up for a powerful breakout, potentially delivering gains in the 70‚Äì80% range as projected by traders. Related Reading: Solana‚Äôs BONK Roundtrips Total Gains From 2024, Here‚Äôs Why It‚Äôs A Good Buy Now However, it‚Äôs important to remain cautious. Symmetrical triangles are neutral by nature, meaning a breakdown is still on the table if buyers fail to push through resistance. The next few candles on the 1-hour chart could provide key confirmation of BONK‚Äôs direction. In the end, BONK is approaching a defining moment. Whether it explodes into a bullish run or fizzles out into another rejection will largely depend on volume, sentiment, and the strength of the breakout. Traders should stay alert, as a big move may be closer than it seems.

While major crypto industry representatives including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, MicroStrategy‚Äôs Michael Saylor, and Ripple‚Äôs Brad Garlinghouse have gathered for talks with President Donald Trump and key advisors, Hoskinson was notable for not attending, despite recent talks regarding ADA‚Äôs inclusion in a proposed U.S. crypto strategic reserve. Speaking at Paris Blockchain Week, Hoskinson, a 37-year-old tech expert, downplayed the situation. ‚ÄúA lot of people want to approach David Sacks and Bo Hines and build relationships there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice from a visual standpoint, but it doesn‚Äôt translate into sustainable, lasting policy.‚Äù When asked if he would like to meet face-to-face with President Trump, Hoskinson was blunt: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to make a deal with Trump.‚Äù Despite being among the top 10 cryptocurrencies with a market cap approaching $22 billion, Cardano has been the focus of criticism. Its pace of development, particularly its late implementation of smart contracts and its use of the complex Haskell programming language, have led to skepticism among developers. Unlike Ethereum‚Äôs thriving ecosystem of over 1,000 DeFi apps that manage over $46 billion in value, Cardano currently hosts just 39 apps with a total value of under $300 million. Even longtime partners like World Mobile have started to branch out to other networks. Hoskinson‚Äôs rivalry with Ethereum runs deep. After leaving the project in 2014 due to disagreements about its structure, he has repeatedly criticized its development approach, particularly its reliance on layer 2 scaling solutions. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt realize that Layer 2s are like mosquitoes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey suck up your liquidity, your user base, your token value, and they don‚Äôt give much return.‚Äù Related News: BREAKING: Mantra (OM) Founder Makes Statement on Token Burning and Buyback Amid Manipulation Allegations Despite Trump‚Äôs recent actions, such as the creation of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve and the appointment of pro-crypto SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, Hoskinson continues to focus on long-term stability in the regulatory environment: ‚ÄúThere's going to be someone after Trump, whether it's J.D. Vance, whether it's a Democrat, whether it's someone else. We need a consistent, stable set of rules.‚Äù Hoskinson is keeping a close eye on two major pieces of legislation: the Genius Act, which would regulate stablecoins, and a broader market structure bill that could clarify crypto oversight and support the tokenization of real-world assets. ‚ÄúBy 2030, there will be approximately $10 trillion in real-world assets coming into play,‚Äù the ADA founder predicted. Hoskinson is also serious about the risks of Trump‚Äôs unorthodox leadership style, including his aggressive trade policies. The crypto market has lost about a quarter of its value since Trump took office in January. ‚ÄúTrump is running the U.S. government like a startup,‚Äù Hoskinson said. ‚ÄúWhen you run it like a startup, it works 60 percent of the time. The rest of it fails.‚Äù But this instability, he said, underscores the need for decentralized alternatives. *This is not investment advice.

Exciting news is brewing in the Tokamak Network ecosystem! If you‚Äôve been keeping an eye on innovative ways to enhance blockchain scalability and decentralization, you‚Äôll want to pay close attention. Tokamak Network, a prominent Ethereum Layer-2 project, has just announced a significant upgrade to its staking mechanism. Get ready for TON Staking V2 , a system designed to inject fresh energy into the network and reward its key players. Let‚Äôs explore what this upgrade means for the future of Tokamak Network and the broader Ethereum landscape. What is Ethereum Layer 2 Staking and Why Does it Matter? Before we delve into the specifics of TON Staking V2, let‚Äôs quickly recap why Ethereum Layer 2 Staking is such a crucial concept in the blockchain world. Ethereum, while being the leading platform for decentralized applications, has faced scalability challenges. Layer-2 solutions are designed to alleviate these bottlenecks by processing transactions off the main Ethereum chain (Layer-1) and then securely anchoring them back. This approach drastically improves transaction speed and reduces costs, making decentralized applications more accessible and efficient. Staking, in this context, plays a vital role in securing and operating these Layer-2 networks. By staking tokens, participants can contribute to the network‚Äôs security and functionality, often by becoming validators or operators. In return, they are typically rewarded with staking rewards, incentivizing their participation and commitment to the network‚Äôs health. Tokamak Network‚Äôs introduction of TON Staking V2 is a testament to the ongoing innovation in this space, aiming to refine and enhance these reward mechanisms. Tokamak Network TON Staking V2: A New Era of Incentives Tokamak Network‚Äôs announcement of Tokamak Network TON Staking V2 marks a significant step forward in its development. This isn‚Äôt just a minor tweak; it‚Äôs a fundamental upgrade to their existing TON staking system, laser-focused on directly incentivizing the operators who power Tokamak‚Äôs Layer-2 solutions. Think of these operators as the engine room of the Layer-2 networks ‚Äì they are the sequencers, the ones who order transactions and ensure the smooth operation of the network. And TON Staking V2 is designed to fuel their efforts. The core innovation of V2 lies in how it distributes rewards. Instead of traditional staking rewards alone, TON Staking V2 introduces a mechanism to share the seigniorage with these crucial sequencers. But what exactly is seigniorage in the crypto context, and why is this a game-changer? Unpacking Seigniorage Incentives: Rewarding Network Growth In traditional finance, seigniorage refers to the profit made by a government by issuing currency. In the context of cryptocurrencies like Tokamak Network‚Äôs TON token, seigniorage incentives represent the proceeds generated from the issuance of new TON tokens. This issuance can occur through various mechanisms, often tied to network growth and demand. Tokamak Network‚Äôs decision to channel this seigniorage directly to the sequencers of its Layer-2 networks is a strategic move. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs significant: Direct Operator Rewards: It provides a direct and potentially substantial financial incentive for operators. As the Tokamak ecosystem grows and more TON tokens are issued, the rewards for sequencers increase proportionally. Boosted Layer-2 Operation: By making it more lucrative to operate as a sequencer, Tokamak Network aims to attract more participants to take on this role. This increased participation strengthens the network‚Äôs operational capacity and resilience. Ecosystem Development Acceleration: Well-incentivized operators are more likely to invest in better infrastructure and contribute actively to the ecosystem‚Äôs growth. This creates a positive feedback loop, accelerating the overall development of the Tokamak Network. Essentially, TON Staking V2 transforms the seigniorage from a passive revenue stream into an active driver for network expansion and operational excellence. It‚Äôs a clever way to align the incentives of network operators with the overall health and growth of the Tokamak ecosystem. Advancing Decentralized Network Operators: The Path to Robustness One of the foundational principles of blockchain technology is decentralization. Tokamak Network‚Äôs TON Staking V2 is explicitly designed to further this principle by empowering decentralized network operators . By distributing seigniorage to sequencers, Tokamak is not just offering financial rewards; it‚Äôs fostering a more decentralized and robust network infrastructure. Consider these benefits of this approach to decentralization: Reduced Centralization Risks: Traditional staking models can sometimes lead to centralization, where a few large entities control a significant portion of the staking power. By incentivizing a broader range of operators through seigniorage, Tokamak aims to distribute network control more evenly. Increased Network Resilience: A more decentralized network is inherently more resilient to attacks and failures. If the operation is spread across numerous independent sequencers, the network becomes less vulnerable to single points of failure. Community Empowerment: TON Staking V2 empowers a wider community to participate actively in the network‚Äôs operation and governance. This fosters a more engaged and invested community, which is vital for the long-term success of any decentralized project. In essence, Tokamak Network is leveraging seigniorage to not only reward operators but also to architect a more fundamentally decentralized and resilient Layer-2 ecosystem. This commitment to decentralization is a key differentiator in the increasingly competitive Layer-2 landscape. Benefits of TON Staking V2: A Quick Overview To summarize the key advantages of Tokamak Network‚Äôs TON Staking V2, let‚Äôs break it down into a clear, concise table: [table id=1 /] Benefit Description Direct Sequencer Incentives Operators of Tokamak Layer-2 solutions receive direct rewards from seigniorage, aligning their interests with network growth. Enhanced Layer-2 Operation Increased operator participation and investment leads to smoother, more efficient Layer-2 network performance. Accelerated Ecosystem Development Stronger operator incentives fuel faster growth and innovation within the Tokamak ecosystem. Advanced Decentralization Seigniorage distribution promotes a more distributed and resilient network operator base. Long-Term Network Sustainability By rewarding key contributors, TON Staking V2 ensures the long-term health and viability of the Tokamak Network. These benefits collectively paint a picture of a more robust, efficient, and decentralized Tokamak Network, poised for continued growth and innovation in the Ethereum Layer-2 space. Looking Ahead: The Future of Tokamak Network and TON Staking The introduction of TON Staking V2 is a clear signal of Tokamak Network‚Äôs commitment to innovation and its dedication to building a thriving Ethereum Layer-2 ecosystem.

43498016,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150753,1745002812,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Arbitrum Timeboost: Unlocking Express Lane for Lightning-Fast DeFi Transactions,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/arbitrum-timeboost-transaction-ordering/,"Exciting news for DeFi enthusiasts and Arbitrum users! The popular Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, Arbitrum, just dropped a game-changer. Say hello to Timeboost , a brand new, auction-based transaction ordering policy designed to speed up your transactions. Imagine having an ‚Äòexpress lane‚Äô for your trades and transfers on Arbitrum One and Nova ‚Äì that‚Äôs essentially what Timeboost is bringing to the table. Let‚Äôs dive into what this innovative mechanism means for you and the Arbitrum ecosystem. What is Arbitrum Timeboost and How Does it Work? Arbitrum Timeboost is not your typical fee hike for faster processing. Instead, it‚Äôs a sophisticated, auction-based system that allows users to bid for priority in transaction ordering . Think of it as an auction where you can bid a small amount of ETH or ARB tokens to have your transaction included in the next block faster than usual. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how it works: Auction for Speed: Users can choose to participate in an auction when submitting a transaction. This auction is for faster inclusion in a block. Bidding with ETH or ARB: Bids are placed using either ETH or ARB, providing flexibility for users within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Private Mempool Maintained: Crucially, Timeboost operates while maintaining a private mempool. This is important for preventing front-running and ensuring fairness. Proceeds to DAO Treasury: All the proceeds generated from these bids are directed straight to the Arbitrum DAO treasury. This means the community benefits directly from the demand for faster DeFi transactions . Optional Feature: Timeboost is entirely optional. If you don‚Äôt need your transaction to be processed urgently, you can simply use the network as usual without participating in the auction. Why is Transaction Ordering Policy Important for Ethereum Layer-2? Transaction ordering policy is a fundamental aspect of any blockchain network, especially for Ethereum layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum. It dictates the sequence in which transactions are processed and included in blocks. In a decentralized environment, ensuring fair and efficient transaction ordering is vital for network integrity and user experience. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs particularly crucial for layer-2 scaling: Scalability and Congestion: Layer-2 networks are built to handle a higher volume of transactions than the Ethereum mainnet. However, even layer-2s can experience congestion during peak demand. A well-designed transaction ordering policy helps manage this congestion effectively. Fairness and Transparency: Users expect transactions to be processed fairly. A transparent and predictable transaction ordering policy builds trust and ensures that no single entity can unfairly prioritize or censor transactions. Mitigating MEV (Miner Extractable Value): While ‚Äòminer‚Äô extractable value is more accurately ‚Äòmaximal‚Äô extractable value in Proof-of-Stake systems and layer-2s, the principle remains the same. MEV refers to the profit that can be extracted by reordering transactions within a block. A robust transaction ordering policy can help mitigate negative forms of MEV exploitation. Enhancing User Experience: For time-sensitive applications like arbitrage or liquidations in DeFi transactions , faster confirmation times are critical. Timeboost directly addresses this by providing an option for users to prioritize their transactions when speed is paramount. Benefits of Arbitrum Timeboost: What‚Äôs in it for You? The introduction of Arbitrum Timeboost brings several potential advantages to users and the Arbitrum network as a whole. Let‚Äôs explore the key benefits: Faster Transactions When You Need Them: The most obvious benefit is speed. For urgent DeFi transactions , time-sensitive trades, or simply when you want your transaction to go through quickly, Timeboost provides a solution. Optionality and Control: You are in control. Timeboost is an optional feature, meaning you only pay for faster processing when you actually need it. For regular transactions, you can continue using Arbitrum with its standard, already fast, processing times. Revenue for the DAO: The proceeds from Timeboost auctions go directly to the Arbitrum DAO treasury. This creates a positive feedback loop, as these funds can be used to further develop and improve the Arbitrum ecosystem, potentially leading to even better user experiences and more robust infrastructure. Competitive Advantage for Arbitrum: By offering a premium, speed-prioritized transaction ordering policy , Arbitrum further differentiates itself from other Ethereum layer-2 solutions. This innovation could attract more users and projects to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Potential for Reduced Congestion: While seemingly counterintuitive, providing an express lane can sometimes help manage overall network congestion. By allowing users who are willing to pay for priority to move ahead, it can potentially free up space in the regular transaction flow for others. Potential Challenges and Considerations While Timeboost is a promising innovation, it‚Äôs important to consider potential challenges and aspects that will need to be monitored as it‚Äôs implemented: Cost for Users: While optional, using Timeboost will incur an additional cost. Users will need to weigh the benefit of faster transaction speed against the extra ETH or ARB spent on bidding. It‚Äôs crucial that the auction mechanism remains fair and doesn‚Äôt become prohibitively expensive for regular users. Potential for Centralization Concerns: It‚Äôs important to ensure that Timeboost doesn‚Äôt inadvertently lead to centralization in transaction ordering . The auction mechanism needs to be designed to prevent a small group of entities from consistently dominating the express lane. Complexity for New Users: Introducing an auction-based system adds a layer of complexity for new users. Clear and user-friendly interfaces will be essential to make Timeboost accessible to everyone, not just experienced DeFi transactions users. Monitoring and Optimization: The effectiveness of Timeboost will need to be continuously monitored. Arbitrum developers will need to analyze auction dynamics, transaction speeds, and overall network performance to optimize the parameters of the system and ensure it‚Äôs achieving its intended goals without unintended side effects. Actionable Insights: How to Utilize Timeboost Ready to try out Arbitrum Timeboost ? Here‚Äôs how you can potentially leverage this new feature: Identify Time-Sensitive Transactions: Think about when speed truly matters for your DeFi transactions . Arbitrage opportunities, time-sensitive token sales, or urgent liquidations are prime examples where Timeboost could be beneficial. Compare Costs: Before using Timeboost, compare the potential cost of bidding with the urgency of your transaction. Is the extra cost justified by the need for speed? Sometimes, waiting a few extra seconds might be perfectly acceptable. Use Wallets and Interfaces that Support Timeboost: Ensure your preferred wallet or DeFi transactions platform supports Timeboost. As it‚Äôs a new feature, adoption across different interfaces will likely grow over time. Experiment and Learn: Start with small bids and observe how Timeboost works in practice. Experiment to understand the auction dynamics and how much you typically need to bid to secure faster inclusion during different network conditions. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on Arbitrum community updates and discussions around Timeboost. Understanding how the community is using and reacting to the feature will help you optimize your own usage. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Enhanced User Experience Arbitrum‚Äôs introduction of Timeboost is undoubtedly a bold and innovative step in the realm of Ethereum layer-2 scaling solutions. By introducing an auction-based transaction ordering policy , Arbitrum is providing users with greater control and flexibility over their transaction speeds. While there are considerations and potential challenges to monitor, the potential benefits for users seeking faster DeFi transactions and for the overall Arbitrum ecosystem are significant. Timeboost has the potential to further solidify Arbitrum‚Äôs position as a leading layer-2 network and enhance the user experience for the growing DeFi community. It will be exciting to see how Timeboost evolves and impacts the Arbitrum landscape in the coming months.

According to a new technical analysis shared by RLinda on the TradingView platform, the $136 level is currently a decisive resistance point, and Solana‚Äôs current trading behavior suggests that a move above this level could ignite a fresh bullish push even as the global market situation is bearish. Solana Finds Stability After False Breakdown The current structure of Solana‚Äôs price chart reflects a notable recovery after what the analyst described as a false breakdown below the range support zone. This false breakdown refers to the price crash between the last week of March and the first week of April, during which the Solana price briefly broke below $100. Notably, this break below $100 came as an extension of a decline run after a break below a key support range between $115 and $108. Related Reading: Solana Price To Drop To Double Digits? Major Levels To Watch For Entries After briefly dipping below key support, Solana quickly rebounded, and the market responded with renewed buying pressure that sent its price back above $130. However, this push is starting to slow down, with resistance at $136 and a consolidation phase between $130 and $136. This consolidation range is proving to be an important zone for Solana‚Äôs bullish potential going forward, according to RLinda. This behavior is further reinforced by liquidity dynamics. The analyst highlights a liquidity imbalance created by the recent false breakdown, which could favor upward price movement as Solana bulls seek to reclaim the upper zones above $136. A sustained move above $136 could serve as the initial trigger for a breakout, potentially shifting short-term market sentiment in Solana‚Äôs favor. If this scenario unfolds, the move would provide technical confirmation of growing strength among buyers. This bullish potential is notable, even as RLinda noted that the global market situation is bearish. Breakout Above $136 Could Unlock Higher Price Targets For Solana Speaking of the bearish global market situation, RLinda‚Äôs analysis categorizes the local Solana setup as neutral, indicating that the price is in a range rather than exhibiting a definitive trend. Crypto market dynamics also lend weight to the bullish outlook for Solana. Bitcoin, the dominant force in the crypto market, is itself undergoing consolidation and has been highly correlated with Solana‚Äôs movements in recent weeks. Should Solana manage to close and consolidate above $136, the chart opens up to a sequence of local targets, with the $140, $147, and $152 levels becoming the following areas of interest. Related Reading: Ethereum, Solana And Cardano Trend After Crypto Crash ‚Äì Here‚Äôs What You Should Know At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $ 134.80, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours and 15.6% in the past seven days. Even if the outlook is bullish, minor corrections may still occur as this process unfolds. In such a scenario, the Fibonacci 0.5 retracement, located around $125.28, will provide a cushion for price corrections. As such, any short-term dip from the current price level may be met with strong support and accumulation at the Fib retracement. Other support levels are at $129, $123, and $111.

Usually, a low volatility period is followed by a range expansion, but it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout with certainty. Cryptocurrency analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin‚Äôs prospects because gold‚Äôs rally in 2017 and 2020 was followed by a sharp rise in Bitcoin's price. Theya head of growth Joe Consorti said in a post on X that Bitcoin follows gold with a lag of roughly 100 to 150 days. If Bitcoin moves as per Consorti‚Äôs expectations, a new all-time high could be hit between Q3 and Q4 of 2025. On similar lines, trading and analytics account Cryptollica projected a medium-term target of $155,000 for Bitcoin . Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360 Along with Bitcoin, analysts are also bullish on altcoins. Swiss bank Sygnum said in its Q2 2025 investment outlook that improved regulations for crypto use cases have prepared the ground for a strong altcoins rally in the second quarter , as ‚Äúnone of the positive developments have been priced in.‚Äù Could Bitcoin and the altcoins break above their respective overhead resistance levels and start a recovery? Let‚Äôs analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin has been trading between the 20-day exponential moving average ($83,463) and the 200-day simple moving average ($87,857), indicating a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the 20-day EMA cracks, the selling could pick up, and the BTC/USDT pair may slide to $78,500 and then to $73,777. Buyers are expected to defend the $73,777 level with all their might because a break below it may signal the start of a downtrend. On the contrary, a break and close above the 200-day SMA indicates that the corrective phase may be over. The pair could climb to $95,000 and eventually to the psychologically critical level of $100,000. Ether price analysis Ether ( ETH ) has been trading between the $1,368 support and the $1,754 resistance, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory suggest a slight edge to the sellers. If the price slips below $1,471, the ETH/USDT pair could descend to $1,368. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $1,368 support because a break below it may sink the pair to $1,150. On the upside, the bulls are likely to face stiff resistance in the zone between the 20-day EMA ($1,676) and $1,754. A break and close above the resistance zone could propel the pair to the breakdown level of $2,111. XRP price analysis The bears have failed to sink XRP ( XRP ) below the $2 support, suggesting a lack of selling pressure at lower levels. XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will try to start a recovery, which could reach the 50-day SMA ($2.23). This is an essential short-term level to keep an eye on because a break above it opens the doors for a rally to the resistance line. Buyers will have to push the price above the resistance line to signal a short-term trend change. Alternatively, a break below the $2 support tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. The XRP/USDT pair could then plunge to the $1.72 to $1.61 support zone. BNB price analysis BNB ( BNB ) has been trading just below the downtrend line, indicating that the bulls have held on to their positions as they anticipate a breakout. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If buyers propel the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally to $644. Sellers will try to defend the $644 resistance, but the bulls are expected to buy the dips to the 20-day EMA ($588). If that happens, the likelihood of a rally to $680 increases. This optimistic view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down from the downtrend line and breaks below $566. That could keep the pair stuck inside the triangle for some more time. Solana price analysis Solana ( SOL ) rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($126) on April 16 and rose above the 50-day SMA ($130), indicating buying on dips. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The SOL/USDT pair could rise to the overhead resistance at $153, where the bears are expected to mount a stiff resistance. If buyers pierce the $153 level, the pair could surge toward $180. Buyers are expected to guard the zone between the 20-day EMA and $120. If the zone gives way, it suggests that the bears are active at higher levels. The pair could then descend to the $110 support. Dogecoin price analysis Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has been trading between the 20-day EMA ($0.16) and the crucial support at $0.14 for the past few days. DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The flattening 20-day EMA and the positive divergence on the RSI suggest reduced selling pressure. Buyers will have to drive the price above the 50-day SMA ($0.17) to gain the upper hand. The DOGE/USDT pair could climb to $0.20, an essential level to watch out for as a break above it completes a double bottom pattern. Contrarily, a break and close below the $0.14 support signals the start of the next leg of the downtrend. The pair could then plummet to $0.10. Cardano price analysis Buyers have kept Cardano ( ADA ) above the $0.59 support but are struggling to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.63). ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price turns down and breaks below $0.59, the ADA/USDT pair could slide toward the solid support at $0.50. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it signals the resumption of the downtrend. The next support on the downside is at $0.40. Buyers will be back in the driver‚Äôs seat on a break and close above the 50-day SMA ($0.70). The pair could then rally to $0.83.

LEO/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 20-day EMA ($9.34) has started to turn down gradually, and the RSI is in the negative zone, signaling a slight edge to the bears. If the price tumbles below the immediate support at $8.95, the LEO/USD pair could retest the vital level at $8.79. A break below $8.79 could sink the pair to $8.30. This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price rises above the 50-day SMA ($9.56). The pair could then retest the stiff overhead resistance at $9.90. Chainlink price analysis Chainlink ( LINK ) has been trading below the 20-day EMA ($12.77), but the bears have failed to pull the price below $11.68, signaling a lack of sellers at lower levels. LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will try to push the price above the moving averages. If they manage to do that, the LINK/USDT pair could rally to $16. Sellers will try to halt the rally at $16, but the pair could reach the resistance line if the bulls prevail. If sellers want to retain the advantage, they will have to sink the price below the $11.68 support. The pair could then decline to the support line of the descending channel, which is likely to attract buyers. Avalanche price analysis Avalanche ( AVAX ) has been trading near the moving averages, indicating a balance between supply and demand. AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The flattish 20-day EMA ($18.97) and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. A break above the downtrend line could open the doors for a rally to the overhead resistance at $23.50. Buyers will have to overcome this barrier to start a new up move. On the downside, a break and close below $17.50 may sink the AVAX/USDT pair to $15.27. This is an essential level for the bulls to defend, as a break below $15.27 may signal the resumption of the downtrend. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

With volume starting to step in and price structure forming a potential higher low on the daily, all eyes are on whether bulls can defend this area and push the chart into the next leg higher. Curve DAO Token ( CRV ) is beginning to show signs of a potential structural shift on the daily timeframe. After a sustained downtrend, recent price action has started consolidating above a zone packed with technical confluences. These zones typically attract strong buyer interest and, when defended successfully, often mark major pivot points. This analysis explores the key levels and signals traders should monitor to confirm the formation of a higher low and the likelihood of a continuation. Key technical points Confluence Zone Support: Price is holding above the value area low, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, and a local swing low, suggesting buyers are actively defending this level. Higher Low Setup: A grinding move into the key swing low, followed by a reclaim and sustained hold above it, would confirm strength and trend continuation. Volume and VWAP Alignment: Sustained buy volume, with VWAP aligned to this zone, would add conviction to a potential bullish breakout. Source: TradingView CRV‚Äôs current chart structure is building out a classic higher low formation, often seen at the early stages of a bullish trend reversal. What makes this setup particularly compelling is the heavy confluence of key technical levels stacked within one zone. The value area low, derived from volume profile analysis, aligns closely with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement from the recent leg up. This overlap is further reinforced by a local swing low, giving bulls a solid foundation for defense. Zooming out slightly, this confluence zone sits just above a weekly support/resistance flip, suggesting the market has memory at this level. The ongoing consolidation just above this zone shows that buyers are stepping in, but haven‚Äôt made the decisive push just yet. This kind of slow, grinding action often precedes explosive moves, especially if the swing low is taken briefly (a liquidity grab) and then quickly reclaimed. You might also like: Ethereum price bullish pattern points to a 35% surge A key confirmation trigger would be seeing the value area high within the same zone act as support. This would indicate that market participants are not only defending the base, but also comfortable reloading on dips. For this to play out effectively, volume should begin rising steadily as price reclaims and holds above this range. The VWAP, also aligned near the Fib level, adds further weight to the bullish case. What to expect next If buyers continue to defend the current region and push above the value area high with rising volume, CRV could target significantly higher levels in the short term. The structure suggests accumulation, and any reclaim of the local highs may spark a trending move. For now, the focus remains on the higher low being locked in, and if it holds, a breakout could be just around the corner.

It seems that new ones have been added to them. LUCE (LUCE), listed on major centralized cryptocurrency exchanges such as Bybit, MEXC, and Kucoin, lost more than 70% of its value in seconds. In addition, many memecoins on Bybit, including MANEKI, JELLYJELLY, and AIDOGE, are experiencing sudden drops. A major memecoin whale is suspected to have liquidated. It is currently unknown if there is a specific reason for the declines. We will update the information as soon as clear information emerges.

ETH/USD has been following a similar fractal pattern in the ongoing macro bull run to the 2020/2021 cycle. Ethereum (ETH) price has stabilized around $1,583 in the past three days. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $192 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $8.52 billion, has hinted at a potential bullish rebound after slowing down capitulation in the past seven days. Moreover, the gold price retrace in the past 24 hours has accelerated cash rotation to the highly oversold crypto market, which has established itself as a reliable alternative investment to the highly volatile stock market that is engulfed by short-term uncertainties. Ethereum Whales on a Shopping Spree On-chain data shows a sharp uptick of whale activities seeking to accumulate Ether from centralized exchanges in the last few days. For instance, a whale wallet linked to Metalpha has withdrawn 29k Ether, worth nearly $49 million, from the Binance exchange since April 1. Another whale investor has withdrawn 46,577 Ether, worth about $97.26 million, from Gate.io Since February 15. Another whale investor has withdrawn 10,091 ETH, worth about $18.8 million, from Bybit since March 12. However, the overall demand for Ether by institutional investors, led by U.S. spot ETH ETFs, has remained low. Already, Galaxy Digital has deposited 62,181 ETH, worth about $100 million, to different exchanges in the past six days. ETH Price Analysis In the weekly timeframe, Ether‚Äôs price, against the U.S. dollar, has been bleeding since mid-December 2024. Most importantly, Ether has been bleeding to Bitcoin since August 2022. With both ETH/USD and ETH/BTC heavily oversold, a rebound may happen in the near future catalyzed by robust fundamentals. In the daily timeframe, ETH/USD has been forming a potential reversal pattern, characterized by a symmetrical triangle. As a result, a consistent close above the established falling logarithmic trend will trigger a rally toward $2.1k ahead. However, a strong correction below $1,500 in the coming days will result in further capitulation potentially towards $1,290.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-18 19:04:26

Stablecoin rules shouldn‚Äôt play favorites. I‚Äôve just sent a letter to Congress backing @CSBSNews ‚Äôs push to keep state-regulated issuers in the game. The GENIUS & STABLE Acts should support fair competition, consumer protection, and innovation. My full letter:‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/NxSnwj5NYt ‚Äî Ivan Soto-Wright (@ivanhodl) April 18, 2025 Addressed to the leadership of the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, the letter advocates for parity in the treatment of state-chartered and federally-chartered entities under the proposed STABLE and GENIUS Acts. Soto-Wright voiced his strong support for proposed amendments from the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), which seek to ensure that state-regulated payment stablecoin issuers (PSIs) are not put at a disadvantage compared to their federally regulated counterparts. According to him, fostering fair competition between state and federal entities will benefit consumers, promote innovation, and uphold long-standing regulatory frameworks that have successfully governed the money transmission industry for decades. He emphasized that state regulators have long been at the forefront of crypto oversight, providing clarity and consumer protections in the absence of federal regulation. As Congress moves closer to finalizing a national stablecoin framework, Soto-Wright urged lawmakers to preserve those viable state pathways that meet the regulatory benchmarks established in the GENIUS and STABLE Acts. An excerpt from his letter reads: ‚ÄúWhile the cryptocurrency industry has called for federal legislation for years, it has been these state regulators who have provided and continue to provide regulatory clarity and supervision to ensure consumer protection and enable growth in the sector. As federal legislation now approaches the finish line, it is essential to preserve viable state pathways for PSIs that place the state regulators who meet the standards set out in GENIUS and STABLE on equal footing with federal regulators.‚Äù Centralizing Stablecoin Regs Could Stifle Competition Soto-Wright‚Äôs message echoes a broader concern within the crypto and fintech industries‚Äîthat centralizing stablecoin regulation at the federal level could stifle competition and innovation. He argues that the dual state-federal regulatory structure that governs money transmitters has proven effective and should serve as a model for stablecoin oversight. As Congress weighs the final language of the legislation, the stance of MoonPay adds prominent industry voice to the push for inclusive and balanced regulation‚Äîone that protects consumers while fostering a thriving, competitive digital asset economy.

But its journey hasn‚Äôt been without bumps. Network outages, inflation-related governance debates, and now investor frustration with a sharp decline from its all-time high have raised questions about the long-term sustainability of its economic model. One of the most recent Solana ( SOL ) flashpoints occurred earlier this year with the SIMD-228 vote proving to be the largest crypto governance vote ever in terms of market value and participation. The vote failed to meet the approval threshold in early March. Now, Galaxy Digital is proposing an alternative : a new voting mechanism called Multiple Election Stake-Weight Aggregation (MESA). Instead of voting on a single inflation rate, validators could select from a spectrum of options, including 15%, 17.5%, 20%, with the network adopting the weighted average of all votes cast. ‚ÄúSometimes, the questions facing communities involve ranges of acceptable outcomes, not simply binary choices,‚Äù Alex Thorn, Head of Firmwide Research at Galaxy Digital told crypto.news in a statement. ‚ÄúWhere possible, the MESA approach may bring more efficiency, transparency, and democracy to proof-of-stake protocol governance.‚Äù To better understand what MESA means for Solana‚Äôs tokenomics, governance structure, and network sustainability, Galaxy research analyst Zack Pokorny shared his perspectives in the following Q&A. crypto.news: What is the primary difference between this proposal and SIMD-228? To help me understand better, could you elaborate on the key differences in terms of how inflation rates and emission curves are structured in both proposals? Specifically, how do the mechanisms for adjusting these rates differ between the two, and what impact might those differences have on Solana‚Äôs long-term governance and network security? Additionally, what role does community input play in each, and how might that affect the predictability of the network‚Äôs economic model? Zack Pokorny: In the aftermath of SIMD-228, it was clear that the community broadly agreed on the proposal‚Äôs intention of reducing SOL inflation, but disagreed on the parameters of the change ‚Äì for example, the amount of inflation at each stake rate ‚Äì as these factors impact everyone on the network differently. As a result, there could theoretically be an infinite number of desirable parameter combinations. The current governance framework of YES / NO / ABSTAIN is not conducive to the network reaching agreement on a change in this setting ‚Äì at least efficiently ‚Äì as it only lets voters completely agree with the change, disagree with the change (which can stem from even a micro detail of the proposal), or take no stance. Instead, MESA offers a way for all voters to disagree on the precise details of a proposal, while agreeing on its broad intention as everyone‚Äôs opinion is baked into the outcome.

Specifically, could you explain how the voting mechanism allows for flexibility, yet ensures stability and consistency in decision-making? In addition, how does the proposal balance the influence of validators with varying levels of stake, and what safeguards are in place to prevent governance fragmentation or instability? Lastly, how might this flexible system adapt to changes in the network over time, and what impact could it have on long-term sustainability and security? ZP: In plain terms, MESA is an alternative approach to reaching outcomes in governance. How it changes SOL: not all governance decisions are black and white ‚Äì MESA allows for a spectrum of opinions to be expressed, all contributing to consensus around a shared goal. CN: How will the implementation of this proposal affect the overall inflation rate of SOL over time? Specifically, how might the range of deflation rate options influence both short-term and long-term inflation, and how could this evolve based on community votes? Do you think this flexibility will impact validator incentives, network security, and staking behaviors? Could fluctuating inflation rates create any risks for delegators or validators? ZP : This is a long-term change: no one will be affected until the protocol is actually modified ‚Äì if it‚Äôs changed at all ‚Äì and even then, implementation may take additional time. CN: What is the significance of using a spectrum of deflation rates (e.g., YES-15%, YES-17.5%, YES-20%) in the voting system? Specifically, how does this approach allow validators to express their preferences more flexibly compared to a single, fixed inflation rate? How does offering multiple options for deflation rates help balance the needs for network security, inflation control, and validator incentives? Could it help mitigate potential risks or conflicts that might arise if only one rate was proposed? ZP: This is entirely up to the community, and there is no predetermined path or timeline for any governance proposal.

According to an update , the change in approach follows ecosystem feedback that showed the initial liquidity program for memecoins, decentralized finance, artificial intelligence and gaming tokens among other projects on BNB Chain was not as effective as expected. BNB Chain initially announced the $100 million program aimed at incentivizing centralized exchanges to list native BNB Chain tokens in March 2024. The goal was to strengthen on-chain liquidity and to solidify market foundations, with projects earning rewards for listing on CEXs in a tiered approach. Top exchanges included Binance , Coinbase, Upbit, while tier two and three consisted of Kraken, Bybit, OKX and Bitget, MEXC, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com respectively. Rewards ranged from $10k to up to $500k.

The report warns that this unprecedented level of issuance could place significant stress on financial markets, including the crypto sector. In its analysis titled ‚ÄúRecord US Treasury Supply in 2025 ‚Äì What It Means for Macro and Crypto,‚Äù Binance Research notes the scale of the expected issuance, noting that the massive supply, largely driven by refinancing needs, will require close attention from both investors and policymakers. ‚ÄúEven if market demand for Treasuries remains stable, the sheer volume of issuance poses a structural challenge,‚Äù the report said. ‚ÄúThe recent easing in risk assets, likely due to optimism about trade talks, does little to offset the persistent pressure this issuance volume is putting on interest rate markets.‚Äù Related News: This Altcoinde Developer Team Quietly Keeps Selling Tokens - They Dumped the Price Foreign demand also remains a critical variable. With about a third of U.S. debt held by foreign investors, any dip in appetite due to geopolitical tensions or strategic portfolio shifts could lead to higher yields and higher borrowing costs for the U.S. government. The implications for risky assets like cryptocurrencies are twofold, the report says. On the one hand, continued upward pressure on interest rates could negatively impact market sentiment and liquidity. On the other hand, if the government resorts to debt monetization (effectively printing money to cover budget deficits), hard assets like Bitcoin could benefit from increased appeal as an inflation hedge. ‚ÄúThis macro dynamic is one to watch closely,‚Äù Binance Research said, adding: ‚ÄúIf debt monetization becomes a reality, it could strengthen demand for alternative stores of value, particularly in the digital asset space.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

Simply holding Bitcoin for the long term can deliver huge returns with relatively low risk. Barry Silbert, CEO of Digital Currency Group, learned this firsthand ‚Äî he said he would have made much more money if he had just held onto the BTC he invested in during the early days of crypto projects, starting around 2012. How to invest in cryptocurrencies the right way On the April 17 airing of a podcast called Raoul Paul's Journey Man, Silbert revealed that he first learned about Bitcoin in 2011, buying coins at a rate of $7 to $8. When the price of BTC rose, he started looking for early cryptocurrency companies to invest in. ‚ÄùI was using Bitcoin to make a bunch of those investments, and you would think, if you invested in Coinbase you would have done really well. Had I just held the Bitcoin, I actually would have done better than making those investments.‚Äù he stated. There are quite a few so-called Bitcoin maximalists on the cusp of popularity in the cryptosphere today, including Strategy co-founder¬†Michael Saylor. He and other experts are predicting a Bitcoin price in the millions of dollars over the next decade. For example, in the summer of 2024, Sailor voiced a legendary prediction with¬†three scenarios¬†for Bitcoin for 2045. The entrepreneur believes that in the worst case BTC will be valued at 3 million dollars. The best case scenario would be an increase to 49 million dollars. The head of the Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) think tank, Zack Shapiro, said the day before that the price of Bitcoin could well reach $1 million per coin if the U.S. government purchases at least a million BTC. Here's a comment on that. If the U.S. announces the purchase of a million BTC, it would cause a real global seismic shock. A government purchase of bitcoins is one possible scenario - especially after incumbent President¬†Donald Trump¬†won the election last year. He is actively promoting the idea of creating a national crypto reserve in the United States and has already signed an executive order to that effect. However, at least initially, this reserve will include only bitcoins already confiscated by the government without additional purchases. Meanwhile, Bitcoin shows a relatively stable price movement, even despite macroeconomic instability. According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, this trend is explained by the stability of holders of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the continuation of aggressive purchases by Strategy. These ETFs and Saylor are buying up all the discarded coins on the market from victims of the FTX crash, GBTC holders, coin unlocks, confiscations and so on. He emphasized that spot Bitcoin ETFs have raised $131.04 million in the last 30 days, and $2.4 billion since Jan. 1. Balchunas called this an ‚Äùimpressive result.‚Äù Especially considering the novelty of this instrument, which appeared in the U.S. in January 2024. As a reminder, Michael Saylor's company made its latest round of BTC investments on April 14, purchasing 3,459 bitcoins worth $285.5 million at an average price of $82,618 per coin. Strategy owns 531,644 BTC at the time of publication. According to¬†sources, the BTC exchange rate has fluctuated between $75,000 and $88,000 over the past thirty days amid macroeconomic uncertainty. The latter is predominantly caused by tariffs from US President Donald Trump and uncertainty over the future interest rate in the US. Crypto scams Fraud, which is one of the main obstacles to the mass popularization of crypto, marked new trends this year. As it turned out, the number of so-called rag-poll schemes, when fraudsters sell project tokens and abscond with investors' money, decreased by 66 percent compared to 2024. However, the scale of each individual case has become much larger. According to the report by analytics platform DappRadar, there were 21 major such incidents in early 2024, while only seven such incidents have occurred so far in 2025. Nevertheless, since the beginning of 2025, investors have lost nearly $6 billion due to the aforementioned schemes. 92 percent of this amount is related to the OM token crash from the Mantra project. In comparison, during the same period in early 2024, the total losses from such schemes amounted to 90 million dollars. DappRadar analyst Sarah Sara Gherghelas commented on the results of the study. This change indicates that these schemes are happening less frequently, but are becoming much more destructive. Fraudulent projects are proving increasingly sophisticated, often run by teams with professional branding and a preconceived narrative. According to Sara Gherghelas, the nature of the rug pulls is evolving. In the first quarter of 2024, the majority of cases occurred in DeFi protocols, NFT projects and among mem-tokens. In the same period of 2025, it is memecoins that account for the largest number of such cases. One of the most notable examples is the¬†Libra¬†token (LIBRA) on the¬†Solana¬†network. It reached a market capitalization of $4.56 billion on Feb. 14 after Argentine President Javier Milay published a Twitter post about it. As a result, the token fell more than 94 percent, triggering serious losses for investors. Barry Silbert's example perfectly demonstrates that simply holding Bitcoin can be the most profitable strategy in the crypto world. Against the backdrop of an unstable economy and growing institutional interest, BTC continues to prove its viability - both as an asset and an idea.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-18 19:29:40

To read full editions, subscribe . At the TokenizeThis conference in New York this week, I had the pleasure of moderating a conversation with executives from Dinari and STOKR on the potential for tokenized stocks. I also caught a panel on the retail adoption of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) more broadly. The headwinds, tailwinds, what have you. First things first: Stablecoins (primarily tokenized dollars, so to speak) are a nearly $230 billion market. Outside of that, onchain RWAs currently amount to $18.5 billion, RWA.xyz data shows. A recent report from Bitwise called Q1 ‚Äúthe best worst quarter in crypto‚Äôs history.‚Äù While asset prices fell, stablecoin market cap hit a new high and tokenized RWAs grew 37% quarter over quarter. Not to mention regulatory progress . Source: Bitwise You can see that big chunk in private credit, and the other substantial piece in the US Treasury debt category. Included in that is BlackRock‚Äôs tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, which recently hit the $2 billion Assets Under Management (AUM) mark. Expected legislation in the US that ‚Äúallows on-ramps and off-ramps to proliferate‚Äù will be crucial, Neoclassic Capital managing partner Mike Bucella said on the TokenizeThis stage Wednesday. Stablecoins and tokenized Treasury products will thus be ‚Äúthe foundation‚Äù for more creative onchain offerings in the coming years. ‚ÄúThe boring stuff is an absolute necessity, because it exists in the offchain world,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt do that in the onchain world, then you‚Äôre not going to sit there and wait for some interesting onchain yield product; you‚Äôre going to go offchain into the traditional markets.‚Äù As for where we go from here, Dinari Chief Business Officer Anna Wroblewska argued that after stablecoins and money market funds, publicly listed US stocks offer another easy access point for investors looking to move onchain. Galaxy Digital tokenization head Thomas Cowan, however, noted the already-solid user experience to invest in stocks on venues like Robinhood. Therefore, he asserted, the next wave of growth could come in ‚Äúplaces where there‚Äôs a clear lack of transparency [and] settlement risk‚Äù ‚Äî i.e. private credit. Sitting beside Cowan, 21Shares US sales head Anton Kozlov added that he also sees demand for tokenized private equity ‚Äî pointing to SpaceX and OpenAI. Blockworks Research analyst Carlos Gonzalez Campo expects shares of such private companies to be tokenized within the next four years. Crypto custody firm Taurus, in a recent report, pegged the ‚Äúmarket opportunity‚Äù of fund tokenization at $1 trillion by 2030. While money market funds unlock use cases in collateral management, the report notes, Taurus is also bullish on tokenization within illiquid segments. ‚ÄúCurrently, if an investor needs to sell their stake in a private equity fund with a lock-up period of several years, their bank or asset manager must find a matching buyer through a manual process that can take weeks and relies primarily on emails and paper-based transactions,‚Äù the Taurus report states. So while it‚Äôs safe to expect stablecoins and tokenized yield funds to continue growing, it remains to be seen which of these other onchain segments will next see big traction. Meeting investors where they are, though, is a sentiment most agree on.‚Äú[Investors] want everything in a single window ‚Äî kind of like a Robinhood experience ‚Äî where you can access crypto, you can access stocks, down the road you can access tokenized private credit,‚Äù Kozlov said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the dream.‚Äù Get the news in your inbox.

Project Eleven Puts It to the Test,https://cryptopotato.com/can-quantum-computing-break-bitcoin-project-eleven-puts-it-to-the-test/,"Project Eleven, a quantum computing research organization, has announced the Q-Day Prize ‚Äì a global challenge offering 1 Bitcoin to the first team or individual who can use Shor‚Äôs algorithm on a quantum computer to break part of an elliptic curve cryptographic (ECC) key. The competition began on April 16, 2025, and will run until April 5, 2026. The main objective is to assess the real-world risk that quantum computing poses to Bitcoin‚Äôs cryptographic security. The challenge specifically targets the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Global Quantum Challenge According to Project Eleven‚Äôs tweet , more than 10 million Bitcoin addresses have exposed public keys, potentially putting an estimated 6.2 million BTC, worth approximately $500 billion, at risk if quantum computing capabilities continue to advance. The Q-Day Prize aims to move the discussion around quantum threats beyond theoretical speculation by encouraging a practical demonstration of vulnerability. Participants must run Shor‚Äôs algorithm solely on a quantum computer, without assistance from classical computing methods. Even breaking a few bits of a Bitcoin key would qualify as a valid proof-of-concept and could indicate that full key recovery is plausible with future technological improvements. Project Eleven stated that no real-world ECC key has ever been cracked to date. The initiative comes amid notable progress in the quantum computing sector. Google‚Äôs ‚ÄòWillow‚Äô chip, for example, recently performed a computation in five minutes that would take traditional supercomputers an estimated 10 septillion years. Other firms, including IBM, Amazon, and Microsoft, have also made advancements in quantum hardware, and access to quantum processors is increasingly available via cloud services. PsiQuantum, another major player in the field, raised $750 million in early 2025, citing developments in photonic chip design and improvements to quantum algorithms such as Shor‚Äôs. While industry experts do not consider the quantum threat to Bitcoin to be imminent, Project Eleven‚Äôs initiative seeks to quantify that risk through open experimentation. The Great Quantum Debate The quantum computing debate isn‚Äôt new. Earlier this year, CryptoQuant identified it as an emerging risk, especially in areas like mining and private key protection. The debate reignited after a November NIST report warned that certain algorithms vulnerable to quantum attacks will be phased out within five years. While some voices, such as ‚ÄòBitcoin Isaiah‚Äô on X, advocate for urgent preparation, others like Blockstream CEO Adam Back maintain that Bitcoin‚Äôs encryption should hold firm until around 2035.

BNB‚Äôs Open Interest Rises Despite Negative Funding Rate While many altcoins have dropped by as much as 98% from their all-time highs, Binance Coin (BNB) has shown strong buying demand, suffering much smaller losses alongside Bitcoin. This strength has made BNB a preferred altcoin for accumulation, even during the market decline. According to Coinglass data, BNB experienced a total liquidation of $97,300, with buyers accounting for $37,000 and sellers for about $60,000. Despite the volatile market conditions, open interest in BNB continues to climb. Coinglass reports that BNB‚Äôs open interest has risen by 3.3%, reaching over $760 million. This growth in open interest could support the recovery and limit sharp declines. However, investor concerns remain, as the funding rate recently peaked in the negative zone at -0.485%, signaling caution. The ongoing recovery has been further boosted by BNB‚Äôs latest quarterly token burn, completed on April 16. The network destroyed 1.57 million tokens, worth over $1 billion at current prices. These burns are typically calculated by the BNB price and the number of blocks produced over the quarter. Also read: Binance Coin Price Prediction 2025, 2026 ‚Äì 2030: Will BNB Hit $1000? Token burns are a key part of BNB‚Äôs strategy to increase its value. According to the project‚Äôs tokenomics, quarterly burns will continue until the total circulating supply is reduced from around 140 million tokens to 100 million. The long/short ratio currently indicates that BNB‚Äôs buying momentum is likely to continue. The ratio has surged to 2.1133, showing that a majority of traders, around 68% are betting on a price increase. This surging long positions could make it easier for BNB to break through the $600 resistance level. What‚Äôs Next for BNB Price? Binance Coin (BNB) continues to face resistance around the $610 level. Currently, it is trading near $595, showing a slight 0.66% gain over the past 24 hours. Sellers are working to keep the price below $600 in an effort to maintain a downtrend. However, despite the increasing bearish sentiment, BNB shows signs of a potential rebound as large holders are accumulating near the dips. This accumulation is supporting a gradual recovery, and BNB could soon break above the $600 mark. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also remains in bullish territory around 60, indicating that buyers are maintaining control of the momentum. If buying pressure continues to build, BNB may break through the $610 resistance, potentially paving the way for a move toward the next key target at $644. Conversely, if selling pressure holds and BNB falls below the 20-day EMA support, the price could drop to the critical $557 level.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-18 19:38:14

As price compresses and volume fades, all eyes are on this level for a potential macro reversal. Will buyers step in, or will this structure break down? Sui ( SUI ) is currently positioned at a decisive support zone on the higher timeframes. This area is backed by strong confluence, including the point of control from VWAP, daily support, and weekly support‚Äîall aligning to create a high-probability trade location. With volume tapering off and the structure showing signs of compression, this may be the calm before a significant move. Key technical points Multi-Level HTF Support: Confluence of VWAP POC, daily support, and weekly support strengthens the zone. Volume Decline Signals Breakout Setup: Decreasing volume suggests consolidation is nearing resolution. Double Bottom Potential: A successful retest here could confirm a reversal structure on the high timeframe. Source: TradingView The current support zone combines several high-timeframe levels, including the VWAP point of control and both daily and weekly support/resistance lines. Price has been respecting this region for some time, suggesting that market participants see it as a key decision point. This type of technical clustering is often a catalyst for major directional moves. Price action has been forming consecutive lower highs and lower lows, but the pace of decline is clearly slowing. This loss in momentum, coupled with declining volume, typically signals a period of consolidation that precedes expansion. The volume profile shows a tightening range, indicating that buyers and sellers are currently in equilibrium, for now. You might also like: Curve DAO Token eyes higher low as key confluence zone holds If this support holds and the next retest is defended, it could lead to the formation of a high-timeframe double bottom, a well-known reversal structure. However, confirmation will come only with a breakout above the local range high, ideally supported by a clear increase in volume. Without that, this remains a consolidation range, and the risk of breakdown still exists. What‚Äôs next for Sui price? As long as SUI consolidates above this support zone, the probability of a bullish breakout remains in play. Traders should watch for a sharp increase in volume, as this would signal the beginning of a new directional leg, potentially ending the current downtrend. Failure to hold this level, however, would invalidate the bullish thesis and could open the door to deeper downside targets.

Over the last three months, institutions have capitalized on price dips to establish good entry positions for the asset class. Notably, institutional demand is increasing at a fast pace following weeks of decline after prices hit lows not seen in months. Companies Holdings Surge 16% A new Bitwise report shows the Bitcoin held by publicly listed companies soared 16% in Q1 2025. In a recent post on X, it was revealed that the institutional grip on the market has grown over the last three months. The total asset holdings tapped 688,000 BTC at the end of the quarter, marking a whopping 3.2% of the total supply. Institutional investors holding this number spark positive sentiment across the market, especially from retail holders. The demand for these players is a major market mover, leading to price peaks. Last year, the influx of investors after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States drove the assets to new all-time highs. This boost led investors and issuers to launch multiple altcoin ETFs. The total value of these companies‚Äô Bitcoin holdings topped $57 billion, representing a 2% increase over the last three months. Meanwhile, the number of companies reached 79, a 17% change, with 12 new companies holding the asset. New companies joining the pack show a bullish drive from large holdings after watching other firms accumulate the asset. Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy has remained vital to the influx of new holders. According to the report, Strategy tops the company list with 528,185 BTC, while Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms rank second with 47,531 BTC and 19,223 BTC. CleanSpark and Tesla conclude the top five with 11,869 BTC and 11,509 BTC, respectively. Q2 Off To A Shaky Start For most analysts, last quarter saw growth due to bullish projections for Q4 2024. The outcome of the US elections , coupled with price jumps, drew the attention of institutional players. This year, the asset has recorded a sharp 22% decline from its all-time high of $108k, affecting the wider market.

This comes on the heels of positive developments around digital asset regulation in the country. President Trump‚Äôs crypto team is doubling efforts to achieve his campaign promises for the market. Bo Hines Turns To Tariffs In a new interview with Anthony Pompliano of Professional Capital Management, Hines stated that Trump‚Äôs advisory team is seeking creative ways to bolster the country‚Äôs Bitcoin reserves. After the President‚Äôs executive order to establish the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Federal agencies were required to disclose all BTC holdings, along with a 180-day window to provide recommendations. The White House advisor noted that they would produce a comprehensive work, but there are countless ways to acquire more of the top crypto. ‚Äú We‚Äôre looking at many creative ways, whether it be from tariffs, there‚Äôs literally countless ways in which you can do this. Everything is on the table, and like we‚Äôve said, we want as much as we can get, so we‚Äôre going to make sure that no stone is unturned‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre moving at tech speed, it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre a startup in this building. We‚Äôll continue moving this along quite quickly.‚Äù The country is currently exploring ways to increase tariff revenue and add it to its reserves. Recently, the President announced sweeping, country-based tariffs. Although special tariffs were reversed after it jolted the markets, the White House increased figures for China and maintained the 10% increase across the board. Aside from tariffs, the administration plans to revalue the country‚Äôs gold certificates. The gold will be valued at the market price of $3,200 per ounce rather than $43 per ounce. This would create a paper surplus to fund new asset purchases. A notable effect is that the surplus could be freed without Congressional appropriations. US To Maintain Global Leadership Hines pointed out that the United States needs to buy more Bitcoin to maintain global leadership or risk falling behind other nations. This backs up President Trump‚Äôs plan to make the country the global capital for Bitcoin and Artificial Intelligence (AI). So far, the Trump administration has taken several steps, including establishing a crypto task force to attract investors. The President also appointed pro-crypto experts to key positions, a sharp contrast from the previous government.

In a new video update , Guy Turner, the host of Coin Bureau, tells his 2.66 million YouTube subscribers that the markets are still way too bullish for traders to be thinking about a bear market starting anytime soon, despite the industry taking a ‚Äúpounding‚Äù recently. According to Turner, we‚Äôre still very much in Bitcoin ( BTC ) season as BTC dominance is still on the rise. He notes that when it comes time to flip to altcoin season, which appears to be coming soon, the top 10 altcoins by market cap will likely see the most inflows. ‚ÄúBitcoin dominance continues to climb‚Ä¶ Taking a look at the altcoin season indicator, we‚Äôre still clearly in Bitcoin season, but you‚Äôll also notice that we‚Äôre also at levels where this trend has historically reversed, with more money flowing into altcoins.

Turner goes on to say the regulatory turnaround by the US on digital assets will also greatly bolster the industry, both in retail and institutional trading, so traders shouldn‚Äôt think about giving up yet. ‚ÄúCrypto regulators in the US have become much friendlier to the industry thanks to the pro-crypto stance taken by the Trump administration‚Ä¶ We believe that this will help to attract a broad range of investors to the crypto market over time, be they retail or institutional investors, and this is also why we believe that although the market has been taking an absolute pounding lately, we shouldn‚Äôt be tapping out just yet‚Ä¶ The overall picture is still too bullish for us to be concerned about a bear market starting anytime soon.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The 22% plunge from $2.10 follows a wider crypto market meltdown, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) sinking to $74,000, its lowest point in five months, and Ethereum crashing 60% over the last 90 days to $1,400. Yet amid the panic, seasoned market watchers are urging calm, and offering a historical reminder. In a tweet , Good Morning Crypto host Abdullah Nassif compared current conditions to the COVID-era crash of 2019‚Äì2020, when Bitcoin touched $3,850, Ethereum hit $100, and XRP dipped to $0.11. You might also like: Morgan Stanley exec says Trump‚Äôs threats to Fed chief Powell is ‚Äònoise‚Äô Nassif‚Äôs point: those who held through the storm back then ended up reaping massive gains. For example: Bitcoin surged from $3,850 to $110,000 at this cycle‚Äôs peak ‚Äî over 2,757% growth XRP climbed from $0.11 in March 2020 to $3.40, a 30-fold increase That means a $40,000 XRP purchase in 2020 would have been worth over $1.2 million by January 2025. Could XRP price surge again? Ripple ( XRP ) has weathered many storms, including a legal battle against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. yet it has consistently climbed in each new market cycle. With today‚Äôs price near $2, the idea of XRP reaching $50 or more in the next major cycle isn‚Äôt out of the question, especially if it repeats its historic 30x performance. Scenario: If XRP does a 30-fold surge again, $2 ‚Üí $60 Holding $40,000 worth (‚âà20,000 XRP) could cross $1.2 million. While XRP‚Äôs long-term potential hinges on market cycles, regulatory clarity, and institutional adoption, some investors are looking toward new alternatives with higher short-term upside. There‚Äôs no certainty XRP can repeat its history, and it could take years to get there. A fresh contender with explosive upside For those not willing to wait years for a 30-fold, Minotaurus (MTAUR) is attracting attention as a new-gen altcoin with strong fundamentals and a much smaller market cap, making it better positioned for faster exponential growth. Why MTAUR Could Deliver Faster: Ultra-low Market Cap: At just 5.6 million USDT, a 30-fold surge move would only push MTAUR to 168 million USDT, still tiny compared to major altcoins like XRP (over $100 billion). Moreover, MTAUR sells cheaply at 0.00010961 USDT, offering a window to accumulate more tokens with less capital than XRP. Unique Gameplay and Ecosystem: MTAUR powers a blockchain game, offering real demand via in-game purchases, events, consumables, and cosmetic upgrades. Incentivized Ecosystem: Whether unlocking special zones, customizing characters, or using MTAUR in the in-game marketplace, the token has built-in utility, giving it value beyond speculation. Fast-Moving Growth Window: Tokens like MTAUR at this stage are known for major moves before reaching saturation, something XRP has already surpassed. Bottom line XRP‚Äôs historical performance suggests it can still make millionaires; however, this may not repeat as attention turns to new gems. Those looking to act early on the next big altcoin before it becomes mainstream may find MTAUR the most compelling bet right now. Now may be the time to explore MTAUR‚Äîbefore the next cycle moves on without it being noticed.

Dogecoin recently got a boost after being endorsed by high profile figures and Shiba Inu‚Äôs ecosystem expansion through Shibarium has kept the interest steady. But as the spotlight is on these viral coins, a new contender Ruvi AI is making waves with a $1 valuation post launch and innovative technology that could change the blockchain game. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu‚Äôs Relevance Dogecoin has been the king of meme coins since its inception and has maintained a market presence largely due to its relatability and community backing. Being the first ‚Äúmeme coin‚Äù has given it cult like status and often gets a boost from public figures like Elon Musk. Shiba Inu is called the ‚ÄúDogecoin killer‚Äù and has diversified its ecosystem to offer more than just meme appeal. Its Shibarium Layer 2 solution promises lower transaction fees and more utility for developers, solidifying Shiba Inu‚Äôs role in DeFi applications. But both tokens are driven by their communities and some investors are looking for projects with real world use cases. Ruvi AI on the other hand is a blockchain innovator that steps away from meme culture to deliver real technological advancements and tangible rewards. Presale Record Ruvi AI‚Äôs presale has smashed records with over 10 million tokens sold and more than $100,000 raised in just days. This is not only a testament to the strong investor confidence in Ruvi AI but also the growing interest in blockchain platforms that offer innovation and utility. VIP Tier 3 Rewards To reward early adopters Ruvi AI has an intelligent VIP reward system. For example, investors in VIP Tier 3 who contribute $1,000 during the presale at $0.01 per token get 100,000 $RUVI tokens. Tier 3 participants also get 60% bonus and get an additional 60,000 tokens and total of 160,000 tokens. The listing price is already confirmed to be 0.07$ per token which will bring the value of these 160,000 tokens to 11,200$. Given the $1 valuation for Ruvi AI, those tokens would be worth $160,000 which is a 15,900% ROI . Such opportunities are good for small and big investors. Leaderboard Rewards Highlight Ruvi AI adds more excitement with its unique leaderboard rewards program that motivates higher volume investors. The Top 10 presale contributors will get 500,000 $RUVI tokens each which is worth $35,000 at listing price and $500,000 at $1 valuation. Lower ranks including Top 50 and Top 1,000 also get generous rewards, 250,000 tokens and 20,000 tokens respectively. This gamified rewards structure has caught the attention of the investor community and created a competition. Ruvi AI‚Äôs Technological Revolution Ruvi AI combines blockchain and artificial intelligence to create a superapp , a single platform with AI powered tools for media generation, content creation and business optimization. This game changing application gives businesses, creators and developers scalable solutions to increase productivity and growth. The project runs on its native $RUVI token and ensures secure and transparent transactions within its decentralized ecosystem. Ruvi AI‚Äôs value lies in its focus on real world challenges and offers practical benefits to its users making it a better alternative to speculative meme coins. Looking Ahead While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu is still getting the social spotlight, Ruvi AI offers investors a next gen opportunity defined by innovation and returns. By addressing real world problems and delivering on blockchain‚Äôs promise of transparency and decentralization, Ruvi AI is positioning itself as a leader in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. The question now is simple yet big. Stick to the meme coins of the past or back a project like Ruvi AI that will take blockchain to new heights. Time will tell but Ruvi AI might just be the future the crypto market has been waiting for.

However, a top central banker has assured that the Fed is ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù ready to do whatever it takes to avoid a financial crisis, whether triggered by the US-led trade war or other adverse developments. Although the long-awaited ‚ÄúFed pivot‚Äù could still be months away, policymakers appear poised to gradually ease financial conditions, beginning last month when they reduced the redemption cap on Treasurys by 80%. Fed policy exerts a gravitational pull on global markets through US dollar liquidity, which has a direct impact on Bitcoin ( BTC ) and the broader cryptocurrency markets. In fact, the Fed‚Äôs impact on crypto has only grown since the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, Bitcoin has been highly correlated with liquidity ‚Äî a fact that was reinforced by a 2024 academic paper by Kingston University of London. This week‚Äôs Crypto Biz newsletter highlights remarks from a senior central bank official and covers major developments in the Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) market and the Bitcoin mining sector. Fed‚Äôs Collins: Central bank will respond to liquidity constraints Boston Fed President Susan Collins said the central bank ‚Äúwould absolutely be prepared‚Äù to backstop markets if economic and financial conditions deteriorated rapidly. Collins was specifically referring to potential liquidity issues or other disruptions that could hinder normal market functioning. Currently, however, Collins noted that the central bank is ‚Äúnot seeing liquidity concerns.‚Äù Should that outlook shift, she emphasized that the Fed has ‚Äútools to address concerns about markets functioning or liquidity.‚Äù Collins is a voting member of this year‚Äôs Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is responsible for setting interest rates. Investors expect the FOMC to refrain from cutting interest rates at its forthcoming meeting in May, based on Fed Fund Futures prices. However, the likelihood of a June rate cut has risen to 67.5%. Fed‚Äôs Collins pictured in an interview with Bloomberg. Source: Bloomberg Television US regulators approve options on spot ETH ETFs The US Securities and Exchange Commission has green-lighted options trading for several spot Ether ( ETH ) exchange-traded funds, an important milestone in ETH‚Äôs quest to attract more institutional capital. According to an April 9 announcement, the approvals were granted to BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Ethereum Trust, Bitwise‚Äôs Ethereum ETF (ETHW), Fidelity‚Äôs Ethereum Fund (FETH), and Grayscale‚Äôs Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH). Options give ETF investors the ability to hedge against a decline in assets, potentially making the funds more attractive to investors. The options trading approval is also seen as an important step in the SEC‚Äôs deliberations around staking services on ETH ETFs. According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, the SEC may be on track to approve staking as early as May. Source: James Seyffart Solana staking ETFs come to Canada As the US SEC continues to deliberate about crypto staking services, Canadian regulators have approved another suite of crypto staking ETFs , this time for Solana ( SOL ). This week, asset managers 3iQ, Purpose, Evolve, and CI received approvals from the Ontario Securities Commission to offer staked Solana ETFs. The 3iQ fund selected blockchain infrastructure provider Figment as its primary staking provider. According to 3iQ‚Äôs website, its Solana Staking ETF will offer yields of between 6% and 8%. The Toronto-based 3iQ launched a spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETF in 2021, some three years before similar funds were approved in the United States. Bitdeer reportedly pivots to self-mining as trade war rattles supply chain Bitcoin mining company Bitdeer is expanding its self-mining capacity and pouring more resources into the United States amid fears that the US-led trade war will rattle global supply chains and upend its hardware business. According to an April 15 report by Bloomberg, Bitdeer is prioritizing BTC mining due to declining demand for its mining rigs. As the broader industry grapples with the potential impact of tariffs , ‚ÄúOur plan going forward is to prioritize our own self-mining,‚Äù Bitdeer executive Jeff LaBerge told Bloomberg. On the topic of US expansion, LaBerge said, ‚ÄúThis is something we‚Äôve been planning for a long time.‚Äù US President Donald Trump‚Äôs sons, Eric and Don Jr, are going all-in on Bitcoin mining after backing a new venture with Hut 8. This follows a renewed commitment by the Trump administration to promote ‚Äúmade in America‚Äù Bitcoin.

According to Dan Tapiero, CEO of 10Tfund, the VIX has hit 60 only five times in the last 35 years, and data suggests a rebound for risk assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) in 6 to 12 months. CBOE Volatility Index. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The VIX, which is widely considered a ""fear gauge,"" reflects investor expectations of market turbulence based on S&P 500 options trading. As illustrated in the chart, extreme spikes were seen in 2008 and 2020, typically coinciding with market bottoms, where panic-driven sellers paved the way for generational market entries. In light of that, Tapiero argued that the current spike is no different, with the worst of market fears likely ""priced in,"" setting the stage for a positive future. Tapiero said that ‚Äúodds favor better future.‚Äù Likewise, Julien Bittel, head of macro research at Global Macro Investor (GMI), supported Tapiero‚Äôs claim and said that tech stocks are at their most oversold since the COVID-19 crash, with over 55% of Nasdaq 100 stocks posting a 14-day RSI below 30. Such a market signal has occurred only during major crises like the 2008 Lehman Brothers collapse and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. American Association of Individual Investors survey. Source: X.com Bittel explained that after the VIX touched 60 last week, it implied peak uncertainty, which breeds fear in investors‚Äô minds. Briefly touching on the US Investors Intelligence Survey, Bittel compared the current bullish sentiment of 23.6% to the lowest reading since December 2008. Additionally, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) survey respondents are currently 62% bearish, reflecting the highest bearish reading since March 2009. Bittel said, ‚ÄúIn other words, we‚Äôre back at the same levels of fear that marked the bottom of the equity market after the Global Financial Crisis.‚Äù This widespread fear, alongside a rare VIX spike, sets up for market entries in assets like Bitcoin, as the recovery of market liquidity will inevitably flow back into risk-on assets.

In a recent X post, Severino predicted that Bitcoin could have already peaked this cycle, but remained open about a possible change in opinion by the end of April.

33767162,[object Object],1745006423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Crypto In The Desert: Arizona Reserve Bill Advances To 3rd Reading,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-in-the-desert-arizona-reserve-bill-advances-to-3rd-reading/,"Arizona‚Äôs push to develop state-run cryptocurrency reserves gained momentum this week. One bill cleared a crucial hurdle when the Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Bill (SB 1373) moved through the upper chamber of the House Committee of the Whole on April 17. It is set for a final vote before potentially reaching Governor Katie Hobbs. Bill Would Create Fund From Seized Crypto Assets SB 1373 would create a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund comprised of digital assets seized in a criminal proceeding. The state treasurer would manage this fund and could invest up to 10% of its total amount into digital assets each year. Under the law, Arizona‚Äôs treasurer would also be able to lend the assets of the fund to enhance returns. The lending power is accompanied by the requirement that it should not enhance financial risks. Governor‚Äôs Veto Threat Hangs Over Legislation The bill‚Äôs passage can be derailed even if it clears its last House vote. Governor Hobbs recently threatened to veto all bills until lawmakers enact legislation for disability funding. Her history doesn‚Äôt look good for the crypto bill ‚Äì she has already vetoed 15 bills that landed on her desk this week. Julian Fahrer, CEO of Apollo and founder of Bitcoin Laws, said SB 1373 will pass the House. However, he intimated it could be merged with another crypto-related bill, SB 1062, that would broaden the definition of legal tender to include cryptocurrency. ARIZONA‚ÄôS STRATEGIC #BITCOIN RESERVE BILL PASSES FINAL COMMITTEE WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE!!! pic.twitter.com/OTRohhG5gt ‚Äî Vivek (@Vivek4real_) April 17, 2025 Second Bitcoin-Specific Bill Also Moving Forward Arizona legislators are pushing a second cryptocurrency bill in addition to SB 1373. The Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB 1025) is targeted at investing in Bitcoin exclusively and not on a wider group of digital currencies. This legislation would allow Arizona‚Äôs state retirement system and treasury to invest as much as 10% of available funds into Bitcoin investments. SB 1025 passed the House Committee of the Whole on April 1 and now is waiting for its own floor vote. Arizona Leads Multi-State Race For Crypto Reserves According to recent legislative advancements, Arizona is at the forefront of multiple states in pursuing cryptocurrency reserve bills. Utah approved Bitcoin bills on March 7 but eliminated the vital provision of a Bitcoin reserve in its third reading. The Texas Senate passed a similar Bitcoin reserve bill on March 6, and New Hampshire‚Äôs House recently passed similar legislation. While Arizona seems to be leading the charge on moving these bills forward, Fahrer thinks the Texas bill has the best shot at becoming law, citing it having encountered the ‚Äúfewest explicit roadblocks‚Äù to date. These state initiatives are part of an emerging trend of government institutions seeing cryptocurrency as an integral part of their investment portfolios, yet political challenges are yet to be overcome. If signed into law, the bills would signal a paradigmatic shift in how state governments invest and manage digital assets.

In a recent video on the X platform, Jeremie indicated that XRP was poised to potentially hit the $24 mark before the end of 2025. A Daring XRP Prediction After years of being a staunch XRP skeptic, Davinci Jeremie, known for his uncanny market insights, changed his tune earlier this year and made a bullish forecast for the crypto. At the time, XRP was trading at a multi-year high of nearly $3.40, and he predicted that the cross-border payments coin was headed to the $20-$24 range before the end of this cycle. The price of XRP has since dropped in tandem with the crypto market amid the US-Sino trade war. The crypto is currently testing the support level at $2 after plunging to $1.65 earlier this month. Nonetheless, Jeremie still expects XRP to ‚Äúpossibly‚Äù climb to $24 as he believes there are many people in the United States government who are ‚Äúpushing XRP.‚Äù He was likely referencing recent developments, including U.S. President Trump‚Äôs announcement that the government would add XRP to the national stockpile . Trump signed an executive order mandating the U.S. Treasury to hold Bitcoin confiscated in criminal and civil forfeitures in a strategic BTC reserve. The EO calls for a U.S. Digital Assets Stockpile ‚Äî a separate entity ‚Äî that will consist of a variety of altcoins, including Ripple‚Äôs XRP, seized through forfeitures alone. While the federal government might sell some of the assets in its stockpile, industry pundits like Jeremie are convinced that XRP featuring in conversations within high-level government circles is a bullish catalyst that could launch the token‚Äôs price to the moon this year. As such, he said there‚Äôs a chance that XRP does ‚Äúsomething crazy‚Äù this year. The crypto would need to jump over 1,040% from its current price to hit the forecasted $24 price target. The Caveat Despite the rosy prospects, Jeremie emphasized that investors should not buy XRP as it is a ‚Äúbanker coin,‚Äù thus acquiring it means supporting banks known to enrich themselves at the expense of the poor. ‚ÄúDo you want to support a banking system that gets free money on your behalf and steal from you whenever they screw up?‚Äù he summarized.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-18 20:01:14

The attack involved a fake Zoom call where Li was invited by a known contact via Telegram. During the call, familiar faces appeared on camera, but there was no audio, followed by a prompt to download a script to fix the audio issue, which Li suspected was malicious. Li managed to avoid the trap by refusing to download the script and attempting to switch the meeting platform to Google Meet, which the impersonator rejected. Subsequently, all communication was erased, and Li was blocked. Although Li was not certain it was the Lazarus Group, security researchers noted that the method matched the group's modus operandi. The Lazarus Group, linked to the $1.4 billion Bybit hack, has been expanding its tactics to include deepfake video, malware, and social engineering to target cryptocurrency industry professionals.

The exchange has been connected to North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus Group, which is accused of laundering approximately $35 million from the hack. eXch, a non-KYC platform, acknowledged that a small portion of the stolen funds passed through its system but denied being a crypto mixing service. The decision to shut down came after a majority vote from the management team, influenced by information provided by a verified whistleblower from the U.S. Department of Justice. In response to the situation, eXch also committed 50 BTC to privacy development initiatives. The closure marks the end of operations for the exchange amid ongoing scrutiny over its role in the laundering of stolen cryptocurrency.

Thursday‚Äôs message stating merely ‚ÄúBitcoin is Calling‚Äù left many asking if a forthcoming significant purchase looms. Related Reading: Is Shiba Inu On Track To Dethrone Dogecoin?

Saylor Continues Bold Bitcoin Claims The chairman of Strategy has issued some provocative comments on BTC in recent weeks. Only two weeks ago, he asserted that the price volatility of the top crypto asset actually proves its utility instead of constituting a disadvantage. When someone brought up Bitcoin‚Äôs link with risky assets, Saylor contended this is so because Bitcoin is ‚Äúthe most liquid, salable, and accessible asset on the planet.‚Äù A day earlier than that remark, he underscored Bitcoin‚Äôs singular status among commodities by noting that there are no tariffs on it. His remark highlighted its digital nature and liquidity as central to what makes it functionally decentralized. Saylor has established himself as one of Bitcoin‚Äôs most vocal proponents. His tweets tend to center on the fact that there are only 21 million coins in existence, which he recently referred to as ‚Äúthe most important number in finance.‚Äù He has also likened Bitcoin to chess, although the meaning behind this comparison wasn‚Äôt elaborated in coverage.

But this could change as tokenized stocks capture a growing share of the US equities market, Wroblewska said. The US stock market has an aggregate value of more than $50 trillion, according to Siblis Research. There is a ‚Äúhuge appetite for US public equities... even individual investors globally want exposure to US capital markets. Tokenization makes it fast and cheap,‚Äù Wroblewska said.

This declaration has caught the attention of investors, especially amidst the current crypto bull market. With a nod to the success of SHIB, anticipation is building around lesser-known projects.

It‚Äôs your ticket to: A private DAO to shape strategy, vote, and manage portfolios Premium AI trading dashboards Early access to exclusive reports An AI launchpad for discovering and launching promising tokens Currently priced at just $0.006666 in stage six of a 28-round presale, AGNT is still under the radar. The final presale price is set at $1 ‚Äî meaning early adopters get in at a serious discount. Audited, secured, and ready to meme Codename:Pepe has passed an audit by Pessimistic, a leading blockchain security firm. While many memecoins lean only on hype, this one has the backbone to last ‚Äî built on code, community, and just the right amount of chaos. With AI-fueled analytics, automated trading, and meme-fueled momentum, Codename:Pepe isn‚Äôt just another coin, it‚Äôs a contender. Shiba Inu hovers near key resistance amid market uncertainty Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading between $0.000011 and $0.000013. Over the past week, the price has slipped by 0.59%. The monthly decline stands at 8.56%, and over six months, SHIB has dropped 36.93%. Despite these declines, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 52.63, indicating neutral momentum. The nearest resistance level is $0.000014. If SHIB breaks above this point, it could signal a potential upward trend. This move might recover some losses from recent months. However, surpassing this resistance is crucial for any significant price increase. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.00000927. Falling below this level could lead to further declines. Traders are watching this support closely to assess SHIB‚Äôs stability. Holding above support may prevent additional losses. The coin‚Äôs future path depends on how it interacts with these key levels. A break above resistance might encourage growth, while slipping below support could trigger more selling. The market remains uncertain, but these levels offer insight into SHIB‚Äôs potential movements. Conclusion In conclusion, while established memecoins like SHIB have seen significant gains, their short-term potential appears limited. Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a new contender, aiming to harness real artificial intelligence for maximum profits. Unlike other projects with vague AI promises, it offers concrete tools like AI-powered trading signals and automated trading to navigate the volatile meme coin market. With transparent tokenomics and a strong focus on community engagement through its DAO, Codename:Pepe crypto distinguishes itself in the crypto space. Its limited supply and rewards for loyal participants highlight a commitment to sustainable growth. As the market evolves, Codename:Pepe crypto represents an intriguing development among memecoins seeking to deliver substantial returns before 2026.

43501233,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150788,1745009452,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unlock Yield on Stellar: Ondo Finance‚Äôs Revolutionary USDY Stablecoin Arrives,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ondo-finance-usdy-stellar-network/,"Exciting news for the Stellar community! Ondo Finance, a prominent player in the tokenized asset space, has just announced a significant expansion. They‚Äôre bringing their Ondo Finance USDY stablecoin, backed by U.S. Treasuries, to the Stellar Network. This move is set to inject a fresh wave of yield opportunities into the Stellar ecosystem, offering users a chance to earn returns on a familiar and trusted asset class within the speed and efficiency of the Stellar blockchain. Ready to dive into the details of this game-changing integration? What is Ondo Finance USDY and Why is it a Game Changer? Before we delve into the specifics of its arrival on Stellar, let‚Äôs quickly recap what Ondo Finance USDY is all about. In essence, USDY is not your average stablecoin. It‚Äôs a tokenized note backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries and bank demand deposits. This backing is crucial because it means USDY holders are essentially gaining exposure to the stability and yield of U.S. government debt, but in a digital, easily transferable form. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of why this is significant: Yield-Bearing Stablecoin: Unlike traditional stablecoins pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies, USDY aims to provide holders with a yield derived from the underlying U.S. Treasury assets. This means simply holding USDY can potentially generate passive income. Transparency and Security: Backed by U.S. Treasuries, USDY offers a level of transparency and security that resonates with both institutional and retail investors. The assets are held in custody and are subject to regulatory oversight. Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs): USDY is a prime example of the growing trend of tokenizing real-world assets. It bridges the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset space, making previously inaccessible markets more readily available to crypto users. The arrival of Ondo Finance USDY on the Stellar network is more than just another token listing; it‚Äôs a strategic move that could significantly enhance the utility and attractiveness of the Stellar ecosystem. Why Stellar Network for USDY? Unveiling the Strategic Fit So, why did Ondo Finance choose the Stellar Network as the next destination for their yield stablecoin ? Stellar is known for its speed, low transaction costs, and focus on payments and tokenization. Let‚Äôs explore the key reasons behind this synergistic partnership: Efficient Payment Infrastructure: Stellar is specifically designed for fast and cost-effective payments. This makes it an ideal network for a stablecoin like USDY, which aims to facilitate seamless transactions and potentially serve as a stable store of value for everyday use. Low Transaction Fees: High gas fees on some blockchains can erode the benefits of yield-bearing assets, especially for smaller transactions. Stellar‚Äôs negligible transaction fees ensure that users can move and utilize their USDY on Stellar without significant cost barriers. Growing Ecosystem: The Stellar ecosystem is vibrant and continuously expanding, with a strong focus on financial inclusion and real-world applications. Integrating USDY into this ecosystem opens up new avenues for decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world utility within Stellar. Existing User Base: Stellar has a dedicated and active user base, many of whom are already familiar with stablecoins and seeking yield opportunities. Introducing Ondo Finance USDY caters to this demand and provides a compelling reason for users to further engage with the Stellar network. Essentially, Stellar provides the perfect infrastructure for USDY on Stellar to thrive, leveraging its strengths to maximize the benefits for users and the network as a whole. Benefits of USDY on Stellar: A Win-Win Scenario The integration of Ondo Finance USDY into the Stellar network is poised to unlock a range of benefits for both USDY holders and the Stellar ecosystem. Let‚Äôs break down the key advantages: Benefit Description Impact Access to Yield for Stellar Users Stellar users gain direct access to a yield-bearing digital asset backed by U.S. Treasuries, previously not readily available within the network. Attracts new users and capital to the Stellar ecosystem, enhances the appeal of holding assets on Stellar. Enhanced Utility of XLM USDY can be used within the Stellar ecosystem for various applications, potentially increasing the demand and utility of XLM, Stellar‚Äôs native token, for transaction fees. Strengthens the Stellar network‚Äôs economy and potentially drives adoption of XLM. DeFi Opportunities on Stellar USDY can be integrated into Stellar-based DeFi platforms, opening up new avenues for lending, borrowing, and yield farming within the Stellar ecosystem. Expands the DeFi landscape on Stellar, providing users with more sophisticated financial tools. Faster and Cheaper Transactions Utilizing Stellar‚Äôs infrastructure, transactions with USDY on Stellar will be significantly faster and cheaper compared to networks with higher fees. Improves user experience and makes USDY more practical for everyday transactions and smaller value transfers. Wider Adoption of Tokenized Treasuries This integration further validates the concept of tokenized real-world assets and can pave the way for wider adoption of tokenized U.S. Treasuries and other RWAs in the crypto space. Contributes to the maturation and mainstream acceptance of blockchain technology in traditional finance. In essence, the arrival of USDY on Stellar creates a powerful synergy, bringing together a yield-generating asset with a high-performance blockchain network. It‚Äôs a move that could significantly benefit both communities. Navigating Potential Challenges and Considerations While the integration of Ondo Finance USDY into the Stellar network is undoubtedly exciting, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations that users and the ecosystem should be mindful of: Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment surrounding stablecoins and tokenized securities is constantly evolving. Users should stay informed about any regulatory changes that could impact USDY and its operations. Smart Contract Risks: As with any digital asset, smart contract risks are inherent. While Ondo Finance and Stellar are reputable entities, users should always exercise caution and understand the potential risks associated with interacting with smart contracts. Yield Fluctuations: The yield on USDY on Stellar is derived from U.S. Treasuries, and therefore, yields can fluctuate based on market conditions and interest rate changes. It‚Äôs not a fixed yield and users should be aware of potential variability. Adoption and Liquidity: The success of USDY on Stellar will depend on its adoption within the Stellar ecosystem and the liquidity it achieves on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and other platforms. Users should monitor liquidity levels before engaging in significant transactions.

The new framework includes direct token buys, a change brought about by developer and community feedback that pointed out inefficiencies in the original plan. Original Program Underperformed Launched in March 2024, the initiative initially was designed to encourage BNB Chain-native projects for getting listed on top exchanges. Incentives were graded between $10,000 and $500,000 and encompassed platforms such as Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and OKX. Nevertheless, following a three-week pilot, the BNB Chain Foundation observed limited success. The CEX-centric incentives were not able to yield the hoped-for liquidity enhancements or market support, leading to the change of tack towards a more direct method. New Emphasis: Direct Token Purchases The new scheme will have them Chain Foundation invest in top-notch projects directly. The qualifying tokens must be fully native on BNB Chain or port over successfully. Projects entering the ‚Äúqualified pool‚Äù must have one or more of the following: Market cap of more than $1 million More than 300 average daily active traders Total value locked (TVL) of more than $20 million Security and other metrics of importance to the ecosystem will also be considered. For those that qualify, the foundation will purchase up to $100,000 of tokens, with discretion regarding timing of purchase and token management.

He is one of the few people mentioned in the original Bitcoin white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious Bitcoin creator. In the old post, he shared his thoughts about Bitcoin when it had just crossed $100. Now, over ten years later, the post still feels very relevant. The 2013 Post That Feels New Again In 2013, many people were worried that they had missed the chance to buy Bitcoin. Some had bought at $30 or $100 and thought the price had already gone too high. Adam Back replied with a calm and thoughtful message. He said that in ten years, those people would still feel early. He was not trying to hype Bitcoin; he was sharing what he believed based on facts and experience. That same post will be shared again on social media in 2025. Many are surprised at how true it still feels today, even though Bitcoin ‚Äôs price is almost $100,000, and hope to rally soon. People Still Ask the Same Question: Is It Too Late? Adam Back saw his old post being shared again and commented on it. People still ask, ‚ÄúIs it too late to invest in Bitcoin?‚Äù However, this time, the question comes from large investors, banks, and fund managers. Back thinks this confusion is one reason why Bitcoin is still undervalued. Even though the price is much higher today, many people still do not fully understand the asset is worth or what it could become. One well-known person who agrees with Adam Back is Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad. He also believes that the asset is still early in its journey. Kiyosaki often says that Bitcoin is a smart way to store money . This is especially true with rising inflation and growing distrust in the traditional banking system. Bitcoin on Exchanges Is Dropping Adam Back also shared some data showing that the number of Bitcoins on exchanges is decreasing. This means more people are moving their Bitcoin into private storage. This means investors are holding onto their Bitcoin long-term and are not planning to sell it soon. At the same time, big investors are becoming more interested in Bitcoin. Large firms like BlackRock have launched Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), which allow people to invest in Bitcoin without directly holding it. Venture capital invests in projects that build new applications on top of Bitcoin, especially layer-2 solutions. These solutions help make Bitcoin faster and more useful.

In an April 18 X post, Soto-Wright said he wanted Congress to ‚Äúkeep state-regulated issuers in the game‚Äù when it comes to stablecoin regulation, referencing efforts in the House of Representatives and Senate to create a federal regulatory framework. Lawmakers are considering whether to pass the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, in the Senate and the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy, or STABLE Act, in the House. ‚ÄúWhile the cryptocurrency industry has called for federal legislation for years, it has been these state regulators who have provided and continue to provide regulatory clarity and supervision to ensure consumer protection and enable growth in the sector,‚Äù said Soto-Wright. ‚ÄúAs federal legislation now approaches the finish line, it is essential to preserve viable state pathways for PSIs [permitted stablecoin issuers] that place the state regulators who meet the standards set out in GENIUS and STABLE on equal footing with federal regulators.‚Äù April 17 letter from MoonPay CEO to congressional leadership. Source: Ivan Soto-Wright The MoonPay CEO‚Äôs comment echoed those of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), which wrote to leadership on the House Financial Services Committee in an April 1 letter and recommended a similar state-level approach. Both the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee voted to advance the bills in March and April, respectively, paving the way for a full floor vote. Related: Lawmaker alleges Trump wants to replace US dollar with his stablecoin The STABLE Act, a companion bill modeled after the GENIUS Act, proposed regulating payment stablecoins by limiting them to ‚Äúpermitted payment stablecoin issuers,‚Äù allowing for ‚Äústate qualified‚Äù ones.

Lately, a fascinating on-chain metric called the Bitcoin RHODL ratio has been making waves, and for good reason. This powerful indicator has just doubled, hinting at a potentially seismic shift in how Bitcoin holders are behaving. Let‚Äôs dive deep into what this means for you and the broader crypto landscape. Decoding the Bitcoin RHODL Ratio: A Key to Holder Behavior The Bitcoin RHODL ratio , or Realized HODL Ratio, is a fascinating tool in the world of on-chain analysis. It‚Äôs essentially a ratio between the Realized Value of coins held for 1 week to 1 month (representing short-term holders) and the Realized Value of coins held for 1 year to 2 years (representing mid-term holders). This comparison gives us a glimpse into the prevailing sentiment and activity of different Bitcoin holder groups. Think of it as a market sentiment barometer, but instead of relying on surveys, it uses actual blockchain data to gauge the temperature. Here‚Äôs a simplified breakdown of what the RHODL ratio helps us understand: Short-term holder activity: The 1 week to 1 month band reflects the actions of newer market participants, often speculators or those reacting to short-term price fluctuations. Mid-term holder accumulation: The 1 year to 2 year band represents holders who have weathered some market volatility and are likely accumulating for a longer-term outlook. Market sentiment shifts: By comparing these two groups, the RHODL ratio can highlight shifts in market sentiment, moving from speculative frenzies to more considered accumulation phases. According to Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytics firm, the Bitcoin RHODL ratio has experienced a significant jump recently. Let‚Äôs examine what this doubling actually signifies. Explosive Doubling: What Does a RHODL Ratio of 0.2 Signal? The recent surge in the Bitcoin RHODL ratio from approximately 0.1 in February to over 0.2 by mid-April is not just a minor blip; it‚Äôs a doubling that warrants attention. This increase is a significant signal, particularly when viewed in the context of historical market cycles. Here‚Äôs what a doubling of the RHODL ratio typically suggests: Decline in Short-Term Speculation: A rising RHODL ratio often indicates that the influence of short-term speculators is waning. This could mean fewer people are rapidly buying and selling Bitcoin based on short-term price movements. Renewed Mid-Term Holder Accumulation: Conversely, an increasing RHODL ratio suggests that mid-term holders, those who have held Bitcoin for 1 to 2 years, are becoming more prominent. This often points to a phase of renewed accumulation, where these holders are adding to their positions. Market Transition Phases: Historically, similar increases in the RHODL ratio have been observed during market transition phases, specifically after major market peaks. Glassnode points out parallels to periods following the 2018 and late 2021 peaks. To better understand the significance, let‚Äôs consider a table illustrating typical RHODL ratio ranges and their interpretations: RHODL Ratio Range Interpretation Market Phase Indication Low (e.g., below 0.1) Short-term holder dominance; potential speculative bubble Late Bull Market/Market Top Moderate (e.g., 0.1 ‚Äì 0.2) Balance between short-term and mid-term holders; transition phase Market Correction/Early Accumulation High (e.g., above 0.2) Mid-term holder dominance; accumulation phase Accumulation/Early Bull Market As you can see, moving from 0.1 to 0.2 places us firmly in the ‚ÄòModerate‚Äô to ‚ÄòHigh‚Äô range, suggesting a shift away from a potentially speculative phase and towards a more accumulation-focused market. But what does this mean for your Bitcoin strategy? Holder Behavior Shift: Actionable Insights for Your Crypto Strategy Understanding the shift in holder behavior , as indicated by the RHODL ratio, can provide valuable insights for your cryptocurrency strategy. It‚Äôs not just about observing a metric; it‚Äôs about interpreting what it tells us about the market‚Äôs underlying dynamics. Here are some actionable insights you can consider: Assess your risk appetite: If the market is transitioning away from short-term speculation and towards accumulation, it might signal a more stable, albeit potentially slower, growth phase. Adjust your risk appetite accordingly. Are you comfortable with long-term holding, or are you primarily focused on short-term gains? Re-evaluate your portfolio allocation: A shift towards accumulation might be a good time to re-evaluate your portfolio. Consider increasing your Bitcoin holdings if you believe in long-term appreciation, as mid-term holders seem to be doing. Look for accumulation opportunities: Market transition phases can present excellent accumulation opportunities. If the RHODL ratio continues to rise, it could indicate a sustained period of accumulation, potentially before the next major bull run. Monitor on-chain metrics: The RHODL ratio is just one of many on-chain metrics. Become familiar with others like the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL), MVRV ratio, and reserve risk to get a more holistic view of market conditions. Stay informed: Keep an eye on analysis from firms like Glassnode and other reputable sources that provide on-chain data interpretations. Market conditions are dynamic, and staying informed is crucial. Navigating Market Cycles: Learning from Past Bitcoin Accumulation Phases The comparison to market transition phases after the 2018 and late 2021 peaks is crucial. These historical parallels offer valuable context for understanding the current market cycles and potential future trajectories of Bitcoin. Let‚Äôs briefly revisit these past phases: Post-2018 Peak: After the 2018 peak, the Bitcoin market entered a prolonged bear market and accumulation phase. During this time, the RHODL ratio likely showed similar patterns of short-term speculation decline and mid-term holder accumulation before the subsequent bull run. Post-Late 2021 Peak: Following the late 2021 peak, we again saw a market correction and a period of uncertainty. The current increase in the RHODL ratio mirroring patterns seen after these peaks suggests a potential similarity in market behavior and recovery phases. By studying these past cycles, we can observe that periods of increased RHODL ratio, signaling stronger mid-term Bitcoin accumulation , often precede significant market recoveries and bull runs. This historical context reinforces the importance of understanding the current RHODL ratio signal. Challenges and Considerations: Is the RHODL Ratio Foolproof? While the RHODL ratio is a powerful tool, it‚Äôs essential to acknowledge its limitations and consider potential challenges: Not a standalone indicator: The RHODL ratio should not be used in isolation. It‚Äôs most effective when combined with other on-chain metrics, technical analysis, and fundamental analysis. Market complexity: Cryptocurrency markets are influenced by numerous factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory changes, and technological developments. The RHODL ratio is just one piece of the puzzle. Potential for manipulation: While on-chain data is generally transparent, there‚Äôs always a theoretical possibility of sophisticated actors attempting to manipulate metrics, although this is less likely to be impactful on a widely observed metric like RHODL. Interpretation nuances: Interpreting the RHODL ratio requires experience and context. What constitutes a ‚Äúhigh‚Äù or ‚Äúlow‚Äù ratio can evolve over time and with changing market dynamics. Despite these challenges, the RHODL ratio remains a valuable tool for understanding Bitcoin market dynamics, particularly when assessing holder behavior and potential market phase transitions. Conclusion: Decoding Bitcoin‚Äôs Holder Behavior for Smarter Crypto Decisions The doubling of the Bitcoin RHODL ratio is a compelling signal that should not be ignored. It points towards a significant shift in market dynamics, away from short-term speculation and towards renewed mid-term holder accumulation. By understanding and interpreting this metric, you can gain a deeper insight into market sentiment and potentially make more informed decisions about your Bitcoin strategy.

Among the top contenders, Qubetics, XRP, and Theta stand out, each with its unique offering, revolutionary potential, and long-term growth prospects. While Ethereum and Bitcoin might have led the charge, newer projects like Qubetics ($TICS) are beginning to challenge the status quo by solving real-world problems with cutting-edge blockchain technology. Qubetics is catching eyes in the crypto space, and for a good reason. It‚Äôs not just another crypto project; it offers a real-world asset tokenization marketplace that promises to redefine how businesses and individuals handle cross-border transactions and asset tokenization. Unlike XRP, which primarily focuses on cross-border payments, or Theta, which is revolutionizing content delivery, Qubetics stands out by providing a seamless platform for tokenizing real-world assets, making them more accessible and tradable. Now, let‚Äôs dive deeper into these three cryptocurrencies and explore how each is making waves in the blockchain world, as well as why they‚Äôre shaping the future of digital finance. And trust me, with Qubetics‚Äô best crypto presale in Stage 30, things are heating up fast‚Äîhere‚Äôs why you should care. Qubetics: Redefining Cross-Border Payments with Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace Unlike XRP, which aims to streamline cross-border payments, Qubetics tackles a broader issue: the lack of liquidity and accessibility in real-world asset markets. Imagine a platform where individuals, businesses, and financial institutions can tokenize everything from real estate and commodities to fine art and intellectual property. This is what Qubetics promises with its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. Qubetics ($TICS) is in its 30th stage of the presale, having raised over $16.2 million from more than 24,900 holders, with over 508 million tokens sold. This crypto is on a fast track to massive success. But what sets it apart? Key Features: Real-World Asset Tokenization: Qubetics streamlines the process of tokenizing real-world assets, facilitating faster and more cost-effective transactions across borders. Blockchain Interoperability: With its multi-chain wallet, users can seamlessly transfer assets between various blockchains, thereby reducing transaction times and fees. Advanced Security Protocols: Built on top of advanced blockchain protocols, Qubetics ensures transparency and security for all transactions. This focus on real-world assets marks a major differentiator for Qubetics. XRP laid the groundwork for cross-border transactions. Still, it is Qubetics that is pushing the envelope in asset tokenization, offering businesses and individuals an entirely new way to trade and manage assets globally. Analysts Predict: Current $TICS Price: $0.1729 $TICS at $1 After the Presale: 477% ROI $TICS at $5 After the Presale: 2789% ROI $TICS at $6 After Mainnet Launch: 3367% ROI $TICS at $10 After Mainnet Launch: 5678% ROI $TICS at $15 After Mainnet Launch: 8567% ROI As Qubetics continues to rise, this project is not only providing a platform for decentralized finance but also disrupting the traditional asset market model, creating a perfect storm for high-reward opportunities. XRP ETF Hopes Rise as Ripple SEC Case Pauses Ripple‚Äôs long-running legal battle with the SEC took a temporary pause on April 16, 2025, sparking renewed optimism in the cryptocurrency community about the potential approval of an XRP spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit suspended the appeal in the SEC vs. Ripple case, halting Ripple‚Äôs immediate response deadline. This move has brought attention to Judge Analisa Torres, who will deliver the final ruling. Legal experts, including Bill Morgan and Fred Rispoli, see this development as a potential catalyst for an XRP ETF, especially as companies like Bitwise, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton have already filed applications for such a fund. If the ETF is approved, it could drive institutional interest in XRP, potentially boosting its price and accessibility for both large investors and retail traders. Theta Network Faces Market Pressure Amid Limited Growth Theta Network‚Äôs native token, THETA, is trading at approximately $0.6257, reflecting a modest decline of 0.02816% from the previous close. The token‚Äôs intraday range has been between $0.6229 and $0.6474, indicating limited volatility. Analysts have forecasted a potential decline to around $0.5909 by April 21, 2025, indicating a bearish short-term outlook for THETA. Similarly, Theta Fuel (TFUEL), the network‚Äôs utility token, is trading at approximately $0.03256, with predictions indicating a gradual increase to a maximum of $0.0487 by the end of 2025 . Despite these forecasts, the overall market sentiment remains cautious, with technical indicators showing bearish trends and a Fear & Greed Index reading of 30, placing investors in the ‚ÄòFear‚Äô zone. Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace: The Future of Global Transactions Real-world asset tokenization is an emerging trend that‚Äôs shaping the future of digital finance. The concept is simple: by converting real-world assets into tokens on a blockchain, these assets can be traded, stored, and accessed by anyone with an internet connection. Why It Matters: Democratizing Asset Ownership: Tokenization enables anyone, not just the wealthy elite, to own and trade high-value assets such as real estate and fine art. Faster Transactions: With blockchain, asset transactions can occur in minutes, not days, thereby reducing costs and enhancing liquidity. Global Accessibility: Tokenized assets are accessible to anyone worldwide, regardless of their location, making them more inclusive than traditional finance. Qubetics is ahead of the curve by incorporating this technology into its platform. With the growing need for transparency, liquidity, and accessibility in global asset markets, tokenization is poised to disrupt traditional finance, and Qubetics is right at the forefront. Conclusion: Why Qubetics is the Best Crypto to Buy Now As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to mature, new projects like Qubetics are emerging with innovative solutions to longstanding problems. While XRP and Theta have paved the way in their respective niches, Qubetics‚Äô Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace offers something entirely new: a seamless, decentralized way for businesses and individuals to tokenize and trade real-world assets. Whether you‚Äôre looking for high-reward plays or just want to get ahead of the curve, Qubetics stands out as one of the best cryptos to buy now , especially with its presale in Stage 30.

According to the team, the move comes after internal consensus among its leadership to ‚Äúcease and retreat‚Äù rather than continue under what it described as a hostile operating environment. The shutdown follows the emergence of what eXch claims is an ‚Äúactive transatlantic operation‚Äù reportedly targeting the platform with the intent to dismantle its infrastructure and pursue criminal charges. This included accusations of enabling terrorism financing and laundering roughly $35 million in crypto allegedly traced back to North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus Group. eXch to Wind Down While the eXch team acknowledged that a small portion of illicit funds may have passed through the platform, they vehemently denied any intentional facilitation of criminal activity. eXch also rejected the characterization of its services as a ‚Äúmixer,‚Äù despite comparisons by on-chain analysts. The platform‚Äôs founders criticized the broader crypto compliance landscape, aiming at what they called the ‚Äúnonsensical policies‚Äù of exchanges that rely on third-party AML scoring APIs, which they argue can be easily bypassed and offer little real protection. As the exchange prepares to wind down, it has announced the establishment of a 50 BTC open-source fund to support privacy-preserving financial tools and wallets across various ecosystems, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Thorchain. Partners will retain limited access to APIs until the transition of control to a new management group is finalized. ‚ÄúThe goals we certainly never had in mind were to enable illicit activities such as money laundering or terrorism, as we are being accused of now. We also have absolutely no motivation to operate a project where we are viewed as criminals. This doesn‚Äôt make any sense to us. Originally, we were just a team of privacy enthusiasts with main areas of interest quite distant from cryptocurrency, where we saw the absolutely unfair happenings. This project was an attempt to restore balance in this industry.‚Äù Bybit Hack The February Bybit hack, which drained over $1.5 billion in digital assets including stETH and mETH, ranks among the largest thefts in crypto history. Onchain investigators ZachXBT and Nick Bax of Security Alliance had previously alleged that eXch facilitated the laundering of funds stolen in the Bybit hack by North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus Group. Additional claims from blockchain analysts and security firm SlowMist support the accusation, which cited Ether transfers from hack-linked wallets. Despite the severe blow, Bybit has managed to regain momentum in the market. As of April 9, analytics firm Block Scholes reported the exchange‚Äôs market share had climbed from a low of 4% after the breach to about 7%. This rebound reflected a strong comeback in spot trading volume and overall exchange activity, suggesting the platform is recovering more quickly than many had initially anticipated.

Regulators in the United States, Russia, and Canada shared updates that could influence their approach to cryptocurrency oversight. SEC Roundtable to Explore Custody and Crypto Regulation The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unveiled the full agenda and panel lineup for its upcoming crypto roundtable, scheduled for April 25. The event signals a deepening institutional focus on crypto regulation, particularly around asset custody standards and investor protections. The roundtable will be split into two key sessions: ‚ÄúCustody Through Broker-Dealers and Beyond‚Äù and ‚ÄúInvestment Adviser and Investment Company Custody.‚Äù These topics address how custodians of crypto assets should be regulated under U.S. securities laws. Zach Zweihorn, a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, will moderate the discussions. The roundtable will begin with opening remarks from Richard Gabbert, Chief of Staff for the SEC‚Äôs Crypto Task Force, along with senior SEC figures including Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, and Commissioner Hester Peirce. The @SECGov held its second crypto roundtable on Friday, with Acting Chair Mark Uyeda proposing temporary rules for blockchain trading while long-term frameworks are crafted. #CryptoRegulation #SEC https://t.co/lYCzMpHSLw ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 11, 2025 The discussions are expected to influence future SEC guidance on custody rules, especially as crypto continues to blend with traditional finance through broker-dealer models and investment advisers. Russia Urged to Build Homegrown Stablecoins A senior Russian finance official called for the development of domestic stablecoins following a clampdown on USDT wallets linked to the country. Russia should issue its own stablecoins after USDT freezes exposed reliance on foreign assets, top Finance Ministry official says. #Russia #Stablecoins https://t.co/CvZGWTnLxZ ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 17, 2025 The statement follows U.S.-based stablecoin issuer Tether freezing several wallets associated with Russian users, causing disruptions in cross-border digital payments. Osman Kabaloev, deputy head of the Financial Policy Department at Russia‚Äôs Finance Ministry, said the incident showed the risks of relying on foreign-issued tokens. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Kabaloev emphasized the need for Russia to build its own stablecoin infrastructure to maintain financial sovereignty and reduce external dependencies. The comments reflect Russia‚Äôs broader efforts to circumvent Western sanctions through alternative financial channels, with stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) playing an essential role in that strategy This pivot toward sovereign digital tools could reshape the country‚Äôs approach to crypto regulation in the years ahead. Senate Proposal Adds Environmental Layer to Crypto Regulation Meanwhile, environmental concerns surrounding cryptocurrency mining have prompted new legislative action in the U.S. Senate. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse and John Fetterman introduced the ‚ÄúClean Cloud Act of 2025‚Äù last week , a bill aimed at reducing emissions from crypto mining and data center operations. Democratic Senators Sheldon Whitehouse and John Fetterman drafted the bill, seeking to curb emissions from crypto mining and AI data centers. #BitcoinMining #AIDataCenter #CryptoMiningBill https://t.co/jsPWgiEPPe ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 14, 2025 The proposed law would fine mining facilities that continue to use non-renewable energy sources beyond 2035. Additionally, it requires facilities consuming more than 100 kilowatts of power to report energy usage, electricity sources, and emissions data annually. ‚ÄúThere is a lack of transparency regarding the energy sources used to power domestic crypto mining and many data center operations,‚Äù the draft legislation states. If passed, the bill would alter the cost structures and operational models of crypto mining firms in the United States, pushing them toward cleaner energy sources or out of the country altogether. Canada Leads with Solana ETFs North of the border, Canada approved North America‚Äôs first spot Solana exchange‚Äëtraded funds (ETFs) that incorporate staking. Canada becomes the first in North America to approve spot Solana ETFs with staking support, and trading is set to begin April 16. #SolanaETF #Canada https://t.co/nbsSS4fR71 ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 15, 2025 These ETFs will include staking capabilities , a feature that allows investors to earn rewards by locking up their tokens to support blockchain operations. The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) approved four issuers‚ÄîPurpose Investments, Evolve ETFs, CI Financial, and 3iQ‚Äîto list Solana ETFs, with trading set to begin on April 16. The funds will hold physical Solana (SOL) and offer staking, making them a rare blend of passive investment and yield-generating blockchain participation. The decision may encourage additional crypto‚Äëbased investment products in traditional markets and reinforces Canada‚Äôs proactive stance on crypto oversight. Crypto Regulation Tightens as Global Oversight Expands The idea that crypto exists outside the system has become harder to defend. Canada‚Äôs ETF approvals reflect financial normalization. The SEC‚Äôs custody talks show traditional regulators are no longer avoiding digital assets. And in Russia, token infrastructure is being treated as a matter of national security. Crypto‚Äôs next chapter won‚Äôt be defined by innovation alone‚Äîit will depend on who sets the rules, how they‚Äôre enforced, and how global approaches to crypto regulation evolve from here.

The proposal has sparked curiosity on X, but early comments on GitHub show some initial resistance. A community member going by ElagabalxNode noted that reducing the staking reward without ‚Äúcompensatory mechanisms like a robust delegation program‚Äù could push smaller validators out of the network, thus weakening the Aptos blockchain‚Äôs decentralization and long-term resistance. Related: Aptos to accelerate innovation with new tech, investment in India The proposal addresses the validators‚Äô role in the network, stating that Aptos should consider a community validator program to give grants and stake to small validators contributing to the ecosystem.‚Äù Aptos was founded in 2021 by a group of former Meta engineers. According to DefiLlama, the Aptos blockchain has a total value locked of $974 million as of April 18, with nearly a $320 million coming from lending protocol Aries Markets. Aptos TVL and other metrics. Source: DefiLlama While high staking rewards can incentivize users to lock up tokens on Aptos, MoonSheisty argues that they may also discourage participation in higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities within the ecosystem, such as restaking, DePIN infrastructure, MEV, and decentralized finance. Staking ‚Äòreal reward rates‚Äô vary considerably Staking rewards can vary significantly across blockchains. According to CoinLedger, real returns on the BNB Smart Chain are among the highest at 7.43%, while Cardano offers one of the lowest at just 0.55%. Staking offers multiple benefits: It incentivizes users to lock their tokens on-chain, supports validators and helps secure the network. Rewards work similarly to interest earned on a savings account ‚Äî but instead of cash, stakers earn crypto, which can fluctuate in fiat value. Related: Coinbase‚Äôs Ethereum staking dominance risks overcentralization: Execs From time to time, proposals emerge aiming to modify staking procedures. In June 2024, Polkadot introduced a proposal to reduce the time needed to unstake to just two days. In September, the Starknet community voted to pass a new staking mechanism , while Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed solutions to staking issues a few weeks later. While staking gives the community a true ‚Äústake‚Äù in the network, there are risks associated with it, including the consolidation of smaller pools into larger ones.

In the fast-paced world of decentralized finance (DeFi), even stablecoins can experience unexpected turbulence. Recently, Synthetix‚Äôs sUSD faced a depegging challenge, causing ripples within the crypto community. But fear not, Synthetix is stepping up with an innovative solution: the sUSD 420 Pool . Let‚Äôs dive into what this means for SNX stakers and the broader DeFi ecosystem. What‚Äôs the Buzz About the sUSD Depegging Issue? Stablecoins, designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with fiat currencies like the US dollar, are crucial for DeFi‚Äôs stability. When a stablecoin ‚Äòdepegs,‚Äô it means it deviates from its intended value, causing uncertainty and potential losses for holders. sUSD, Synthetix‚Äôs native stablecoin, recently experienced such a depegging event. While fluctuations are normal, significant and prolonged deviations can be concerning. This is where Synthetix‚Äôs proactive approach comes into play, aiming to swiftly restore confidence and stability in sUSD. Introducing the Hero: The sUSD 420 Pool To tackle the depegging issue head-on, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick announced the launch of the sUSD 420 Pool. Think of this pool as a strategic reserve designed to re-establish and maintain the sUSD peg. But how does it work, and why is it called the ‚Äò420 Pool‚Äô? Let‚Äôs break it down: Purpose-Built Solution: The sUSD 420 Pool is specifically engineered to address the current depegging of sUSD. It‚Äôs not a generic liquidity pool; it‚Äôs a targeted intervention. Incentivizing Stability: The core mechanism involves incentivizing SNX stakers to deposit sUSD into the pool. By increasing demand for sUSD, this mechanism aims to push its price back towards the $1 peg. Attractive Rewards: To make it worthwhile for SNX stakers, Synthetix is offering substantial rewards. We‚Äôre talking about a whopping 5 million SNX tokens distributed over 12 months! Daily SNX Payouts: According to Synthetix‚Äôs announcement on X (formerly Twitter), the daily reward distribution is approximately 13,698.6 SNX. That‚Äôs a significant incentive for participants. The ‚Äò420‚Äô Mystery: While the ‚Äò420‚Äô in the name might raise eyebrows and spark internet jokes, it‚Äôs likely just a memorable label. There‚Äôs no official explanation for the ‚Äò420‚Äô designation, but in the crypto space, sometimes memorable names are just as important as functional details! How Can SNX Stakers Benefit from the 420 Pool? Are you an SNX staker looking for opportunities to boost your holdings? The sUSD 420 Pool presents a compelling option. Here‚Äôs a closer look at the potential benefits: Earn Generous SNX Rewards: The primary allure is the chance to earn a share of 5 million SNX. By depositing sUSD, stakers become eligible for daily SNX rewards, effectively earning yield on their stablecoin holdings. Contribute to sUSD Stability: Participating in the pool isn‚Äôt just about personal gain; it‚Äôs also about contributing to the health of the Synthetix ecosystem. By depositing sUSD, you‚Äôre directly helping to restore its peg and ensure its reliability as a stablecoin. Simple Participation: The process is straightforward ‚Äì SNX stakers deposit sUSD into the designated 420 Pool. The mechanics are designed to be user-friendly, encouraging broad participation. Long-Term Earning Potential: With rewards distributed over 12 months, this isn‚Äôt a flash-in-the-pan opportunity. It offers a sustained period for earning SNX, providing a more predictable income stream. Example: Imagine you deposit $10,000 worth of sUSD into the 420 Pool. You become part of the reward distribution mechanism, earning a proportional share of the daily 13,698.6 SNX. Over time, this can accumulate into a significant amount of SNX, especially if SNX‚Äôs value appreciates. Addressing the Depegging: Why is it a Priority for Synthetix? Why is Synthetix so focused on resolving the sUSD depegging issue? The answer lies in the fundamental role stablecoins play within DeFi and the Synthetix ecosystem itself. Maintaining User Trust: A depegged stablecoin erodes user trust. Restoring the peg is crucial for reassuring users that sUSD is a reliable and stable asset to hold and transact with. Ecosystem Health: sUSD is integral to the Synthetix ecosystem, used in various synthetic asset (Synths) trading and DeFi applications built on Synthetix. A stable sUSD is essential for the smooth functioning of these applications. Preventing Cascading Effects: Unaddressed depegging can lead to wider market instability. By proactively intervening, Synthetix aims to prevent potential negative ripple effects across the DeFi space. Demonstrating Resilience: Successfully addressing the depegging showcases Synthetix‚Äôs resilience and commitment to its ecosystem. It sends a strong message that Synthetix is capable of tackling challenges and prioritizing the stability of its assets. Are There Any Challenges or Risks to Consider? While the sUSD 420 Pool is designed as a solution, it‚Äôs important to approach it with a balanced perspective. What are some potential challenges or risks to keep in mind? Market Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile. Despite the pool‚Äôs incentives, external market forces could still impact sUSD‚Äôs price. SNX Price Fluctuations: The rewards are paid in SNX. If the price of SNX drops significantly, the real value of the rewards might decrease, although the number of SNX tokens earned remains constant. Smart Contract Risks: As with any DeFi protocol, there are smart contract risks involved. While Synthetix is a well-established project, smart contract vulnerabilities are always a possibility (though typically mitigated through audits). Opportunity Cost: Staking sUSD in the 420 Pool means locking up those funds. Stakers should consider if there are other potentially more lucrative opportunities elsewhere in the DeFi space. Actionable Insights: Should You Participate in the sUSD 420 Pool? So, should you, as an SNX staker, consider depositing sUSD into the 420 Pool? Here are some actionable insights to help you decide: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand the potential risks and rewards. Are you comfortable with the inherent risks of DeFi and potential SNX price volatility? Evaluate SNX Reward Potential: Consider the current and potential future value of SNX. Do you believe in the long-term prospects of Synthetix and SNX? Diversification Strategy: Think about your overall portfolio diversification. Is allocating a portion of your sUSD holdings to the 420 Pool aligned with your broader investment strategy?

These gains resulted from a bounce, which suggests a fresh increase. It is currently approaching a weekly resistance. Following last week‚Äôs bounce that brought some notable price recovery among many altcoins, DOT stayed well above the crucial $3 level and posted little gains during that period as it temporarily suspended selling. Facing resistance on the way up, it lost steam and fell slightly to $3.5 on Wednesday. The price picked up again and increased to where it is changing hands at $3.7. Amid increasing volume, it is on the verge of breaking last week‚Äôs high with a bullish pattern on the lower timeframe. The bullish pattern, which looks like a double-bottom formation on the hourly chart, signals a potential short-term trend shift. While it is yet to be confirmed, there are several obstacles ahead even if the price breaks up. The closest key resistance level to watch for a shift is $6. If the recent gains roll back, especially below the current monthly low, we can expect more collapses. Currently, the bulls are gaining control.

Executives from Braiscompany, the orchestrators of a massive crypto fraud scheme, have been slapped with a staggering 171 years in prison. This isn‚Äôt just a slap on the wrist; it‚Äôs a decisive blow against those who prey on unsuspecting investors in the burgeoning digital asset space. What Exactly Was the Braiscompany Crypto Fraud? Braiscompany, once hailed as a promising name in the Brazilian crypto scene, turned out to be a wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing. They lured in approximately 20,000 investors with tantalizing promises of high returns. Imagine being promised financial freedom, only to find out it was all built on lies and deceit. The scheme, which prosecutors are calling one of Brazil‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency scam cases, involved: False Promises: Braiscompany aggressively marketed unrealistic returns on crypto investments, painting a rosy picture of guaranteed profits. Embezzlement: Instead of legitimate investment activities, funds were allegedly siphoned off, enriching the executives at the expense of ordinary investors. Unlicensed Operations: Operating as an unlicensed financial institution, Braiscompany bypassed regulatory safeguards designed to protect investors. Money Laundering: Efforts were made to conceal the ill-gotten gains, further complicating the recovery process for victims. The scale of the deception is immense, with an estimated $190 million vanishing into thin air, leaving thousands financially devastated. This case serves as a stark reminder of the risks lurking within the often-unregulated corners of the crypto market. Who Are the Masterminds Behind the Braiscompany Scandal and What Were Their Sentences? Justice, albeit delayed, has finally been served. The Brazilian court didn‚Äôt mince words, handing down hefty sentences to the key players in the Braiscompany saga: Executive Role Sentence Charges Joel Ferreira de Souza Alleged Mastermind 128 years Running unlicensed financial institution, money laundering Gesana Rayane Silva Fund Manager 27 years Managing funds in the fraudulent scheme Victor Veronez Intermediary 15 years Acting as an intermediary in the scheme Joel Ferreira de Souza, deemed the mastermind, received the lion‚Äôs share of the punishment. His 128-year sentence reflects the severity of his crimes and the central role he played in orchestrating this elaborate investment fraud . The sentences for Silva and Veronez, while shorter, are still substantial, highlighting that all participants in such schemes will face consequences. Brazil Crypto Landscape: Is This an Isolated Incident? While the Braiscompany case is undoubtedly a major event, it raises questions about the broader Brazil crypto landscape. Is this an isolated incident, or are there systemic issues that need addressing? It‚Äôs crucial to understand that while Brazil has seen growing interest and adoption of cryptocurrencies, the regulatory framework is still evolving. This creates opportunities for bad actors to exploit loopholes and prey on investors. However, this case also demonstrates that Brazilian authorities are taking crypto-related fraud seriously. The lengthy sentences signal a strong intent to protect investors and maintain the integrity of the financial system, even in the face of novel digital challenges. This could be a turning point, encouraging stricter regulations and increased vigilance within the Brazilian crypto market. Lessons Learned: How to Protect Yourself from Crypto Investment Fraud The Braiscompany scandal serves as a painful but vital lesson for anyone venturing into the world of crypto investments. How can you avoid becoming the next victim of a crypto fraud ? Do Your Due Diligence: Thoroughly research any crypto investment opportunity. Are the promised returns realistic? Is the company registered and regulated? Look for independent reviews and audits. Be Wary of Guaranteed Returns: In the volatile world of crypto, nothing is guaranteed. Promises of fixed, high returns should be a major red flag. Understand the Investment: Don‚Äôt invest in something you don‚Äôt understand. If you can‚Äôt explain how the investment works, it‚Äôs best to stay away. Diversify Your Investments: Never put all your eggs in one basket, especially in a high-risk asset class like crypto. Seek Professional Advice: Consult with a qualified financial advisor before making significant crypto investments. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The allure of quick riches can be strong, but caution and informed decision-making are your best defenses against crypto scams. Conclusion: Justice Served, Warning Sounded The Braiscompany sentencing is more than just a legal outcome; it‚Äôs a powerful statement. It shows that even in the decentralized and often murky world of cryptocurrencies, justice can prevail. This case sends a clear warning to would-be fraudsters: the long arm of the law will reach you, and the consequences will be severe. For investors, it‚Äôs a sobering reminder to exercise caution, conduct thorough research, and remain vigilant in the face of enticing but potentially dangerous crypto investment opportunities.

Blocksquare, a leading name in real estate tokenization infrastructure, has just announced a groundbreaking partnership that‚Äôs set to inject a massive $1 billion into the digital real estate market. Teaming up with Vera Capital, a prominent venture capital firm, Blocksquare is poised to transform how we invest in property. Let‚Äôs dive into what this sensational collaboration means for the future of real estate. What is Real Estate Tokenization and Why is it a Game Changer? Before we delve deeper into this exciting partnership, let‚Äôs understand the core concept: real estate tokenization . In simple terms, it‚Äôs the process of converting rights to a real estate asset into digital tokens on a blockchain. Think of it as creating digital shares of a property. This innovative approach unlocks a plethora of benefits that traditional real estate investment simply can‚Äôt offer: Fractional Ownership: Imagine owning a piece of a prime commercial building in New York City without needing millions of dollars. Tokenization allows for fractional ownership, making high-value properties accessible to a wider range of investors. Increased Liquidity: Real estate is notoriously illiquid. Selling a property can take months, even years. Tokenized real estate, on the other hand, can be traded much more easily on secondary markets, offering significantly improved liquidity. Reduced Barriers to Entry: Traditionally, investing in real estate comes with high minimum investment amounts, complex paperwork, and geographical limitations. Tokenization drastically reduces these barriers, opening up global investment opportunities with lower entry points. Transparency and Security: Blockchain technology, the backbone of tokenization, ensures transparency and security. All transactions are recorded on an immutable ledger, reducing fraud and increasing trust. Faster Transactions and Lower Costs: Tokenization streamlines the investment process, eliminating intermediaries and reducing transaction costs and time significantly. In essence, real estate tokenization democratizes real estate investment, making it more accessible, efficient, and transparent. It‚Äôs not just about digitizing assets; it‚Äôs about revolutionizing the entire real estate ecosystem. Blocksquare and Vera Capital: A Powerful Alliance in Digital Real Estate Now, let‚Äôs shine the spotlight on the key players in this game-changing partnership: Blocksquare and Vera Capital. Blocksquare is a well-established infrastructure provider specializing in real estate tokenization . They offer white-label solutions that empower real estate businesses to launch their own tokenization platforms. Their technology simplifies the complex process of tokenizing real estate assets, making it accessible for traditional players to enter the digital real estate space. Vera Capital , on the other hand, is a venture capital firm with a keen focus on identifying and investing in innovative real estate ventures. Their expertise lies in understanding market trends and backing projects with significant growth potential. Their foray into tokenized real estate with Blocksquare signals a strong belief in the transformative power of this technology. Together, Blocksquare and Vera Capital create a synergistic alliance. Blocksquare brings the technological prowess and proven infrastructure, while Vera Capital contributes the financial backing and market insights. This partnership isn‚Äôt just about tokenizing assets; it‚Äôs about building a robust and thriving digital real estate marketplace. Unveiling the $1 Billion Tokenized Real Estate Vision The headline figure ‚Äì $1 billion ‚Äì is certainly attention-grabbing, but what exactly does it entail? According to the announcement on X (formerly Twitter) and reported by Investing.com, Vera Capital will leverage Blocksquare‚Äôs technology to tokenize a diverse portfolio of commercial and multifamily real estate assets across the United States. This isn‚Äôt just a small pilot project; it‚Äôs a large-scale initiative aimed at bringing substantial tokenized real estate offerings to the market. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what we know: Aspect Details Partnership Blocksquare & Vera Capital Asset Value $1 Billion Asset Type Commercial and Multifamily Real Estate Geographic Focus United States Technology Provider Blocksquare (White-label solution) Marketplace Operator Vera Capital (Developing its own digital marketplace) Vera Capital will be developing its own digital real estate marketplace, powered by Blocksquare‚Äôs technology. This means they are not just passively investing in tokenization; they are actively building an ecosystem to facilitate the trading and management of these tokenized real estate assets. This commitment to creating a dedicated marketplace is a strong indicator of their long-term vision for real estate tokenization . The Compelling Benefits of Tokenized Real Estate: Why Should You Care? The partnership between Blocksquare and Vera Capital is more than just a business deal; it‚Äôs a significant leap forward for the entire real estate tokenization movement. But what are the tangible benefits, and why should investors, real estate professionals, and even casual observers be excited? Democratization of Investment: As mentioned earlier, tokenization breaks down the barriers to entry in real estate investment. This partnership will likely lead to a wider range of tokenized real estate offerings becoming available, allowing smaller investors to participate in potentially lucrative deals that were previously out of reach. New Investment Opportunities: For investors seeking diversification, tokenized real estate provides a novel asset class. It offers exposure to the real estate market with the added benefits of blockchain technology ‚Äì transparency, liquidity, and fractional ownership. Efficiency and Streamlining for Real Estate Businesses: For real estate companies, adopting real estate tokenization can lead to increased efficiency in fundraising, property management, and investor relations. Blocksquare‚Äôs white-label solution makes this transition smoother and more accessible. Innovation and Growth in the Real Estate Sector: This partnership injects significant capital and innovation into the real estate industry. By embracing digital real estate , traditional players are future-proofing their businesses and contributing to the evolution of the sector. Essentially, the rise of tokenized real estate promises to create a more inclusive, efficient, and dynamic real estate market, benefiting everyone from individual investors to large institutions. Navigating the Challenges and Considerations in Real Estate Tokenization While the potential of real estate tokenization is immense, it‚Äôs crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that come with this nascent technology. It‚Äôs not a completely frictionless process, and understanding the hurdles is essential for responsible growth. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory framework for tokenized real estate is still evolving globally. Clarity and standardization in regulations are needed to foster wider adoption and investor confidence. Businesses operating in this space must navigate varying legal requirements across different jurisdictions. Technological Complexity: While platforms like Blocksquare simplify the process, real estate tokenization still involves technological complexities. Ensuring security, scalability, and interoperability of platforms is paramount. Market Education and Adoption: Educating investors and the broader real estate market about the benefits and nuances of tokenized real estate is crucial for driving adoption. Overcoming skepticism and fostering understanding are key challenges. Valuation and Liquidity of Tokens: Establishing robust valuation methods for tokenized real estate and ensuring sufficient liquidity in secondary markets are ongoing efforts. Market maturity and wider participation will play a vital role in addressing these aspects. Despite these challenges, the momentum behind real estate tokenization is undeniable. As the industry matures and regulatory clarity emerges, many of these hurdles are expected to be overcome, paving the way for mainstream adoption. The Future is Digital: Real Estate Investment in the Tokenized Era The partnership between Blocksquare and Vera Capital is a powerful signal ‚Äì the future of real estate investment is increasingly digital real estate . Real estate tokenization is not just a fleeting trend; it‚Äôs a fundamental shift in how we perceive, invest in, and manage property. This $1 billion initiative is likely to be just the tip of the iceberg. Looking ahead, we can anticipate: Increased Institutional Adoption: As the market matures and regulatory frameworks become clearer, we can expect to see greater participation from institutional investors in tokenized real estate . Growth of Secondary Markets: Robust and liquid secondary markets for tokenized real estate will emerge, further enhancing liquidity and investor confidence. Integration with DeFi and Web3: We can expect to see greater integration of tokenized real estate with the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 ecosystems, opening up new possibilities for yield generation and innovative financial products. Global Expansion: The success of initiatives like the Blocksquare-Vera Capital partnership will likely spur similar projects globally, accelerating the worldwide adoption of real estate tokenization . The convergence of real estate and blockchain technology is creating a paradigm shift. Real estate tokenization is poised to unlock unprecedented opportunities for investors, developers, and the entire real estate industry, ushering in a new era of accessibility, efficiency, and innovation. Conclusion: A Billion-Dollar Bet on the Future of Real Estate The collaboration between Blocksquare and Vera Capital to tokenize $1 billion in US real estate is a monumental step forward for the digital real estate revolution. It showcases the growing confidence in real estate tokenization and its potential to reshape the investment landscape. This partnership is not just about tokenizing assets; it‚Äôs about building the infrastructure and ecosystem for a future where real estate investment is more accessible, transparent, and efficient for everyone.

Solana with its super fast transaction speeds and scalable network is making waves in DeFi and NFTs. Cardano is still standing out with its methodical and research driven approach and getting attention for its plans to expand smart contract capabilities. Ruvi AI, on the other hand is the platform that will merge blockchain with AI in a way that has never been done before. Introducing Ruvi AI Ruvi AI is not just another cryptocurrency project; it‚Äôs a superapp that will integrate AI powered tools seamlessly into the blockchain ecosystem. Whether you‚Äôre a creator, developer or entrepreneur this platform offers scalable and practical solutions. From automated content creation to advanced business optimization strategies Ruvi AI has tools for real world problems. At the heart of the Ruvi AI ecosystem is its native $RUVI token which gives access to premium AI tools, governance rights, passive income by staking it and possibility to earn tokens by training the AI models. Unlike speculative or meme driven tokens Ruvi AI‚Äôs functionality is rooted in real world use cases so it‚Äôs a project to watch. A Presale That Speaks Volumes Ruvi AI‚Äôs presale has already shown the project‚Äôs potential. Within just a few days Ruvi AI sold over 10 million tokens and raised more than $100,000 . This is a big deal and shows the confidence early investors have in the platform. But Ruvi AI isn‚Äôt stopping there. Early investors are rewarded generously for their faith in the project thanks to its VIP reward system . Unlocking VIP Tier 2 Rewards To attract both small and large scale contributors Ruvi AI offers multi tiered bonuses that makes participating in the presale even more attractive. Check out VIP Tier 2 .For an investment of $500 at $0.01 per token, participants get 50,000 $RUVI tokens . Investors in this tier also get a 40% bonus and get an additional 20,000 tokens . The token‚Äôs listing price is confirmed to be 0,07$ per token which will turn the initial investment of $500 into $4900 immediately. By the time Ruvi AI reaches its predicted post listing price of $1 , the total 70,000 tokens would be worth $70,000 which is a 13,900% ROI . This well thought out rewards program makes Ruvi AI accessible to all types of investors while giving substantial returns to those who get in early. A Gamified Leaderboard Incentive Beyond VIP rewards Ruvi AI adds a layer of fun with its leaderboard rewards program . Designed to recognize top contributors this program gives big bonuses to those who contribute the most during the presale. The Top 10 investors will get 500,000 $RUVI tokens each , valued at $35,000 based on the expected listing price. Other notable contributors like those in the Top 50 and Top 1,000 will get 250,000 tokens and 20,000 tokens respectively. This creates competition and a sense of community as investors try to maximize their stakes. Why Ruvi AI Stands Out Unlike many cryptocurrency projects Ruvi AI focuses on solving real problems rather than chasing trends. Its combination of blockchain and artificial intelligence makes it a dual force innovator offering tools to diverse industries to thrive in a digital world. Where other tokens rely on market sentiment Ruvi AI anchors its success on practicality and innovation. From its robust ecosystem to its presale model every part of Ruvi AI feels designed for long term relevance and impact. The Future of Blockchain and AI While Solana and Cardano are making headlines with their network advancements and scalability Ruvi AI is quietly building the future of blockchain utility.

A renewed wave of bullish sentiment has lifted the meme token off its recent lows, sparking optimism among traders targeting a return toward its previous highs. But while SHIB captures short-term headlines, seasoned investors are shifting their gaze to the DeFi market, particularly toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The altcoin MUTM presale is already live, and tokens are being sold for $0.025, and up to this point, the platform has raised $6.9 million. Over 8,400 investors are on board, and the majority expect the price to hit $0.03 in the next round. Investors in this round stand to gain up to 140% ROI when the token‚Äôs anticipated launch price of $0.06 is reached. This Ethereum-based protocol is quickly emerging as a serious 100x performer in the next bull run, with analysts projecting a possible surge to $6 in 2025, after launch. Mutuum Finance: A New DeFi Behemoth in the Making Mutuum Finance transforms the decentralized lending world through its exceptional dual borrowing system which drives broad market adoption. Mutuum Finance gained support from over 8,400 investors during its presale period which has resulted in raising $6.9 million for the project. Early adopters who participate in Phase 4 will benefit from monumental gains because the token price is $0.025 but Phase 5 will bring it to $0.03. According to experts MUTM has the potential to reach more than $6 by the end of this year beginning at its initial offering price of $0.06 due to its innovative lending system which addresses the growing requirements of DeFi platforms. The game-shifting model of Mutuum Finance drives its increasing popularity because it operates as a solid token although undervalued. A real-time leaderboard of the top 50 holders of MUTM has been activated by MUTM. Successful token holders who do not fall below their position will be rewarded with bonuses that amplify both their position value and long-term investment in MUTM. The growing interest of investors in utility-based projects over hype-based projects is indicative of MUTM‚Äôs success at being able to demonstrate profitable substance-based cryptocurrency projects. Disrupting DeFi Lending with a Two-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing the DeFi lending landscape with its innovative merge of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. The P2C model is enabling users to earn passive income by lending their USDT through automated liquidity pools managed by smart contracts. Users can now start direct Peer-to-Peer transactions without depending on third parties because of the P2P model which gives users total control over their assets. Mutuum Finance combines the P2P system with P2B to provide streamlining operations and profitable investment opportunities for users. Fueling Community Growth with Reward Programs To enhance its user base Mutuum Finance has established various incentive plans for acquisition. The platform devotes $100,000 to give ten investors each $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The platform provides rewards to users who successfully refer potential new users to join the platform. New users who join early receive extra advantages such as stake pool preferences as well as governance participation options and elite community communications which enhance their connection to the platform. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing signs of a bullish comeback, but savvy investors are eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the real 100x play for 2025. Currently priced at $0.025, with over $6.9 million raised and 8,400+ investors onboard, MUTM is gaining serious traction.

However, analyst Dr. Cat has warned that, contrary to public opinion, this development is bearish, not bullish, for the flagship crypto. In an X post, Dr. Cat stated that Bitcoin entering oversold levels is ‚Äúsuper-bearish‚Äù and overbought levels are ‚Äúsuper-bullish.‚Äù He explained that for the oscillator to reach oversold values, it means that the price action has been extremely bearish, indicating why investors are selling their holdings. Why Bitcoin Entering Oversold Levels Is Bearish The crypto analyst further remarked that Oscillators are range-bound indicators, so they can‚Äôt go beyond 0 and 100, as they are limited by their mathematical formulas. However, he added that the Bitcoin price can go lower or higher. Dr. Cat then alluded to Bitcoin‚Äôs bull markets, noting that all of them are in overbought territory on the weekly chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To Break $125,000 But Sell Everything In October, Analyst Warns The analyst stated that if an investor buys an oversold condition on a lower timeframe when Bitcoin‚Äôs higher timeframe is bullish, this is a good move. However, he remarked that whoever advises buying a weekly oversold chart based on the claim that it is bullish because it is oversold has no idea what they are talking about. He remarked that many altcoins are oversold on the higher timeframe and can remain oversold as they approach zero, where the analyst claims they are eventually headed. Dr. Cat also explained that in a bull market, oversold conditions on the daily chart may mark higher lows on the weekly or monthly chart. However, in a bear market, oversold conditions may persist or just lead to some consolidation before more downside. Dr. Cat then alluded to Quinten‚Äôs chart, which he said showed what daily oversold conditions led to one year earlier in different broader market conditions. The analyst cautioned that he wasn‚Äôt discussing whether Bitcoin is in a bull or bear market or where it is headed, but simply clarifying the misconception about oversold and overbought RSI. BTC‚Äôs Supply Overwhelming Demand At The Moment In an X post, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju revealed that Bitcoin‚Äôs supply is currently greater than its demand at the moment, providing a bearish outlook for the flagship crypto. This supports the idea of BTC being in oversold conditions right now, with holders selling their coins rather than buying.

For most of the past 15 years, buying every dip has worked. Brief recessions, including the 2020 downturn and the 2022 bear market, were followed by quick, strong rebounds. Anyone who started investing during that era might think that sell-offs are only temporary. ‚ÄúIf, anytime, there‚Äôs a sell‚Äëoff, it‚Äôs just a buying opportunity, why would you ever stop that?‚Äù Scott Sheridan said to MarketWatch . He added, ‚ÄúThese people have never seen a down move up until the last couple of weeks.‚Äù The latest shock came after the White House announced sweeping tariffs on April 2. From April 2 to April 7, the S&P 500 dropped 11 %, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid more than 10 %, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 12 %. On the other hand, the Cboe Volatility Index peaked near 52 on April 8, and on April 9, the S&P 500 logged its best single‚Äëday gain since 2008, jumping 9.5%, before slipping again in the following sessions. Small traders were on a buying spree despite Wall Street‚Äôs concerns over the economic impact of tariffs JPMorgan data shows $21 billion in equities inflows between April 3 and April 16, far above normal levels. April 3 alone drew $4.7 billion, the largest single‚Äëday haul the bank has recorded. JPMorgan says the urge to buy the dip has grown stronger since 2022. Retail flows increased after Trump‚Äôs April 2 tariff announcement. Source: BNY ‚ÄúRetail has been continuously buying dips since the pandemic,‚Äù said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial. ‚ÄúBut that trade worked out great. It has not broken until now, where maybe they bought the first 3% to 5% down, and now they‚Äôre underwater.‚Äù Bob Savage, head of markets macro strategy at BNY, warned that the strategy can fail. ‚ÄúOutsized moves down have a tipping point linked to volatility and the state of the economy,‚Äù he wrote, adding that the rest of April depends on how the Federal Open Market Committee responds. ‚ÄúThe history of 2008 trading suggests you need a bigger policy to turn the dip to work.‚Äù Turnquist noted that if investors buy the first dip and the market keeps sliding or recovers slowly, they sit on losses for an unknown period. No one can forecast when the next rebound will arrive. Sheridan used a rubber band example. Stretch it and it snaps back, stretch it again and it snaps back again. That has been the pattern for years. In 2024 alone, the S&P 500 set 57 record closes, about one every 4.4 trading days. Yet rubber bands can break. Sheridan, who traded through the crashes of 1987, 2000, and 2008, worries the next prolonged slump will shock newcomers. ‚ÄúPeople who only began investing during the past 15 years have yet to experience something like that,‚Äù he said. Heavy dip buyers are at risk of steeper losses Trading platform Public reported a jump in customers moving money out of high‚Äëyield cash accounts to buy stocks. Sam Nofzinger, Public‚Äôs general manager of crypto and brokerage, said, ‚ÄúPeople have been sitting on mountains of cash for the past year and finally see [an opportunity to invest],‚Äù. A deeper recession would not only drive prices lower; it could threaten jobs and incomes, slicing the money that fuels dip buying. ‚ÄúYou really need a dot‚Äëcom or global financial crisis kind of situation for that to unfold,‚Äù Turnquist said. ‚ÄúAnd who knows. That‚Äôs not in our playbook for this year or next year.‚Äù Whenever the next severe downturn arrives, heavy dip‚Äëbuyers risk steeper losses and, Sheridan fears, may quit the market altogether. Still, he remains optimistic about the long run. ‚ÄúThe good news is the markets are resilient. The markets are going to come back in time. There is no doubt in my mind that we will be significantly higher in the markets in the next 5, 10, 15 or 20 years,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe question is, what does it look like before we get there?

The gloves are off as crypto giant Coinbase fiercely defends itself against a lawsuit from Oregon. Accusing the state of recycling discredited theories and undermining the push for clear federal rules, Coinbase is not backing down. Let‚Äôs dive into why this baseless lawsuit is making waves and what it means for the future of crypto regulations. Coinbase Lawsuit: A Clash Over Crypto Regulation Coinbase is hitting back hard against Oregon‚Äôs legal challenge, labeling it a ‚Äòbaseless attempt to revive discredited legal theories.‚Äô This strong language underscores the company‚Äôs frustration and determination to fight what it perceives as an unfair and outdated attack. But what exactly is Oregon alleging, and why is Coinbase so vehemently opposed? Oregon‚Äôs Claims: While the specifics of Oregon‚Äôs lawsuit haven‚Äôt been detailed in the initial reports, Coinbase suggests the state is attempting to apply outdated legal frameworks to the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency. Coinbase‚Äôs Defense: Coinbase argues that these legal theories have already been rejected by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), implying a lack of merit in Oregon‚Äôs approach. Undermining Federal Efforts: A key part of Coinbase‚Äôs argument is that this lawsuit disrupts the ongoing bipartisan efforts in Washington D.C. to establish clear and consistent federal crypto regulations . This legal battle isn‚Äôt just about Coinbase and Oregon; it‚Äôs a microcosm of the larger struggle to define and regulate the crypto industry in the United States. The outcome could set precedents and influence how other states and federal agencies approach crypto regulation in the future. Why ‚ÄòBaseless Lawsuit‚Äô is Coinbase‚Äôs Key Argument Coinbase‚Äôs repeated use of the term ‚Äòbaseless lawsuit‚Äô isn‚Äôt just rhetoric; it‚Äôs a strategic legal and public relations move. By framing the Oregon lawsuit as lacking foundation, Coinbase aims to: Discredit the Claims: Immediately cast doubt on the legitimacy of Oregon‚Äôs legal action in the eyes of the public and the broader crypto community. Rally Support: Position itself as a victim of overreach, potentially garnering support from industry stakeholders, investors, and even crypto-friendly lawmakers. Strengthen Legal Position: Signal a strong defense and potentially influence the court‚Äôs perception of the case from the outset. The ‚Äòbaseless‚Äô label is a powerful tool to control the narrative and put pressure on Oregon to justify its legal challenge. It‚Äôs a clear indication that Coinbase intends to fight this case aggressively. The SEC Crypto Factor: A History of Discredited Theories? Coinbase‚Äôs statement that Oregon is trying to revive legal theories ‚Äòpreviously abandoned by the U.S. SEC‚Äô is particularly noteworthy. This alludes to past instances where the SEC may have explored certain regulatory approaches to crypto, only to later move away from them. This could mean Oregon is: Using Old Playbooks: Potentially relying on legal interpretations that the federal regulator, the SEC, has deemed ineffective or inappropriate for the current crypto landscape. Ignoring Industry Evolution: Failing to recognize the advancements and changes within the crypto industry since these older theories were considered and possibly discarded. Creating Regulatory Conflict: Risking a conflict with federal regulatory trends if Oregon‚Äôs approach diverges significantly from the SEC‚Äôs current stance on SEC crypto regulation. Understanding the specific SEC theories Coinbase is referencing will be crucial in assessing the validity of their ‚Äòbaseless lawsuit‚Äô claim. It highlights the complexity of navigating state versus federal regulation in the rapidly evolving crypto space. Crypto Regulations in the Crosshairs: Federal vs. State The Coinbase-Oregon standoff throws a spotlight on the ongoing tension between state and federal oversight of crypto regulations . Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key issues: Issue Federal Approach State Approach (Example: Oregon Lawsuit) Consistency Aims for uniform rules across the nation, preventing a patchwork of conflicting state laws. Can lead to regulatory fragmentation, making it harder for crypto businesses to operate nationally. Innovation Ideally balances consumer protection with fostering innovation and growth in the crypto sector. Risk of stifling innovation if state regulations are overly restrictive or misinformed about crypto technology. Expertise Federal agencies like the SEC and CFTC are developing specialized expertise in crypto regulation. State regulators may have varying levels of crypto expertise, potentially leading to less informed regulations. Political Landscape Subject to federal legislative processes, often slower but potentially more comprehensive and bipartisan. State regulations can be influenced by local political climates and may not align with national or global trends. Coinbase‚Äôs argument about undermining bipartisan federal efforts emphasizes the industry‚Äôs preference for a unified national framework for crypto regulations . They believe that a state-by-state approach, especially one perceived as ‚Äòbaseless‚Äô or outdated, creates unnecessary hurdles and uncertainty. What‚Äôs Next for Coinbase and Oregon? Coinbase has made it clear: they will ‚Äòfight the case‚Äô while maintaining normal operations in Oregon. This legal battle could unfold in several ways: Court Proceedings: Expect a potentially lengthy legal process involving filings, arguments, and possibly appeals. SettlementÁöÑÂèØËÉΩÊÄß: While Coinbase is projecting a strong stance, settlements are always a possibility in litigation, although unlikely given the strong rhetoric. Legislative Impact: This case could further fuel the debate in Washington about the need for federal crypto legislation, potentially adding urgency to bipartisan efforts. Industry-Wide Implications: The outcome will be closely watched by the entire crypto industry, as it could influence future regulatory challenges and the balance of power between state and federal authorities. A Fight for the Future of Crypto Regulation The Coinbase-Oregon lawsuit is more than just a legal dispute between a company and a state. It‚Äôs a significant battleground in the larger war over how cryptocurrency will be regulated in the United States. Coinbase‚Äôs aggressive defense and its framing of the Oregon lawsuit as ‚Äòbaseless‚Äô signal a determination to push back against what it sees as misguided and obstructive state-level actions. As this case progresses, it will undoubtedly shape the ongoing conversation about crypto regulation and the future of the digital asset industry.

This happened just a few days after the attack was discovered. Instead of using legal threats or launching an investigation, KiloEx tried a different method. This method could set a precedent and change how similar cases are handled. How the Hack Happened On April 14, Cyvers, a blockchain security firm, detected a serious breach on KiloEx. The main problem came from the platform‚Äôs price oracle, a tool that gives price updates to the exchange. Sadly, the attacker found a way to manipulate this tool. The attacker exploited the system‚Äôs weakness and took advantage of price differences on several blockchains, like BNB, Base, and Taiko. The bad actor siphoned the stolen funds through a wallet on Tornado Cash, a crypto-mixing platform often used for money laundering and hiding stolen funds. The wallet used in the hack received money through Tornado Cash. Tornado Cash is a tool that mixes different crypto transactions to hide where the money comes from. Hackers and criminals often use it to cover their tracks and move stolen money without being caught. This got people worried that the money might be lost forever. However, KiloEx did not give up. Hacker Returns $7.5M, Gets $750,000 Reward Soon after the breach, KiloEx made an unusual proposal. The exchange told the attacker that if the money were returned, it would receive 10% as a reward. This kind of reward, often called a bounty , is typically offered to white-hat hackers, who are ethical hackers who help expose security flaws without harming others. To everyone‚Äôs surprise, the attacker returned all the stolen funds. KiloEx said it would be true to its word and give the hacker 10% of the recovered amount, which amounts to $750,000. The company said the reward was a way of thanking the individual for helping improve its security. KiloEx Solves Hack Issue with No Legal Battle Rather than press charges or open a legal case, KiloEx said it considers the issue resolved. The company praised the outcome and emphasized building trust with ethical hackers. The exchange believes that working with security experts is a better way to protect users and grow stronger as a platform. So far this year, hackers and exploiters have stolen about $2 billion from different platforms. In most cases, the funds were never recovered, and the attackers vanished. Yu Xian, a respected figure in blockchain security, said the decision to return the funds and claim the bounty is rare and difficult. However, it might be the smartest option for hackers who realize the damage they could cause.

The report says the company‚Äôs main operator, Joel Ferreira de Souza, was handed a sentence of 128 years behind bars, while the other two perpetrators, Gesana Rayane Silva and Victor Augusto Veronez de Souza, were given sentences of 28 and 15 years, respectively. According to authorities, the trio promised ‚Äúexorbitant‚Äù returns on the crypto investments of their victims in order to initially get their funds and engaged in money laundering.

Mid Term Price Prediction For RENDER & TIA,https://bitzo.com/2025/04/render-celestia-kickstart-a-climb-will-the-rally-continue-mid-term-price-prediction-for-render-tia,"Render and Celestia have started showing signs of upward movement in the crypto market. Traders and investors are watching closely, wondering if this momentum will keep building. This article dives into the details and provides a mid-term price forecast for RENDER and TIA, aiming to uncover which of these digital assets might be primed for significant growth. Crypto Price Snapshot and Technical Overview The RENDER experienced a 25% gain over the past month and a 17% boost within the last week. Over a six-month period, the price dropped by 25%, reflecting a mixed performance with sharp short-term rallies contrasted by a longer-term decline. These movements signify rapid shifts in sentiment where recent gains may indicate renewed interest, despite an overall weakness observed in the half-year view. The current trading zone ranges between $2.46 and $4.42, with a key support level at $1.52 and resistance near $5.43 along with a secondary resistance at $7.39. Price action appears delicate with no definitive trend, suggesting bulls may be cautiously testing gains while bears maintain pressure near lower levels. Traders might consider buying near support and monitoring resistance for potential exits. Celestia Price Outlook and Market Levels TIA showed a 26.12% decline over the last month and a 59.19% slide over the past six months, with a small weekly drop of 2.34%. Price moves have been steep and led to marked shifts in sentiment, with volatility defining its recent performance. Indicators point to fading momentum as the market adjusts, highlighting a clear downward trend during these intervals. Current trading sees Celestia moving between $2.31 and $4.17. Resistance sits near $5.28, with a second push expected around $7.14, while support is seen at $1.55. Bears hold sway for now, with the price failing to break higher and a lack of strong directional trend. Cautious trades within these levels could test resistance and find new support at the current key level. Conclusion The recent surge in RENDER and TIA signals a renewed interest in these coins. Market sentiment appears strong, driven by positive developments and community support. While current trends favor continued growth, monitoring broader market conditions is crucial. Both RENDER and TIA have shown potential, but their long-term performance will depend on sustained momentum and adoption. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It felt like every other company was going public via a Special Purpose Acquisition Company. Then, the hype faded, and SPACs seemed to lose their luster. But hold on ‚Äì could we be witnessing a surprising SPAC comeback ? Kodiak Robotics, a self-driving truck startup, is making headlines by choosing the SPAC route to the public market, merging with Ares Acquisition Corporation II. This bold move raises eyebrows, especially given the recent struggles and shutdowns in the autonomous vehicle sector, not to mention the generally shaky IPO landscape. Is this a lone wolf, or the start of a new SPAC wave? Let‚Äôs unpack this. Is the SPAC Comeback Really Happening? The big question on everyone‚Äôs mind: is the SPAC comeback real ? Kodiak Robotics‚Äô decision certainly suggests a pulse in the SPAC world. But it‚Äôs happening against a backdrop of considerable uncertainty in the broader IPO market. As highlighted on Bitcoin World‚Äôs Equity podcast, featuring Kirsten Korosec, Max Zeff, and Anthony Ha, the expected blockbuster IPO year of 2025 is looking less certain. Major players like Klarna and StubHub have pumped the brakes on their public debut plans. Investor Mark Goldberg even quipped that those waiting for a fintech IPO wave this year might be waiting a long time. So, why SPACs, and why now? Here‚Äôs a breakdown of factors at play: Uncertain IPO Market Conditions : Traditional IPOs require extensive roadshows and market confidence. In a volatile market, SPACs offer a potentially faster and more certain path to going public, even if it means negotiating valuation with a SPAC sponsor. SPACs Seeking Deals : Many SPACs raised capital during the boom and are now under pressure to find merger targets before their deadlines expire. This creates a supply of SPACs looking for companies, potentially making it an attractive option for private companies seeking liquidity. Kodiak Robotics‚Äô Bold Bet : For Kodiak, the SPAC route might offer access to capital and public markets at a time when traditional funding rounds are tougher to secure for autonomous vehicle companies, especially after the setbacks of Embark and TuSimple. However, it‚Äôs crucial to remember the challenges that led to the SPAC market cooling down in the first place: SPAC Performance History : Post-merger SPAC performance has often been lackluster, with many companies underperforming market expectations. This has made investors wary. Regulatory Scrutiny : Increased regulatory attention on SPACs has added complexity and potentially deterred some companies and investors. Market Saturation : The sheer volume of SPACs in 2021 led to deal fatigue and a decline in investor enthusiasm. Autonomous Vehicles and the IPO Landscape Kodiak Robotics operating in the autonomous vehicles space adds another layer of intrigue. This sector has faced significant headwinds recently. The closures of Embark and TuSimple, mentioned in the original article, underscore the capital-intensive and long-term nature of developing and deploying self-driving technology. Going public via SPAC could be a strategic move for Kodiak to secure funding and visibility in a challenging environment. However, investor sentiment towards autonomous vehicles is currently mixed. While the long-term potential is undeniable, the path to profitability and widespread adoption remains uncertain. Key Considerations for Kodiak Robotics‚Äô SPAC Move: Factor Potential Impact Market Sentiment for Autonomous Vehicles Could be a headwind if investors are still cautious about the sector‚Äôs near-term prospects. SPAC Partner (Ares Acquisition Corporation II) A strong and reputable SPAC sponsor can lend credibility and support to the deal. Valuation and Deal Terms Attractive valuation and deal terms are crucial to attract investors and ensure long-term success as a public company. Execution and Roadmap Clear execution plans and a realistic roadmap for commercialization will be vital to maintain investor confidence post-merger. Fintech IPOs: Still on Hold? The article also touches upon the broader fintech IPO landscape, quoting Mark Goldberg‚Äôs pessimistic view on an imminent wave. This context is important because it highlights the general hesitancy in the IPO market, not just for tech but specifically for fintech companies which were also darlings of the previous IPO boom. If even fintech giants are delaying public offerings, it underscores the challenging market conditions and makes Kodiak‚Äôs SPAC move even more noteworthy ‚Äì and potentially risky. Other Key Highlights from the Equity Podcast: AI Voices Everywhere : Imagine Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos‚Äôs AI voices guiding you at crosswalks. The podcast discussed the increasing pervasiveness of AI voices and its implications. Figma‚Äôs IPO Plans : The Equity crew is eagerly anticipating Figma‚Äôs S-1 filing, raising questions about its financials, growth strategy, and market positioning. Hugging Face‚Äôs Robotics Push : Hugging Face‚Äôs recent acquisition signals a deeper dive into humanoid robotics, expanding its AI footprint beyond software models. OpenAI‚Äôs Model Updates : Updates to OpenAI‚Äôs o3 and o4-mini models, and the anticipation for the grand GPT-5 launch, keep the AI world buzzing with excitement. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope or a False Dawn? Kodiak Robotics‚Äô SPAC merger is undoubtedly a significant event. Whether it signals a true SPAC comeback or is merely an outlier remains to be seen. It‚Äôs a bold move in an uncertain market, particularly for the autonomous vehicle sector. The broader IPO landscape is still hesitant, especially for fintech, suggesting that any SPAC revival might be selective and dependent on specific company strengths and market conditions. Keep a close watch on how Kodiak‚Äôs SPAC deal progresses and whether other companies follow suit ‚Äì it could be a crucial indicator for the future of SPACs and the IPO market in general.
