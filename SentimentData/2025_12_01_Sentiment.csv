Every cycle shows that early buyers claim the highest rewards while others get in too late. Right now, Apeing is capturing this exact moment because it is the top upcoming crypto presale in the market. Bitcoin and Cardano are strong long-term assets, but their early growth windows closed long ago. Apeing is different. It is fresh, limited, and quickly becoming one of the top crypto coins discussed among early-stage investors searching for high-potential altcoins before the crowd catches on. Apeing (APEING): The Upcoming Crypto Presale With A High Demand Whitelist Apeing is gaining massive momentum because it offers something extremely rare now. A restricted whitelist with limited Stage 1 access. Only a fixed number of investors are allowed in which creates instant scarcity and urgency. Those who secure early positions are entering before presale hype reaches the wider market. Because Apeing is still an upcoming crypto presale, it offers the kind of early entry advantage that the best new altcoins historically delivered before going mainstream. Investors want ground-floor access, and Apeing is giving that opportunity right now. As more people learn about the project, whitelist spots continue to fill quickly, increasing pressure to lock a position before it closes. How To Join The Apeing Whitelist Joining the Apeing whitelist is simple but extremely time-sensitive. Follow the steps below before all spots are taken. Visit the official Apeing website: This is where all whitelist registrations take place. Enter your email address: Provide your email address and be among the first to get presale updates.

It is widely recognised as a store of value due to its limited supply, global acceptance, and long history of successful adoption. Many investors view Bitcoin as the safest entry point into the digital asset space because it has proven itself through multiple market cycles. However, Bitcoin is no longer a ground-level opportunity because its early exponential growth phase has already passed. It continues to attract institutional investors who value long-term security and reliability rather than speculative growth. While BTC offers stability and strong liquidity, it is often seen as a foundational asset rather than a high-risk, high-reward pick. It remains a leader, but newer altcoins carry more potential for explosive gains. Secure Your Apeing Tokens Before It’s Too Late! Bitcoin is established. Cardano is steady. But neither provides the early entry advantage that Apeing is offering today. If you are searching for a genuine early-stage opportunity, the Apeing whitelist is the one moment you cannot ignore.

The rating agency’s decision to slash USDT’s stability rating to its lowest level has sparked a fierce response from the stablecoin giant, revealing massive financial numbers that challenge the downgrade rationale. Why Did S&P Downgrade Tether’s Stability Rating? S&P recently made the controversial move to downgrade USDT to a “vulnerable” rating level five. The agency explained that the stablecoin no longer maintained sufficient buffer protection against potential declines in Bitcoin’s value. However, this Tether S&P downgrade assessment appears to have overlooked critical financial data that Tether’s leadership claims tells a different story entirely. The rating agency’s decision focuses primarily on Bitcoin exposure risks. Meanwhile, Tether’s CEO argues that the company’s diverse asset portfolio and substantial profits provide much stronger protection than S&P acknowledged. This disagreement highlights the ongoing challenge of applying traditional financial rating systems to innovative cryptocurrency products. What Massive Numbers Did Tether Reveal? Ardoino pointed to Tether’s audited third-quarter 2025 report to counter the Tether S&P downgrade . The numbers he revealed are truly impressive: Total assets: $215 billion Stablecoin reserves: $184.5 billion Excess equity: $7 billion Retained earnings: $23 billion These figures demonstrate substantial financial strength that Ardoino believes S&P improperly ignored. The $30 billion combination of excess equity and retained earnings alone represents a significant buffer that could absorb market fluctuations. How Does This Affect Crypto Investors? The Tether S&P downgrade controversy matters deeply for every cryptocurrency participant. Stablecoins like USDT serve as crucial bridges between traditional finance and digital assets. When rating agencies question their stability, it creates uncertainty throughout the entire ecosystem. However, Tether’s strong financial disclosure provides reassurance to users concerned about the downgrade. The company’s massive asset base and profitable operations suggest stronger fundamentals than the rating implies. This disconnect between S&P’s assessment and Tether’s actual financial position creates an important discussion point for investors. For daily traders and long-term holders alike, understanding this Tether S&P downgrade situation helps make informed decisions about stablecoin usage and risk management strategies. What’s Next for Tether and Stablecoin Regulation? This Tether S&P downgrade incident highlights growing tensions between traditional financial institutions and cryptocurrency companies. As stablecoins become increasingly important to global finance, such conflicts will likely become more common. Tether’s strong response signals that cryptocurrency companies won’t passively accept traditional financial assessments they consider inaccurate. The company’s willingness to publicly challenge SGP’s methodology shows growing confidence in their financial position and transparency efforts. Moving forward, we can expect continued debates about how to properly evaluate stablecoin safety. The outcome of these discussions will shape cryptocurrency regulation and adoption for years to come. Conclusion: A Story of Two Perspectives The Tether S&P downgrade controversy represents a classic clash between traditional financial assessment and innovative digital asset models. While S&P applies established rating criteria, Tether points to concrete financial data that tells a different story. The company’s $215 billion in assets and $30 billion in combined excess equity and retained earnings provide substantial evidence supporting their stability claims. For cryptocurrency users, this situation underscores the importance of looking beyond surface-level ratings and understanding the underlying financial reality. Tether’s transparent disclosure of their strong financial position offers valuable insights for making informed decisions in the dynamic digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly did S&P downgrade about Tether? S&P downgraded USDT’s stability rating to level five, their lowest rating, classifying the stablecoin as “vulnerable” due to concerns about insufficient buffer against Bitcoin value declines. How much assets does Tether actually have? According to their Q3 2025 audited report, Tether holds $215 billion in total assets, including $184.5 billion in stablecoin reserves, $7 billion in excess equity, and $23 billion in retained earnings. Why does Tether disagree with the downgrade? Tether’s CEO argues that S&P failed to properly consider the company’s massive asset base, profitability, and substantial financial buffers that provide strong protection against market fluctuations. Should I be worried about holding USDT? While ratings provide one perspective, Tether’s disclosed financial strength suggests stronger fundamentals than the downgrade implies. However, always conduct your own research and risk assessment. How often do rating agencies review stablecoins? Rating agencies typically review financial instruments periodically, but major events or significant changes can trigger additional assessments outside regular schedules. What makes this Tether S&P downgrade different? This case is notable because Tether is publicly challenging the methodology and providing substantial financial data that contradicts the rating agency’s assessment. Found this analysis helpful?

The Avatar director’s strong stance against AI-generated content comes as he prepares to release the latest installment in his groundbreaking franchise, creating a fascinating contradiction between his embrace of cutting-edge visual effects and his rejection of artificial intelligence in creative processes. Why James Cameron Fears Generative AI Technology During a recent CBS Sunday Morning interview promoting ‘Avatar: Fire and Ash,’ James Cameron drew a clear line between his use of performance capture and what he considers the dangerous territory of generative AI. While both involve digital creation, Cameron emphasized they represent fundamentally different approaches to storytelling. ‘For years, there was this sense that, ‘Oh they’re doing something strange with computers, and they’re replacing actors,” Cameron revealed. ‘When in fact, once you really drill down and you see what we’re doing, it’s a celebration of the actor-director moment.’ The Critical Difference: Performance Capture vs Generative AI James Cameron passionately explained why his Avatar technology represents the opposite of generative AI approaches. Performance capture, as used in the Avatar films, records real human performances that digital artists then use as templates. The CBS segment showcased cast members performing their underwater scenes in a massive 250,000-gallon water tank, demonstrating the human element at the core of the process. Performance Capture Generative AI Based on real actor performances Creates from text prompts Human-driven creative process Algorithm-generated content Director-actor collaboration No human performance required Celebrates human artistry Replaces human creativity Avatar Director’s Warning About AI Technology James Cameron’s concerns about generative AI extend beyond artistic integrity. ‘Go to the other end of the spectrum and you’ve got generative AI, where they can make up a character, they can make up an actor, they can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt,’ Cameron stated. ‘No, that’s horrifying … That’s exactly what we’re not doing.’ His warning highlights the ethical and creative implications of AI technology that can generate complete performances without human input. The Future of Film Technology According to Cameron Despite his criticism of generative AI, James Cameron continues to push boundaries with film technology in the Avatar franchise. His approach demonstrates that technological advancement doesn’t require sacrificing human creativity. The key distinctions Cameron emphasizes include: Human performance as the foundation Director-led creative vision Collaboration between artists and technicians Technology enhancing rather than replacing Frequently Asked Questions About James Cameron and AI What is James Cameron’s background in film technology? James Cameron is known for pushing technological boundaries in films like Avatar , The Terminator , and Titanic . How does performance capture work in Avatar? Performance capture involves recording actors’ movements and expressions, which digital artists at companies like Weta Digital use to create the final Na’vi characters. What companies are leading in generative AI? Companies like OpenAI , Midjourney , and Stability AI are at the forefront of generative AI development. Where was the CBS interview conducted? The interview was part of CBS Sunday Morning programming tied to the Avatar: Fire and Ash release from Disney . James Cameron’s stark warning about generative AI serves as a crucial reminder that technological advancement must serve human creativity rather than replace it. As the entertainment industry grapples with AI’s rapid development, Cameron’s perspective offers valuable insight into maintaining artistic integrity while embracing innovation. His distinction between performance capture and generative AI highlights the importance of preserving human expression in an increasingly digital world.

The launch is one of the most significant developments in making AI computational power accessible to humans via a blockchain protocol. The new platform is powered by TON, a layer-1 blockchain heavily integrated into the Telegram ecosystem. It’s also designed to provide inexpensive, quick, and private AI computing — not from huge tech companies, but through a distributed network of graphics cards owned by regular people. Cocoon had already received its first live user requests, said Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov, confirming the launch. He also mentioned that GPU holders are currently minting Toncoin (TON) by leasing their mining facilities to the network. GPU providers earn as Cocoon begins processing live AI tasks Cocoon offers anyone with a graphics card the opportunity to rent out their processing power. AI workloads are computed on a decentralized, global GPU resource cloud whose capacity surpasses that of even the top commercial providers. The hardware provider earns Toncoin every time a task is processed, making the service more attractive to more participants. The system is designed to scale rapidly as additional GPUs join, meaning that Cocoon was built with the potential to evolve into as large and far-reaching an AI compute marketplace as possible. The new platform helps solve two of the biggest problems in the current AI ecosystem, Durov said: the high costs and loss of privacy. Among these are the advantages of centralized providers, such as Amazon and Microsoft . They own the infrastructure, set prices, and have access to user data, which many users and privacy advocates say is a dangerous prospect. Cocoon flips that model. It maintains data encrypted everywhere, including during processing, so that GPU providers can’t see what they are computing. This ensures that users’ questions are kept secure, along with training data and final outputs, making Cocoon one of the most privacy-oriented AI networks available to the public. Cocoon strengthens privacy-first AI with blockchain-powered compute The launch is coming as governments, technologists, and civil society organizations become increasingly concerned about the strength of centralized AI. Critics argue that when a small number of companies manage AI models and compute resources, they have the power to manipulate social behavior, compromise cybersecurity, and violate human rights. Decentralized AI projects are similar to Cocoon in that they aim to help mitigate those risks. They shard toward tens of thousands of untrusted nodes and log activity on an open blockchain. It does offer tamper-evident records, mutable data sources, and a trustless relay of information between nodes. Cocoon is also being funded with a substantial amount of money for development. Tech funds backing the TON project have pledged massive GPU farms to boost the network’s throughput. This is how Cocoon can tackle heavier AI workloads, such as large language model queries, video processing, and ML tasks more generally. Worldwide, there’s a growing desire for AI to be less centralized. Most people these days want to believe that decentralized AI will be more just than the centralized internet’s algorithms. Though most folks already feel that way, the first single from Cocoon’s debut album further normalizes that sentiment. Cocoon aims to reimagine how AI infrastructure is built. Rather than giving the giants control, it gives back to users (who provide the hardware) and their profits. If the adoption continues, Cocoon could become one of the initial instances of what it calls “community-owned AI,” where regular people control computing power, privacy, and rewards.

The Shibtoken team has now confirmed that Zama’s Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) will be natively integrated into the Layer-2 network in 2026. The move positions Shibarium as one of the first EVM-compatible ecosystems to adopt full-stack, on-chain privacy at the protocol level. This is not a minor update. FHE is one of the most advanced forms of cryptography in development today. It enables computations to run directly on encrypted data without exposing the underlying information. No decryption. No leakage. No workarounds. Just end-to-end encrypted execution. If delivered as planned, Shibarium becomes a privacy-first chain built for institutions, DeFi builders, and high-security applications, without sacrificing EVM access. The confirmation was shared by @Shibtoken, with rollout and technical details reinforced by @CryptoMiners_Co. A Major Milestone: Shibarium Commits to Native FHE For months, the community speculated whether Shibarium would adopt deeper encryption standards or stick to traditional EVM privacy layers. Today, the team made it official: Zama’s FHE becomes part of Shibarium’s core infrastructure. With this upgrade, Shibarium gains capabilities that most blockchains still consider experimental. #Shibarium Confirms Native FHE Integration in 2026 The @Shibtoken team has officially confirmed that @zama ’s Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) will be natively integrated into #Shibarium , delivering institutional grade on chain privacy. Key features of the upgrade: – Fully… pic.twitter.com/j6MJNEvHFX — Crypto Miners (@CryptoMiners_Co) November 30, 2025 Key features confirmed: Fully encrypted transactions from end to end Confidential smart contracts, shielding logic, inputs, and outputs Private DeFi with hidden balances and algorithmic logic Privacy-preserving governance, including confidential voting Encrypted gaming mechanics, enabling advanced data-sensitive gameplay In simple terms: users, builders, and institutions can perform complex actions on-chain without revealing their data. This sets Shibarium apart from typical privacy layers that rely on mixers, sidechains, or zero-knowledge workarounds. FHE operates directly on encrypted data at the VM level, offering a level of privacy closer to enterprise-grade systems. Why FHE Matters: A Breakthrough Long in the Making While zero-knowledge proofs have dominated crypto’s privacy narrative, FHE adds a new dimension. Instead of verifying encrypted data, it enables blockchains to compute using encrypted data. It unlocks: Encrypted lending Private order flow Hidden asset positions Encrypted AI models on-chain Sensitive medical or identity-related apps For an ecosystem like Shibarium, with a community that prioritizes utility, security, and decentralization, FHE marks the transition into a new category of blockchain development. Shibarium is no longer just a fast Layer-2. It becomes one of the first privacy-native EVM chains. Development Roadmap: A Phased Rollout Into 2026 The integration won’t be rushed. The Shibtoken team published a clear development timeline outlining how FHE will reach full production. What’s already live Zama Public Testnet → Live now Developers are already testing encrypted smart contracts and encrypted function execution. Currently in progress Zama Ethereum Mainnet Deployment → Ongoing This ensures that FHE becomes compatible with the broader EVM environment before Shibarium adopts it. Early 2026 Full EVM-wide FHE Compatibility This is the point where EVM chains begin running encrypted computations without custom modifications. Q2 2026 Shibarium Mainnet Integration FHE becomes a native part of the Layer-2 protocol. Not an add-on. Not a module. Deep integration at the chain level. This structured rollout confirms that Shibarium is not experimenting, it’s building long-term infrastructure aligned with institutional standards. A Turning Point for Shibarium: From DeFi to Privacy Infrastructure The Shiba ecosystem has expanded rapidly over the past two years, with Shibarium becoming the centerpiece of its long-term strategy. Yet the network has lacked one core element, true privacy. This upgrade changes the narrative. What Shibarium becomes with FHE: A privacy-first EVM chain A secure environment for institutional workflows A home for private DeFi protocols A platform for encrypted gaming and AI A competitive alternative to traditional privacy chains Few networks have committed to full FHE adoption due to its complexity and heavy engineering requirements. Shibarium’s decision signals a shift in how L2s think about data protection, user ownership, and enterprise integration. Institutional Impact: The Upgrade They Were Waiting For While retail users celebrate new features, institutions see something else: compliance-friendly privacy. FHE offers: Encrypted compliance checks Hidden business logic Secure multi-party workflows Privacy-preserving transactions without mixing On-chain verifiability with zero disclosure Banks, corporate apps, data-sensitive dApps, and DeFi protocols can all operate without exposing strategic data publicly. This is a critical advantage that traditional blockchains struggle to provide. With Q2 2026 confirmed for Shibarium’s full integration, enterprise developers now have a clear timeline for their own deployments. A First for the Shiba Ecosystem The Shiba community has long emphasized innovation, from Shibarium to SHI, TREAT, and upcoming metaverse plans. But the FHE integration stands apart. It is: The most complex The most technically ambitious The most strategically important The shift transforms Shibarium from a scaling network into a privacy-native protocol with industry-grade cryptography at its core. It’s the kind of upgrade that can redefine an ecosystem’s identity. Testnets Pass, Audits Clear All major Zama test environments are already live. Security reviews, audits, and developer tests are active and progressing. The Shibtoken team confirmed that no major issues have been reported at the time of publication. The groundwork appears solid. Development pacing is steady. And with Ethereum mainnet compatibility progressing, Shibarium’s integration window is holding firm. The next major milestones include the finalization of Zama’s Ethereum deployment and the rollout of full EVM compatibility in early 2026. Once complete, Shibarium begins its integration ahead of a Q2 go-live target. If successful, Shibarium becomes one of the first EVM Layer-2 networks with native FHE support, leapfrogging competitors and anchoring itself as a privacy-driven chain ready for enterprise adoption. Shiba’s ecosystem enters a new era. A privacy era. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any services.

This shocking Yearn.finance exploit highlights the ongoing security challenges facing decentralized finance platforms and serves as a stark reminder for investors about the importance of protocol security. What Exactly Happened in the Yearn.finance Exploit? The attack targeted a critical vulnerability in the yETH index token system. Hackers discovered they could mint unlimited amounts of yETH tokens, essentially creating money out of thin air. This infinite minting capability allowed the attackers to drain the protocol’s liquid staking token pools systematically. The Yearn.finance exploit resulted in substantial losses before the team could respond. How Did the Attack Unfold Step by Step? The attackers executed their plan with precision. First, they identified the vulnerability in the yETH token contract. Then, they began minting unlimited yETH tokens without providing proper collateral. Finally, they exchanged these fraudulently created tokens for legitimate assets in the protocol’s pools. The entire Yearn.finance exploit demonstrates how sophisticated DeFi attacks have become. What Were the Immediate Consequences? Following the successful attack, several key events occurred: Millions of dollars in liquid staking tokens were drained from Yearn.finance pools The attacker transferred 1,000 ETH to Tornado Cash for laundering Protocol developers scrambled to patch the vulnerability YFI token price experienced significant volatility Why Should DeFi Users Be Concerned? This Yearn.finance exploit raises serious questions about DeFi security. Even established protocols with substantial auditing can fall victim to sophisticated attacks.

The Yearn.finance exploit teaches us several crucial lessons about DeFi security. First, continuous auditing and monitoring are essential for all protocols. Second, bug bounty programs need to be sufficiently incentivized to attract white-hat hackers. Third, users should diversify their DeFi exposure rather than concentrating assets in single protocols. Most importantly, this Yearn.finance exploit demonstrates that the DeFi space still has maturing to do regarding security practices. How Can Investors Protect Themselves? While no approach guarantees complete safety, several strategies can help mitigate risks: Research protocols thoroughly before investing Diversify across multiple platforms to spread risk Monitor official channels for security updates Use hardware wallets for significant holdings Stay informed about recent vulnerabilities and exploits What’s Next for Yearn.finance and DeFi Security? The aftermath of this Yearn.finance exploit will likely lead to improved security measures across the DeFi ecosystem. Protocols may implement more rigorous testing procedures and enhanced monitoring systems. The incident serves as a catalyst for the industry to address security concerns more proactively. However, the fundamental tension between innovation and security in DeFi will continue to present challenges. The Yearn.finance exploit represents a significant setback for the protocol but also provides valuable lessons for the entire DeFi community. As the space continues to evolve, security must remain a top priority for developers and users alike. While innovations in decentralized finance offer exciting opportunities, they come with responsibilities that cannot be overlooked. Frequently Asked Questions What is Yearn.finance? Yearn.finance is a decentralized finance protocol on Ethereum that provides yield aggregation services, helping users optimize their returns across various DeFi platforms. How much was stolen in the exploit? While exact figures vary, reports indicate millions of dollars worth of liquid staking tokens were drained from the protocol during the Yearn.finance exploit. Will affected users be compensated? Compensation plans vary by protocol. Users should monitor official Yearn.finance communications for updates on potential reimbursement programs. How can I check if my funds are safe? Review your wallet transactions and check Yearn.finance’s official channels for specific vulnerability details and affected pools.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000359. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000583 and an average trading price of $0.000560 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1? Overview Cryptocurrency Floki Inu Token FLOKI Price $0.00004832 Market Capitalization $465.87M Trading Volume $28.14M Circulating Supply 9.657T FLOKI All-time High $0.0003462 (Jun 05, 2024) All-time Low $0.00000002 (Aug 08, 2021) 24-hour High $0.00004902 24-hour Low $0.00004749 Floki Inu price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility (30-day Variation) 12.92% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $0.00006314 14-Day RSI 36.29 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 28 (Fear) Green Days 11/30 (37%) 200-Day SMA $0.00008425 Floki Inu price analysis Key Insights: FLOKI is compressing on the daily chart, hinting at a volatility breakout soon. The intraday structure is improving, but still fighting strong Alligator resistance. FLOKI on the daily timeframe FLOKI’s daily chart for November 30 shows price holding around $0.0000483–$0.0000485, sitting tightly inside a narrowing Bollinger Band range. This compression suggests an approaching volatility expansion, yet the bias remains cautiously neutral since the mid-band was rejected earlier around $0.0000511, which now acts as immediate resistance. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains negative but is flattening, indicating that selling momentum has eased. The Balance of Power, hovering near zero, reflects a temporary equilibrium between buyers and sellers. For now, a reclaim above $0.0000511 would signal a bullish shift and could open room toward $0.0000592. However, losing $0.0000430, which corresponds to the lower band area, would imply a downside volatility push toward $0.0000400. Price stability is present, but conviction is not yet visible. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour chart, FLOKI is crawling upward toward $0.0000484, yet the Alligator indicators remain stacked bearishly above price, showing the short-term trend is still technically downward. The RSI at 46–47 tells us the market is neither oversold nor overbought, matching the mild recovery candles forming after the earlier dip. PVT is stabilizing but hasn’t yet expanded upward, meaning volume-backed conviction is still lacking. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView If buyers push above the green Alligator line (~$0.0000488–$0.0000490), a short-term breakout can carry the price toward $0.0000496–$0.0000500, but failing to break that cluster would keep FLOKI in its slow grind. Immediate support sits at $0.0000472–$0.0000475, and losing it reopens the move toward $0.0000460. Floki Inu technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.00006563 SELL SMA 5 $0.00005979 SELL SMA 10 $0.00005510 SELL SMA 21 $0.00005668 SELL SMA 50 $0.00006314 SELL SMA 100 $0.00007828 SELL SMA 200 $0.00008425 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.00005612 SELL EMA 5 $0.00006229 SELL EMA 10 $0.00007266 SELL EMA 21 $0.00008437 SELL EMA 50 $0.00009474 SELL EMA 100 $0.00009638 SELL EMA 200 $0.0001007 SELL What to expect from FLOKI FLOKI is in a stabilization phase with early signs of recovery, but it needs a clean break above $0.0000511 to confirm bullish momentum. Until then, expect range-bound movement with potential for volatility expansion in the coming sessions. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

With the year nearing its end, the cryptocurrency remains down around 36% from its all-time high despite earlier expectations that bullish momentum would accelerate into December. Network economist Timothy Peterson has been among the most vocal in highlighting how closely the current trajectory matches that of 2022. “2H2025 Bitcoin is the same as 2H2022 Bitcoin,” he wrote in a recent post on X. Correlation Metrics Reach Unprecedented Levels Peterson’s analysis shows that the daily correlation between 2025 and 2022 market action sits at roughly 80%. The monthly correlation has climbed even higher, hitting an extraordinary 98%. Charts accompanying his research indicate that if the trend remains intact, Bitcoin may not see a significant rebound until sometime in the first quarter of 2026. These findings have unsettled investors who hoped the market would rebound heading into the holiday period. Peterson recently summarized November’s performance with blunt clarity. “It feels bad because it is bad,” he wrote, adding that “this month ranks in the bottom 10% of daily price paths since 2015.” Historical Patterns Suggest December May Bring More Losses Bitcoin’s negative performance in November has historical implications. Data shows that when the cryptocurrency posts a “red” November, December often follows with further declines, though usually with reduced severity. With only weeks remaining in the year, traders are now weighing whether macro-driven optimism could deliver an end-of-year “Santa rally” or whether the market will continue mimicking 2022’s prolonged slump. Shift in Macro Environment Boosts Equities While crypto endured a challenging month, broader financial markets have shown signs of recovery. Figures reported by The Kobeissi Letter indicate that US equity funds have witnessed $900 billion in inflows since November 2024, with $450 billion arriving within the last five months alone. The publication noted: “Put differently, equities have attracted more inflows than all other asset classes COMBINED. Equity inflows remain remarkably strong.” This surge contrasts with the relatively muted performance of other asset classes, creating a divergence between stock-market sentiment and crypto-market behavior. ETF Inflows Signal Potential Crypto Stabilization Despite the recent sell-off, new data suggests that institutional crypto participation may be recovering.

Speaking on CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday, he declined to confirm if he sees himself as the leading candidate, calling recent reporting on the matter a “rumor.” Still, he pointed to the market’s positive reaction to reports that Trump is close to naming his pick, subtly acknowledging investor concerns that he might be viewed as too closely aligned with the president. “We had a great Treasury auction, interest rates went down and I think that the American people could expect President Trump to pick somebody who’s going to help them have cheaper car loans and easier access to mortgages at lower rate,” Hassett noted on CBS. “That’s what we saw in the market response to the rumor about me.” Markets react as Hassett emerges as top contender for Trump’s Fed pick Hasset’s remarks come as Trump said on Sunday that he has picked his next Federal Reserve chairman and will make the announcement soon. While talking to reporters, he noted, “I know who I’m going to pick as Fed Chair, I will announce it soon.” However, he failed to confirm that his nomination to replace Jerome Powell will be Hassett, the current director of Trump’s National Economic Council, when asked. According to bets on the Kalshi prediction market , Hassett currently has a 65% chance of getting the nomination, a rise from 40% on Tuesday. Other contenders, such as Fed Governor Christopher Waller, are at 15%, with former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh at 13%. According to people close to the matter, Trump holds Hassett in high regard and views him as aligned with the desire to push for more aggressive interest-rate cuts at the central bank. Hassett has been a strong defender of Trump’s economic policies, including tariffs and interest rates, and said he would be happy to serve as Fed chief if Trump nominated him. By highlighting the market reaction, he effectively countered concerns that his nomination would be seen as a direct challenge to Fed independence. While Trump has made last-minute changes before, the prospect of Hassett being nominated for the position briefly pushed the 10-year Treasury yield below 4%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been overseeing the selection process, recently noted that the president could announce his nominee before the Christmas holiday on December 25. “I know who I am going to pick, yeah,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on his way back to Washington, without naming his choice. “We’ll be announcing it.” Trump eyes saster Fed action as Hassett and others vie for chair Trump’s patience with Powell is wearing thin as the Fed cautiously cuts rates, signaling he wants a chair who will move faster. Hassett says he’d take the job if offered, but analysts caution he could clash with the Fed’s committee and be more exposed to Trump’s influence Trump’s patience with Powell is wearing thin as the Fed cuts rates cautiously, suggesting that he is looking for a chair who is more action-oriented. Hassett says he would accept the job if offered, but analysts say he could bump heads with the Fed’s committee and become more subject to Trump’s influence. Other finalists besides Hassett include Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock’s Rick Rieder. Trump has frequently mentioned wanting Bessent as Fed chair, a suggestion Bessent has consistently turned down. Any nominee will require Senate confirmation for the chairmanship and would likely assume a 14-year term as a Fed governor, starting in February, if they are an outsider. Powell’s current term as chair expires in May.

This announcement drew widespread attention after CyrusOne, the company that owns the Chicago 1 (CHI1) data center in Aurora, Illinois, released a statement mentioning that, “We have restored stable and secure operations at our facility. To improve continuity further, we have added extra redundancy to our cooling systems.” CME’s data center eases tension after a major power outage CME Group Inc., the world’s leading derivatives marketplace, operating four exchanges, relies heavily on the Aurora data center. In 2016, CME struck a deal with CyrusOne and decided to sell the facility to the Dallas-based company, which is now owned by KKR & Co. and Global Infrastructure Partners, the private equity companies that jointly acquired and now own CyrusOne. Notably, the exchanges operated by CME include the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, the New York Mercantile Exchange, and the Commodity Exchange. When the major outage occurred, the cooling system broke down late on Thursday, November 27, at the data center complex. This outage resulted in a significant rise in temperature to above 100°F (38°C). At this time, several possible suggestions were raised under CME’s disaster recovery plan to address the issue and prevent further impacts. An example of the proposals raised was that the company move to a data center located in New York. However, after reports announced that the incident was a short outage, the firm decided to withdraw the plan. Contrastingly, the outage lasted for hours. This outage was massive. It began in Asia and spread globally, affecting various trading activities for everything ranging from gold and oil to bets on US interest rates. On Friday afternoon, the following day after the incident occurred, most operations were back up and running. Regarding regulators’ participation in the scenario, a representative from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission confirmed that they were aware of the issue and were monitoring the market as usual. CME’s power outage incident ignites tension in the market Following a significant power outage at CME, trading on its famous currency platform halted. Futures linked to foreign exchange, commodities, Treasuries, and stocks were also affected. In a statement, CME stated that, “Our markets are currently halted due to a cooling issue at CyrusOne data centers. Our support team is working to fix the problem soon and will update clients with Pre-Open details as they become available.” This situation prompted reports to contact CyrusOne for further information on the incident. However, when they requested the company to comment on the matter, it declined to respond. The Dallas-based firm is responsible for managing more than 55 data centers across Japan, Europe and the United States. Regarding the CME’s notice, reports from reliable sources indicate that the EBS foreign exchange platform’s operations were temporarily halted due to technical issues. On the other hand, traders in the market raised concerns about CME’s power outage. They claimed that the company alerted them of the trading stoppage just before 0300 GMT, which resulted in major losses affecting all futures and options contracts on Globex. One trader, who wished to remain anonymous, referred to this scenario as a “nightmare.” Meanwhile, it is worth noting that CME derivatives serve as benchmarks in various markets, including stocks and commodities. Still, it remained unclear exactly how many CME products were affected by the outage. Nonetheless, LSEG data highlighted that the prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil, Treasury futures, S&P 500 futures, palm oil, and gold were not being updated. Don’t just read crypto news.

The Bitcoin price has fallen below the crucial $89,000 mark, sending ripples across the digital asset landscape. According to real-time market data from Binance USDT, BTC is currently trading at $88,977.74, marking a concerning drop for holders and traders alike. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Price Decline? Market analysts point to several factors influencing the current Bitcoin price movement. The cryptocurrency market often experiences volatility due to various economic indicators and global events. However, this particular drop below $89,000 suggests deeper market sentiment shifts that warrant closer examination. Several key elements typically affect Bitcoin price fluctuations: Market sentiment and investor psychology Regulatory developments worldwide Institutional investment patterns Global economic conditions Technical trading patterns and resistance levels How Significant is This Bitcoin Price Movement? The current Bitcoin price drop represents more than just numbers on a chart. Falling below $89,000 indicates potential resistance levels being tested and could signal further market adjustments. Historically, such movements often precede either consolidation periods or more substantial trend reversals. Market participants should note that cryptocurrency investments carry inherent volatility. The Bitcoin price has demonstrated resilience in past cycles, but current conditions require careful monitoring. Understanding these patterns helps investors make informed decisions rather than emotional reactions. What Should Investors Watch For Next? As the Bitcoin price navigates this downturn, several indicators deserve attention. Trading volume, market depth, and key support levels will provide clues about potential recovery or continued pressure. The $88,000 level now becomes particularly important for short-term direction. Consider these actionable insights: Monitor trading volume for confirmation of trend strength Watch for institutional buying or selling patterns Keep informed about regulatory announcements Diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio appropriately Navigating Market Volatility with Confidence The Bitcoin price movement serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency markets remain dynamic and unpredictable.

This week brings substantial releases that could impact market dynamics, with EIGEN leading the way at $21.8 million. Understanding these token unlocks helps investors make informed decisions in the volatile crypto space. What Are Token Unlocks and Why Do They Matter? Token unlocks represent the release of previously restricted cryptocurrency tokens into circulating supply. These events typically occur according to predetermined schedules outlined in project whitepapers. When major token unlocks happen, they can significantly influence market prices and trading volumes. Investors closely monitor these releases because they often increase selling pressure. However, well-managed token unlocks can also demonstrate project maturity and team commitment to transparent tokenomics. Major December Token Unlocks You Need to Watch According to Tokenomist data, several important token unlocks are scheduled for December 1-7. These releases represent substantial value entering the market and deserve careful attention from crypto enthusiasts and traders alike. The most significant token unlocks this week include: EIGEN : 36.82 million tokens ($21.8 million) unlocking at 4:00 a.m. UTC on December 1 ENA : 40.63 million tokens ($11.6 million) unlocking at 7:00 a.m. UTC on December 2 Breaking Down the EIGEN Token Unlock Impact The EIGEN token unlock represents 10.79% of the circulating supply, making it particularly noteworthy. Such a substantial percentage increase in available tokens often creates temporary price volatility. Investors should consider both the short-term effects and long-term implications of these token unlocks. Historical data shows that major token unlocks can create buying opportunities for patient investors. However, timing entry points requires careful analysis of market conditions and project fundamentals. How to Navigate Token Unlock Events Successfully Successful navigation of token unlock events requires strategic planning. First, research the project’s token distribution schedule and understand who receives the unlocked tokens. Team and investor unlocks often have different market impacts than community reward distributions. Second, monitor trading volume and price action around unlock dates. Increased volume typically accompanies these events. Finally, consider the project’s overall health and development progress beyond just the token unlock timing. Strategic Insights for December’s Crypto Landscape December’s token unlocks occur during a typically active period for cryptocurrency markets. The combination of year-end positioning and these scheduled releases creates unique trading conditions. Savvy investors use token unlock calendars as part of their comprehensive market analysis toolkit. Remember that not all token unlocks negatively impact prices. Projects with strong fundamentals and clear utility often weather these events successfully. The key is understanding each project’s specific circumstances rather than applying blanket assumptions. FAQs About Token Unlocks What exactly happens during a token unlock? During a token unlock, previously locked or vested tokens become available for trading on the open market, increasing circulating supply. Why do projects schedule token unlocks? Projects use token unlocks to gradually release tokens to team members, investors, and community rewards according to predetermined schedules that prevent market flooding. How do token unlocks affect prices? Token unlocks often create temporary selling pressure as recipients may take profits, but well-established projects can absorb this pressure without significant long-term damage. Where can I find reliable token unlock schedules? Platforms like Tokenomist, CoinMarketCap, and project official websites provide accurate token unlock calendars and detailed distribution information. Should I sell before a token unlock? This depends on your investment strategy, the project’s fundamentals, and the unlock size relative to circulating supply. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer. Can token unlocks create buying opportunities? Yes, temporary price dips following token unlocks can present entry points for investors who believe in the project’s long-term potential.

That’s exactly what happened as massive futures liquidated across major exchanges, sending shockwaves through the trading community. This staggering event represents one of the most significant liquidation waves we’ve seen this year. What Triggered This Massive Futures Liquidated Event? The sudden market movement that caused these futures liquidated positions came without significant warning. When prices move rapidly against leveraged positions, exchanges automatically close these trades to prevent further losses. This creates a cascade effect where more futures liquidated positions trigger additional price movements. Here’s what happened during that critical hour: Bitcoin and Ethereum led the downward movement Leveraged positions between 10x-25x were hit hardest Multiple exchanges experienced simultaneous liquidations Long positions accounted for 65% of the total value wiped out Why Should You Care About Futures Being Liquidated? Even if you don’t trade futures, these massive futures liquidated events affect everyone in crypto. The ripple effects can impact spot prices and create buying opportunities. Moreover, understanding why futures liquidated positions occur helps you make better trading decisions. Key factors that contributed to this event: Over-leveraged positions in a volatile market Unexpected regulatory news Large whale movements triggering stop losses Market sentiment shifting rapidly How Can You Protect Yourself From Future Liquidations? Learning from this $247 million futures liquidated event is crucial for every trader. The first lesson is risk management. Always use proper position sizing and avoid excessive leverage. Remember that when markets turn, futures liquidated positions can wipe out accounts quickly. Essential protection strategies: Never risk more than 2-5% of your capital on one trade Use stop losses religiously Monitor leverage ratios carefully Diversify across different time frames and strategies The Bigger Picture: $367 Million in 24 Hours While the one-hour futures liquidated figure is staggering, the 24-hour total of $367 million puts this event in perspective. This suggests the market volatility extended beyond that critical hour. Understanding these patterns helps traders anticipate potential market movements. The market has shown remarkable resilience despite these massive futures liquidated events. However, each liquidation wave serves as a stark reminder of crypto’s inherent volatility and the dangers of over-leverage. FAQs: Understanding Futures Liquidations What exactly are futures liquidations? Futures liquidations occur when exchanges automatically close leveraged positions that have lost too much value. This happens to prevent accounts from going negative. How does leverage affect liquidation risk? Higher leverage means smaller price movements can trigger liquidations. A 10x leveraged position only needs a 10% price move against you to get liquidated. Can I recover funds after liquidation? Unfortunately, once positions are liquidated, the funds are lost. Exchanges use these funds to cover the leveraged position’s losses. Which exchanges had the most liquidations? While specific exchange data varies, Binance, OKX, and Bybit typically see the highest volumes during major liquidation events. How often do large liquidation events occur? Significant liquidation events like this $247 million wave happen several times per year, often during periods of high volatility or major news events. Should I avoid futures trading because of liquidation risk? Not necessarily, but you should approach futures trading with proper risk management and education about liquidation mechanics.

This week brings several key announcements that could significantly impact market sentiment and price movements across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets. Let’s explore the most important global macroeconomic events scheduled for December 2-5 that every crypto trader should monitor closely. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About Global Macroeconomic Events? Global macroeconomic events directly influence investor sentiment and capital flows. When central banks speak or economic data releases, they can trigger volatility across all financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. These global macroeconomic events often determine whether investors seek risk-on assets like crypto or retreat to safer options. Therefore, staying informed about these developments helps you anticipate market movements and protect your investments. Key Federal Reserve Announcements This Week The Federal Reserve takes center stage with multiple important speeches and data releases. These global macroeconomic events could provide clues about future interest rate decisions, which significantly affect crypto markets. December 2, 1:00 AM UTC: Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks – watch for hints about monetary policy direction December 2, 3:00 PM UTC: FOMC member Michelle Bowman provides additional insights December 4, 5:00 PM UTC: Michelle Bowman speaks again – consistency in messaging matters These speeches represent critical global macroeconomic events because the Fed’s stance on interest rates influences dollar strength and risk appetite. When the Fed signals hawkish policies, crypto markets often face pressure as borrowing costs rise. Employment Data Releases and Market Impact Employment figures serve as vital economic health indicators among global macroeconomic events. Strong job data might suggest continued rate hikes, while weak numbers could signal economic slowdown. December 2, 3:00 PM UTC: September JOLTs Job Openings report December 3, 1:15 PM UTC: November ADP Non-Farm Employment Change December 4, 1:30 PM UTC: Weekly initial jobless claims data These employment-related global macroeconomic events help gauge labor market strength. For crypto traders, unexpected results often trigger immediate market reactions as investors reassess economic conditions. European Central Bank and Inflation Watch Global coordination matters in today’s interconnected financial landscape. The European Central Bank’s actions complement Fed policies among important global macroeconomic events. December 3, 3:30 PM UTC: ECB President Christine Lagarde speaks December 5, 3:00 PM UTC: Core PCE data release – the Fed’s preferred inflation measure These international global macroeconomic events provide broader context for monetary policy trends. When major central banks move in similar directions, the combined impact on crypto markets amplifies significantly. How to Prepare for These Market-Moving Events Successful crypto trading during volatile global macroeconomic events requires preparation and risk management. Consider these actionable strategies: Set price alerts for key support and resistance levels Reduce leverage positions before major announcements Monitor multiple timeframes for clearer technical context Have entry and exit strategies prepared in advance Remember that not all global macroeconomic events create sustained trends. Sometimes, markets overreact initially before correcting, so avoid chasing momentum without proper analysis. Final Thoughts on This Week’s Economic Calendar This week’s packed schedule of global macroeconomic events offers numerous opportunities for informed crypto traders. By understanding how Fed communications, employment data, and international central bank actions influence markets, you can make better trading decisions. The most successful investors don’t just react to news – they anticipate how global macroeconomic events will shape market sentiment and position accordingly. Frequently Asked Questions Why do crypto prices react to traditional economic data? Crypto markets have become increasingly correlated with traditional finance. Economic data influences investor risk appetite, capital flows, and monetary policy expectations, all of which affect digital asset prices. Which economic indicators most impact cryptocurrency markets? Inflation data, employment reports, and central bank communications typically have the strongest immediate impact on crypto markets among global macroeconomic events. How quickly do crypto markets react to economic news? Reactions often occur within minutes or even seconds of data releases. However, sustained trends may take hours or days to develop as markets digest information. Should I trade during major economic announcements? Only experienced traders with robust risk management should trade during volatile events. Most investors benefit more from adjusting positions beforehand and avoiding reactionary decisions. Do all cryptocurrencies react similarly to economic news? Bitcoin and Ethereum typically show the strongest correlations to traditional markets. Smaller altcoins may react differently based on their specific use cases and market maturity. How can I stay updated on upcoming economic events? Use economic calendars from financial websites, set reminders for key releases, and follow reputable financial news sources that cover global macroeconomic events regularly. Found this guide helpful?

He argued that the downgrade of the stablecoin’s rating was based on incomplete information and did not accurately reflect the company’s real financial strength. Ardoino insisted that S&P had failed to fully take into account Tether’s assets, the volume of its profits, and the value of the wider group’s equity. These points further strengthen Tether’s case, he said, and demonstrate that USDt is backed by significantly more assets than critics would have assumed. For numerous exchanges and users, USDt serves as a reliable workhorse for daily transactions. As a consequence, any perception of weakness can raise alarm bells, even if the fundamentals supporting it remain strong. S&P downgrades USDT dollar-peg rating On November 26, S&P downgraded USDT’s so-called “peg‑stability” rating from 4 (“constrained”) to 5 (“weak”) — the lowest level under its 1–5 scale introduced in 2023. The agency cited growing reserves in what it terms “high‑risk” assets: allocations to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, precious metals, corporate bonds, secured loans, and other assets that introduce credit, market, interest‑rate, or foreign‑exchange risks. The agency downgraded the dollar peg stability for USDt to its weakest level, its second downgrade since March. This decision took many in the industry by surprise, as USDt has proven itself capable of maintaining its peg during significant market swings over the years. The downgrade quickly alarmed analysts, who said the rating could undermine confidence in a token that underpins billions of dollars’ worth of daily trading activity throughout the cryptocurrency market. Ardoino disputed the report , saying it did not accurately represent Tether’s financial position. He said that Tether had, at the end of Q3 2025, approximately $7 billion in excess equity, in addition to the approximately $184.5 billion in stablecoin reserves, and an additional $23 billion in retained earnings as part of the Tether Group’s equity. There was also roughly another $7 billion worth of reserves kept as a second buffer for USDt holders, but these were reserved in other forms, and they had “a different risk level”, Ardoino said. Ardoino also claimed that S&P had swept Tether’s powerful revenue engine under the rug. From U.S. Treasury yields alone, Tether is taking in roughly $500 million a month, courtesy of its substantial holdings of government debt. The company’s income has grown as it has expanded and invested more of its reserves in short-term U.S. securities. He contended that the rating company did not take into consideration the structure of the broader Tether Group. This conglomerate encompasses several revenue-generating divisions and substantial amounts of equity unrelated to stablecoin reserves. Experts scrutinize Tether’s asset allocation and potential pitfalls The downgrade had reignited old controversies about Tether’s reserves. Some analysts have wondered if Tether is too heavily reliant on non-traditional assets. BitMEX creator Arthur Hayes hinted that Tether may be acquiring more gold and Bitcoin. He said these assets could also be employed to offset dwindling income on U.S. Treasuries in the context of falling interest rates. If the prices of gold and Bitcoin were to decline precipitously, by, say, 30% or more, Tether’s equity could be wiped out, Hayes warned. He said that, in theory, such a situation could leave USDt vulnerable to insolvency. But other experts dismissed the view. Joseph Ayoub, who was previously a top digital asset analyst at Citi, said he had analyzed Tether extensively and that the company is much stronger than many of its critics claim. Ayoub stated that Tether’s reserves exceed its debt, much of which is unaccounted for in public summaries, and that the company has one of the most lucrative business models in finance. The firm, he said, generates billions in interest income with a staff of barely 150 people. Tether is better collateralized than the majority of traditional banks, he also noted.

The answer lies in CoinMarketCap’s latest Altcoin Season Index reading of 24, which clearly indicates we’re in the midst of a strong Bitcoin season. This crucial metric gives investors valuable insights into market trends and helps shape strategic decisions. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index serves as a vital barometer for cryptocurrency market cycles. The platform defines an altcoin season as a period when 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. Currently sitting at just 24, we’re far from altcoin season territory. The index calculation excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, focusing purely on performance comparisons. This approach ensures the metric reflects genuine market sentiment rather than artificial stability. Understanding this index helps investors time their entry and exit points more effectively. Why Does the Current Reading Matter for Your Portfolio? With the Altcoin Season Index at 24, Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto landscape. This reading suggests that most alternative cryptocurrencies are struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin’s performance. For investors, this means several important considerations: Bitcoin-focused strategies may currently yield better returns Altcoin investments require more careful selection and timing Market sentiment strongly favors the leading cryptocurrency Diversification strategies might need temporary adjustment However, remember that market conditions can change rapidly. The current Altcoin Season Index reading doesn’t mean altcoins are permanently sidelined – it simply reflects the present market reality. How Can You Use This Information Strategically? Smart investors use tools like the Altcoin Season Index to guide their decision-making process. When the index remains low, it often indicates that capital is flowing primarily into Bitcoin. This knowledge helps you allocate resources more effectively and manage risk appropriately. Consider these actionable insights based on the current index reading: Monitor the index weekly for potential trend changes Research fundamentally strong altcoins during Bitcoin dominance periods Set alerts for when the index crosses key thresholds (like 50 or 75) Balance your portfolio according to current market conditions When Might We See an Altcoin Season Return? While predicting exact timing remains challenging, historical patterns suggest that altcoin seasons typically follow extended periods of Bitcoin dominance. The Altcoin Season Index needs to reach 100 to confirm a full altcoin season, but movements above 50 often signal shifting momentum. Several factors could trigger the next altcoin season: Bitcoin price stabilization after major moves Increased institutional interest in specific altcoin projects Technological breakthroughs in alternative blockchain networks Changing regulatory landscapes favoring diverse crypto assets Final Thoughts: Navigating the Current Market Phase The Altcoin Season Index at 24 clearly signals that patience remains crucial for altcoin investors. Rather than fearing this reading, view it as an opportunity to conduct thorough research and prepare for the next market cycle shift. Remember that successful cryptocurrency investing involves understanding these metrics and adapting strategies accordingly. Market cycles are inevitable, and the current Bitcoin dominance won’t last forever. By staying informed about the Altcoin Season Index and other key indicators, you position yourself to capitalize when market conditions eventually change. Frequently Asked Questions What does the Altcoin Season Index measure exactly? The index tracks how many of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? CoinMarketCap updates the index regularly, typically reflecting the most recent 90-day performance data. What reading indicates a true altcoin season? A reading of 100 signals a full altcoin season, meaning 75% of top cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin. Should I avoid altcoins when the index is low? Not necessarily – low readings can present buying opportunities for fundamentally strong projects at better prices. How reliable is this index for investment decisions? While valuable, the index should be one of several tools in your analysis toolkit, not the sole decision-maker. Can the index predict short-term price movements? The index reflects longer-term trends (90 days) rather than short-term price predictions. Found this analysis of the Altcoin Season Index helpful?

As Phase 6 is already at 94% allocation and the demand rapidly growing during the entire Q4 2025, the scramble is on among the investors to secure their position before the remaining supply is taken up. The presale is at a rapid pace and most people now think that this can be amongst the most successful crypto breakouts into 2026. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that considers enabling actual utility. The project offers two lending frameworks that provide more flexibility and secure borrowing solutions to the users. In the P2C model, users deposit assets and get back the mtTokens. These mtTokens are appreciated with the interest repayments of borrowers. As an illustration, a user who provides $1,000 of ETH will have their mtTokens increase as the degree of lending gains momentum and they will establish a kind of APY, which is contingent on the observed demand. Under the Peer-to-peer model, it is the lender who gets a chance to select between the variable rates or the stable ones depending on the preference of repayment. Variable rates are altered according to the utilization whereas stable rates provide specific interest charges. LTV regulations assist in securing every loan. The LTV ratios are often backed by stable assets that are within 75% whereas volatile tokens continue to be within the 35%-40% range. In case collateral of a given user goes so low, automated liquidation will enable the debt to be repaid and assets be bought by the liquidators at a discount to keep the system safe. Quick-Growth Presale and Huge Community Development Mutuum Finance presale started at $0.01 at the beginning of 2025. The token has since however jumped to $0.035, which is 250% appreciated in its development period. This increase is an indication of consistent demand in every stage of offering. The protocol has raised interest of $19M and has widened its range to reach 18,200 holders, which indicates a clear and consistent interest in the project. The current price has 94% allocation at phase 6 meaning that very little number of tokens left in this phase. Mutuum Finance also contributes to the increased involvement with 24-hour leaderboard, where the best contributor is given $500 in MUTM daily. This system facilitates daily activity and keeps the users interested in joining the system prior to the next change in price. Now at a launch of $0.06, several early purchases feel that the $0.035 window is closing fast with even more buyers rushing in as Phase 6 is heading to full allocation. V1 Launch and Analyst Outlook of Security The official Mutuum Finance X account presupposes the launching of V1 on Sepolia Testnet in the Q4 of 2025. This release will consist of the liquidity pool, mtTokens, the liquidation bot and the debt-tracking token. It will be supported with ETH and USDT. The issue of security has been a prime concern during the development. Mutuum Finance successfully went through a CertiK audit with a 90/100 rating on the Token Scan and Halborn Security is working on the final lending and borrowing contracts. Such reviews assure investors that MUTM is being constructed on a strong footing, which has been proven, and many early-stage tokens do not have this. Mutuum Finance is also in the process of launching a stablecoin minted and burned on-demand and pegged to USD. The type of interest earned by this stablecoin will fund the Mutuum Treasury, generating long-term income and increasing the usefulness of this platform. Stablecoins are central to DeFi liquidity systems, which provide the user with predictability of value and enhanced liquidity. The other significant element of the roadmap is layer-2 expansion. Mutuum Finance will be implemented on L2 networks in order to minimize the fees and enhance the speed of transactions. This plays a critical role with any DeFi crypto prone to accommodate a large number of users and effective lending requirements. Chainlink oracles will also be incorporated into the project to guarantee that the calculations regarding liquidation and borrowing would be correct despite the instability of the market, as well as fallback oracles and on-chain price feeds to ensure system safety. Final Takeaway Mutuum Finance is experiencing a runaway growth with the 250% boost already being registered and Now Phase 6 being at 94% deployment. Having solid DeFi interactions, the leading audits, an imminent V1 Testnet rollout, stablecoin creation and a rising interest of whales, the venture is now among the potential best cryptocurrencies under $0.05. There is a minor proportion of tokens left behind standing at $0.035. At this pace of purchases, Phase 6 can run out of stock long before it is anticipated, so this is the final opportunity to buy before the next huge increase.

The Bitcoin price has been a barometer for the entire cryptocurrency sector, making this development crucial for understanding broader market trends. Historical data shows that Bitcoin price corrections often precede periods of consolidation or further movement. However, each situation presents unique characteristics that require careful analysis. The current Bitcoin price situation demands attention because it breaks through what many considered a psychological support level. What Should Investors Watch For Next? As the Bitcoin price continues to evolve, market participants should monitor several key indicators. Trading volume patterns, support and resistance levels, and market sentiment all play crucial roles in determining where the Bitcoin price might head next. The $87,916.43 level represents the current reality, but market conditions can change rapidly. Important factors to consider include: Support levels below the current Bitcoin price Trading volume during the decline Market news and regulatory updates Institutional activity in Bitcoin markets Understanding Market Volatility in Bitcoin Price The Bitcoin price has always been known for its volatility, which presents both opportunities and risks for investors.

However, understanding the context and potential implications remains essential for making informed decisions about Bitcoin investments. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin price drop below $88,000? The Bitcoin price decline likely results from a combination of market factors including profit-taking, changing investor sentiment, and broader economic conditions affecting cryptocurrency markets. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Investment decisions should always be based on individual risk tolerance and research. Some traders see price drops as buying opportunities, while others prefer to wait for market stabilization. How low could Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price levels is challenging. Market analysts typically identify support zones rather than specific numbers, with the next major support level being watched closely by traders. Will this affect other cryptocurrencies? Yes, Bitcoin price movements often influence the broader cryptocurrency market since Bitcoin remains the dominant digital asset by market capitalization. How long might this price correction last? Cryptocurrency price corrections can vary in duration from hours to weeks, depending on market conditions and catalyst events driving the movement. Should I be worried about my Bitcoin investment? All investments carry risk. It’s important to maintain a long-term perspective and ensure your investment aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Found this analysis helpful?

This massive wipeout represents one of the most significant liquidation events in recent months, sending ripples through the entire digital asset ecosystem. What Triggered This Massive Futures Liquidated Event? When we see $350 million in futures liquidated within sixty minutes, several factors typically converge. Market volatility spiked unexpectedly, catching many traders off guard. Price movements became so rapid that stop-loss orders triggered in cascade fashion. This creates a domino effect where each liquidation puts additional pressure on the market. The timing of these futures liquidated positions suggests coordinated market movements. Large players might have been adjusting their portfolios, or unexpected news triggered rapid position unwinding. Either way, the result was catastrophic for traders on the wrong side of these moves. Understanding How Futures Get Liquidated Futures liquidation occurs when traders can’t meet margin requirements. Here’s how it typically unfolds: Margin calls activate when positions move against traders Automatic closures happen when collateral drops below maintenance levels Cascade effect amplifies as liquidations trigger more price movement Market impact creates additional volatility and pressure When $350 million in futures get liquidated this rapidly, the market infrastructure gets tested. Exchanges must process these forced closures while maintaining system stability throughout the turmoil. The 24-Hour Picture: $483 Million Futures Liquidated Looking beyond the dramatic one-hour window reveals an even broader story. The past 24 hours witnessed $483 million in futures liquidated across cryptocurrency markets. This indicates sustained pressure rather than just a brief flash crash. The distribution between long and short positions matters significantly. Typically, sharp price drops trigger more long position liquidations. However, rapid price recoveries can equally devastate short sellers. Understanding which side dominated these futures liquidated events helps traders gauge market sentiment. Why Should Traders Care About Futures Liquidated Data? Monitoring futures liquidated metrics provides crucial market intelligence. These numbers reveal: Market leverage levels across the ecosystem Potential turning points for price trends Risk appetite among trading participants Systemic vulnerability to cascading effects When we see $350 million in futures liquidated so quickly, it signals excessive leverage in the system. Smart traders use this information to adjust their risk management strategies accordingly. Protecting Your Portfolio During High Liquidation Periods Surviving periods of heavy futures liquidated activity requires disciplined strategy. Consider these protective measures: Reduce leverage during volatile conditions Set appropriate stop-losses away from crowded levels Monitor funding rates for early warning signs Diversify timing of position entries and exits Remember that when futures get liquidated en masse, even well-planned strategies can face unexpected challenges. Maintaining adequate capital reserves becomes crucial during these turbulent periods. What’s Next After This Futures Liquidated Storm? Historical patterns suggest markets often find stability after major liquidation events. The forced closure of over-leveraged positions typically removes excess speculation from the system. This can create healthier foundation for subsequent price discovery. However, the psychological impact of seeing $350 million in futures liquidated so rapidly may linger. Traders might become more cautious about leverage, potentially reducing volatility in the near term. The key is watching whether this represents an isolated incident or the beginning of a broader deleveraging cycle. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly does ‘futures liquidated’ mean? Futures liquidated refers to the forced closure of leveraged positions when traders cannot meet margin requirements. This happens automatically when collateral values drop below maintenance levels. How does $350 million in futures liquidated compare to historical events? While significant, this event ranks below the largest liquidation events in cryptocurrency history. Major market crashes have seen single-day liquidations exceeding $1 billion. Can futures liquidated events predict market direction? Large liquidation events often mark local extremes in price movement. However, they don’t reliably predict longer-term trends and should be considered alongside other market indicators. Which cryptocurrencies experienced the most liquidations? Bitcoin and Ethereum typically dominate liquidation events due to their high trading volumes and futures market depth, though altcoins can experience proportionally larger impacts. How can I avoid getting liquidated in volatile markets? Use lower leverage, maintain adequate collateral, set stop-losses strategically, and monitor positions actively during high-volatility periods. Do exchanges benefit from futures being liquidated? Exchanges primarily earn from trading fees rather than liquidations themselves. However, high volatility typically increases trading activity and fee revenue. Found this analysis of the $350 million futures liquidated event helpful?

While any price drop below key psychological levels creates concern, it’s important to maintain perspective.

However, breaking below the $87,000 level does signal potential short-term challenges ahead. What Should Bitcoin Investors Do Now? Market downturns often present both challenges and opportunities. Here are actionable insights for navigating the current BTC price environment: Review your risk management strategies Consider dollar-cost averaging during dips Monitor key support and resistance levels Stay informed about market developments Understanding BTC Price Volatility The BTC price has always been characterized by significant fluctuations.

The fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin remains unchanged despite temporary BTC price adjustments. Many experienced investors view these periods as potential accumulation opportunities within a long-term strategy. The recent BTC price movement below $87,000 serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency markets remain dynamic and unpredictable.

The key to successful navigation lies in maintaining perspective, implementing sound risk management, and focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term price fluctuations. Frequently Asked Questions Why did BTC price drop below $87,000? The BTC price decline likely results from combined factors including market sentiment shifts, technical trading patterns, and broader economic conditions affecting risk assets. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Market downturns can present buying opportunities for long-term investors, but always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before investing. How low could BTC price go? Predicting exact price levels is impossible, but Bitcoin has established historical support zones that often provide buying interest during corrections. Should I sell my Bitcoin now? Investment decisions should align with your individual strategy and risk management plan rather than reacting to short-term price movements. How long might this BTC price downturn last? Cryptocurrency market cycles vary in duration, but historical patterns suggest volatility is normal and markets typically recover over time. What indicators should I watch for BTC price recovery? Key indicators include trading volume patterns, institutional activity, market sentiment shifts, and broader economic conditions.

This critical alert comes as the platform identifies significant security concerns surrounding Yearn.finance tokens, prompting immediate investor caution. What Triggered This YFI Investment Warning?

The exploit was aimed at the protocol’s liquid-staking index token, yETH, allowing a hacker to mint close to infinity tokens and suck the pool dry in one transaction. According to blockchain analysis, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in yETH’s smart contract that combines these liquid staking tokens into a tradable index token. In a post on X, Yearn confirmed that the exploit was isolated to the yETH pool and its other vaults (V2 and V3) remain unaffected. Blockchain analysts are closely monitoring the network to determine if there is further suspicious activity. This is one of the ways a single bug in a complex DeFi product can result in significant losses. At this stage, the full magnitude of the loss is still being assessed. While the visible drain totals approximately $3 million, liquidity pools backing many users’ staked positions may also have been affected. Yearn acts after yETH breach, secures vaults Yearn Finance has confirmed that its yETH vault was hacked, although only the LST stableswap pool was impacted, and no other part of the code had been infiltrated. The company scrambled to assure its customers that its main vault products (V2 and V3) were still 100% secure and that the attack had not compromised them. The Yearn team states that it is conducting a thorough internal investigation to determine exactly how the exploit was executed and whether any other assets were affected. This involves auditing snippets of code, monitoring on-chain transactions, and collaborating with security professionals to ensure that no other mistakes remain undiscovered. The hack was first flagged by X user Togbe, who reported noticing the apparent attack while monitoring large transfers. “Net transfers suggest yETH super mint let the attacker drain the pool for some gain of 1k ETH,” Togbe said in a message. “Somehow, other eth was sacrificed in this, but they still made away with profit.” The breach serves as a crucial reminder about the risks that may be present in DeFi, including those for protocols with solid reputations and previous audit histories. Yearn’s response, characterized by openness to the public, active monitoring of developments, and its dedication to auditing, aligns with a protocol that prioritizes user security in decision-making, while continuing to explore all facets related to DeFi. DeFi protocols face rising threats from hackers The Yearn Finance yETH Pool attack isn’t an isolated occurrence; it’s symptomatic of a larger, exponentially growing trend that poses existential threats to the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. As recently reported by Cryptopolitan , in November 2025, the space lost approximately $127 million to hacks, scams, and exploits. According to experts, tech risk, rather than phishing or hacked wallets, has been the largest threat to DeFi projects so far – it appears that the majority of flash loan (and other) issues were due to smart contract code flaws. The yETH attack is an example that even highly used and audited platforms are not invulnerable. Protocol-inclusive protocols with feature-rich toolsets, such as Liquid Staking, Auto Token-Indexing, and Aggregate Quotations, can potentially expand the attack surface area, allowing protocol attacks to be compromised by a more sophisticated hack over time. And designed to be as efficient and slippery as possible for their intended customers, such systems can also inadvertently create doorways that even the bad guys will have noticed by now. The latest attacks have been similar, according to security experts. Hackers are now employing increasingly sophisticated and multi-stepped plays, utilizing incredibly agile, premeditated movements through self-destructing smart contracts. These self-destructing smart contracts are used to transfer the stolen funds via privacy-focused mixers like Tornado Cash. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The prominent crypto figure revealed that the world’s largest stablecoin issuer could face catastrophic Tether insolvency if its gold and Bitcoin holdings decline by just 30%. This warning sends shockwaves through the entire crypto ecosystem. What Exactly Did Arthur Hayes Say About Tether Insolvency? Arthur Hayes analyzed Tether’s latest audit report and discovered alarming vulnerabilities. He explained that Tether has been aggressively increasing its gold and Bitcoin exposure as a strategic bet on upcoming U.S. interest rate cuts. However, this calculated risk carries potentially devastating consequences for the stablecoin’s stability and could trigger Tether insolvency under specific market conditions. Hayes detailed how a 30% decline in these key asset values would completely eliminate Tether’s equity cushion. This scenario would create a dangerous situation where USDT could become virtually worthless, threatening the entire cryptocurrency market structure that relies on stablecoins for trading and liquidity. How Real is the Tether Insolvency Threat? The Tether insolvency risk isn’t just theoretical speculation. Hayes based his analysis on concrete financial data from the company’s official reports. Consider these critical factors: Tether’s substantial exposure to volatile assets like Bitcoin and gold The company’s strategic positioning for interest rate changes Market conditions that could trigger the 30% decline threshold The complete erosion of equity protection at this drop level This potential Tether insolvency scenario highlights the interconnected nature of cryptocurrency markets. When one major player faces instability, the effects ripple across the entire ecosystem. What Actions Might Follow This Tether Insolvency Warning? Hayes anticipates significant market reactions if concerns about Tether insolvency continue to grow. Large USDT holders and major cryptocurrency exchanges will likely demand real-time financial transparency from Tether. They need current data to assess the actual solvency risk rather than relying on outdated audit reports. Moreover, Hayes predicts intensified media scrutiny targeting Tether’s key stakeholders. Major shareholders like Howard Lutnick and financial firms such as Cantor Fitzgerald (CFAM) could face mounting pressure to address these Tether insolvency concerns publicly. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About Tether Insolvency Risks? The possibility of Tether insolvency matters because USDT serves as fundamental infrastructure within cryptocurrency markets. As the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, its stability affects: Trading pairs across hundreds of exchanges Liquidity provision for DeFi protocols Cross-border payment systems Institutional crypto adoption Any disruption to USDT’s stability could trigger widespread market turbulence. The Tether insolvency warning serves as a crucial reminder that even “stable” assets carry underlying risks that require careful monitoring. What Can Investors Do to Protect Themselves? While the Tether insolvency scenario remains hypothetical for now, prudent investors should consider diversification strategies. Rather than concentrating stablecoin holdings in a single provider, spreading exposure across multiple reputable stablecoins can mitigate risk. Additionally, staying informed about Tether’s quarterly attestations and audit reports provides early warning signals. Monitoring the composition of Tether’s reserves helps investors gauge the actual Tether insolvency risk as market conditions evolve. Final Thoughts on the Tether Insolvency Warning Arthur Hayes’ Tether insolvency analysis highlights the importance of transparency and risk management in cryptocurrency markets. While Tether has maintained its peg through previous market turbulence, this warning underscores that no asset is completely risk-free. The potential for Tether insolvency, however remote, reminds investors to maintain vigilant portfolio management practices. The cryptocurrency ecosystem continues maturing, and such warnings contribute to healthier market development by promoting due diligence and proper risk assessment among all participants. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly would trigger Tether insolvency according to Arthur Hayes? Hayes states that a 30% decline in the value of Tether’s gold and Bitcoin holdings would completely wipe out the company’s equity, potentially making USDT worthless. How likely is this Tether insolvency scenario to happen? While possible, the scenario requires specific market conditions. However, the warning highlights real vulnerabilities in Tether’s reserve composition that investors should monitor. What should I do if I hold USDT? Consider diversifying your stablecoin holdings across multiple providers and stay informed about Tether’s reserve reports and market developments. Has Tether responded to these insolvency concerns? As of this writing, Tether hasn’t issued an official response to Hayes’ specific analysis, though they regularly affirm their stability through public communications. How would Tether insolvency affect the broader crypto market? A USDT collapse would likely cause significant market disruption, affecting trading, liquidity, and potentially triggering widespread sell-offs across cryptocurrency assets. What alternatives exist to Tether for stablecoin users? Several regulated alternatives include USDC, DAI, BUSD, and other stablecoins that maintain different reserve structures and transparency levels. Found this analysis helpful?

The first-ever Chainlink spot ETF is set to launch this week, marking a significant milestone for both Chainlink enthusiasts and the broader crypto investment landscape. This revolutionary development transforms how investors can access LINK exposure through traditional financial channels. What Makes This Chainlink Spot ETF So Special? According to Nate Geraci, CEO of Novadius Wealth Management, this pioneering Chainlink spot ETF will emerge through the conversion of Grayscale’s existing LINK Trust. This strategic move creates the first regulated spot ETF specifically for Chainlink’s native token. The conversion process ensures that investors gain direct exposure to LINK without the complexities of managing private keys or navigating crypto exchanges. The timing couldn’t be more perfect. As institutional interest in cryptocurrency continues to surge, this Chainlink spot ETF provides a familiar investment vehicle for traditional investors. Moreover, it eliminates several barriers that have previously kept cautious investors away from the crypto space. Why Should Investors Care About This Development? This Chainlink spot ETF represents more than just another investment product. It signals growing mainstream acceptance of blockchain oracle networks and their crucial role in the decentralized ecosystem. Consider these key benefits: Regulated Access : Investors can now gain LINK exposure through established financial channels Enhanced Security : No need to worry about private key management or exchange risks Tax Simplicity : Traditional tax reporting makes cryptocurrency investing more straightforward Liquidity Advantages : ETF structure provides easier entry and exit points for positions The launch of this Chainlink spot ETF could potentially drive increased institutional adoption. Financial advisors who were previously hesitant to recommend cryptocurrency investments now have a familiar product to offer their clients. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? The introduction of a Chainlink spot ETF demonstrates the maturing nature of the cryptocurrency industry. Following the successful launches of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, this development expands the range of crypto assets available through traditional investment vehicles. This progression suggests that regulators are becoming more comfortable with diverse cryptocurrency offerings. Market analysts anticipate that this Chainlink spot ETF could attract significant capital from both retail and institutional investors. The product’s structure allows for easier portfolio allocation to Chainlink, potentially increasing overall market liquidity and stability. What Challenges Remain for Crypto ETFs? Despite this exciting development, challenges persist in the cryptocurrency ETF space. Regulatory scrutiny remains intense, and approval processes can be lengthy. However, the successful conversion of Grayscale’s LINK Trust into a spot ETF suggests that established crypto investment products can successfully navigate these hurdles. Another consideration involves market volatility. While the ETF structure provides familiar investment mechanics, the underlying asset—LINK—still experiences the price fluctuations characteristic of cryptocurrency markets. Investors should maintain realistic expectations about risk and potential returns. Final Thoughts: A New Era for Chainlink Investment The launch of the first Chainlink spot ETF represents a watershed moment for both Chainlink and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This development bridges the gap between traditional finance and decentralized technology, offering investors unprecedented access to oracle network exposure. As the crypto industry continues to mature, we can expect more innovative investment products to emerge, further solidifying blockchain technology’s place in mainstream finance. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Chainlink spot ETF? A Chainlink spot ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds actual LINK tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to Chainlink’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. How is this different from Grayscale’s LINK Trust? The ETF conversion eliminates the premium/discount issues that often plagued the trust structure, providing more accurate price tracking and better liquidity for investors. When will the Chainlink spot ETF start trading? According to recent announcements, the ETF is expected to launch this week, though exact trading dates may vary by brokerage platform. Can international investors access this ETF? Initially, the ETF will likely be available primarily to U.S. investors, though international availability may expand over time through different share classes or similar products. What are the tax implications of investing in this ETF? The ETF structure provides traditional tax documentation (1099 forms), simplifying tax reporting compared to direct cryptocurrency ownership. How does this benefit long-term Chainlink investors? The ETF increases institutional accessibility, potentially bringing more stable long-term capital into the Chainlink ecosystem and supporting network development.

While many investors drown in cynicism, those who understand exponential growth principles see tremendous opportunity in today’s undervalued altcoins. Why Exponential Growth Thinking Changes Everything Dragonfly Managing Partner Haseeb recently highlighted a fascinating market dynamic. Major altcoins like ETH and SOL remain significantly undervalued for investors who grasp exponential growth concepts. However, most market participants operate with short-term thinking that misses the bigger picture. The current atmosphere resembles early internet skepticism. New blockchain projects face immediate criticism upon launch. Many investors believe crypto is overvalued and destined to collapse. This creates a unique opportunity for those who understand how exponential growth works in technology adoption. The Amazon Parallel: Lessons in Exponential Growth Haseeb draws a powerful comparison with Amazon’s journey. The e-commerce giant was unprofitable for 22 years and frequently called a Ponzi scheme. Critics couldn’t see the exponential growth potential that would eventually reshape global commerce. Consider these key parallels: Both faced widespread skepticism about long-term viability Early critics focused on short-term metrics rather than exponential growth potential Traditional analysis methods failed to capture the disruptive impact Patient investors who understood exponential growth were richly rewarded How Exponential Growth Reshapes Financial Systems Blockchain technology follows a similar exponential growth trajectory to the early internet. Just as the internet absorbed multiple industries, blockchain will transform the entire financial system. The key advantage lies in creating interoperable financial components within an open framework. This exponential growth potential explains why institutional investors operate on much longer time horizons than retail traders typically assume. They recognize that true exponential growth takes years to manifest but delivers extraordinary returns when it does. Actionable Insights for Exponential Growth Investors If you believe in exponential growth principles, current market conditions present unique opportunities. The widespread cynicism creates pricing disconnects that won’t last forever. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals and clear paths to adoption. Remember these key principles: Exponential growth requires patience and long-term perspective Market sentiment often lags behind technological reality Institutional adoption follows rather than leads exponential growth trends The biggest rewards go to those who understand exponential growth cycles Frequently Asked Questions What is exponential growth in cryptocurrency context? Exponential growth refers to the accelerating adoption and value creation that occurs when network effects kick in, similar to how internet usage exploded in the 1990s. Why are current crypto markets considered undervalued? Markets are undervalued because short-term skepticism has overshadowed long-term exponential growth potential, creating pricing disconnects for informed investors. How long does exponential growth typically take in tech? True exponential growth often takes 5-10 years to manifest significantly, as seen with Amazon, Google, and other tech giants. What risks come with betting on exponential growth? The main risk is timing – exponential growth can take longer than expected, requiring substantial patience and risk management. Which cryptocurrencies show strongest exponential growth potential? Projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases like Ethereum and Solanum demonstrate significant exponential growth characteristics. How do institutional investors view exponential growth in crypto? Institutions typically operate on longer time horizons and recognize exponential growth potential, which explains their increasing crypto allocations.

55181257,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=870672,1764557856,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55181257.jpeg,"Japan’s 2-year government bond yield rose to 1%, the highest in 17 years.",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/japans-2-year-yield-hits-17-year-high/,"On Monday, the yield on Japan’s 2‑year government bond climbed to 1%, the highest level in 17 years. The rise reflects growing market expectations that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) may soon begin raising interest rates. This development comes ahead of a speech by BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda in Nagoya. Japan’s currency strengthened as much as 0.3% to 155.71 per dollar. “Growing expectations of a BOJ rate hike are helping the yen appreciate and putting upward pressure on the two-year JGB yield,” said Hirofumi Suzuki, chief FX strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. “Governor Ueda’s comments today should be the key catalyst. If he sounds more hawkish than expected, I would expect this trend to continue.” Amid these financial market movements, domestic corporate activity also showed signs of cooling. Japanese businesses reduced their capital spending over the summer, following five consecutive quarters of profits, which signaled a cooling of corporate sentiment as higher US tariffs took a toll. The Finance Ministry noted on Monday that Capital expenditure on goods, excluding software, declined 0.3% from the previous quarter in the three months through September. Preliminary GDP data, however, indicated that overall corporate investment grew by 1%. Investor caution amid rate hike speculation The swap market now assigns a roughly 62% chance of a rate hike ahead of the BOJ’s next policy decision on December 19, with a near-90 % chance at the January meeting. Only a few weeks ago, there were slim odds of a move in December — 30%. If the BOJ does follow through on a rate hike, the move, analysts warn, could further strengthen the yen, putting additional pressure on exporters and possibly cooling domestic demand. Yields increasing could have great effects on Japan’s public finances, which are already saddled with one of the world’s largest debts relative to its GDP. It may draw foreign capital back into Japanese bonds. Analysts say rising borrowing costs could ripple into domestic markets and impact global financial flows. Conversely, elevated yields can attract foreign investment into Japanese bonds, thereby supporting the government’s fiscal program. Market participants will closely pay attention to Governor Ueda’s speech in Nagoya for clues on how aggressively the BOJ will act in the coming months. Rising debt issuance adds pressure to bonds Separately, the Ministry of Finance plans to increase issuance of short-term debt to fund Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s economic package. This includes raising issuance of two- and five-year notes by ¥300 billion ($1.92 billion) each and Treasury bills by ¥6.3 trillion, a move expected to weigh on shorter-term government bonds. “It’s prudent to remain cautious” on bonds at the moment, said Ryutaro Kimura, senior fixed-income strategist at AXA Investment Managers. The market must account for “the anticipated re-acceleration of inflation under the fiscal expansion of the Takaichi administration and the deterioration in the supply-demand balance due to a substantial increase in medium-term JGB issuance.” The rising speculation of a December hike comes as the yen has slumped 5% against the dollar this quarter, positioning it as the worst-performing among the Group of 10 currencies. For some time now, Japan’s inflation has been running above the BOJ’s 2% target, drawing criticism that the central bank is behind the curve in raising rates. A short-term note auction held late last week drew weak demand, suggesting that investors are cautious amid growing concerns about interest-rate hikes.

This landmark legislation could transform how digital assets are managed in one of Asia’s most dynamic crypto markets. The urgency behind this Digital Asset Basic Act reflects South Korea’s commitment to establishing clear regulatory frameworks. What Makes South Korea’s Digital Asset Basic Act So Important? The Democratic Party and Financial Services Commission recently held crucial discussions about the Digital Asset Basic Act. These closed-door meetings focused on creating a comprehensive framework for digital asset regulation. Lawmaker Kang Jun-hyeon revealed that consensus was reached on several key aspects, particularly regarding stablecoin issuance. This Digital Asset Basic Act represents a significant step toward formalizing cryptocurrency oversight. The proposed legislation addresses critical areas that have previously operated in regulatory gray zones. Moreover, the January deadline creates substantial pressure for stakeholders to align their positions. How Will Won-Backed Stablecoins Work Under This New System? The consortium model for stablecoin issuance stands as a cornerstone of the Digital Asset Basic Act. Under this innovative approach: Banks must hold over 50% stake in any stablecoin consortium The structure coordinates positions between Bank of Korea and FSC Banking sector involvement ensures financial stability Clear governance prevents regulatory conflicts This model for the Digital Asset Basic Act balances innovation with financial security. By requiring majority bank ownership, the system maintains traditional financial oversight while embracing digital asset technology. The consortium approach also distributes risk and responsibility across multiple institutions. What’s the Timeline for This Digital Asset Basic Act? The government faces a tight December 10 deadline to submit its official proposal. If missed, lawmakers plan to introduce their own version of the Digital Asset Basic Act. The goal remains passing legislation during January’s extraordinary National Assembly session. This accelerated timeline for the Digital Asset Basic Act demonstrates South Korea’s determination to lead in crypto regulation. The extraordinary session indicates the priority level assigned to this legislation. Market participants should prepare for rapid implementation once the Digital Asset Basic Act becomes law. Why Should Global Crypto Investors Watch This Development? South Korea’s Digital Asset Basic Act could set precedents for other nations considering similar regulations. The comprehensive nature of this Digital Asset Basic Act covers multiple aspects of digital asset management. International observers are closely monitoring how this Digital Asset Basic Act balances innovation with consumer protection. The banking sector’s central role in the Digital Asset Basic Act provides lessons for other jurisdictions. This approach maintains financial system stability while accommodating technological advancement. The success of this Digital Asset Basic Act could influence regulatory frameworks worldwide.

The tight deadline creates pressure for consensus among: Government regulatory bodies Banking institutions Cryptocurrency exchanges Consumer protection advocates Technical implementation of the Digital Asset Basic Act presents additional hurdles. Creating functional consortium structures while maintaining market efficiency requires careful planning. However, the structured approach of this Digital Asset Basic Act provides clear guidelines for all participants. Conclusion: A New Era for South Korean Crypto Regulation South Korea’s Digital Asset Basic Act represents a transformative moment for cryptocurrency regulation. The proposed January passage demonstrates serious commitment to establishing clear digital asset frameworks. This comprehensive Digital Asset Basic Act balances innovation with necessary oversight, potentially creating a model for other nations to follow.

The Digital Asset Basic Act aims to create comprehensive regulations for digital assets, particularly focusing on stablecoin issuance through bank-led consortiums to ensure financial stability. When will the Digital Asset Basic Act become law? Lawmakers are targeting passage during an extraordinary session of the National Assembly in January, provided the government meets its December 10 proposal deadline. How will stablecoins be regulated under this new act? The Digital Asset Basic Act proposes a consortium model where banks must hold over 50% stake in any won-backed stablecoin issuance project. What happens if the government misses the December 10 deadline? If the government fails to submit its proposal by December 10, lawmakers have stated they will introduce their own version of the bill for January consideration. Why are banks required to have majority ownership in stablecoin consortia? This requirement ensures financial stability and coordinates positions between the Bank of Korea, Financial Services Commission, and banking sector while maintaining traditional oversight.

The past 24 hours delivered a brutal reminder of how quickly markets can turn. Crypto futures liquidations overwhelmingly targeted long positions across major cryptocurrencies, wiping out hundreds of millions in leveraged bets. This dramatic shift reveals important lessons about market sentiment and risk management that every trader should understand. Why Are Crypto Futures Liquidations So One-Sided? The data tells a clear story of longs bearing the brunt of recent market pressure. Bitcoin saw $170 million in crypto futures liquidations , with an astonishing 91.41% coming from long positions. Ethereum followed closely with $150 million liquidated, where 87.13% were long positions. Even Solana experienced this trend with $31.9 million in liquidations and 90.57% affecting longs. This pattern suggests several market dynamics at play: Overly optimistic long positioning before price drops Leverage ratios that were too high for volatile conditions Stop-loss triggers cascading through the market Changing sentiment catching many traders off guard What Do These Crypto Futures Liquidations Reveal About Market Psychology? When crypto futures liquidations heavily favor one direction, it often indicates a market sentiment extreme. The dominance of long liquidations suggests that many traders were positioned for continued upward movement. However, when prices moved against these expectations, the forced selling created additional downward pressure. This phenomenon creates a self-reinforcing cycle. As long positions get liquidated, the selling pressure increases, potentially triggering more liquidations. Understanding this dynamic helps traders anticipate potential market movements and manage their risk accordingly. How Can Traders Protect Against Future Crypto Futures Liquidations? Surviving periods of heavy crypto futures liquidations requires proactive risk management. Here are essential strategies every trader should implement: Use appropriate leverage levels – Higher leverage means smaller price moves can trigger liquidations Set strategic stop-loss orders – Place stops at logical technical levels rather than arbitrary percentages Monitor funding rates – Extreme rates often precede volatility and potential liquidations Diversify position timing – Avoid entering all positions at once during high sentiment extremes What’s Next After This Wave of Crypto Futures Liquidations? Major crypto futures liquidations often create potential turning points in markets. After forced selling completes, markets frequently experience relief rallies as oversold conditions attract new buyers. However, the psychological impact can linger as traders become more cautious about leverage and position sizing. The current data shows that long positions dominated the recent crypto futures liquidations , suggesting that excessive optimism needed correction. Markets naturally cycle between fear and greed, and these liquidation events serve as painful but necessary resets. Key Takeaways From the Latest Crypto Futures Liquidations Data The recent crypto futures liquidations provide valuable lessons for all market participants. First, never underestimate how quickly sentiment can shift in cryptocurrency markets. Second, proper position sizing remains the most effective protection against liquidation events. Finally, understanding market structure helps traders anticipate potential pressure points before they trigger. Remember that while these events can be painful for affected traders, they represent normal market functioning. The dominance of long liquidations simply reflects previous positioning rather than predicting future price direction. Frequently Asked Questions What causes crypto futures liquidations? Crypto futures liquidations occur when a trader’s position loses enough value that their collateral can no longer cover potential losses. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent negative balances. Why were long positions hit harder than shorts? Long positions dominated liquidations because more traders were positioned for price increases before the market moved downward. This created concentrated risk in one direction. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use lower leverage, maintain adequate collateral, set stop-loss orders, and avoid trading during periods of extreme volatility or unusual funding rates. Do liquidations affect spot prices? Yes, significant liquidations can create selling pressure that impacts spot prices, especially when large positions get closed rapidly across multiple exchanges. What happens after major liquidation events? Markets often stabilize or rebound as forced selling completes and new buyers enter at lower prices. However, trader psychology may become more cautious temporarily. Are liquidations always bad for markets? While painful for affected traders, liquidations help maintain market health by removing excessive leverage and resetting positioning to more sustainable levels.

This situation has provided reassurance to policymakers as they confront the rise of global protectionism. Following November’s economic reports, data from the customs office published on Monday, December 1, highlighted that shipments adjusted for differences in working days surged 13.3% that month compared to the same period in the previous year. This rise took place following a 14% gain in the previous month. Headline exports, on the other hand, surged 8.4% after a revised 3.5% rise in October. Imports also increased by 1.2%, resulting in a trade surplus of $9.7 billion. South Korea’s economic growth surges amid a significant rise in exports Sources noted that semiconductor exports in South Korea continued to drive the country’s growth , increasing by almost 39%. This growth has mainly resulted from a strong demand for AI and data centers. Apart from semiconductor exports, the car industry has also rebounded with a nearly 14% surge, more than offsetting the slowdown in sectors such as petrochemicals. Lim Hye Youn, an economist at Hanwha Investment & Securities Co, commented on this growth. The economist argued that exports seemed solid because both DRAM and high-value semiconductors were performing well. Therefore, he cautioned that if the country decided to exclude semiconductors, then the overall export situation would not be this good. “Nonetheless, exports are performing better than anticipated despite American tariffs because companies have lessened their dependence on the US and expanded into other markets,” Lim added. This positive trade report was released just a few days after the Bank of Korea(BOK) made public its decision to keep its benchmark rate steady at 2.5%. At this time, the central bank had also implemented some changes to its statement, indicating that it is less likely to cut rates further than it has in the past. Still, officials demonstrate a divided stance on a decision regarding rate cuts. This situation was noted after the Governor of the Bank of Korea, Rhee Chang-yong, acknowledged that the board is evenly split on the outlook. According to information from the governor, three members supported a further reduction of interest rates, while three others anticipated that the interest rates would remain unchanged for now. In the meantime, it is worth noting that the central bank implemented slight improvements to its growth and inflation predictions through 2026. Sources close to the situation noted that, along with the rate decision, the BOK increased its 2026 growth outlook to 1.8% from the 1.6% estimated in August. It also raised its 2025 prediction to 1%, illustrating strong third-quarter output primarily driven by significant chip exports and a consistent rebound in private consumption. South Korea-US trade deal sparks hope in the market As South Korea released its outstanding economic reports, it was confirmed that the country and America had completed a landmark deal last month to limit US President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imports of Korean goods to 15%. The agreement covered key goods, such as vehicles, which were initially subjected to a 25% levy. This move aligns with Seoul’s earlier prediction that the auto rate will be retroactively reduced starting November 1. Meanwhile, the country’s ruling party submitted a special bill proposal to carry out its $350 billion investment promise last week. Considering the situation, Rhee shared his forecast that outbound shipments and companies’ equipment investment will surpass expectations. He noted that this will happen, backed by the global increase in semiconductor production and the recent breakthrough in the trade agreement with Washington. Several economists also weighed in on the matter. An example is Hyosung Kwon, a Korean economist. He mentioned that, “Since exports are steady, we believe the economy is set to grow by at least 1% in 2025 and more than 2% in 2026. Given this situation, the Bank of Korea doesn’t need to make any further changes to its policies.” By destination, shipments to the US dropped by 0.2% as some sectors, such as auto parts and steel, struggled due to tariffs imposed on them. As for China, exports soared 6.9%. Shipments to the Middle East also increased by around 33% and those to Southeast Asia rose by 6.3%.

Sacks didn’t just disagree – he called the narrative ‘bogus’ and threatened legal action. This dramatic confrontation raises crucial questions about government officials’ cryptocurrency investments and the ethics surrounding their policy influence. What Exactly is the Crypto Conflict of Interest Allegation? The New York Times report centered on whether Sacks’ government position could benefit his associates and former investments. The publication noted that Sacks maintained investments in crypto and AI firms like BitGo, suggesting these companies might gain from his policy influence. However, the situation isn’t as straightforward as initial reports might suggest. Sacks immediately countered these claims with concrete evidence of his compliance. He revealed that before accepting his government role, he sold approximately $200 million in crypto-related assets. This substantial divestment demonstrates a clear effort to avoid any actual crypto conflict of interest situation. How Did Sacks Respond to the Allegations? Sacks took to social media platform X to deliver his powerful rebuttal. His response included several key points that challenge the newspaper’s narrative: Complete compliance with government ethics regulations Massive $200 million cryptocurrency asset sale before appointment Description of the story as a ‘bogus narrative’ distorting facts Potential legal action against the publication The strength of Sacks’ response suggests he believes the crypto conflict of interest claims lack substantial evidence. His threat of legal action indicates confidence in his ethical standing. Why Does This Crypto Conflict of Interest Matter? This situation highlights the complex relationship between government regulation and emerging technologies. As cryptocurrency and AI continue to transform our economy, government advisors with relevant expertise often come from industry backgrounds. This creates an inherent tension between their knowledge and potential conflicts. The crypto conflict of interest debate extends beyond Sacks’ individual case. It touches on broader questions about how government should engage with rapidly evolving technologies while maintaining public trust. Proper ethical safeguards become crucial when officials have backgrounds in industries they help regulate. What Are the Real Implications for Crypto Regulation? This controversy emerges during a critical period for cryptocurrency regulation. As governments worldwide struggle to create effective frameworks for digital assets, the expertise of officials like Sacks becomes increasingly valuable. However, the potential for crypto conflict of interest allegations may deter qualified professionals from public service. The situation reveals several important considerations for future cryptocurrency policy development: Clear ethical guidelines for officials with crypto backgrounds Transparent disclosure requirements for investments Balancing expertise needs with conflict avoidance Public perception management around official conduct Conclusion: Separating Fact from Fiction in the Crypto Conflict Debate The confrontation between David Sacks and the New York Times represents more than just a personal dispute. It highlights the challenging intersection of cryptocurrency expertise, government service, and media scrutiny. While Sacks has provided evidence addressing the crypto conflict of interest concerns, the situation underscores the need for clear ethical standards in this rapidly evolving space. As cryptocurrency continues to gain mainstream acceptance, similar debates will likely emerge. The resolution of this particular crypto conflict of interest case may set important precedents for how government balances technological expertise with ethical compliance in the digital age. Frequently Asked Questions What specific crypto conflict of interest was Sacks accused of? The New York Times reported that Sacks’ government position could benefit his associates, noting he maintained investments in crypto and AI firms that might gain from his policy influence. How did Sacks respond to the allegations? Sacks stated he sold $200 million in crypto assets before his appointment and is fully compliant with government ethics regulations, calling the story a ‘bogus narrative.’ What is Sacks’ current government role? David Sacks serves as a White House advisor on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency policy. Has Sacks taken legal action regarding the report? While Sacks suggested he might pursue legal action, no formal lawsuit has been filed as of current reporting. Why is this crypto conflict of interest case significant? This case highlights the challenges of balancing technological expertise with ethical compliance in government roles involving emerging technologies like cryptocurrency.

You might have noticed things have gotten quiet—very quiet. New data reveals a startling slowdown: crypto spot volume plummeted to a mere $1.59 trillion in November. This isn’t just a minor dip; it marks the lowest trading activity the market has seen since June, signaling a major cooldown. What’s behind this dramatic shift, and what does it mean for your portfolio? Let’s dive into the numbers and uncover the story of a market catching its breath. Why Did Crypto Spot Volume Crash in November? The figures are stark. According to a report from The Block, the total crypto spot volume for November was $1.59 trillion. This represents a massive 26.7% drop from October’s $2.17 trillion. To put it simply, nearly a third of the trading activity evaporated in just one month. This decline pushed volumes to their lowest point in five months, creating a noticeable lull across major exchanges. This wasn’t a uniform decline. Centralized exchanges felt the pinch acutely. For instance, industry giant Binance saw its own crypto spot volume fall by roughly 26%, dropping from $810.4 billion in October to $599.3 billion. This pattern suggests a broad-based retreat, not an issue isolated to a single platform. What’s Causing the Market Stagnation? So, what triggered this widespread slowdown? Experts point to a perfect storm of factors that drained momentum from the market. Vincent Liu, Chief Investment Officer at Kronos Research, provides a clear explanation. He notes that as the market stagnated in November, two key ingredients for trading vanished: volatility and upward momentum. Liu attributes the slump in crypto spot volume to two primary actions by traders: Profit-Taking: Following a significant rally in previous months, many investors decided to cash in their gains, pulling money out of the market. Reduced Liquidity: This selling, combined with a wait-and-see approach from new buyers, led to thinner order books and less money flowing between trades. “It’s a typical pattern of a market cooling down after overheating,” Liu describes. Think of it like an engine that has been running hot; it needs to idle for a while to prevent damage. The market is now in that cooling-off phase. What Does Low Crypto Spot Volume Mean for Traders? For everyday traders and investors, this environment presents both challenges and opportunities. Low crypto spot volume often leads to decreased volatility, which can be a double-edged sword. The Challenge: Fewer large price swings mean fewer opportunities for short-term gains from day trading or swing trading. The market can feel flat and uneventful. The Potential Opportunity: Calm periods can be excellent times for research and accumulation. Without the noise of frenetic trading, you can more carefully evaluate projects and consider dollar-cost averaging into positions you believe in long-term. Historically, periods of low volume and consolidation often precede the next major market move. While it’s impossible to predict the direction, this lull is a crucial phase where the foundation for the next trend is built. Navigating the Quiet: Actionable Insights Instead of viewing the low crypto spot volume with alarm, savvy market participants use this time strategically. Here are a few actionable steps you can take: Review Your Portfolio: Use the calm to assess your holdings without emotional price swings influencing you. Strengthen Your Knowledge: Dive into whitepapers, project updates, and market analysis you may have put off during busier times. Set Alerts and Plan: Define your entry and exit points for when volume and volatility inevitably return. Remember, market cycles are normal. The explosive growth of October had to balance out, and November’s data is that balancing act. This cooldown is a natural, healthy part of the market’s rhythm. Conclusion: The Market Takes a Breather The dramatic drop in November’s crypto spot volume to $1.59 trillion is a clear signal: the market is taking a deliberate pause. Driven by profit-taking and evaporating liquidity, this cooldown follows a classic financial pattern after a strong rally. For investors, this period of stagnation isn’t a cause for panic but a call for perspective and preparation. It’s a reminder that sustainable growth isn’t a straight line upward but a series of advances and consolidations. As volatility remains low, the smartest move is to use this quiet time to build a stronger, more informed strategy for the cycles to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is “crypto spot volume”? A1: Crypto spot volume refers to the total value of cryptocurrencies bought and sold on exchanges for immediate delivery, as opposed to futures contracts. It’s a key measure of real-time trading activity and market liquidity. Q2: Is low trading volume always bad for crypto prices? A2: Not necessarily. While low volume can lead to higher price susceptibility to large orders, it often indicates a period of consolidation. Major trends frequently begin after such periods of low activity, as new momentum builds. Q3: Did the volume drop affect all cryptocurrencies equally? A3: The reported figure is an aggregate. Typically, major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum see a proportional drop, but some smaller altcoins might experience even lower liquidity. The decline was broad-based across centralized exchanges. Q4: Could this low volume indicate a coming bear market? A4: One month of data doesn’t define a trend. This cooldown is explicitly linked by analysts to profit-taking after a rally. It’s a typical pause, not conclusive evidence of a longer-term bearish shift. Continued monitoring of subsequent months’ data is essential. Q5: How does this compare to historical volume drops? A5: A 26.7% month-over-month drop is significant but not unprecedented. Crypto markets are known for their cyclicality, with periods of high volatility and volume often followed by corrective periods of lower activity, similar to patterns seen in mid-2023. Q6: What should I do as an investor during low-volume periods? A6: Focus on education, portfolio review, and strategy planning. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on boredom or the lack of action. Consider dollar-cost averaging and set clear goals for when market conditions change.

After hovering near $91,000 at the end of November, Bitcoin had been slipping lower in small steps, a sign of fatigue rather than capitulation. That changed when a wave of selling punched through several intraday support levels and drove prices toward the $86,900 area, with a sharp spike in sell volume pointing to forced liquidations or large stop orders getting triggered. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $86,053, down 5.4% Ether : $2,819, down 6.1% XRP : $2.04, down 7.5% Total crypto market cap: $3.01 trillion, down 4.9% Japanese bonds puking on renewed expectations of rate hike: Sends 2Yr JGB yield above 1% for the first time since 2008, and Nikkei tumbles. And since Bitcoin always correlates with anything that's down, we have a 4% dump in Bitcoin in Asian trading. pic.twitter.com/dL0Uc4bYD2 — zerohedge (@zerohedge) December 1, 2025 Liquidations Surge As Over $600M In Leveraged Crypto Bets Are Wiped Out Coinglass data shows a major wipeout in the past 24 hours, with about $608m in crypto liquidations. Longs took the hit, accounting for more than $535m, while shorts saw only about $73m. Bitcoin and Ethereum led the move, with roughly $185m and $154m cleared out. For highly leveraged traders, the move felt less like a tidy pullback and more like a trapdoor that reset positioning going into December. Equity markets looked calmer. MSCI’s broad index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed, but is still up 23.5% so far this year and on track for its strongest annual gain since 2017. Japan’s Nikkei slipped about 1.3% in early trade, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose more than 1%, helping offset softer US equity futures. A rally in metal stocks helped Chinese shares start the month on a slightly brighter note, even as the latest factory data showed activity remained in contraction in November. Fed In Focus As Markets Await Powell’s Comments On December Policy Investors stayed wary of the country’s property sector after China Vanke reportedly failed to secure a short term bank loan, keeping credit worries in the background. The broader tone across global markets is being set in Washington. Investors are positioning ahead of a heavy run of US data this week that will cover manufacturing and services, as well as consumer confidence and early readings on holiday spending from Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Attention is also fixed on the Federal Reserve. Traders are looking to remarks from Chair Jerome Powell later in the day for clues on the policy meeting in mid-December, with recent dovish comments from officials helping cement the view that another cut is likely. Pricing in futures markets now implies an 87% chance of a move this month. Upcoming Numbers Could Determine Whether Rate Cuts Continue Into 2026 The week’s releases will arrive against an unusual backdrop. A record 43-day government shutdown earlier this year delayed key reports, leaving policymakers to work with data that, in some cases, is already outdated. That has nudged markets to rely more heavily on speeches from regional Fed presidents and governors for guidance. Recent comments from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Governor Christopher Waller have reinforced expectations for continued easing, while New York Fed President John Williams has said he sees room for another reduction in the near term as labour conditions soften. For the Fed, the upcoming batch of numbers will help shape the debate over whether to extend the rate cutting cycle into 2026 as inflation cools and consumer demand gradually slows. For crypto traders, the same data will guide whether Monday’s Bitcoin flush is a brief positioning shakeout or the start of a deeper reset after a powerful year long rally.

The decline wiped out last week’s advances and was part of a broader decline in other major digital assets. The drop occurred in early Asian trading, where Bitcoin briefly dipped near its intraday lows of $85,778. The sell-off of the early Asian session led to liquidations exceeding $400 million in leveraged crypto futures, resulting in a roughly 4% decline in global digital asset market value to around $3 trillion. This suggests many traders had bet on a price rebound and were caught off guard by the sudden downturn. Major tokens slide as November’s steep losses deepen market fragility According to CoinMarketCap, Ether dipped more than 6% to below $2,900. It is worth noting that most tokens followed a similar pattern, with Solana experiencing a decline of almost 7%. The latest drop follows a punishing November as Bitcoin ended the month with an 18% decline , its worst performance since March. This is despite the leading crypto rebounding from almost $80,000 to above $90,000. Ether was not spared as it fared even worse, sinking 22% for its steepest monthly loss since February. The market remains fragile after roughly $19 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out in early October, just days after Bitcoin reached a record high of $126,251. Bitcoin fell in November and then briefly stabilized last week, returning to above $90,000. The last wave of sellers has traders getting ready for further declines. “It’s a risk off start to December,” noted Sean McNulty, APAC derivatives trading lead at FalconX. “The biggest concern is the meagre inflows into Bitcoin exchange traded funds and absence of dip buyers. We expect the structural headwinds to continue this month. We are watching $80,000 on Bitcoin as the next key support level.” Investor sentiment was further tested by comments from Strategy Inc. CEO Phong Le, who said on Friday that the company could sell Bitcoin if its mNAV — enterprise value relative to Bitcoin holdings — falls below 1. “We can sell Bitcoin and we would sell Bitcoin if we needed to to fund our dividend payments below 1x mNAV,” he said, stressing that it would be a last resort. Strategy, which holds $56 billion Bitcoin stockpile, has seen its mNAV tumble to 1.19, according to its website. Weak ETF inflows and fresh stability fears fuel December volatility Adding to the pressure, S&P Global Ratings downgraded its stability assessment of USDT , the world’s largest stablecoin, to its lowest level last week, warning that a deeper drop in Bitcoin could leave the token undercollateralized. Still, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino hit back shortly after the S&P move, saying the company wears critics’ loathing with pride. Noting the repeated failures of ratings agency models, he said the traditional finance propaganda machine is growing worried when any company tries to defy the force of gravity of the broken financial system. He added that Tether instead built the first overcapitalized company in the financial industry, with no toxic reserves. This week will provide a key read on US economic momentum as policymakers evaluate the path for interest rates into 2026. The data could influence expectations for further Federal Reserve cuts. President Donald Trump said Sunday he has decided on his choice for the next Fed chair, after signaling that he expects the nominee to support lower rates. Asian equities were mixed on Monday after logging their best weekly performance in two months. Japanese stocks declined and the yen strengthened as Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda delivered his clearest indication yet of a possible rate hike this month.

In a surprising market move, the Bitcoin price has tumbled below the crucial $86,000 mark, sending shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $85,999.55 on the Binance USDT market, marking a significant downturn that has investors scrambling for answers. Why Did the Bitcoin Price Drop Below $86,000? The sudden decline in Bitcoin price reflects several market factors converging simultaneously. Market analysts point to increased selling pressure from institutional investors and profit-taking after recent gains. Moreover, global economic uncertainties and regulatory concerns continue to influence cryptocurrency valuations. The Bitcoin price movement demonstrates how volatile digital assets can be, even for established cryptocurrencies like BTC. What Does This Bitcoin Price Movement Mean for Investors? When the Bitcoin price experiences such significant movements, it creates both challenges and opportunities. For long-term holders, this dip might represent a buying opportunity. However, short-term traders face increased risk.

Understanding market cycles is essential when dealing with Bitcoin price fluctuations. Historical data shows that BTC has experienced similar corrections before continuing upward trends. Therefore, maintaining perspective during these periods is vital. The current Bitcoin price action serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency markets operate differently from traditional financial markets. What’s the Future Outlook for Bitcoin Price? While the immediate Bitcoin price drop below $86,000 concerns some investors, many analysts remain optimistic about long-term prospects. The fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin remains unchanged, and adoption continues growing globally. However, predicting short-term Bitcoin price movements remains challenging due to multiple influencing factors including regulatory developments, institutional adoption rates, and macroeconomic conditions.

Whether you’re a seasoned trader or new to cryptocurrency, understanding that price corrections are normal in volatile markets can help maintain emotional balance. The Bitcoin price will likely continue experiencing fluctuations, but the underlying technology and adoption story remain strong. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to drop below $86,000? The Bitcoin price decline resulted from combined factors including profit-taking, market sentiment shifts, and broader economic concerns affecting cryptocurrency valuations. Should I buy Bitcoin now that the price has dropped? Investment decisions should align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. While some see price drops as buying opportunities, always conduct thorough research first. How low could the Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price levels is impossible, but historical patterns show Bitcoin has recovered from similar corrections multiple times in the past. Will Bitcoin recover from this price drop? While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience through numerous market cycles and price corrections. How does this Bitcoin price affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin often leads market trends, so price movements typically influence the broader cryptocurrency market, though individual assets may respond differently. What’s the best strategy during Bitcoin price volatility? Maintaining a long-term perspective, avoiding emotional decisions, and sticking to your investment strategy typically yields better results than reactive trading. Found this analysis helpful?

The perpetual futures funding rate, a crucial indicator of trader positioning, is showing clear signs of slowing growth. This development suggests that bullish bets are weakening across major crypto exchanges, according to recent analysis from Glassnode expert CryptoVizArt. What Exactly Is the Perpetual Futures Funding Rate? The perpetual futures funding rate acts as a balancing mechanism in crypto derivatives markets. It represents periodic payments between long and short position holders. When this rate turns positive and rises steadily, it indicates strong bullish sentiment. However, the current slowdown in perpetual futures funding rate growth tells a different story about market expectations. Why Should You Care About This Slowdown? The declining momentum in perpetual futures funding rate increases carries significant implications for your trading strategy. Here’s what you need to understand: Reduced leverage demand from bullish traders Potential price consolidation ahead Changing risk appetite among institutional players Market sentiment shift from extreme greed to caution How Does This Impact Your Trading Decisions? When the perpetual futures funding rate growth slows, it often precedes periods of price stability or correction. This pattern suggests that traders should consider adjusting their positions accordingly. The current perpetual futures funding rate behavior indicates that the market may be entering a phase of reassessment rather than continued aggressive buying. What Historical Patterns Tell Us Historical data shows that sustained slowdowns in perpetual futures funding rate increases typically lead to one of two outcomes. Either markets consolidate within a range, or they experience moderate corrections. Understanding these patterns helps you make informed decisions about when to enter or exit positions. Actionable Insights for Smart Trading Based on the current perpetual futures funding rate trends, here are practical steps you can take: Monitor funding rates across multiple exchanges Reduce leverage exposure during uncertain periods Set appropriate stop-loss orders Diversify across different time frames The slowing perpetual futures funding rate growth serves as an early warning system for market participants. While it doesn’t guarantee immediate price drops, it certainly suggests that the previous bullish momentum is losing steam. Smart traders use this information to adjust their strategies rather than following the crowd. Frequently Asked Questions What causes perpetual futures funding rates to change? Funding rates change based on the imbalance between long and short positions. When more traders want to go long, the rate becomes positive to encourage short positions. How often do funding payments occur? Most exchanges settle funding payments every 8 hours, though some platforms use different time intervals. Can funding rates predict price movements? While not perfect predictors, extreme funding rates often indicate potential reversals, while slowing growth suggests momentum shifts. Should I avoid trading when funding rates are high? High funding rates increase holding costs for long positions, making timing and position sizing more critical. Do all cryptocurrencies have the same funding rate behavior? No, different assets exhibit varying funding rate patterns based on their specific market dynamics and trader behavior. How can I monitor funding rates effectively? Use dedicated analytics platforms or exchange APIs to track real-time funding rates across multiple trading pairs. Found this analysis helpful?

That slowdown is now pushing part of the market toward projects showing clearer product progress. Remittix is one of the names consistently appearing on watchlists. With its live Apple-listed wallet, CertiK verification, early CEX listings, and a major December roadmap update coming, Remittix is gaining attention while the Bitcoin price stalls under pressure. Is the Bitcoin Price Setting Up for Chaos Mode? The Bitcoin price is trading around $90,949, supported by more than $70B in daily volume and a market cap above $1.8T. This week’s 5% rebound helped recover part of November’s drawdown, after BTC fell from highs above $120,000.

Miner selling is down, short-term wallets are accumulating, mid-term holders are de-risking, and ETF flows flipped negative earlier this month before stabilizing again. Analysts say this split could trigger a “chaos mode” move: sharp upside continuation or an equally sharp unwind.

This strategic addition marks a pivotal enhancement for users of the on-chain trading service within Binance Wallet, specifically designed for discovering and trading early-stage coins. For investors aiming to get in on the ground floor, understanding Binance Alpha RLS is now crucial. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does RLS Matter? Binance Alpha operates as a specialized gateway within the broader Binance ecosystem. Its core mission is to provide access to promising digital assets in their infancy. The introduction of RLS, or a dedicated listing service for these assets, directly supports this goal. Therefore, this update isn’t just a new feature; it’s a fundamental upgrade to the platform’s discovery engine. Think of Binance Alpha as a curated showcase for tomorrow’s crypto leaders. The RLS component acts as the rigorous filter and presentation layer, ensuring that the projects listed have undergone specific scrutiny. This process helps separate genuine innovation from mere hype, offering a more reliable path for investors. How Does the Binance Alpha RLS Platform Work for Traders? For the everyday user, the integration of RLS simplifies the journey of finding early-stage coins. Instead of scouring countless forums and obscure channels, traders can now find vetted opportunities in one secure, familiar environment—the Binance Wallet. The workflow is streamlined for efficiency and security. The benefits of this system are clear: Curated Access: The RLS mechanism pre-screens projects, saving you hours of independent research. Enhanced Security: Conducting trades through the native Binance Wallet interface reduces exposure to external risks. Timely Opportunities: Get direct exposure to tokens early in their lifecycle, which is often when the most significant growth potential exists. What Are the Real-World Implications of This Update? This move by Binance Alpha signals a growing institutional focus on the nascent segment of the crypto market. By formalizing the listing process through RLS, Binance is applying a layer of structure and legitimacy to early-stage investing. This development could attract a new wave of cautious capital that was previously hesitant to engage with unvetted projects. However, it’s vital to remember the inherent nature of these assets. While the Binance Alpha RLS platform offers a better filter, early-stage coins remain high-risk, high-reward propositions. Market volatility, project failure, and liquidity issues are ever-present challenges. Smart investing here still requires due diligence and robust risk management. Actionable Insights for Navigating Binance Alpha Ready to explore? Start by ensuring your Binance Wallet is set up and funded. Navigate to the Binance Alpha section and familiarize yourself with the new RLS interface. Look for project details, tokenomics, and team information provided for each listing. Crucially, never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider diversifying across multiple early-stage assets instead of concentrating on one. In conclusion, the addition of RLS to Binance Alpha is a transformative step that bridges the gap between cutting-edge crypto innovation and the mainstream trading community. It empowers users with tools for discovery while embedding crucial safeguards. This evolution makes the thrilling, yet daunting, world of early-stage coins more accessible and navigable than ever before. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly is RLS on Binance Alpha? A: RLS refers to the listing service integrated into Binance Alpha. It is the system that selects, vets, and lists new, early-stage cryptocurrency projects on the platform for trading. Q: Do I need a separate account to use Binance Alpha? A: No. Binance Alpha is a service within the Binance Wallet ecosystem. If you have a Binance account and use the Binance Wallet, you can access Binance Alpha features directly. Q: Are coins listed via RLS safer than other early-stage coins? A: While the RLS process involves vetting, which adds a layer of scrutiny, “safer” is relative. All early-stage investments carry significant risk. The RLS helps filter out lower-quality projects, but it does not eliminate market or project failure risk. Q: How can I find the RLS listings on Binance Alpha? A: After accessing Binance Alpha through your Binance Wallet, look for a dedicated section or tab labeled for new or early-stage listings. The interface should clearly highlight projects added via the RLS. Q: What are the main benefits of using Binance Alpha for early-stage trading? A: The key benefits are curated project discovery, the convenience of trading within a secure wallet you already trust, and potentially earlier access to tokens compared to major centralized exchanges. Q: Is there a minimum investment amount for trading on Binance Alpha? A: Minimums would depend on the specific token and prevailing market conditions. Always check the trading pairs and rules listed for each individual project on the platform. Found this guide to Binance Alpha RLS helpful?

He pointed to the withdrawal of CoinShares’ XRP ETF filing and raised a question that caught immediate notice. He examined the timing and asked if the decision was linked to supply pressures that could grow once major asset managers enter the market. Details From The Shared Report Remi directed readers to information from another user who cited the formal withdrawal notice. The update stated that CoinShares filed to withdraw the application under SEC Rule 477 and confirmed that “No shares were sold.” It also said the transaction never reached completion. The report placed the move in a competitive context. It noted potential filings from BlackRock and Fidelity, which would shift attention to larger issuers with deeper resources. The report also pointed out that CoinShares may want to focus on its Nasdaq merger. It closed with a view that the withdrawal clears space for stronger players. Did Coinshares withdraw its XRP filing knowing there isn’t enough XRP left for them to fulfill their ETF obligations ? I think so especially with BlackRock & Fidelity about to file. Coinshares knows BlackRock will pretty much buy out every XRP left on the open market. Do you… https://t.co/HCHlPslWEu — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) November 28, 2025 Remi’s Interpretation Of Market Conditions After presenting the report, Remi posed his central question. He asked, “Did Coinshares withdraw its XRP filing knowing there isn’t enough XRP left for them to fulfill their ETF obligations?” His point centered on supply. He suggested that demand from giant issuers could absorb much of the remaining XRP available on the open market. He also added that “BlackRock will pretty much buy out every XRP left on the open market” once filings move forward. XRP’s supply has shrunk significantly in 2025 . He believes BlackRock’s entry into the XRP ETF race could bring strong demand to a market already facing supply constraints. He then returned to the potential impact on XRP’s outlook. He suggested that XRP’s tight supply, combined with major institutional demand, could produce favorable conditions for the asset. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What Will Happen to XRP? The sequence he highlighted matters for several reasons. ETF filings from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity carry weight in traditional markets. Some researchers believe BlackRock’s XRP ETF will be the largest in the market . If these firms proceed with XRP filings, they would need significant quantities of the token to support their products. High demand in a limited market can push competition for supply. Remi pointed to that dynamic to explain why the withdrawal from CoinShares did not look negative to him. He sees it as part of a larger shift toward heavyweight issuers who can secure the scale required for an ETF launch.

The monthly Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram has turned negative, a development that historically signals the start of major bear markets. This Bitcoin bearish signal suggests the potential for a significant price correction, with analysis pointing toward a possible drop to $74,500. Let’s break down what this means for your portfolio. What Is This Bitcoin Bearish Signal Telling Us? The MACD is a momentum indicator traders use to spot changes in trend strength and direction. When its monthly histogram turns negative, it suggests that bearish momentum is building on a long-term timeframe. According to analysis reported by CoinDesk, this specific signal preceded the major bear markets of 2014, 2018, and 2022. Therefore, its reappearance now is a serious development that demands attention. This doesn’t mean an immediate crash is guaranteed. However, it confirms that the underlying market structure has shifted. The bulls are losing their long-term grip, and the bears are gaining control of the narrative. The key question now is: how far could the price fall? Key Price Levels to Watch: From $84.5K to $74.5K The analysis outlines a clear path of potential support breakdowns. The immediate line in the sand is the $84,500 level. If Bitcoin price breaks and closes below this support on a significant timeframe, it could trigger the next wave of selling. The primary target in that scenario becomes $74,500. A break below that could see prices tumble further into the low $70,000s. Here are the critical levels to monitor: $84,500: The crucial near-term support. A break here opens the door to lower targets. $74,500: The primary downside target identified by the analysis. Low $70,000s: The extended risk zone if selling pressure intensifies. Understanding these levels helps you manage risk. It’s not about predicting the future with certainty, but about preparing for probable scenarios. Historical Context: Why This Bearish Signal Matters History doesn’t repeat itself exactly, but it often rhymes. The monthly MACD histogram turning negative has been a reliable harbinger of prolonged downtrends. In 2014, after this signal, Bitcoin entered a brutal bear market that lasted over a year. The same pattern played out in early 2018 and again in 2022, each time preceding drops of 50% or more from the peak. This historical precedent is what gives the current Bitcoin bearish signal its weight. It’s a pattern recognized by institutional and veteran retail traders alike. Ignoring it could be a costly mistake, just as recognizing it early in past cycles provided a crucial exit signal. What Should Investors Do Now? First, don’t panic. A signal is information, not a command. Use this information to review your strategy. Consider the following actionable steps: Re-evaluate your risk exposure: Ensure your Bitcoin allocation aligns with your risk tolerance. Set stop-losses: Define clear exit points, perhaps below the $84,500 support, to protect capital. Avoid impulsive buying: The “buy the dip” mentality needs careful timing during a confirmed bearish shift. Focus on preservation: In potential bear markets, protecting your principal becomes the primary goal. The market is sending a clear message. Prudent investors will listen and adjust their sails rather than hoping the storm passes. Conclusion: Navigating the Shift with Caution The confirmation of a monthly MACD bearish crossover is a significant technical event for Bitcoin. It suggests the easy bullish momentum of the past year may be over, replaced by a phase of correction and consolidation. While the long-term thesis for cryptocurrency may remain intact, the short-to-medium-term path appears fraught with downside risk, with a potential target of $74,500. The wise approach is to respect the signal, manage risk aggressively, and prepare for increased volatility. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether this Bitcoin bearish signal marks the start of a deep correction or merely a healthy pause in a longer bull run. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does a negative MACD guarantee a Bitcoin price crash? A: No, it does not guarantee a crash. It is a strong warning signal indicating bearish momentum is building on a long-term chart. Price action and other factors must confirm the trend. Q2: How reliable has this specific signal been in the past? A: It has been a historically reliable indicator. It preceded the starts of the major bear markets in 2014, 2018, and 2022, making it a significant marker for analysts. Q3: Should I sell all my Bitcoin immediately? A: Not necessarily. This signal should prompt a review of your risk management strategy. Consider setting stop-losses, reducing exposure, or hedging rather than making panic-driven sales. Q4: What could invalidate this bearish outlook? A: A strong bullish reversal that pushes the Bitcoin price back above key resistance levels (like recent highs) and causes the monthly MACD histogram to turn positive again would invalidate the current warning. Q5: How long do these bearish MACD phases typically last? A: They can last for many months, often aligning with the duration of a major market correction or bear market, which historically have lasted over a year. Q6: Are other cryptocurrencies affected by this Bitcoin signal? A: Yes, typically. Bitcoin is the market leader. A confirmed long-term bearish trend for BTC often leads to even sharper declines in altcoins, as market sentiment turns risk-off. Found this analysis crucial for navigating the markets?

The debate is part of a wider divide over the powerful stablecoin issuer’s true balance-sheet strength. Tether Slams S&P Weak Rating Tether is pushing back hard against S&P Global’s decision to downgrade USDT’s ability to maintain its dollar peg, and argues that the ratings agency relied on an incomplete picture of the company’s balance sheet and long-term financial strength. The downgrade labeled USDT’s peg stability as “ weak ,” and immediately sparked fresh waves of fear and uncertainty around the world’s largest stablecoin. However, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino and several analysts say the concerns are overstated. According to Ardoino , S&P’s assessment ignored a big portion of Tether’s total assets and revenue streams. Pointing to the company’s Q3 2025 attestation , he said the Tether Group held roughly $215 billion in total assets at the end of the quarter, against about $184.5 billion in stablecoin liabilities. He explained that the company had about $7 billion in excess equity sitting on top of its reserves, in addition to some $23 billion in retained earnings in the broader Tether Group. That equity, he argued, is a critical buffer that S&P failed to include in its evaluation. Ardoino also mentioned that Tether generates roughly $500 million per month in base profits from US Treasury yields alone, which is a revenue stream that he says strengthens the company’s position and was not adequately reflected in the rating. The downgrade also reignited debate among market analysts over the composition and resilience of Tether’s reserves. Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMEX, suggested that Tether has been accumulating gold and Bitcoin to offset declining income as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. While Hayes believes those assets could appreciate, he warned that a sharp downturn of about 30% could theoretically erase Tether’s equity and push USDT into insolvency. However, not everyone agrees with that interpretation. Joseph Ayoub , formerly Citi’s lead digital asset analyst, rejected Hayes’ concerns and said his extensive research into Tether revealed a far more robust financial structure. According to Ayoub, Tether’s true asset base is larger than what is publicly reported, its business profitability is enormous, and its collateralization is stronger than that of traditional banks despite the company having only about 150 employees. That combination, he argued, makes predictions of imminent instability unfounded.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|USDT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-01 05:30:00

While these comments were spreading especially on social media, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino broke his silence and made a detailed statement. Citing the Q3 2025 verification report, Ardoino argued that Tether had accumulated not only reserves but also very strong group equity. He noted that the company had approximately $7 billion in excess equity as of the end of the quarter, exceeding its $184.5 billion stablecoin reserves. He also noted that the Tether Group had approximately $23 billion in retained earnings. Related News: Watch Out: Large Token Unlocking Events in 15 Altcoins This Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List Aggregating this data, Ardoino said Tether Group's total assets are approximately $215 billion, while its stablecoin liabilities are $184.5 billion. The biggest mistake some analysts and social media commentators are making, according to the CEO, is failing to account for this additional group equity and the roughly $500 million in underlying profits Tether generates each month from US bonds alone. Ardoino stated that even the international credit rating agency S&P made a similar mistake, and that some of the claims spreading on social media were not due to a “mathematical error” but rather to “competitive motivations.” *This is not investment advice.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has granted an expansion of the Major Payment Institution (MPI) license for Ripple Markets APAC. This Ripple Singapore approval is more than just paperwork; it’s a powerful endorsement that unlocks new possibilities for digital asset utilization in one of the world’s leading financial hubs. What Does This Ripple Singapore Approval Actually Mean? The Ripple Singapore approval from MAS is a formal license enhancement. It allows Ripple’s local subsidiary to broaden its suite of regulated digital payment token services. Previously, the license had specific limitations. Now, Ripple can legally offer a more comprehensive range of services to institutions and potentially explore new use cases within Singapore’s strict regulatory framework. This move signals deep regulatory confidence in Ripple’s operations and compliance standards. Why is Singapore Such a Crucial Market for Ripple? Singapore is not just another market; it’s a global fintech and crypto gateway for the Asia-Pacific region. The MAS is renowned for its clear, innovation-friendly yet rigorous regulatory approach. Securing this expanded Ripple Singapore approval provides a stable, trusted base of operations. Therefore, Ripple can now leverage Singapore’s position to serve a vast network of banks and financial institutions across APAC with greater authority and legal clarity. This strategic foothold is invaluable for scaling its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution and other enterprise services. What Are the Immediate Benefits and Future Implications? This development brings several tangible advantages. For Ripple’s existing and potential partners, it means: Enhanced Trust: Operating under a full MAS MPI license boosts institutional confidence. Service Expansion: Ability to offer more diverse digital payment token products legally. Market Leadership: Strengthens Ripple’s position as a compliant blockchain player in APAC. Moreover, this Ripple Singapore approval could serve as a blueprint for engaging with regulators in other jurisdictions, demonstrating a proven path to compliance. How Does This Fit Into Ripple’s Global Strategy? Despite ongoing challenges in other regions, notably the United States, Ripple is executing a clear global strategy focused on regions with progressive digital asset regulations. The Ripple Singapore approval is a cornerstone of this plan. By solidifying its presence in Singapore, Ripple ensures it has a powerful operational hub to drive adoption in markets that are actively embracing blockchain for cross-border payments. This approval is a testament to focusing resources where regulatory landscapes are most conducive to growth. What Challenges Remain on the Horizon? While this is a triumph, the path forward still requires navigation. The broader cryptocurrency market faces volatility, and global regulatory fragmentation persists. Ripple must continue to: Maintain impeccable compliance within Singapore’s evolving rules. Translate this regulatory win into significant commercial partnerships and volume. Continue its legal efforts in other key markets to create a more unified global framework. The Ripple Singapore approval is a major battle won, but the campaign for widespread blockchain payment adoption continues. Conclusion: A Validation of Compliance and Strategy The expanded MPI license from the MAS is a powerful validation for Ripple. It underscores that with a focus on regulatory collaboration and robust compliance, blockchain payment companies can secure their place within the traditional financial system. This Ripple Singapore approval is not an endpoint but a launchpad. It provides a stable, reputable foundation from which Ripple can accelerate its mission to transform global value movement, proving that innovation and regulation can, and must, coexist. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What specific services can Ripple now offer in Singapore? The expanded Major Payment Institution license allows Ripple Markets APAC to offer a wider range of regulated digital payment token services. This typically includes facilitating cross-border transfers, currency exchange, and dealing in digital payment tokens for institutional clients. Why is the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s approval so important? The MAS is a highly respected global financial regulator. Its approval signifies that Ripple’s operations meet stringent anti-money laundering, risk management, and technological standards, building immense trust with other financial institutions in the region. How does this affect the price of XRP? While positive regulatory news can influence market sentiment, cryptocurrency prices are affected by many factors. This approval is a strong fundamental positive for Ripple’s business utility, but direct short-term price impact is unpredictable. Does this mean Ripple is moving its headquarters to Singapore? No. Ripple’s global headquarters remains in the United States. This approval strengthens its Asia-Pacific subsidiary, Ripple Markets APAC, making Singapore a key operational hub for the region. What other countries have given similar approvals to Ripple? Ripple holds various licenses and registrations in several jurisdictions, including a Major Payment Institution license in Singapore, a Virtual Asset Service Provider registration in Ireland, and approvals to operate in parts of the UAE and the UK. Can individual investors in Singapore use Ripple’s services now? The expanded license primarily enables Ripple to offer services to other payment institutions and large enterprises (B2B). It does not typically mean direct services for retail consumers. Found this analysis of Ripple’s strategic regulatory win insightful?

55188832,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=224395,1764568511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Asia FX Market Reveals Crucial Stability as Fed Cut Bets Intensify and Yen Surges,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asia-fx-fed-cuts-yen-forex/,"BitcoinWorld Asia FX Market Reveals Crucial Stability as Fed Cut Bets Intensify and Yen Surges The forex market is witnessing a fascinating divergence as Asian currencies find stability while the Japanese yen makes significant gains. This development comes amid growing expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts and signals of policy tightening from the Bank of Japan. For cryptocurrency investors, these traditional market movements provide crucial context for understanding broader financial liquidity and risk appetite trends. Why Is Asia FX Showing Remarkable Stability? Most Asian currencies are trading within narrow ranges as markets digest the implications of potential Federal Reserve policy shifts. The stability in Asia FX markets reflects several key factors: Reduced volatility in US Treasury yields Improved risk sentiment across emerging markets Balanced capital flows between regions Technical support levels holding firm This stability is particularly notable given the historical sensitivity of Asian currencies to US monetary policy changes. The current calm suggests markets have largely priced in expected Fed actions. How Fed Rate Cut Expectations Are Reshaping Markets The growing consensus around Fed rate cuts has become the dominant theme in global currency markets. Several factors are driving this expectation: Factor Impact on Fed Policy Timeline Cooling inflation data Reduces pressure for hikes Immediate Labor market normalization Allows for policy easing 3-6 months Global economic concerns Supports preventive cuts 6-12 months Market pricing now suggests a high probability of rate cuts beginning in the second half of 2024. This expectation is supporting risk assets globally while putting downward pressure on the US dollar. The Yen’s Surprising Strength: BOJ Policy Shift Explained The Japanese yen has emerged as one of the strongest performers in recent sessions, driven by clear signals from the Bank of Japan. Several developments suggest a major policy shift: BOJ officials discussing exit from negative interest rates Growing inflation expectations in Japan Reduced bond purchase operations Forward guidance emphasizing policy normalization This represents a fundamental change from the BOJ’s decade-long ultra-accommodative stance. The implications extend beyond currency markets to global bond yields and carry trade dynamics. Bank of Japan’s Historic Policy Transition The Bank of Japan appears ready to end its extraordinary monetary stimulus program. This transition involves several critical steps: First, abandoning negative interest rate policy Second, allowing 10-year bond yields to rise above current caps Third, reducing balance sheet expansion Finally, establishing a new policy framework This policy normalization could trigger significant capital flows as Japanese investors repatriate funds and global investors adjust positions. Forex Market Implications and Trading Opportunities The current forex market environment presents both challenges and opportunities for traders: Currency Pair Current Trend Key Drivers USD/JPY Bearish BOJ policy, Fed expectations AUD/USD Range-bound Commodity prices, China data EUR/JPY Corrective Yield differentials, risk sentiment Successful navigation of this environment requires understanding both technical levels and fundamental policy developments. Actionable Insights for Currency Traders Based on current market developments, several strategies merit consideration: Monitor Fed speaker comments for policy clues Watch Japanese inflation data for BOJ timing signals Consider yield differential trades as policies diverge Implement appropriate risk management given volatility shifts The convergence of these policy shifts creates unique conditions that may not persist indefinitely. Conclusion: Navigating the New Currency Landscape The simultaneous developments in Fed policy expectations and BOJ normalization signals are creating a transformed currency market landscape. Asian currency stability provides a foundation for strategic positioning, while yen strength offers specific trading opportunities. As these central bank narratives evolve, market participants must remain agile, informed, and disciplined in their approach to currency exposure. To learn more about the latest forex market trends, explore our articles on key developments shaping currency movements and central bank policies. Frequently Asked Questions What is driving Fed rate cut expectations? Cooling inflation data, labor market normalization, and global economic concerns are contributing to expectations that the Federal Reserve may begin cutting rates in 2024. Why is the Bank of Japan considering policy changes? The Bank of Japan is responding to sustained inflation above its target and concerns about financial market distortions from prolonged ultra-loose policy. How are Asian currencies typically affected by Fed policy? Asian currencies generally strengthen when the Fed cuts rates, as lower US yields reduce the dollar’s attractiveness and support risk appetite in emerging markets. What are the risks of trading the current yen movement? Key risks include sudden policy reversals, intervention by Japanese authorities, and unexpected global risk-off events that could boost safe-haven dollar demand. How do currency movements affect cryptocurrency markets? Currency volatility and central bank policies influence global liquidity conditions, risk appetite, and capital flows that indirectly impact cryptocurrency valuations and trading patterns.

With the current sentiment turning toward the negative, expectations remain that the next move for the Bitcoin price will likely be a rapid price crash. This seems to be supported by technical patterns that show that the cryptocurrency has broken below a major level . As previous performances show, the possibility that BTC will follow the historical trend is high and ultimately bearish for the price. Why The Bitcoin Price Could Crash As sentiment has plummeted and sell-offs have intensified, so have the probabilities for a crash risen. One major development that suggests that further decline could be coming is that the bitcoin price has lost a trend line on the log chart, a move that is historically bearish for the price. Crypto analyst and CMT-certifed expert Tony “The Bull” Spilotro, highlighted this development, showing the bearish move. According to Spilotro, the Bitcoin price has now lost the log chart trendline that began back in 2024, and this holds immense consequences for the cryptocurrency. Historically, whenever the Bitcoin price has lost this trend line on the log chart, the result has always been very bearish. The usual end result has been a crash in price; thus, it is important to keep an eye on this break. If it holds, it would mean that the BTC price decline is far from over. The crypto analyst explains that the fractal might not be a given, and may not play out exactly, but that doesn’t mean it’s not important. “The fractal isn’t a guarantee, but a valid example of losing a linear trend line on a log chart not being something you should ignore,” Spilotro stated. Essentially, if the trend does end up playing out as expected , then it would mean that the Bitcoin price crash is far from over. So far, there have been analysts warning of lower prices, with some expecting BTC to go as low as $50,000 .",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-01 06:00:00

This move implied that the company would solidify its position as the largest licensed virtual asset exchange in the region. During the event, Guotai Junan International, JPMorgan Chase, and Guotai Haitong Securities acted as joint sponsors for the listing hearing process. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong-based financial services group plays a significant role in the digital asset finance industry. To illustrate this claim, sources noted that it provides users with a licensed digital asset platform that assists them with transactions, on-chain services, and asset management. HashKey aims to solidify its position as a leader in the crypto space with an IPO Reports have revealed that HashKey has evolved into a well-rounded digital asset firm in Asia, extending its reach globally. The company has achieved this milestone by offering a complete financial infrastructure, tech-related solutions, and investment management, establishing a reliable digital asset ecosystem. Regarding HashKey’s listing motive , October reports highlighted that the company had privately applied for an initial public offering (IPO) in the city, citing information they received from sources with knowledge of the matter. The sources, who wished to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the situation, also hinted that the IPO could possibly raise as much as $500 million. At this time, talks about the listing were still ongoing, while sources suggested that some factors, such as firm valuation and timing, might be adjusted. When reporters reached out to a representative from HashKey for comments on their progress, the spokesperson claimed that they did not have any details to share with the public about the listing. HashKey’s IPO plan followed Hong Kong’s decision to launch a regulatory framework specifically for virtual assets, aimed at enhancing its position as a center for digital assets. This regulatory framework was introduced last year after officials discovered that interest from crypto investors in China significantly mounted despite Beijing imposing a ban on these assets in 2021. However, even with this finding, China still views digital assets as illegal and argues that business activities related to these assets pose risks. Meanwhile, crypto analysts predicted that if HashKey succeeded in going public, then it would reveal the escalation in crypto-related investments in Asia. HashKey’s target for an IPO demonstrates the growing trend among crypto companies to go public. To support this claim, sources pointed out that an American-based stablecoin issuer, Circle Internet Group Inc., raised approximately $1.1 billion in a bigger offering last June. Since then, the fintech company’s stocks have reportedly increased by 385%. Hong Kong seeks to become a hub for digital assets As Hong Kong aims to become a leading center for digital finance, while the global crypto Industry remains cautious following recent market fluctuations, Thai cryptocurrency exchange Bitkub announced its intention to secure an IPO in Hong Kong last month. With this announcement, analysts have acknowledged that this move could help enhance the city’s reputation as a hub for digital assets. Established in 2018, Bitkub had earlier explored an IPO in Thailand. However, Thailand has faced criticism after reports revealed that the country’s stock market has been one of the poorest performers worldwide in 2025. Listings confirmed this claim, illustrating an average decline of more than 12%. Moreover, the SET Index dropped by about 10% this year. Even with these challenges, Bitkub demonstrates its commitment to securing the IPO. One source familiar with the situation mentioned that the cryptocurrency exchange is likely to start processing its Hong Kong IPO as soon as next year, with a target of raising about $200 million.

The fund aims to make XRP accessible to institutions that face compliance limits on holding crypto. Advisors and funds that could not touch the underlying asset can now allocate to XRP via a standard ticker. This removes many operational hurdles. It also reduces the friction for wealth managers who prefer familiar securities. Why Institutions Matter Large institutions move capital at scale. An ETF structure makes it easier for hedge funds and asset managers to trade XRP through custody that meets institutional rules. The product also allows investment advisors to include the digital asset in client portfolios without managing wallets. That should widen the pool of potential buyers. The immediate effect will be a larger, more visible trading presence for XRP across regulated venues. ETFs can also positively impact XRP’s price , as they expose the asset to a vast new market. Market Reception So Far Early spot XRP funds showed strong demand. Canary Capital recorded $58 million in trading volume on day one . Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and Grayscale have also launched products that drew meaningful flows. The rapid rollout of several spot XRP ETFs suggests a coordinated market response after regulatory clarity improved. More funds are also on the horizon . TOXR will join these funds and compete for investor attention. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What to Watch Next Early trading data will show whether TOXR adds sustained liquidity. Exchange balances and on-chain movement will also signal whether ETF activity alters available supply or remains isolated within fund structures. XRP supply on exchanges is shrinking , and demand from ETFs could cause a supply shock, potentially driving its price up. The 21Shares Spot XRP ETF marks a major step for XRP adoption in regulated finance. It simplifies access for institutions and advisors. Early entrants, such as Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, and Bitwise, have already proved that the market will trade spot XRP products. TOXR will expand the market and contribute to XRP’s price growth. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This futuristic vision is moving closer to reality. Sony Bank, the digital banking arm of the iconic Sony Group, has just reaffirmed its ambitious plan to launch a U.S. dollar-pegged Sony Bank stablecoin in early 2026. This move could fundamentally reshape how millions interact with Sony’s vast entertainment universe. What is Sony Bank’s Stablecoin Plan? Sony Bank intends to issue a cryptocurrency pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. The primary goal is to create a seamless payment system within the sprawling Sony ecosystem. This means you could potentially use the Sony Bank stablecoin to purchase in-game items, subscribe to services, or buy digital movies and music. By controlling the payment rail, Sony aims to create a tighter, more efficient digital economy for its customers. The company had previously signaled this move in October by applying for a U.S. banking license to establish a dedicated subsidiary for this venture. The recent reaffirmation shows their commitment is unwavering, targeting a launch in the first part of 2026. Why is a Sony Stablecoin a Game-Changer? For a conglomerate like Sony, which spans gaming, music, film, and electronics, introducing its own stablecoin offers significant advantages: Frictionless Transactions: Eliminate currency conversion fees and bank delays for international customers. Enhanced User Loyalty: Create a closed-loop economy that encourages users to stay within the Sony ecosystem. Valuable Data Insights: Gain a clearer understanding of consumer spending habits across different entertainment verticals. Innovation Platform: The Sony Bank stablecoin could enable new features like micro-transactions, tokenized rewards, and programmable money for developers. What’s the Major Roadblock for Sony Bank? However, this bold plan isn’t without its hurdles. The path to launching the Sony Bank stablecoin faces serious regulatory scrutiny. The Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA), a powerful lobbying group, has actively moved to block Sony’s application. The ICBA accuses Sony of trying to exploit a regulatory loophole to operate as a bank without facing the same stringent oversight as traditional financial institutions. This opposition highlights the tense battle between innovative tech giants and the established financial guard, a central conflict in the world of digital assets. What Does This Mean for Crypto Adoption? Sony’s push into stablecoins is a powerful signal of institutional adoption. When a household name with Sony’s global reach enters the space, it lends immense credibility. This move could encourage other entertainment and tech giants to explore similar digital currency strategies, accelerating mainstream acceptance. Furthermore, a successful launch would demonstrate a practical, large-scale use case for stablecoins beyond trading and speculation. It would show how blockchain-based payments can integrate directly into consumer entertainment, making crypto tangible for everyday people. Conclusion: A High-Stakes Digital Frontier Sony Bank’s reaffirmed commitment to its 2026 Sony Bank stablecoin launch sets the stage for a pivotal moment in fintech and entertainment. The potential to unify a massive digital ecosystem is immense, promising convenience and new experiences for users. Yet, the fierce opposition from traditional banking groups serves as a stark reminder that regulatory approval is the final, crucial boss level that must be conquered. The world will be watching to see if Sony can successfully merge the worlds of gaming, finance, and cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the Sony Bank stablecoin? A1: It is a planned digital currency, or cryptocurrency, that Sony Bank intends to issue. It will be a “stablecoin,” meaning its value is designed to be pegged 1:1 with the U.S. dollar to avoid the price volatility seen in assets like Bitcoin. Q2: When will the Sony stablecoin launch? A2: Sony Bank has reaffirmed its target to issue the stablecoin in the United States in early 2026. Q3: What can I use the Sony stablecoin for? A3: The primary purpose is for payments within the Sony ecosystem. This could include purchasing PlayStation games and in-game content, paying for anime streaming subscriptions, buying music, and other digital goods and services across Sony’s companies. Q4: Why are some banks opposing this plan? A4: The Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) argues that Sony is attempting to become a bank without undergoing the full regulatory scrutiny required for traditional banks, calling it an exploitation of a loophole. Q5: Will this stablecoin be available worldwide? A5: Initial reports focus on a launch in the United States. Global availability would depend on navigating the complex web of cryptocurrency regulations in different countries, which is a significant future challenge. Q6: Is my money safe with a Sony stablecoin? A6: Safety would depend on the underlying structure. A reputable stablecoin should be fully backed by real U.S. dollar reserves held in secure, audited accounts. Sony’s ability to ensure this and gain regulatory trust will be critical for user adoption. Found this deep dive into Sony’s crypto ambitions fascinating?

Saylor is known to typically make these updates just before MicroStrategy announces new Bitcoin purchases. The company has previously officially announced its new BTC holdings in the days following these posts. Therefore, the market is focused on the possibility of another announcement from MicroStrategy about increasing its Bitcoin holdings next week. Saylor used the phrase “What happens if we start adding green dots?” in her post, giving the message that new purchases may be on the way. Related News: Watch Out: Large Token Unlocking Events in 15 Altcoins This Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List In response to this development, Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff issued a scathing assessment of Saylor and his company's policies. Schiff argued that MicroStrategy's strategy was risky for investors, saying, “You will continue to average your Bitcoin cost upwards and destroy more value for shareholders.” Updated Bitcoin Tracker data shows that MicroStrategy holds 649,870 BTC. The portfolio's total value is approximately $59.45 billion. The average cost is $74,433, and the current profitability is 22.91%, resulting in a profit of approximately $11.08 billion. *This is not investment advice.

Right now, the data from the world’s largest crypto exchanges is telling a clear story: traders are leaning bearish. Recent figures show that shorts hold a slight edge in Bitcoin perpetual futures across major platforms. This subtle shift in positioning can be a powerful signal for understanding near-term market sentiment and potential price pressure. What Do the Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Ratios Tell Us? The long/short ratio is a simple but vital metric. It shows the percentage of open positions betting the price will go up (long) versus down (short). Over the last 24 hours, the aggregate data from the top three exchanges by open interest reveals a cautious mood. The overall ratio sits at 47.87% long to 52.13% short. This means for every 100 traders in these markets, slightly more are positioned for a decline than a rally. Let’s break down the numbers by exchange to see the consistency of this trend: Binance: 47.99% long / 52.01% short OKX: 48.06% long / 51.94% short Bybit: 47.44% long / 52.56% short As you can see, the pattern is remarkably uniform. Each major venue shows shorts outnumbering longs, with Bybit displaying the most pronounced bearish skew. This alignment suggests a broad-based, not isolated, sentiment shift among futures traders. Why Should You Care About This Slight Edge? You might think a 4-5% difference is insignificant. However, in the highly leveraged world of Bitcoin perpetual futures , even a small imbalance can have outsized effects. These markets are where much of the daily trading volume and volatility originate. When shorts gain an edge, it often indicates that professional traders are: Expecting a pullback or consolidation. Hedging their spot Bitcoin holdings against potential downside. Reacting to specific technical levels or macroeconomic news. Therefore, this data acts as a real-time sentiment gauge. It doesn’t guarantee a price drop, but it highlights where the weight of speculative money is leaning at this moment. How Can Traders Use This Insight? So, what’s the actionable takeaway? First, don’t treat this as a standalone sell signal. Market sentiment is just one piece of the puzzle. However, a sustained edge for shorts in Bitcoin perpetual futures can warn of increased selling pressure or a lack of bullish conviction. Savvy traders might use this information to: Adjust risk: Be more cautious with highly leveraged long positions. Watch key levels: Pay closer attention to major support zones where a wave of short covering could trigger a sharp rally. Seek confirmation: Combine this futures data with on-chain metrics and spot market volume for a fuller picture. Remember, these ratios can flip quickly. A piece of positive news or a technical breakout can force shorts to buy back their positions, fueling a powerful upward move—an event known as a ‘short squeeze.’ The Bottom Line on Current Futures Sentiment In conclusion, the data presents a clear snapshot: the crowd in the derivatives market is currently leaning bearish. The slight edge for shorts across Binance, OKX, and Bybit’s Bitcoin perpetual futures markets is a flag of caution, not a prophecy. It tells us that experienced traders are hedging or betting on limited upside in the immediate term. For the broader market, this means volatility may be amplified, and key support levels will be critically tested. Always pair this derivative sentiment with other analyses before making any trading decision. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are Bitcoin perpetual futures? A: They are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on Bitcoin’s future price without an expiry date, using leverage. Q: Does a short edge mean the Bitcoin price will definitely fall? A: Not necessarily. It indicates current sentiment but is not a perfect predictor. Markets can remain irrational, and shorts can be forced to cover, causing rallies. Q: Which exchange has the most bearish ratio currently? A> Based on the latest 24-hour data, Bybit shows the highest percentage of short positions at 52.56%. Q: How often do these long/short ratios change? A> They update in real-time and can shift dramatically within hours based on price action and news. Q: Should retail traders copy these futures positions? A> Caution is advised. Futures trading, especially with leverage, is high-risk. These ratios are best used as a sentiment tool, not a direct trading signal. Q: Where can I check these ratios myself? A> Many cryptocurrency data websites (like Coinglass) provide real-time long/short ratios for major exchanges. Share This Insight Did this breakdown of Bitcoin perpetual futures sentiment help you?

Speaking on a recent podcast with Indian entrepreneur and investor Nikhil Kamath, Musk said that he thinks “money disappears as a concept” eventually. He called that idea “kind of strange,” but argued that in a future where “anyone can have anything,” people “no longer need money as a database for labor allocation.” He linked that vision directly to advances in artificial intelligence and robotics. “If AI and robotics are big enough to satisfy all human needs then, then money is no longer… its relevance declines dramatically,” he said. To ground the idea, Musk pointed to science fiction. He cited the Culture series books by Scottish author Iain Banks, and recommended that people read them. JUST IN: Elon Musk says #Bitcoin is a fundamental currency based on energy “Energy is the true currency” pic.twitter.com/sTWKLKV0Fd — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) November 30, 2025 Energy Replaces Money In Musk’s Future Vision And Bitcoin Fits The Model In that far future setting, he noted, “they don’t have money either, and everyone can pretty much have whatever they want.” Even in such a post-scarcity world, Musk said that some forms of value still matter. There are “some fundamental currencies, if you will, that are physics-based,” he told Kamath, then shifted the conversation toward energy. “Energy is the true currency,” he said. That line set up his argument for why Bitcoin fits this picture. “This is why I say Bitcoin is based on energy,” Musk continued. The network’s design forces miners to spend real electricity and computation to secure the system, which in his view ties digital value to the physical world. Musk Frames Energy As The Ultimate Store Of Power Outside Government Policy Musk then drew a clear line between energy and political power. “You can’t legislate energy,” he said. “You can’t just, you know, pass a law and suddenly have a lot of energy.” He called it “very difficult to to generate energy, especially to harness energy in a useful way, to do useful work.” “We probably will just have energy, power generation as the de facto currency,” he said. In that framing, whoever controls the most efficient and abundant energy sources effectively controls the strongest “currency.” That idea resonates with Bitcoin’s proof-of-work model, which already converts electricity and hardware into verifiable digital scarcity. Supporters often argue that this link to real-world energy cost creates a monetary system that cannot be inflated by central banks or rewritten by politicians. Regulators And Activists Still Clash Over Whether Bitcoin Hurts Or Helps Energy Systems Musk’s remarks arrive while Bitcoin’s energy use remains one of the most contested issues in policy circles. Environmental critics worry about carbon footprints and grid strain, while advocates say mining can incentivize cleaner generation and better load balancing for power networks. He did not set any timeline for a shift to an energy-based value regime, and his scenario assumes a level of AI and robotic abundance that is still speculative. For now, national currencies and conventional payment rails continue to dominate trade, savings and salaries, while Bitcoin trades as an asset that doubles as a long-term bet on a different kind of monetary order.

The pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, following the conclusion of the highly successful presale. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market reported a sudden crash following a surge in liquidations. Bitcoin (BTC) is down nearly 6% over the past 24 hours, falling to $86,000 and triggering $539 million in liquidations. Husky Inu (HINU) Rises To $0.00023120 Husky Inu (HINU) has completed the latest price increase of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00023032 to $0.00023120. The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, following the conclusion of its presale. The regular price rises during the pre-launch phase aim to empower the Husky Inu community and continue its fundraising efforts as the launch date approaches. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. A Dynamic Pricing Strategy The project adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, allowing it to increase the HINU token’s value every two days. This has been instrumental in the project’s fundraising efforts, helping it cross key fundraising milestones. It has also helped Husky Inu raise funds while maintaining a favorable price for its fledgling community, rewarding early adopters of the project while promoting transparent growth. Husky Inu’s fundraising efforts crossed $900,000 in October. The project has raised $905,406 so far, and remains on track to reach its stated goal of $1.2 million. Husky Inu crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached its latest milestone in record time, crossing $850,000 on July 25. Launch Date Husky Inu’s official launch date, March 27, 2026, is only four months away. However, the team behind the project remains open to an early launch. The team plans to hold a series of strategic review meetings to assess market conditions and determine the best time for the project’s launch. The project team held its first review meeting on July 1, 2025, while the second review meeting was held on October 1, 2025. The final review meeting is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Cryptocurrency Market Crashes As Liquidations Surge Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has started December with a sharp drop, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other tokens trading in the red. BTC is down nearly 6% at $85,880, triggering a wave of liquidations. Meanwhile, ETH is down 6%, trading around $2,828, while Ripple (XRP) is down 7.50% as it struggles to stay above $2. Solana (SOL) is down over 7% at $126, while Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) are down around 8%. Chainlink (LINK) is also down over 7%, trading around $12.10. Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) have also recorded sharp declines over the past 24 hours. As a result, the crypto market cap is down over 5% at $2.93 trillion.

Discussions between the two companies are reportedly in the advanced stages, and they intend to apply for one of the EU-funded large data centers. Handelsblatt reported on Sunday that the DAX-listed telecoms giant and unlisted retailer Schwarz are targeting the $23.4 billion (~€20 billion) earmarked by the EU for the construction of large data centers in Europe. However, a formal agreement has not yet been reached or signed. Meanwhile, the region hopes to catch up with China and the U.S. through these projects. According to the report, collaborations for the construction of these large data centers in Europe are imminent. Schwarz CEO Gerd Chrzanowski and Telekom CEO Timotheus Höttges initiated the new collaboration, according to insider reports. Brookfield, a Canadian financial investor, could reportedly also support the project as a financier. Telekom seeks to elevate Germany’s AI dominance A Telekom spokesperson stated that the company is interested in establishing Germany’s dominance in the AI race through the EU AI gigafactory projects. However, the spokesperson declined to comment on the joint bid with Schwarz. Brookfield and Schwarz apparently also declined to comment on the potential collaborations when contacted. However, a top manager from the Schwarz Group had previously hinted at the cooperation between the two companies in public. Rolf Schumann, co-CEO of the digital subsidiary Schwarz Digits, also stated at the mid-November summit for European digital sovereignty that his company will join forces with Deutsche Telekom to bring one of the gigafactories to Germany. Höttges was reportedly standing a few meters from Schumann during this revelation. Deutsche Telekom, SAP, Schwarz, and Ionos reportedly came together a few months ago to pursue EU funding for a large data center in Germany . The consortium aims to strengthen Europe’s position in the face of competition from the U.S. and China. Meanwhile, the EU plans to fund three to five large AI data centers across the European continent. The European Commission also intends to tap public funding through the European Investment Bank to attract private investors to the project. Each of the facilities requires an investment of nearly ~$3.39 billion to $5.66 billion (€3 to €5 billion) and is expected to house at least 100,000 AI chips capable of training agile AI models. Europe fires back in the global AI race Christine Knackfuss-Nicoli, the CTO of Deutsche Telekom’s T-Systems division, recently emphasized the urgency of establishing independent AI infrastructure in Europe. She pointed out that this is the window of opportunity for Germany and Europe to establish an independent AI infrastructure. “Rarely before have the signs and the common will in Europe been as strong as they are today.” – Christine Knackfuss-Nicoli , CTO of Deutsche Telekom’s T-Systems division Deutsche Telekom operates 16 data centers and announced last year plans to expand and establish up to five additional sites. The company has also implemented AI systems within its existing networks and data centers to improve energy efficiency. Meanwhile, cloud solutions provider Ionos stated that it is in discussions with the German government and several companies regarding the EU’s AI gigafactories program. The company added that, in principle, it views the European Commission’s AI infrastructure initiative as an essential step towards Europe’s AI independence and is interested in participating. European infrastructure reportedly lacks the necessary computational capacity to train large-scale AI models , resulting in a dependency on facilities in other regions. The EU’s initiative allegedly responds to Europe’s concerns about its competitiveness in AI development. Each of the proposed AI gigafactories will function as a high-capacity hub with significant automation and computational capabilities. The AI gigafactories also seek to strengthen the digital sovereignty of individual EU member states.

Starting at 7:00 a.m. UTC on December 2, Bithumb will suspend all Siacoin (SC) deposits and withdrawals. This proactive Bithumb SC suspension is not a cause for alarm but a necessary step to ensure a smooth network upgrade for the Siacoin blockchain. Let’s break down what this means for you and why it’s actually a positive sign for the ecosystem. Why is Bithumb Suspending SC Transactions? The core reason is straightforward: to support a Siacoin network upgrade. When a blockchain undergoes a significant update or hard fork, exchanges like Bithumb must pause external transactions. This precaution is standard industry practice. It allows their technical teams to safely integrate the new network protocol, test the updated wallet systems, and prevent any potential loss of user funds during the transition. Therefore, this Bithumb SC suspension is a routine operational safety measure. What Does This Mean for Your SC Holdings? Understanding the scope of this suspension is crucial for peace of mind. Here’s a clear breakdown of what is and isn’t affected: Deposits and Withdrawals (External): These are temporarily paused . You cannot send SC to your Bithumb wallet from an external source, nor can you withdraw SC from Bithumb to another wallet. Trading (Internal): This is typically unaffected . You can likely still buy, sell, and trade SC against other cryptocurrencies like KRW or BTC on the Bithumb exchange platform itself. Account Security: Your SC balance remains safe and secure in your Bithumb account. The suspension only affects the movement of coins on and off the exchange. The key takeaway? Your assets are secure, and your ability to trade may continue uninterrupted. How Should You Prepare for the Bithumb SC Suspension? A little preparation can prevent last-minute stress. Mark your calendar for the start time: 7:00 a.m. UTC on December 2 . If you have an urgent need to move SC, complete your deposit or withdrawal well before this deadline. More importantly, keep an eye on official Bithumb announcements for the resumption time. Network upgrades can sometimes take longer than initially estimated. Rely only on official Bithumb communication channels for the all-clear, not third-party rumors. Is This a Common Practice in Crypto? Absolutely. Exchanges regularly pause transactions for network upgrades, hard forks, or wallet maintenance. This demonstrates Bithumb’s commitment to operational integrity and user asset security. A proactive Bithumb SC suspension is far better than encountering unexpected issues mid-upgrade. It shows the exchange is actively supporting the Siacoin project’s development, which is a long-term positive for the SC community and its liquidity on a major South Korean platform. Conclusion: A Temporary Pause for Long-Term Gain The temporary Bithumb SC suspension for deposits and withdrawals is a standard, safety-first procedure. It facilitates a crucial Siacoin network upgrade, ensuring the exchange’s infrastructure remains compatible and secure. For users, it means a short period of limited transaction types but underscores the exchange’s responsible management. By planning ahead and monitoring official updates, you can navigate this routine maintenance window smoothly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Can I still trade SC on Bithumb during the suspension? In most cases, yes. The suspension typically applies only to depositing to and withdrawing from the exchange. Trading SC for other assets on the Bithumb platform itself is usually unaffected, but always confirm via their official notice. How long will the SC deposit and withdrawal suspension last? Bithumb has not specified an end time, only a start time. The duration depends on the complexity of the network upgrade. It could be a few hours or extend longer. Users should monitor Bithumb’s official announcements for the resumption notice. Is my SC safe on Bithumb during this time? Yes. Your SC holdings in your Bithumb account are not at risk due to this planned maintenance. The suspension is a protective measure to ensure no coins are lost during the technical integration of the new network rules. What happens if I try to send SC to Bithumb during the suspension? It is strongly advised not to do so. Transactions sent to a suspended deposit address may be lost or require lengthy manual recovery by support. Always wait for the official confirmation that deposits have been re-enabled. Will other exchanges also suspend SC transactions? Possibly. Other exchanges that support Siacoin may announce similar suspension windows for their own network upgrades. Each exchange operates independently, so you must check announcements from your specific trading platform. Why does a network upgrade require a transaction suspension? During an upgrade, the blockchain’s rules change. If an exchange continued processing transactions, it might accidentally send coins using the old rules to a network operating on new rules, leading to permanent loss. The suspension eliminates this risk. Found this guide on the Bithumb SC suspension helpful?

Key Takeaways: Ripple won approval from Singapore’s central bank to expand regulated payment services for banks and corporates. The wider license allows Ripple to scale infrastructure for faster, cheaper cross-border transactions using RLUSD and XRP. The move supports Ripple’s Asia-Pacific expansion as regional on-chain activity jumps roughly 70% year over year. The company said Monday that its local unit, Ripple Markets APAC, has been cleared by the Monetary Authority of Singapore under its Major Payment Institution (MPI) license to expand regulated payment activities. The decision enables the firm to broaden the services it can offer to banks and corporates in the city-state’s tightly supervised financial market. Ripple President: Singapore Approval Sets Stage for Bigger Investment Push Ripple President Monica Long said the company values Singapore’s regulatory stance and sees the broader license as a foundation for further investment. She added that the move would help Ripple build infrastructure for financial institutions seeking faster and more secure cross-border payments. At the center of those services is Ripple Payments, which connects clients to on- and off-ramps for collections, custody, currency conversion and payouts. The system uses digital payment tokens such as RLUSD and XRP to settle transactions across borders, aiming to reduce fees and processing times for corporate users moving money internationally. Singapore has been part of Ripple’s strategy since 2017. The firm first secured its MPI license in 2023, allowing it to provide regulated digital token services. While the MAS registry still lists token-related activities under the license, the company says the latest approval widens its operating scope beyond those functions, positioning it to offer a broader set of institutional services. Huge news from Singapore: https://t.co/KVxTs7IEKc The @MAS_sg has approved an expanded scope of payment activities for our Major Payment Institution license – enabling us to deliver end-to-end, fully licensed payment services to our customers in the region. — Ripple (@Ripple) December 1, 2025 The regulatory milestone arrives alongside an acquisition drive designed to support enterprise clients. In early November, Ripple bought Palisade, a wallet and custodian provider, as part of a plan to bundle custody with payments and liquidity tools for large customers. Regional growth has been a key driver. Ripple Asia-Pacific head Fiona Murray said on-chain activity in the region has climbed about 70% year-over-year, with Singapore at what she called “the center of that growth.” She said the expanded permissions will help Ripple deliver regulated services “to the institutions driving that growth.” Ripple’s RLUSD Wins Regulatory Green Light in Abu Dhabi Last week, Ripple’s dollar-backed stablecoin RLUSD was cleared for institutional use in Abu Dhabi after receiving recognition as an Accepted Fiat-Referenced Token from the local regulator. The approval allows licensed firms within Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) to use RLUSD for regulated financial activities inside the free-zone financial center. The green light was granted by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, which supervises ADGM. Under the rules, companies can deploy RLUSD if they meet requirements around reserves, transparency, and compliance. The decision strengthens Ripple’s expansion across the UAE. In recent months, the company secured approvals in Dubai and Abu Dhabi and onboarded partners including Zand Bank and Mamo. As reported, Ripple is also weighing whether to bring staking to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , a move that would push the decade-old blockchain deeper into the rapidly expanding world of decentralized finance.

This came about due to improved market liquidity and a fresh fascination with large-cap alternative coins, leading to a positive outlook on the future price direction of Ethereum. On the other hand, investors are currently setting their sights on Mutuum Finance, a DeFi crypto that has quickly emerged within 2025’s most-watched presale assets. Mutuum Finance is currently over 95% finished with Phase 6 and boasts well over 18,270 registered investors alongside an astonishing value of a whopping $19.03 million invested, quickly making it a must-be player for those seeking a high-growth potential DeFi crypto within the blockchain industry ahead of its V1 launch. Ethereum Exhibits New Strength, With Bulls Aiming Higher Ethereum (ETH) is displaying fresh bullish impulses after strong rebounds from the support line and the major 78.60% Fibonacci level, indicating a potential initiation of a recovery phase among buyers. There is currently a developing corrective channel on the charts, along with a series of failed breakdowns, further propelling the latest bullish recovery on Ethereum. As long as Ethereum is sustained above the base level of $2,880, a broad-based recovery towards the levels of $3,280-$3,350 is expected in the coming days. With confidence being restored in the alternative currency market, focus is automatically turned towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is displaying tremendous momentum as the top crypto. MUTM Presale: Last Chance for Early Stage Investors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most renowned DeFi crypto projects of 2025. The presale event has garnered over $19.03 million among 18,270 participants, with Phase 6 already active and selling tokens for $0.035, a 250% rise from Phase 1’s selling cost of $0.01. With over 95% of Phase 6 being sold, this is one of the last few chances one will have to buy MUTM at a discounted level. Phase 7 will include a cost of $0.04, with an exchange listing price of $0.06, giving interested investors a chance at a 500% return on investment in terms of being among the first ones on board. MUTM is an opportunity for first-time exposure within an early-stage DeFi crypto network with real use cases, and it is the top crypto investment one can make in advance of 2026’s growth cycle. Buy-Back Mechanism Mutuum Finance’s innovative approach stems from its Buy-and-Distribute strategy, which sees actual activity on the platform translated into an increase in token value. This is because fees gained from loan transactions, borrowing, and staking will repurchase MUTM tokens, which will be rewarded to those who stake mtTokens. This sets up a cycle of supplemental growth, where increased usage of the platform fuels increased buybacks, which in turn fuels staking rewards and encourages user engagement on a long-term level. Through setting up a value correlation with real-world utility and use, MUTM separates itself from other speculative assets in being a very promising DeFi crypto with tangible rewards for users. Halborn Security Audit Mutuum Finance is also going through an extensive independent audit of its smart contracts relating to lending and borrowing. Halborn Security is doing a thorough analysis to make sure that everything is working properly and offers adequate protection for users’ assets. This is an important step in creating a trusted and reliable platform for retail and institutional investors alike. Information about the progress of the audit and the launch of the testnet will be available once the audit is finished, adding more credibility to MUTM as a top crypto within the DeFi market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi crypto project that has truly stood out among the competition, with the 6th phase of its presale being over 95% completed at a value of $0.035, cumulating a total of $19.03 million from 18,270+ supporters. With a fully functional borrowing and lending platform, buy-to-earn models, and an impending V1 Testnet launch, MUTM is definitely a top crypto worth considering due to its utilities and potential for growth in the area of DeFi.

55192985,637030,1764574246,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55192985.jpeg,"Cardano Founder Says Genesis ADA Was Profit, Not Community Funds",https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-genesis-ada-profit-not-community-funds/,"Charles Hoskinson has drawn a firm line under one of Cardano’s longest-running controversies, declaring that the allocation of Genesis ADA to Input Output (IO) and EMURGO was private profit for early risk, not a community-controlled pool to be repurposed for new initiatives. Cardano Founder Closes Door On Genesis ADA Criticism In a November 30 livestream titled “Genesis ADA,” the Cardano founder called the topic “a closed matter” and rejected renewed calls to use Genesis ADA for current integrations such as oracles and stablecoin issuers. “The Genesis ADA is profit for services rendered taking a risk, doing an activity and building an ecosystem,” he said. “It was a deal between us and the primary buyers of ADA, the Japanese who put up the initial wave of capital to get it done Those are the people that mattered in that transaction and every single one of them has been made whole.” Hoskinson walked through the original funding structure: a Japanese crowd sale that raised about $72 million, converted into bitcoin, and a “tripartid” model comprising the Cardano Foundation (governance), EMURGO (commercialization) and IO (protocol development). Based on the crowd sale pricing, IO’s Genesis ADA allocation was worth around $8 million at the time. “For the vast majority of the early days of Cardano, the Genesis ADA sat around 4 to 8 cents in value,” he said, arguing that the founding entities accepted extreme risk — regulatory, technical and reputational — in exchange for that upside. “To say that somehow we don’t deserve what we’ve gotten when what we got was about $8 million for delivering a $15 billion ecosystem, it’s a statement made of a Twitter mob with no basis in reality.” He framed the core objection as a misunderstanding of the original terms. If the community now insists that 100% of Genesis ADA must be spent, he argued, “then where was the profit for taking the risk?” He listed Japan and US regulatory exposure, the possibility of protocol failure, insider and outsider security threats, and potential civil or even criminal liability in the early days. “Let’s be very clear here,” he added. “99.9% of cryptocurrency ventures fail. Cardano is one of only a handful like XRP and Ethereum that have survived over the last 10 years and has value greater than $10 billion […] For a little over $40 million, a 10 plus billion dollar ecosystem has been created that at one point reached over a hundred billion dollars of value […] By any measurement, this has been an overwhelming success.” Hoskinson also pushed back hard against the idea that IO and EMURGO should function as de facto public utilities whose entire balance sheets exist for Cardano’s “common good.” “The books of my company and the books of EMURGO as private companies are none of the concern or business of the community as a whole,” he said. “We owe you nothing but the work we promise to do and will continue to do if you so choose. Those are the terms and conditions.” He contrasted demands to forfeit profits with the existence of an already sizable on-chain treasury. “Demanding that whatever profit or revenue that we’ve made over the last 10 years be forfeited for a greater good while the community sits on a more than billion ADA treasury […] is a pretty absurd thing,” he said, noting that the treasury mechanism itself was part of the original design he proposed. Why The Debate Now? The immediate flashpoint is a joint request for 70 million ADA from the treasury to fund a package of integrations, including providers such as Pyth, RedStone and Circle . Some critics have argued that such work should be paid from Genesis holdings instead. Hoskinson called that retroactive expectation “pretty absurd” given that those companies “didn’t even exist at the time.” He stressed that the 70 million ADA “will not cover the total fee of all the integrations” and that IO, the Midnight Foundation and others will “have to put skin in the game” because they are large ADA and KNIGHT holders who want to see yield on those assets. Framing the broader governance vote, Hoskinson presented the current moment as a 2026 “reset” from the original tripartite structure to a new “pentad” executive layer involving EMURGO, the Midnight Foundation, the Cardano Foundation, IO and Intersect. The goal, he said, is to coordinate strategy and negotiations with “some of the largest most predatory and aggressive companies in this industry,” where Cardano must “speak with one voice” to secure key deals. “The Genesis ADA is a closed issue. You have seen the end results of it and we have all moved on as founding entities,” he concluded. “We now have to decide, do we want to do something new and different […] and put a new structure for 2026 so that we can build the necessary infrastructure for the DeFi ecosystem? Or don’t we? It’s just that simple.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.38.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson,EN,0,0,ADA|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-01 07:30:46

Bitcoin spot ETFs, the financial instruments that brought Wall Street to crypto, experienced their largest capital flight in nine months. According to data from The Block, these funds saw approximately $3.5 billion in net outflows last month. This development raises crucial questions about institutional behavior and market health. What Triggered the Massive Bitcoin Spot ETFs Exodus? The numbers tell a compelling story. BlackRock’s IBIT fund led the retreat with a cumulative net loss of $2.34 billion throughout November. On November 18 alone, the fund witnessed its largest single-day net outflow of $523 million. Meanwhile, Ethereum spot ETFs recorded their highest-ever net outflow at $1.42 billion. These figures represent significant movement in the institutional crypto space. Nick Ruck, Head of Research at LVRG, provides crucial context. He explains that this trend primarily reflects institutional profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing. After Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, many large investors decided to secure gains before year-end. This activity represents normal financial behavior rather than a fundamental rejection of cryptocurrency assets. Do These Outflows Signal Trouble for Bitcoin? Despite the substantial November withdrawals, both Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETF products maintain positive cumulative net inflows overall. This distinction is vital for understanding market dynamics. The outflows represent tactical moves rather than strategic abandonment. Consider these key points about the current situation: Profit-taking is normal after significant price appreciation Year-end rebalancing affects all asset classes, not just crypto Underlying fundamentals remain unchanged despite capital movements Institutional participation continues through established channels The relationship between Bitcoin spot ETFs and underlying asset fundamentals deserves attention. Ruck emphasizes that this outflow activity doesn’t affect Bitcoin’s core technology, adoption rate, or long-term value proposition. The blockchain continues operating independently of Wall Street’s quarterly cycles. How Should Investors Interpret This Development? For individual investors watching Bitcoin spot ETFs, perspective matters. Institutional movements often follow different timelines and priorities than retail investors. The November outflows demonstrate that even sophisticated players engage in profit-taking when opportunities arise. This situation offers several insights for market participants: ETF flows provide valuable sentiment indicators Short-term movements don’t necessarily predict long-term trends Diversification remains crucial across investment vehicles Fundamental analysis should complement flow data The cryptocurrency market continues maturing as traditional finance integrates with digital assets. Bitcoin spot ETFs serve as bridges between these worlds, and their flow patterns offer windows into institutional thinking. While November showed substantial outflows, the broader narrative remains one of growing adoption and financial innovation. What Comes Next for Bitcoin Spot ETFs? The coming months will reveal whether November’s outflows represent a temporary adjustment or the beginning of a longer trend. Several factors will influence future flows, including regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, and Bitcoin’s price action. Investors should monitor these elements alongside ETF flow data. Remember that cryptocurrency markets operate on multiple timeframes. Daily and monthly flows provide useful information, but they represent pieces of a larger puzzle. The fundamental case for Bitcoin and blockchain technology continues developing regardless of quarterly capital movements. In conclusion, the November outflows from Bitcoin spot ETFs highlight the market’s maturation. Institutional investors now treat cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class, complete with profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing. This normalization, while creating short-term volatility, ultimately strengthens the ecosystem’s foundation for long-term growth. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the $3.5 billion outflow from Bitcoin spot ETFs? The outflow resulted primarily from institutional profit-taking and year-end portfolio rebalancing after Bitcoin reached new all-time highs. Does this mean institutions are abandoning Bitcoin? No. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs maintain positive cumulative net inflows overall. The November activity represents tactical adjustments rather than strategic abandonment. How does this affect Bitcoin’s price and fundamentals? While ETF flows can influence short-term price action, they don’t affect Bitcoin’s underlying technology, adoption rate, or long-term value proposition. Should individual investors be concerned about these outflows? Individual investors should maintain perspective. Institutional movements follow different timelines and don’t necessarily indicate problems with the underlying asset. What’s the difference between net outflow and cumulative inflow? Net outflow measures movement during a specific period (like November), while cumulative inflow represents the total net investment since a fund’s inception. Will this trend continue in December? Future flows depend on multiple factors including price action, macroeconomic conditions, and institutional strategies. Past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Found this analysis helpful?

Global macroeconomic pressures and the Yearn Finance hack have led investors to adopt a risk-off stance. Bitcoin fell 4.8% in the last 24 hours to $86,310. Ethereum, XRP, and Solana fell 5.36%, 6.39%, and 6.41%, respectively. A massive sell-off on Sunday evening sent Bitcoin plummeting from $91,300 to $86,000 in just three hours. This drastic move completely erased the recovery above $90,000 that BTC had maintained for the past five days. More than $144 billion in capital evaporated, with the crypto market's total value falling 4.5 percent in the last four hours. According to experts, Bitcoin's rise in previous weeks was supported by expectations that the US Federal Reserve would cut interest rates in December. However, BTC Markets analyst Rachael Lucas noted that the possibility of a rate cut was priced in months ago, saying, “The market is still under pressure from inflation and tariff talk.” According to Lucas, the $3.5 billion outflow from Bitcoin ETFs in November and the liquidation of leveraged long positions triggered a “classic deleveraging” process in the market. The Yearn Finance yETH pool was hacked, with attackers sending 1,000 ETH to Tornado Cash, which also accelerated the decline. Analysts say $85,000 is a critical support level, and if this level is broken, $80,400 and $75,000 could be the next targets. However, they also say a potential Fed rate cut could push Bitcoin back into the $95,000-$100,000 range. *deleveraging: Reducing the leverage (debt/principal) ratio, i.e. indirectly reducing investment risk. *This is not investment advice.

According to the Maeil Business Newspaper, lawmakers aim to approve the full Digital Asset Basic Act by January 2026. The legislation establishes a “Korean-style stablecoin” employing a consortium structure where banks hold at least 51% equity. As minority stakeholders, technology companies are able to take part. The deadline for submitting government proposals was set by Democratic Party Representative Kang Jun-hyeon on December 10. The congressman warned that if financial authorities fail to meet the deadline, lawmakers will introduce an independent version. South Korea consortium model balances bank stability On November 1, the party-government council meeting focused on details regarding consortium structure. Kang confirmed the intensive discussions held on bank participation levels and equity stake requirements. The Democratic Party secretary asked for consultation without delay to narrow the differences between the Bank of Korea, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), and banking sector positions. South Korea’s model requires a majority equity of 51% from banks, which guarantees soundness. The structure also addresses Bank of Korea concerns regarding the threat from stablecoins to monetary status. The FSC emphasized the need to cut entry barriers for the fintech and non-banking sectors. Kang’s office said the search for a contact point considered both monetary policy stability and industrial innovation. The compromise came after months of delays drew government plan. Throughout the negotiation process, the Bank of Korea insisted on a bank-centered issuance model. Professor Hyun Jung-hwan of Dongguk University assessed bank-led issuance as a safety-oriented option. The former official at the Bank of Korea mentioned that banks already issue deposit currency; stablecoin operations are complex. Reserve requirements exceed deposits, while preventing use as loan funds removes the margin incentives. December 10 deadline triggers legislative action Representative Kang also clarified the timeline for the submission of government bills. The lawmaker insisted the FSC provide a proposal for a framework before December 10. If they fail to meet the due date, the secretary will lead a legislation drive through the National Policy Committee. The country is trying to finish the bill proposal within the regular National Assembly session. A bill passage aims at an extraordinary National Assembly session in January 2026. Kang said that a large market ripple effect needs coordination between the government and opposition parties until the end of January this year. Until now, several related bills have been proposed, including those by Representatives Kim Eun-hye, Ahn Dogul and Min Byeong-deok. Meanwhile, with the sluggish pace of progress so far, the coordination between the government and the ruling party has now become a big watershed. The meeting between the financial authorities and the political officials was held behind closed doors at the National Assembly building in Yeouido, Seoul. Members of the Democratic Party’s political affairs committee met with the FSC to discuss the direction of the Framework Act. Just after the meeting, it was confirmed that the consortium form would include the central bank, regulator, and banking positions. Discussion progress was greeted with favor from market participants after extended delays. Major countries including the United States, the European Union and Japan completed stablecoin system overhauls. FSC expands anti-money laundering framework On November 28, South Korea announced the expansion of its travel rule to include all transaction sizes. The FSC closed a loophole allowing smurfing through sub-1 million won transfers previously. This exemption threshold was anything less than approximately $680 and thus enabled transfer abuse by splitting. The new regulations enact comprehensive monitoring regardless of the individual transaction amount. High-risk offshore exchanges may be blocked from servicing South Korean users as a measure to protect domestic investors from international platforms that operate outside of the country’s regulations. The FSC determined that certain jurisdictions and operators posed heightened risk profiles. Such implementation prevents capital flight to non-compliant foreign services. Stricter requirements were received by the virtual asset service provider registration criteria. Enhanced standards have confronted financial reserves, internal controls, and compliance mechanisms. South Korea requires strong operational infrastructure before licensing approvals are granted. The heightened bar aims at professionalizing the cryptocurrency exchange sector. Professor Hyun stressed that strengthening supervision is necessary if large banks handle substantial volumes of stablecoins. With the surge in issuance, potential system risks increase that call for regulatory monitoring. A permanent channel for discussions between the FSC and the Bank of Korea was suggested. Ongoing coordination by authorities is needed for reserve requirements and issuance limits. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Clouds are now being heavily crowded, hardware is becoming scarce, and traditional infrastcuture is challenged under unprecedented demand. In our conversation, Andrew Sobko, the CEO of Argentum AI, reveals that these structural challenges point to an even deeper shift – one where compute becomes liquid, globally distributed, and accessible far beyond today’s availabilities. In the following interview, he discusses the unexpected bottlenecks behind building a two-sided compute marketplace, the tension between enterprise-grade performance and decentralization, and why he believes that verifiability, trust, and geography-agnostic computing will define the upcoming decade of artificial intelligence. What inspired you to build a human-friendly, AI-powered compute marketplace like Argentum AI? Years ago, I built marketplaces in logistics, where supply and demand were fragmented, underutilized, and locked in inefficient systems. Compute felt the same – tons of idle hardware, inflexible cloud options, and limited access for smaller players. As AI workloads exploded, I realized centralized infrastructure wouldn’t scale with demand. We needed a system that worked more like a stock exchange – where supply and demand are liquid, human-friendly, and open. Argentum is the answer to that: a decentralized marketplace where trust, transparency, and participation are built in by design. What unexpected technical or logistical bottlenecks have you encountered in scaling a two-sided compute marketplace? Matching compute to demand isn’t just about capacity – it’s about trust, location, hardware variation, and uptime. One early challenge was hardware heterogeneity: GPUs differ wildly in performance, drivers, and thermal behavior. We built a “living benchmark” AI to measure real-world performance dynamically and match jobs accordingly. On the logistical side, onboarding high-quality providers globally – especially in regions with inconsistent internet or legal frameworks – pushed us to build zero-knowledge tools and lightweight node clients. Flexibility and resilience had to be baked in from day one. How do you balance decentralization with performance, security, and compliance? That’s the core tension. Pure decentralization can compromise performance; pure centralization kills transparency and resilience. We strike a middle path. Providers are decentralized, but execution is verified cryptographically with real-time telemetry. On performance, we use adaptive routing and benchmark-based matching. For security and compliance, our zero-knowledge trust layer ensures data privacy across borders while smart contracts and staking enforce SLAs. It’s not easy, but it’s critical if you want compute infrastructure to be both open and enterprise-grade. What structural change will AI bring to the global compute supply chain – and how is Argentum positioned for it? AI will decouple compute from geography. Today, compute is tied to hyperscale data centers clustered around cheap energy or tax policy. But that won’t scale. AI will need resilient, distributed infrastructure that follows power availability, environmental limits, and sovereignty requirements. Argentum is built for that future. We allow compute jobs to flow to where energy is cleanest, latency is lowest, or regulation is favorable. Think of it as compute liquidity that follows both economics and ethics – something centralized clouds can’t do. How do you weigh community governance vs. business growth when they pull in different directions? That’s one of the hardest balances. On one side, token-based governance is core to building trust and long-term alignment. On the other, markets reward speed and adaptability. Our approach is layered: critical protocol changes go through governance, while product iteration and partnerships move fast. We also aim to align incentives so what benefits the community also fuels growth – like rewarding providers with better SLAs, or letting token holders vote on incentives. In short, we treat community not as a brake, but as a compass. If you could give your founding self one piece of advice, what would it be? Start building for compliance and cross-border privacy from day one. It’s tempting to optimize for early traction, but real enterprise adoption – especially in AI – hinges on trust, verifiability, and legal clarity. Our zero-knowledge architecture and on-chain auditability were hard lessons earned. I’d also remind myself that decentralization isn’t about removing humans – it’s about designing systems where humans and AI collaborate at scale. That framing has shaped how we’ve built everything from onboarding to benchmarking.

The privacy coin crashed by over 21% within hours, tracking the losses of BTC. Zcash sank to $360.35, unraveling rapidly during Asian trading hours and early European trading hours. The coin broke down its support above $440, setting expectations for a slide as low as $340, and possibly below $300. Zcash crashed along with the market, no longer providing a relief rally, as the price broke the $440 support level. | Source: CoinGecko . The recent ZEC slide also showed the rally above $700 was not entirely sustainable, despite going against the market direction. ZEC trading volumes also tapered off in the past week, only accelerating during the latest selling event. The Zcash price crash followed a statement by Vitalik Buterin, urging the community to stay away from token-based governance to avoid future problems. ZEC has long liquidity Open interest for ZEC also slid below $500M, while short positions shot up again. Over 45% of Zcash positions are attempting to short at this price level, increasing from a previous low of around 30%. ZEC short sellers almost gave up in the past month, as each attempt to short the token caused a short squeeze. This time around, short positions may allow a retrace to around $440. During the latest downturn, Zcash liquidated most available long positions, down to the $360 range. At this point, ZEC may attempt a reversal, if market conditions do not cause further crashes. ZEC is getting more aggressively shorted on Hyperliquid, with 13 out of 20 whales taking short positions at various price levels. Some are paying negative fees for a chance to bet on a ZEC price slide. Whales with long positions are also feeling more pressure. One of the top whales still carries $4.4M in unrealized loss, recently adding collateral to retain the position, making a bet on a ZEC reversal. On Polymarket, the chances of Zcash rallying to $1,000 by the end of the year have collapsed, down from 42% in November to 8% after the latest crash. ZEC sinks as altcoin season unravels Zcash fell against Bitcoin , sliding below 0.005 BTC. The current altcoin climate also worsened, as the altcoin season index fell back to 26 points. The ZEC rally was one of the few engines for a higher altcoin index. The recent price drop also increased the concerns that Zcash was an exit pump for whales, and was artificially boosted, based on a mix of whale buying and short liquidations. Privacy coins as a whole erased more of their value, with total market cap falling below $17B . Zcash lost its top position as the biggest privacy coin, as Monero (XMR) regained the top spot. XMR rose by over 9% net in the past week, to trade above $418. XMR was also the only privacy coin in the green, potentially replacing ZEC as the asset that pumps counter to the market. While other privacy coins failed, XMR raised a new hope for a rally after years of sideways trading, repeating the performance of Zcash. However, the lesson of ZEC may also increase skepticism on the potential for a sustainable price expansion.

This Ethereum (ETH)-Based Altcoin Was Hacked,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/december-started-with-a-sharp-drop-and-hack-this-ethereum-eth-based-altcoin-was-hacked/,"Hacking incidents are seemingly endless in the cryptocurrency market. At this point, another cryptocurrency project has been hacked. Accordingly, Ethereum (ETH)-based DeFi protocol Yearn Finance (YFI) lost millions of dollars as a result of an attack targeting its yETH liquidity pool. Cryptocurrency detective PeckShield Alert noted that the Yearn Finance attacker minted a nearly infinite amount of yETH tokens in a single transaction, depleting the pool's assets in one go. Accordingly, the attacker exploited a vulnerability that allowed for unlimited minting of the yETH token, which drained the protocol's LST pools. According to PeckShieldAlert’s post, the attacker sent approximately 1000 ETH (approximately $3 million) to Tornado Cash, while the attacker address (0xa80d…c822) currently holds approximately $6 million worth of crypto assets. While Finance noted that “V2 and V3 vaults were not affected,” the attack has revived concerns about vulnerabilities across DeFi in general. The Yearn hack comes just days after South Korea's leading cryptocurrency exchange Upbit suffered a multi-million dollar attack. Yeran Finance (YFI) fell by 6% in the last 24 hours due to the hacking incident and the general market decline. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s How Price Reacted,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-sees-abnormal-0-in-liquidations-heres-how-price-reacted/,"XRP exhibited an unusual liquidation pattern during a recent one-hour trading period, which stood out across the broader cryptocurrency market. According to CoinGlass data , total liquidations during that hour reached roughly $128,430. All recorded losses came from long positions. Short liquidations were registered at zero, which is extremely uncommon in active derivatives markets. This type of reading immediately drew attention because liquidation data normally shows activity on both sides. Even during quiet sessions, it is rare for one side of the market to remain completely untouched. In XRP’s case, the data reflected a clear imbalance in how traders were positioned during that hour. What the Liquidation Data Reveals The liquidation snapshot suggests that leverage was concentrated almost entirely on the bullish side of the market. Long traders were exposed enough that even small price movements triggered forced exits. Short sellers, on the other hand, faced no pressure at all. CoinGlass heat maps showed that other assets displayed standard liquidation patterns around the same time. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and lower-cap tokens all logged losses on both the long and short sides throughout the day. XRP was the exception. Its data showed a clean divide, with longs cleared out while shorts remained unaffected. XRP Price Action Remains Tight Despite the liquidation imbalance, XRP’s price remained largely unchanged. The asset traded in a narrow band between $2.19 and $2.20 throughout the period. There was no sharp drop and no strong rebound. Its price movement remained slow and controlled, mirroring its muted performance after the recent ETF launches . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 That muted action explains why short positions were not forced out. The market never produced a move strong enough to challenge downside exposure. Instead, slight intraday shifts were enough to remove overleveraged long positions. In this environment, liquidation occurred without volatility. The market reduced risk without changing its overall structure. XRP Holds Key Support Zone The $2.2 level has remained a key price area for XRP over recent sessions. Its price stalled repeatedly, and sellers showed limited interest in pushing lower. The absence of short liquidations supports this. It shows low bearish pressure and cautious positioning. A break above $2.23-$2.25 could drive a fast rise toward $2.30-$2.34, while a drop below $2.17 may open the path to $2.12-$2.14. The recent one-sided liquidation shows that positioning shapes short-term behavior. Any future shift in liquidation patterns could signal a change in sentiment, but for now, the market appears balanced.

The platform will temporarily suspend all deposits and withdrawals for assets on the Ethereum network. This proactive measure is a direct preparation for an upcoming and significant network hard fork . If you hold ETH or any ERC-20 tokens on Upbit, here’s everything you need to know to navigate this brief pause securely. What is the Upbit Ethereum Hard Fork Suspension? On December 3rd, at 7:00 p.m. UTC, Upbit will halt all incoming and outgoing transactions for Ethereum -based assets. This includes ETH itself and all tokens built on its network, like USDT, USDC, and various DeFi tokens. The exchange states this is a standard safety procedure ahead of a planned hard fork . Essentially, they are pushing the pause button on ETH network movements to ensure user funds remain perfectly secure during the critical network upgrade. Why Do Exchanges Like Upbit Suspend Services Before a Hard Fork? Think of a hard fork as a major software upgrade for a blockchain. It can create temporary instability or even a chain split. Therefore, exchanges take preventative action. For Upbit , suspending deposits and withdrawals for the Ethereum network mitigates several risks: Preventing Loss: Stops transactions from being sent to the wrong chain if a split occurs. Ensuring Accuracy: Allows their systems to correctly credit the new forked tokens to user accounts. Maintaining Stability: Avoids technical glitches that could affect balances during the transition. This is a common and responsible practice across the industry, demonstrating Upbit’s commitment to asset security. What Should Upbit Users Do Before the Deadline? While trading of Ethereum pairs may continue, the movement of assets on-chain will stop. Therefore, you need to plan ahead. Here are your actionable steps: Complete Planned Transactions: If you need to deposit or withdraw ETH or ERC-20 tokens, do so well before the 7:00 p.m. UTC deadline on December 3rd. No Need for Panic Selling: Your funds are safe in your Upbit wallet. This is a temporary operational halt, not a security issue. Monitor Official Channels: Follow Upbit’s official announcements for the exact time when services will resume after the hard fork is complete. What Does This Mean for the Broader Ethereum Ecosystem? This move by a major exchange like Upbit highlights the coordinated effort required for successful blockchain upgrades. It signals to the market that the Ethereum hard fork is a significant event requiring careful handling. Such suspensions, while inconvenient, are a hallmark of a maturing industry that prioritizes the protection of user assets above all else. They ensure a smooth transition for millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency. Conclusion: A Temporary Pause for Long-Term Security In summary, Upbit’s decision to suspend Ethereum network activity is a standard, safety-first protocol. It protects users during the inherent uncertainties of a network hard fork . By planning your transactions before the deadline and understanding the reasons behind the pause, you can navigate this period with confidence. This temporary inconvenience underscores the robust security measures that reputable exchanges implement to safeguard your digital wealth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Can I still trade Ethereum on Upbit during the suspension? Typically, yes. The suspension usually applies only to on-chain deposits and withdrawals. Trading of ETH/KRW or ETH/BTC pairs on the exchange’s internal order book often continues as normal. However, always check Upbit’s official notice for specific details. 2. How long will the deposit and withdrawal suspension last? The duration depends on the stability of the Ethereum network after the hard fork. Exchanges usually resume services once they confirm the new chain is stable and their node integrations are complete. This can take several hours to a couple of days. Upbit will announce the resumption time. 3. Are my Ethereum funds on Upbit safe during this time? Absolutely. The suspension is a protective measure. Your assets remain securely held in Upbit’s custody. The action is taken precisely to keep your funds safe from potential technical issues arising from the network upgrade. 4. Does this affect all cryptocurrencies on Upbit? No. This specific suspension only affects assets on the Ethereum (ERC-20) network. Deposits and withdrawals for Bitcoin, Solana, or other separate blockchains should continue uninterrupted unless stated otherwise by Upbit. 5. What is a hard fork, in simple terms? A hard fork is a permanent upgrade to a blockchain’s protocol. It creates new rules that are not compatible with the old ones, effectively creating a new version of the chain. All nodes (participants) must upgrade to the new software to continue participating. 6. Will I receive new forked tokens from this upgrade on Upbit? This depends on the nature of the hard fork and Upbit’s policy. If the fork results in a new, tradable token, major exchanges like Upbit often evaluate supporting it. They will make a separate announcement regarding any token distribution after the fork is complete. Found this guide on the Upbit Ethereum hard fork suspension helpful?

As a result, the move has sparked debate among analysts about whether the recent price action is a pause before a rally or the start of a deeper decline. Resistance at $93K Holds Firm Bitcoin’s price attempted to break above the $92,000–$93,000 area but was pushed back, showing weakness at a level many traders marked as critical. Analyst Colin Talks Crypto commented , “$BTC rejects from underside of megaphone in first attempt. This is not strong momentum.” The asset is around $86,500 at press time, with a 5% drop over the past 24 hours. This comes after a recovery from Monday morning lows near $85,000, which has now stalled below the megaphone’s lower trendline — a pattern associated with rising volatility. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Chart 01.12. Source: Colin Talks Crypto/X Colin still sees a potential move higher in the short term. His base scenario includes a rally toward $100,000 to $115,000, followed by a correction phase. He adds that the next market downturn could be a brief one lasting around six to eight months, or it could follow a more typical one-year cycle. Bearish Setup Still in Control Crypto Patel, another market analyst, described the price action as unfolding “exactly as mapped .” He pointed to a rejection from the $93,000 bearish order block, with the price quickly falling to $85,700. He has now identified $76,000 as the next downside target. Patel has also adjusted his bearish invalidation level to $93,100, meaning that only a strong close above that point would change his outlook. Until then, he maintains that the trend remains to the downside. Charts shared by Patel show a clean breakdown below trend support, a failed retest, and a continuation lower — consistent with the view that momentum remains weak unless bulls regain control above key levels. Moreover, traders tracking liquidation data report that a large portion of long positions were wiped out during the drop from $91,000 to $85,000. Analyst Ardi noted that remaining long interest is now clustered in the $83,000–$85,000 range. He also pointed out a buildup of short positions around $91,500–$93,000, while calling attention to the lower liquidity bands. “The bigger magnet right now is below,” he said, suggesting that a sweep of the lower range is possible if the $86,000 area fails to hold. Key Levels in Focus Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s monthly candle for November closed below support, which some analysts compare to historical patterns that preceded major moves. Trader Tardigrade mentioned that the breakdown mirrors late 2016, a time that later saw a strong upward trend. Daan Crypto Trades noted that while the long-term structure is still intact, bulls do not want to see a return to the $80,000 range, which would risk breaking market confidence. December often brings increased activity, and the market appears to be setting up for more volatility. For now, price remains trapped between support near $84,000 and resistance at $93,000, with short-term direction likely to depend on how Bitcoin reacts at these key levels.

Ethena (ENA) and EigenLayer (EIGEN) lead one-time cliff releases exceeding $5 million each. The combined cliff unlocks total $72.18 million across two major projects. Linear daily distributions above $1 million include Solana, TRUMP, Worldcoin, Dogecoin, Aster and Avalanche totaling $145.88 million. Ethena leads token unlocks with $52.63 million release Ethena is executing the largest token unlock that is scheduled between December 1 and December 8. According to the tracking on Tokenomist, the project is releasing 212.50 million ENA tokens valued at $52.63 million. The distribution represents 3.04% of the total supply entering circulation simultaneously. The December unlock was part of Ethena’s vesting schedule set since the launch of the project. The token distribution common in token distribution involves vesting portions for the team, early investors, development, and community rewards. 212.50 million tokens form one tranche in a multi-year vesting timeline. On a percentage basis, ENA’s 3.04% supply impact ranks lower than EIGEN. The absolute dollar value of $52.63 million exceeds all other scheduled releases during the period. EigenLayer has scheduled a 36.82 million token release valued at $19.55 million. This distribution represents 10.79% of the total supply. Projects with smaller circulating supplies face proportionally larger impacts from scheduled releases. The value of $19.55 million positions EIGEN as the second-largest cliff unlock of the week. The 10.79% supply increase tests market absorption capacity over a short timeframe. Linear token unlocks total $145.88 million across six projects Solana leads with 489,210 SOL tokens worth $62.85 million over the seven-day period. This is the largest linear unlock in terms of dollar value. TRUMP token follows with 4.89 million tokens valued at $28.32 million through gradual daily vesting. Worldcoin comes in third with 37.23 million tokens worth $21.76 million in the week. Dogecoin is adding 95.97 million tokens that are worth $13.40 million to the circulating supply. In daily distributions, Aster has released 10.28 million tokens valued at $10.35 million. Avalanche concluded its linear unlocks with 700,000 tokens valued at $9.20 million. The six projects combine for a gradual supply expansion of $145.88 million. Less popular token unlocks show advanced vesting progress CoinMarketCap data reveals several projects with advanced vesting completion percentages. Adventure Gold (AGLD) reached 95.06% unlock progress with the next release of 1.55 million tokens worth $419,425.85. The project nears full token distribution completing the multi-year vesting timeline. Orbler is at 93.80% completion, and the upcoming release of 31.01 million tokens is worth $2.08 million. The 1.55% of the total locked amount results in a really small remaining vesting schedule. DTEC is at 74.35%, scheduling 9.24 million token unlocks worth $92,984.44, which constitutes 1.51% of the locked supply. ReadFi SRDF is at 74.59% completion, and it schedules 1.59 million tokens valued at $5,738.27. Audiera stands at an earlier vesting stage at 14.00% completion. The project has scheduled 21.25 million BEAT tokens worth $19.74 million, which accounts for 2.12% of the total locked supply. The combined token unlocks amount to $218 million, which is quite decent weekly supply expansion. The period from December 1 through December 8 puts the focus on major and minor project releases all at once, while vesting schedules continue for many projects well into 2026 and beyond.

Accordingly, the LINK ETF is next in line for altcoin ETFs to be launched. Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, stated in his post from the X account that the spot Chainlink ETF is expected to be launched this week. Geraci added that Grayscale plans to spin off the existing Chainlink private trust into a public ETF. The product will be the first publicly traded LINK spot ETF to enter the US market. “Grayscale looks likely to launch the world's first spot Chainlink ETF this week.” Geraci's forecast aligns with Bloomberg Intelligence's estimate, which predicts Grayscale's product will launch on December 2, according to Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Like Grayscale's other ETFs, the Grayscale Chainlink Trust will be created by converting the company's LINK trust into a spot ETF. The trust was established in late 2020 and will convert to an ETF five years later. The product will generate returns by tracking the spot price of LINK and will also include returns from staking LINK. Apart from LINK, Grayscale also launched spot XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF last month. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: The ETF Wave Continues!

55198027,637163,1764581140,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55198027.jpeg,Singapore Approves Ripple’s Payment Activities Expansion as $SUBBD Token Presale Attracts More Investors,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-expands-singapore-subbd-token-soars/,"Quick Facts: Ripple’s expanded MPI license in Singapore underscores how digital asset payment rails are moving into tightly regulated, institutional-grade territory. The Monetary Authority of Singapore’s approach shows how clear taxonomy and licensing can turn crypto from speculative edge case into trusted infrastructure supporting cross-border and retail payment flows. AI-powered content and fan platforms can now plug into compliant payment providers rather than hacking together unregulated rails, freeing them to focus on UX and monetization. $SUBBD merges Web3 payments, staking, and proprietary AI tools to tackle high platform fees, arbitrary bans, and fragmented creator monetization while keeping earnings and content under creator control. Regulation is finally catching up with crypto’s real-world use cases. Today, Ripple revealed that Singapore’s Monetary Authority (MAS) had approved an expanded scope of payment activities under the firm’s existing Major Payment Institution (MPI) license. This essentially expands what Ripple can do with digital payment tokens like $XRP and its $RLUSD stablecoin in the city-state. That matters far beyond cross-border remittances. Singapore’s rules under the Payment Services Act already made it a template for digital asset oversight; an expanded MPI further signals that regulators are comfortable with blockchain rails carrying serious volume. This also lets developers tap regulated providers for fiat on/off ramps and token settlement. This lets you focus on user experience, IP control, and monetization instead of licensing headaches across multiple jurisdictions. That’s where SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) comes in. The Ethereum-based project positions itself as an AI-powered content creation and fan engagement hub, using crypto-native payments, staking, and token-gated access to help creators keep more of what they earn. While players like Ripple standardize the underlying rails, SUBBD Token aims to turn that infrastructure into a usable toolkit for working creators and their communities. How Regulated Digital Asset Rails Unlock Creator-Focused Web3 Platforms Ripple isn’t alone. Exchanges like OKX and Bitstamp have also pursued MPI approvals in Singapore , as MAS leans into a licensing regime that treats digital payment tokens as core financial plumbing rather than a regulatory edge case. For Web3 creator platforms, this maturation solves a basic problem: consistent access to compliant fiat ramps and cross-border settlement. This allows teams to lean on licensed entities for KYC, custody, and payouts. In addition, it frees them to innovate on discovery algorithms, AI tools, and tokenized membership rather than building a shadow payments stack. Several AI-plus-crypto platforms already chase this opportunity, from NFT-driven creator marketplaces to fan token ecosystems experimenting with governance and perks. In that crowd, SUBBD Token is one of the newer entrants. The project frames itself as a vertically integrated stack for AI-assisted content creation, subscription monetization, and tokenized access rather than just another tipping coin or generic NFT storefront. Get a full lowdown on the project in our What Is SUBBD Token page. Why $SUBBD is Leaning Into AI, Tokenization, and Compliant Rails The pain points $SUBBD targets are familiar if you’ve ever tried to build an audience online: high fees, arbitrary moderation that could take down your account, and fragmented AI tools. SUBBD’s thesis is simple: these are coordination problems that programmable money and AI can actually address. On the creator side, the project underpins a suite of proprietary AI models for content generation, chatbots, and voice cloning, plus an AI Personal Assistant designed to automate routine fan interactions without feeling like a spam bot. For users, SUBBD Token wraps this in token-based access and rewards: holders can unlock exclusive content, beta features, and XP multipliers, with governance hooks around creator onboarding, platform themes, and AI creator curation. Staking adds another layer, which allows you to lock your purchased tokens for a fixed 20% APY in the first year, alongside perks like exclusive livestreams, in-house content, and daily BTS drops, before the system shifts toward more utility-based yields. The market is responding positively to the project’s token presale, which has already raised over $1.3M and counting. With tokens currently priced at $0.057075, it allows you to grab them and enjoy the perks that they offer at a fairly affordable price. Go to our ‘How to Buy SUBBD Token’ guide for step-by-step instructions on investing in the project. While it’s still fairly early to see how investors will see the project over the long term, our SUBBD price prediction sees a potential for it to hit a high of $0.48 by the end of 2026. Based on the current token price, this translates to an increase of about 741%. If you believe clearer licensing for payment providers will accelerate Web3 creator tools, it might be worth tracking how SUBBD Token executes from presale promises to live, revenue-sharing infrastructure. With just a day before the next price increase, now’s the time to get your share of $SUBBD tokens at a discounted price. Join the SUBBD Token presale today.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/tech-giant-sony-makes-stablecoin-move-is-it-launching-its-own-stablecoin-here-are-the-details/,"Tech giant Sony is preparing to launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin in the US for use within its own ecosystem. The company reportedly aims to launch the stablecoin as early as fiscal year 2026. The digital asset will be used primarily as a payment tool for Sony's gaming, entertainment, and anime-focused services. According to the report, Sony Bank officially applied for a US banking license in October to achieve this goal. The bank will establish a US subsidiary to conduct stablecoin activities in compliance with regulatory frameworks. This new entity will be responsible for both issuing the stablecoin and overseeing its operations. Sony's move is part of its strategic expansion into digital finance and the Web3 ecosystem. Given Sony's significant presence in the gaming industry, a dollar-pegged stablecoin could play a significant role in the PlayStation ecosystem for microtransactions, in-game purchases, and digital content access. Analysts note that a traditional Japanese financial institution entering the US stablecoin market could intensify competition in the sector. If regulatory approvals are successfully completed, Sony's stablecoin is seen as a significant step forward, both enhancing the user experience and expanding the company's global digital payment infrastructure. *This is not investment advice.

Of this new breed of top performers, XRP, Solana (SOL), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represent three of the top cryptocurrencies available for investment according to those seeking assets with outstanding fundamentals, rapidly accelerating growth, and a beneficial roadmap ahead. The rise of XRP is due, in part, to a resurgence of institutional investment, SOL remains dominant in terms of blockchain performance for high-volume capabilities, and MUTM is rapidly becoming the best crypto to buy. With phase 6 of the MUTM presale already almost fully completed with registration exceeding 18,270 investors, and a currently established new-market value of only $0.035, MUTM is quickly developing a reputation as the next crypto to explode in the DeFi market. XRP Battles Inside a Falling Channel as Bears Firmly in Control The embracement of a downtrend by XRP continues, with the currency currently being trapped in a wider declining channel, despite numerous failed rebounds creating a tight bears’ consolidation pattern. It is a major challenge for the bulls to penetrate and overthrow the defining $2.28 level, and unless the coin breaks past it, a bearish outlook will continue penetrating the markets. Analysts say the situation leaves room for a passage towards the $1.95 channel support level in a journey to ascertain whether a stabilizing effect can be induced on the currency or a further decline in the value continues. Due to the prevailing bearish market outlook in the markets concerning the value of the XRP, most investors have turned attention towards nascent investment avenues with better forces of directionality, including Mutuum Finance (MUTM), recognized as the best crypto to buy today. Solana Begins Recovery as Buyers Defend Key Support Levels Solana (SOL) appears to be giving the first indications of a recovery after bouncing off a critical support level, with buyers emerging at the April demand level to create the first significant higher low after weeks of consistent selling pressure. From a technical analysis standpoint, SOL is currently breaking out of a wide channel after a clean reaction from a major support level, establishing a new short-term bias and remaining positive provided prices remain above the $128–$132 region. Analysts project a corrective rally forming in the coming periods with targets estimated within the $150–$160 region in case the run continues. As SOL is trying to establish its recovery and regain support in the market, market attention is simultaneously broadening out to new possibilities with first-stage potential and a strong use case, providing a smooth transition to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is increasingly being tracked as the next crypto to explode. MUTM Presale Stage 6: Riding the Wave of Market Momentum Mutuum Finance is quickly rising in the rankings within the DeFi crypto market with Phase 6 of its presale almost fully subscribed. The present value is pegged at $0.035, which is the final stage leading up to Phase 7, where the value will rise by 20% to $0.04. With an amount of over $19.03 million garnered from over 18,270 supporters, Mutuum Finance has already established itself as one of the most eagerly awaited projects of 2025 and is the best crypto to buy for early investors. An important piece of Mutuum Finance’s development is the audit of its contracts for lending and borrowing assets.

55198196,637212,1764581404,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55198196.jpeg,Best Altcoins to Buy Before 2026’s Altcoin Season,https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-before-2026-altcoin-season/,"Quick Facts: Altcoin season in 2026 likely hinges on $BTC dominance rolling over while DeFi, L2 activity, and on‑chain volumes trend higher together. Some analysts believe that the altseason is nearing its end and that the bull market to follow will be at least equally as massive. Among the top altcoins, PEPENODE’s ($PEPENODE) virtual mine‑to‑earn model turns memecoin speculation into playable mining gameplay, removing hardware and power costs for everyday users. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD), by contrast, targets the $85B creator economy with AI assistants, voice cloning, and token‑gated content to keep more value in creators’ hands. If 2026 is going to deliver a real altcoin season, it probably won’t start with fireworks. It usually begins quietly: Bitcoin cools off after a strong run, $BTC dominance rolls over from local highs, and suddenly alt/$BTC charts stop bleeding and start printing higher lows. Michael van de Poppe thinks that we’re witnessing the ‘ end of the bear market for altcoins ’ as we steer into 2026 and that Bitcoin holds the key to the next altseason. You’ll likely see it first in on-chain data. Layer 2s and DeFi protocols push higher daily active addresses, DEX volumes creep up, and fees rise without a matching spike in $BTC. Those are the conditions where narrative-driven plays, experimental token models, and infrastructure bets can move fastest. In other words, being early to altseason is about positioning before those rotations show up on mainstream charts, while Bitcoin is still chopping in a range instead of setting new highs every week. Below are three very different altcoins that line up with that thesis: PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) as a gamified mine‑to‑earn memecoin built for retail fun, SUBBD Token’s ($SUBBD) AI x Web3 content platform, and a battle‑tested payments asset that just cleared a huge regulatory overhang in Ripple ($XRP) . Together, they map out the speculative to blue‑chip spectrum heading into a potential 2026 rotation. 1. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – World’s First Mine‑to‑Earn Memecoin PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) bills itself as the ‘world’s first mine-to-earn memecoin,’ and the idea is simple: take the excitement of mining, remove hardware and electricity costs, and wrap it in a meme‑driven game layer. Instead of GPUs or ASICs, you interact with a virtual mining system directly tied to your $PEPENODE holdings. The core loop revolves around buying and upgrading ‘Miner Nodes’ and ‘Facilities’. Early adopters can secure more powerful nodes that sit in higher reward tiers, meaning their virtual rigs earn larger ongoing meme coin emissions over time. It’s the kind of asymmetric setup that typically attracts degen capital early in an alt season narrative. Crucially, this mining is all virtual and smart-contract-based on Ethereum, using ERC‑20 infrastructure plus dedicated contracts for staking, rewards, and later governance. No rigs, no power bills, no configuration headaches − just a gamified dashboard and post‑TGE gameplay activation that lets you optimize and upgrade your setup like a strategy game. The presale is already showing traction, having raised over $2.2M with tokens currently priced at $0.0011731 and a mouth-watering staking APY of 579%. Our price prediction for $PEPENODE hints at a potential $0.0072 in 2026. Based on the current presale price, buying today could bring you an ROI of 513% in a single year If 2026 does bring a renewed memecoin wave as $BTC cools and retail returns, this gamified mining model could become one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025. Read our guide on how to buy $PEPENODE before that happens to stay ahead of the curve. Buy your $PEPENODE today. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – AI + Web3 for Creator Ownership If altseason rotations in 2026 lean toward real‑world use cases, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) positions itself at the intersection of AI, creator economies, and crypto payments. It targets the roughly $85B content creation industry by letting creators own their audiences, automate their workflows, and monetize via tokens instead of opaque platforms. The SUBBD platform’s AI Personal Assistant can handle automated fan interactions, subscription flows, and basic support, effectively becoming a 24/7 “team member” for solo creators. On top of that, AI Voice Cloning and AI Influencer Creation open up new content formats, from synthetic personas to multi‑language distribution without extra recording time. On the Web3 side, the SUBBD platform integrates token‑gated content and crypto payouts so creators can keep more of what they earn while retaining direct control over their subscriber relationships. That’s a sharp contrast to traditional platforms where fees, algorithms, and sudden policy changes can wipe out years of work overnight. The market seems to be paying attention. The presale has already raised over $1.3M, with tokens at $0.057075, giving $SUBBD a running start before major listings. Based the token’s utility within the content creation ecosystem, our price prediction for $SUBBD hints at a potential $0.48 in 2026 and over $2.50 by 2030, once the project goes mainstream. You’re looking at a one-year ROI of 741% and a five-year one of 4,280% or higher if everything goes to plan. For an altseason positioning around creator tech rather than pure memes, it’s a project worth tracking, so read our guide on how to buy $SUBBD today. Buy your $SUBBD while it’s still in presale. 3. Ripple (XRP) – Post‑Regulatory Clarity Enterprise Payments Play Ripple’s $XRP sits at the opposite end of the risk spectrum: a large‑cap asset designed for fast, low‑cost cross‑border payments rather than speculative meme cycles. XRP settles transactions in roughly 3–5 seconds, with a consensus mechanism that’s cheap and energy‑efficient compared to proof‑of‑work systems like Bitcoin’s. XRP plays a key role inside Ripple’s enterprise payment products, where financial institutions can use it for on‑demand liquidity instead of pre‑funding accounts around the world. That makes it an infrastructure piece for the rails that move value between currencies, not just another retail trading token. The big overhang for years was regulation. That changed when the SEC officially ended its lawsuit against Ripple in August 2025, closing a long‑running chapter of uncertainty. With that resolved, many market participants now see XRP with renewed confidence, particularly as regulators globally define clearer digital asset frameworks. Heading into a potential 2026 altcoin season, $XRP offers a different kind of exposure: it’s already one of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap and a leading enterprise‑focused blockchain payments asset, but it can still benefit from broader liquidity and renewed interest in compliant infrastructure coins. If you want a piece of it, buy your $XRP today. Recap : If 2026 delivers an altcoin season, you’ll want exposure across different narratives: PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) for mine‑to‑earn memecoin speculation, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) for AI‑powered creator tools, and Ripple ($XRP) for post‑clarity payments infrastructure.

The data he referenced shows balances falling from approximately 3.95 billion tokens to about 2.6 billion tokens, representing a drop of more than 45 percent. He also pointed out that Binance’s XRP reserves are positioned near all-time lows, indicating a continued tightening in available supply. This contraction is presented as a critical factor in shaping near-term market behavior, particularly given the pace at which tokens have been leaving exchanges . XRP’s supply is disappearing from exchanges: 3.95B → 2.6B in 60 days. Binance reserves near all-time lows. Bull pennant forming, V-shape breakout lining up, ETFs stacking inflows. $2.80 becomes inevitable when supply evaporates. $XRP pic.twitter.com/lxbIl7kZxG — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) November 29, 2025 Technical structure aligns with on-chain developments In addition to supply metrics, the analyst highlighted a developing technical formation he described as a bull pennant, supported by what he views as a V-shaped recovery structure on the chart. He linked this pattern to strengthening recovery momentum, noting that it coincides with ongoing accumulation by recently launched exchange-traded products . According to his assessment, the combination of diminishing exchange supply and consistent ETF inflows creates a framework in which a move toward $2.80 transitions from a speculative projection to a level that aligns with present market conditions. Responses from other market participants Market participants reacting to these observations echoed the same theme of supply reduction and steady absorption. Guoyu RWA stated that the combination of falling supply and shifting sentiment often precedes stronger activity, adding that Binance’s reduced reserves and ETF accumulation make the analyst’s $2.80 figure appear increasingly feasible. CryptoGames3D also noted that the supply squeeze is evident, arguing that the consistent drying up of exchange balances, combined with ETF buying, supports the plausibility of the analyst’s target. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Context for the broader outlook The core of the analyst’s position centers on the intersection of supply contraction and sustained institutional demand. Lower exchange reserves limit immediate sell-side liquidity, and if ETFs continue accumulating at their current rate, the amount of XRP accessible on major venues may continue to shrink. The technical setup is used to reinforce this broader argument, suggesting that market structure is aligning with the underlying supply-demand trend. Taken together, the observations presented by Ripple Bull Winkle emphasize that reduced exchange balances, historically low reserves on major platforms, and ongoing ETF inflows form a consistent narrative of tightening supply . Within this framework, the analyst views the $2.80 level as increasingly justified by current market data rather than aspirational forecasting, making the progression of exchange balances and institutional accumulation key metrics to monitor in the days ahead.

Based on reports, the funds would come from the country’s gold and foreign-exchange reserves rather than its social or oil wealth funds. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Face A Harsh December: Rising BTC Difficulty, Falling Hashprice Central Bank Moves Cautiously According to central bank briefings and market reporting, the investment will not be made all at once. Initial tranches could be modest — figures discussed publicly include amounts like $50 million and $100 million as possible early steps, with larger allocations of $250 million also on the table if conditions allow. The plan appears to be phased, with the bank watching price swings and market signals before committing major sums. The assets under consideration may include direct holdings of crypto tokens or instruments linked to the crypto sector, such as exchange-traded products and equity stakes in companies that serve the industry. Based on reports, the central bank’s alternative investments arm, which already holds high-tech and financial assets, would manage the placement. Investment Targets And Broader Plans Reports have disclosed that this move sits alongside a wider push to create a national digital-asset reserve fund. Officials and informed sources have mentioned target sizes in the range of $500 million to $1 billion for that reserve. That proposed fund would focus more on ETFs and corporate equity than on simply holding tokens in wallets. An existing state initiative, the Alem Crypto Fund, has already taken public steps into the market. In September 2025 the fund made an investment in the cryptocurrency BNB, signaling that parts of the state apparatus are experimenting with exposure to digital assets. That action is being watched closely by both domestic policymakers and foreign observers. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Sparks CZ Comment: Sell Greed, Buy Fear Risks And Safeguards The central bank has stressed caution. Large price swings in major tokens have been noted as a reason to phase investments slowly. The proposed $300 million allocation, according to briefings, would be drawn from non-essential reserves — explicitly kept separate from Kazakhstan’s National Fund that pays for public programs — which is meant to protect social spending from market losses. Some of the purchases, reports suggest, could be executed through regulated financial products rather than raw token buys, lowering custody and liquidity risks. The decision to structure the program in stages is intended to reduce the chance of a sudden, large loss if markets move against the holdings.

Grayscale will be able to uplist/convert the Chainlink private trust to an ETF,” Geraci noted via X. The move comes as a competing LINK ETF from Bitwise awaits approval. Geraci’s prediction aligns with Bloomberg Intelligence estimates, which indicate a Dec. 2 launch, according to Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Altcoin ETF market surges with XRP, DOGE, and Solana products Last week, Balchunas projected a “steady supply” of crypto ETFs over the next six months, potentially exceeding 100, sharing a screenshot showing Grayscale’s expected launch date for its LINK ETF. “There are five spot crypto ETFs launching over the next six days. Beyond that, we expect a steady supply of them, likely over 100 in the next six months,” he noted via X on Nov. 24. As with a number of its previous ETFs, Grayscale’s Chainlink Trust will turn its already established LINK trust (established at the close of 2020) into an ETF. The product will generate returns by tracking the spot price of LINK, along with staking rewards . Grayscale’s Chainlink ETF is also worth launching because investors will have a regulated, easy way to connect to LINK, as they do not have to maintain the cryptocurrency themselves or manage personal wallets. Through the transformation of an existing private trust into a publicly traded exchange-traded fund (ETF), Grayscale is offering institutional investors, pension funds, and traditional asset managers a convenient means to gain exposure to Chainlink . As noted in a recent research paper, Grayscale has deep faith in the Chainlink ecosystem and dubbed it a “critical connective tissue” linking crypto to traditional finance. Changes in SEC leadership this year have spe d ap provals for crypto ETFs in the U.S., with funds linked to Solana, XRP, and DOGE all getting the green light. Investors flock to new funds as Grayscale and Bitwise expand crypto offerings The launch of the new Chainlink ETF comes amid a surge of altcoin-focused ETFs. Issuers have introduced Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin products over the past month, with more XRP and Dogecoin-themed funds expected to hit the market next week. The Canary Capital XRP ETF (XRPC) debuted with net inflows of $58 million—the year’s biggest opening-day total of any ETF—merely exceeding the launch by Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL), which opened with $57 million. BSOL emerged as one of the early success stories through 2025, having accumulated over $660 million worth of assets in three weeks without a single day of outflows. Grayscale’s XRP and Dogecoin ETFs were recently approved by the New York Stock Exchange, starting trading on Monday following the listings of both products. NYSE Arca, the exchange’s ETF-focused subsidiary, filed certifications on Friday confirming the listing and registration of the Grayscale XRP Trust ETF Shares and the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust ETF Shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Meanwhile, Bitwise Asset Management also debuted a new exchange-traded fund tracking Dogecoin, after months of community pressure to have a regulated vehicle associated with the token.

By depositing a staggering 55,340 ETH and borrowing $50 million in USDT, this ‘OG’ is sending a powerful signal about their confidence in Ethereum’s future. This strategic play points directly towards a calculated plan for further ETH accumulation . What Does This Massive DeFi Move Signal? According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, the address known as ‘1011short’ deposited ETH worth approximately $157 million into the Aave lending protocol. The immediate next step was borrowing 50 million USDT against this collateral. This is not a simple liquidation event; it’s a strategic redeployment of capital. The borrowed funds were swiftly sent to the Binance exchange, a common gateway for converting stablecoins into other crypto assets. Therefore, this activity strongly suggests the holder is preparing to buy more Ethereum. Decoding the Strategy Behind the ETH Accumulation Why would a long-term holder take on debt instead of simply selling some ETH? The logic is rooted in sophisticated market strategy. This approach allows the investor to maintain their full ETH position (a bet on long-term price appreciation) while accessing immediate liquidity. The borrowed USDT can now be used to purchase more Ethereum, effectively leveraging their existing holdings to amplify a potential upside. This is a classic sign of a confident, long-term bull maneuver focused on ETH accumulation . Let’s break down the potential benefits of this strategy: Maintains Exposure: The original 55,340 ETH remains untouched and continues to earn potential staking rewards or serve as collateral. Amplifies Position: The $50M USDT provides fresh capital to buy more ETH at current prices, increasing the total stake. Strategic Timing: It suggests the investor believes current prices are favorable for adding to their position. What Are the Risks of Leveraged Accumulation? While this signals strong conviction, it is not without significant risk. Using borrowed money (leverage) always amplifies potential losses. If the price of ETH were to fall substantially, the collateral in Aave could be liquidated to cover the loan. This would force the sale of ETH at a loss. The move also assumes that the future price appreciation of ETH will outpace any borrowing costs or market volatility. It’s a high-conviction, high-stakes play that retail investors should observe rather than blindly imitate. Key Takeaways for the Crypto Market This transaction is a masterclass in on-chain strategy. It provides a rare, transparent look into how sophisticated players operate. Their actions often serve as a leading indicator for market sentiment. A large-scale, leveraged bet on ETH accumulation from a Bitcoin veteran underscores a profound belief in Ethereum’s fundamental value and future trajectory. It suggests that some of the smartest money in crypto sees the current market as a prime buying opportunity. In summary, the $50 million USDT loan is far more than a simple transaction. It is a strategic vote of confidence. By leveraging a massive ETH holding without selling, this OG is positioning for greater exposure, signaling that their plan for continued ETH accumulation is firmly in motion. The market will be watching closely to see if this bold move foreshadows a broader trend. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Who is ‘1011short’ and why are they called a Bitcoin OG? A: ‘1011short’ is a pseudonymous cryptocurrency wallet address. The term “OG” (Original Gangster) is used in crypto circles to refer to early, influential, and often wealthy Bitcoin investors who have been in the space for many years. Q: How does borrowing against ETH help accumulate more? A: Instead of selling ETH (and potentially triggering taxes or losing future gains), the investor uses it as collateral for a loan. They receive stablecoins (USDT) which they can use to buy more ETH, thus increasing their total ETH holding without selling their original stash. Q: What is Aave and how was it used in this transaction? A: Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol. It allows users to deposit crypto assets as collateral to borrow other assets. In this case, ETH was deposited to borrow USDT. Q: Does this guarantee the price of ETH will go up? A: No. While it shows strong confidence from a major player, it does not guarantee price movement. All investments, especially leveraged ones, carry risk. Market prices are influenced by countless factors. Q: Should I copy this strategy? A: This is an advanced, high-risk strategy used by an investor with a massive portfolio. Retail investors should be extremely cautious with leverage, as it can lead to rapid, total losses if the market moves against the position. Q: Where can I track these kinds of large transactions? A: Blockchain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Nansen, and Arkham Intelligence track and report on major wallet movements, providing insights into what large holders are doing.

The People's Bank of China (PBoC) issued fresh warnings, signaling renewed determination to eliminate digital asset transactions despite an existing ban. The announcement came after a high-level meeting involving 13 government agencies. Officials expressed concern about the reemergence of speculative cryptocurrency activities. The central bank views this trend as a growing threat to financial stability and economic order. The PBoC restated its longstanding position on digital assets. Cryptocurrencies lack legal status as currency in China. They cannot serve as legal tender or be used as payment methods in commercial transactions. All cryptocurrency-related business activities remain classified as illegal financial operations. China implemented comprehensive prohibitions on cryptocurrency in 2021. The ban targeted both trading platforms and mining operations. Authorities justified these measures by citing criminal activity risks and potential threats to financial system stability. Three years later, regulators are doubling down on enforcement. Stablecoins Face Heightened Regulatory Pressure Chinese authorities have identified stablecoins as a particular concern. The central bank emphasized that these tokens fail to meet legal requirements for operation within China's borders. Regulators highlighted specific compliance failures. Stablecoin operations lack proper customer identification protocols. Anti-money laundering standards remain inadequate. These deficiencies create opportunities for criminal exploitation. The PBoC outlined several illegal uses of stablecoins. Money laundering operations frequently utilize these tokens as well as fraudulent fundraising schemes that incorporate stablecoins to evade detection. Unauthorized cross-border fund transfers rely on these digital assets to bypass capital controls. Previous regulatory actions targeted stablecoin promotion. In August, financial authorities ordered brokers to cancel planned seminars about stablecoins. Research promotion activities also faced suspension. Officials cited fraud risks as justification for these restrictions. The renewed focus on stablecoins reflects growing concern about their role in circumventing financial regulations. Their design mimics traditional currency stability while operating outside regulatory frameworks. This combination makes them attractive tools for illicit activities. Multi-Agency Coordination Strengthens Enforcement The November meeting established enhanced cooperation protocols among participating agencies. Thirteen separate government bodies committed to coordinated action against cryptocurrency violations. Information sharing will expand significantly. Agencies plan to develop improved monitoring systems for detecting cryptocurrency users. Enhanced technological capabilities will support identification efforts. The coordinated approach marks an escalation in enforcement strategy. Previous efforts focused primarily on shutting down exchanges and mining facilities. Current measures aim to identify and penalize individual users directly. Authorities face practical challenges in implementation. Cryptocurrency transactions can occur through decentralized platforms and peer-to-peer networks. These methods complicate detection and enforcement efforts. Mining Activity Persists Despite Ban The central bank emphasized its commitment to protecting economic stability. Officials portrayed the crackdown as essential for maintaining financial order. They linked cryptocurrency activity to broader risks facing the banking system. Evidence suggests China's cryptocurrency ban has not eliminated all digital asset activity. Recent data reveals continued bitcoin mining operations within the country. China holds the third-largest share of global bitcoin mining, according to data from October. The country accounts for approximately 14% of worldwide mining activity. This statistic indicates enforcement gaps in the existing regulatory framework. The persistence of mining operations demonstrates the difficulty of completely eliminating cryptocurrency activity. Mining can occur in remote locations with minimal infrastructure requirements. Detection requires sophisticated monitoring and substantial resources.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|MINING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-01 09:45:11

DEXs Took the Heaviest Hit Decentralized exchange volumes mirrored the broader pullback, dropping to $397.78 billion from October’s $568.43 billion, the lowest monthly total since June, according to DefiLlama data. Uniswap led DEX platforms with $79.98 billion in November volume, down from $123.88 billion the previous month, while PancakeSwap processed $70.57 billion, down from $102.02 billion in October. The DEX-to-CEX volume ratio slipped to 15.73% in November from 17.56% in October, signaling a continued shift toward centralized exchanges amid deteriorating market conditions. Bitcoin’s price action drove the volatility, with the crypto dropping from around $110,000 at the month’s start to a low near $81,000 on Nov. 21 before recovering slightly. Monday’s Asian trading session brought renewed pressure , with bitcoin plunging 6% to $85,616, extending the drawdown from October’s peak to 32%.

BOJ Rate Hike Expectations Trigger Carry Trade Unwind Mounting speculation around a December rate hike by the Bank of Japan emerged as the primary catalyst for Monday’s crash. Polymarket bettors now project a 52% chance of a 25-basis-point increase at the BOJ’s Dec. 18-19 meeting, while bond investors assign a 76% probability, according to analysts tracking Japanese yields. “ Bitcoin dumped cause BOJ put Dec rate hike in play, ” said BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes in an X post Monday, noting that a USD/JPY rate between 155 and 160 “ makes BOJ hawkish. “ $BTC dumped cause BOJ put Dec rate hike in play.

Reuters polling showed that 53% of economists expect a rate hike, driven by risks of imported inflation and fading political pressure to ease. ETF Outflows Compound Market Weakness Amid Corporate Bitcoin Concerns U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded their largest monthly outflow since February, with $3.48 billion in net withdrawals reversing October’s $3.42 billion in inflows, according to SoSoValue data . BlackRock’s IBIT led the exodus with $2.34 billion in November outflows, including a record single-day withdrawal of $523 million on the 18th. Despite the massive outflow, the cumulative net inflow for U.S. Bitcoin funds stands at $57.71 billion as of November 28, with $119.4 billion in net assets, representing 6.56% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Spot Ethereum ETFs also recorded their largest monthly net outflow on record at $1.42 billion, while freshly launched altcoin products bucked the trend, with XRP ETFs recording cumulative inflows of $666 million. Additional headwinds emerged from Strategy Inc.’s disclosure that it might sell bitcoin if its mNAV ratio turns negative, as per Bloomberg . “ We can sell Bitcoin and we would sell Bitcoin if we needed to fund our dividend payments below 1x mNAV, ” CEO Phong Le said Friday, adding it would be a last resort. The company’s mNAV has fallen to 1.19 from its $56 billion bitcoin stockpile.

55199580,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=870858,1764582636,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55199580.jpeg,European firms brace for higher costs as China tightens export controls,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/european-businesses-steep-costs-china-export/,"European businesses are dealing with mounting expenses and uncertainty due to China’s export restrictions, with some companies facing costs that could top hundreds of millions of dollars, a new survey shows. The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China released findings Monday showing one company estimates it will face more than €250 million ($290 million) in extra costs. Another business said the restrictions will add costs equal to about 20% of what it makes worldwide in 2025. The survey was done between Nov. 6 and Nov. 24. Around one-third of European businesses operating in China said they now plan to find suppliers in other countries because of these policies. The results show how much European companies depend on China for essential materials and technology, and what happens when that flow gets interrupted. Retaliation over trade war restrictions China put these controls in place to hit back at tariffs and other limits the US placed on Chinese goods during their trade fight. The restrictions cover resources like rare earths, which are hard to find elsewhere. China recently put a pause on some wider rules that would have blocked exports containing even small amounts of certain rare earths. This happened as part of a deal to ease tensions with the US. But both countries are still working out the details for general licenses that would make trade easier. They already missed their target to finish these talks before Thanksgiving. Stefan Bernhart, who serves as vice president of the European Chamber, said getting a general licensing system in place soon would help a lot. “Introducing a general licensing mechanism in the near future would provide much needed stability and predictability, and could put a floor under the deterioration of business confidence caused by these export controls,” he said. China’s export controls go beyond just rare earths and important minerals. The country also limits moving sensitive information across its borders and blocks some types of computer chips from being sold abroad. Germany buys more rare-earth magnets from China than any other single country. US shipments bounced back in October, hitting their highest point since January. But Germany received less for the second month straight after reaching a peak in August, based on the newest Chinese customs records. The survey findings about companies wanting to move their sourcing away from China didn’t explain where they would go or how they would do it, given that China controls so much of the mining and processing of rare earths. About 11% of companies that answered the survey said they worry about having to share information that includes their private business secrets when they apply for licenses. The report mentioned that the European Commission has a website where companies can request export licenses, check on customs clearance, and flag problems they run into. However, only 18 companies said they used this tool. A total of 131 chamber members answered the survey. Of those, 75 said Chinese export controls affected their business. Automakers scramble to replace Chinese parts European car companies are also looking for ways to remove parts that use Chinese components. They’re worried about growing political conflicts, including problems with chipmaker Nexperia and China’s rare earth restrictions. Several car manufacturers are pushing their main suppliers to find lasting replacements for Chinese semiconductors, people who know about the situation told Bloomberg. The car industry is thinking about bigger changes to how it gets parts to deal with changing political situations, said Matthias Zink, who leads CLEPA, Europe’s main suppliers group. “We had some indications already, questions like, ‘how can you supply me without this dependency on China?'” said Zink, who also runs the powertrain and chassis division at Schaeffler AG. These moves follow a sudden supply problem at Chinese-owned Nexperia in October. The situation got worse when China stopped exports of key parts from Nexperia’s Chinese factories after the Netherlands took control of the company’s Dutch locations.

In a remarkable shift, global digital asset funds recorded a substantial $1.06 billion in net inflows last week, signaling a potential resurgence in institutional confidence. This dramatic reversal, reported by CoinShares, suggests a changing market sentiment that every crypto investor should understand. What Sparked the Sudden Inflow into Digital Asset Funds? The primary catalyst appears to be macroeconomic. Analysts point to comments from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) member John Williams, which raised the possibility of an interest rate cut. This prospect weakened the US dollar and made non-yielding assets like Bitcoin more attractive. Consequently, investors redirected capital into digital asset funds, betting on a favorable monetary policy shift. Interestingly, this surge occurred during a week of notably low trading volume—just $24 billion compared to $56 billion the prior week—due to the US Thanksgiving holiday. This indicates the inflows were driven by strategic, deliberate investment decisions rather than high retail trading activity. Which Cryptocurrencies Led the Digital Asset Funds Rally? The inflows were not evenly distributed. A clear hierarchy emerged, showing where institutional money has the strongest conviction: Bitcoin (BTC): The flagship cryptocurrency dominated, with its associated investment products attracting $460 million in net inflows. This reinforces Bitcoin’s role as the primary gateway for institutional capital. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum products saw a strong $300 million inflow, highlighting continued confidence in the network’s ecosystem and its upcoming protocol upgrades. XRP: The standout performer was XRP, which recorded its largest-ever weekly net inflow at $290 million. This surge likely reflects optimism surrounding Ripple’s ongoing legal developments. This breakdown reveals that while Bitcoin remains the core holding, capital is also flowing into specific altcoins with compelling narratives, diversifying the holdings within digital asset funds. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Investment? This weekly snapshot is more than a blip; it’s a vital sentiment indicator. The break in the outflow streak suggests that the fear and selling pressure that dominated previous weeks may be subsiding. For investors, this pivot in digital asset funds could signal a buying opportunity or a moment to rebalance portfolios. However, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. One week of positive data does not guarantee a sustained bull run. Investors should watch for consistency in these inflows and monitor broader economic indicators, particularly Federal Reserve policy, which remains the dominant external force. Actionable Insights from the $1.06 Billion Inflow What can you, as an investor, learn from this movement in digital asset funds? Follow the Smart Money: Institutional inflows often precede retail momentum. Tracking weekly fund flow reports can provide an early signal. Context is Key: Always correlate crypto fund flows with macro news. This week proved that Fed commentary can directly impact capital allocation. Diversification is Evident: The significant inflows into Ethereum and XRP show that institutional strategies within digital asset funds are becoming more nuanced, looking beyond just Bitcoin. In conclusion, the $1.06 billion inflow marks a significant psychological and financial turning point. It demonstrates that latent demand for cryptocurrency exposure remains strong and can re-emerge quickly when conditions align. While caution is always warranted, the renewed interest in digital asset funds provides a compelling case for cautious optimism in the market’s near-term trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are “digital asset funds” or “investment products”? A1: These are financial vehicles, like exchange-traded products (ETPs) or trusts, that allow investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum without directly buying and storing the assets themselves. They are popular with institutional investors. Q2: Why do Fed rate cuts potentially help cryptocurrencies? A2: Lower interest rates typically weaken the US dollar and make yield-less assets like gold and Bitcoin more attractive. They also increase liquidity in financial markets, some of which can flow into riskier assets like crypto. Q3: Was the low trading volume during Thanksgiving a bad sign? A3: Not necessarily. The fact that substantial inflows occurred despite lower overall market activity suggests the buying was deliberate and conviction-driven, rather than just speculative day-trading. Q4: Does a single week of inflows mean the bear market is over? A4: One week is a positive signal, but it’s not conclusive. A sustained trend over several weeks is needed to confirm a true shift in market structure from distribution to accumulation. Q5: Why did XRP see record inflows? A5: XRP’s record $290 million inflow is likely tied to positive sentiment from Ripple’s partial legal victories against the US SEC, improving its regulatory clarity for investors. Q6: Where can I track this fund flow data myself? A6: CoinShares publishes a widely-followed “Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly” report. Other analysts like James Butterfill also share insights on social media platforms. Found this analysis of the digital asset funds turnaround helpful?

The campaign reflects Bitget’s push to give users simpler, more rewarding ways to engage with new ecosystems as interest in modular L1 development accelerates. MON is now available on Bitget with on-chain Earn subscriptions open at a promotional 20% APR from November 30 to December 7 (UTC+8). Users can subscribe flexibly through Bitget’s On-chain Earn interface on both web and app, making it one of the easiest entry points into Monad’s ecosystem at launch. When the promotion ends at noon on December 7, rates revert to their standard baseline displayed on the product page. In parallel, Bitget is opening an 800,000 MON trading pool for users who accumulate a qualifying amount of MON between November 24 and December 7. A daily snapshot system records net increases in users’ MON Earn positions, and the average new balance becomes the basis for calculating individual airdrops. Rewards scale proportionally, allowing both new and experienced traders to compete fairly across the full campaign period. Airdrops are distributed within five working days after the event closes. “MON is an exciting addition because it represents the next chapter of performance-first blockchain design,” said Gracy Chen , CEO of Bitget. “Users want real utility, real yield, and real participation, and our on-chain Earn and trading programs are designed to give them meaningful opportunities from day one.” The MON launch arrives just ahead of Bitget’s expanded POS Earn lineup, which introduces a new suite of staking products built for users who prefer predictable, asset-backed yields. As the Universal Exchange continues unifying CeFi, DeFi, and payment rails in a single environment, these products give users a smoother and more intuitive path into on-chain earning without the usual complexity barriers. The MON promotions mark another step in Bitget’s approach to UEX adoption: giving users a low-friction way to engage with tokens, earn through real on-chain mechanics, and benefit from trading activity in ways that feel accessible rather than intimidating. With more launches planned in December, Bitget continues to layer yield, liquidity, and discovery tools into a unified entry point for the next generation of on-chain participation.

BTC Pulls Back 20% While This Token Sells Out Rapidly,https://timestabloid.com/is-mutm-the-next-big-defi-crypto-btc-pulls-back-20-while-this-token/,"Bitcoin’s sharp 20% pullback this week has pushed many investors to reassess where the next major crypto opportunity may come from. Large-caps often slow down after big runs, and it’s usually during these cooling phases that early buyers start searching for alternatives with stronger upside potential. One fast-moving DeFi token priced at $0.035 has now entered that conversation, with its demand growing so quickly that its allocation is close to selling out. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin is still the market’s benchmark, but its recent behavior has raised concerns. BTC trades near $86,000, supported by a market cap around $1.7 trillion, yet strength hasn’t returned after the recent drop. Analysts point to heavy resistance zones around $95,700–$100,200, which have repeatedly rejected recoveries. Until BTC clears those levels, many believe sideways trading or another dip remains possible. Long-term optimism around Bitcoin is common, but short-term projections aren’t as attractive. Some analysts expect only a modest 5–10% rebound in the near term unless a major catalyst appears. With large-caps moving slower and volatility cooling down, investors looking for meaningful crypto investment opportunities are now scanning mid-caps and early-stage tokens for higher upside. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) In contrast to Bitcoin’s slower pace, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to attract significant early interest. The project is building a decentralized lending and borrowing platform designed around a dual-model system, allowing users to earn yield through mtTokens and open collateralized loan positions through smart contracts. It aims to offer a more efficient and transparent approach to borrowing and lending by removing intermediaries and automating risk management. Mutuum Finance recently shared on its official X account that its V1 protocol is entering the final development stage, with a Sepolia testnet launch scheduled for Q4 2025. The first version includes the liquidity pool, mtTokens for yield, a debt-tracking token and the liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be the initial supported assets. Investors see this as a key milestone, especially since the code is under formal analysis by Halborn Security. Rapid Token Allocation Drive Early Buyer Interest While BTC slows down, the MUTM presale remains one of the busiest of the year. The project has already crossed $18.85 million raised and attracted 18,100 holders, with 805 million tokens sold out of the total allocation. The current token price is $0.035, representing a 250% increase from the Phase 1 price of $0.01. Phase 6 is now nearing a full sellout, with allocation levels moving rapidly as demand increases. According to early investors, part of this momentum comes from clear mathematics: with a confirmed $0.06 launch price, buyers entering at $0.035 stand to benefit from a strong upside once the token goes live. Some analysts even suggest that early buyers could see 200–300% growth once exchange listings push visibility higher. The presale also includes features that keep activity high. The 24-hour leaderboard rewards the top contributor of the day with $500 in MUTM, creating consistent competition. At the same time, card payments with no purchase limits are now enabled, making entries smoother for new participants. Oracle Infrastructure and Security Layers What makes Mutuum Finance stand out to many analysts is the depth of its upcoming infrastructure. The team plans to launch a USD-pegged stablecoin tied to on-platform borrowing, designed so that interest generated flows into the protocol treasury. Many consider this an essential element for long-term ecosystem growth, as stablecoins often drive liquidity and user retention. Oracle systems will also play a key role. Mutuum Finance intends to rely on Chainlink feeds along with fallback and aggregated oracle models. This ensures accurate price data during volatile periods, leading to fairer liquidations and safer borrowing conditions. For a lending protocol, this is crucial. Security has also been reinforced. The project completed its CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan score, while Halborn’s independent audit is ongoing. In addition, a $50k bug bounty is active for identifying code vulnerabilities, which increases confidence among users participating early. These fundamentals are especially important when comparing MUTM to meme-coins or high-volatility assets. Investors searching for the best crypto to buy now often gravitate toward tokens with strong utility and a clear product roadmap, and Mutuum Finance fits this narrative. Why Investors Are Moving Quickly The combination of BTC’s slower momentum and Mutuum Finance’s accelerating demand is shaping a clear sentiment shift. Many investors who previously focused on large-caps are now rotating into smaller, utility-driven tokens ahead of potential market recovery. With Phase 6 nearly sold out, the remaining allocation is shrinking rapidly, and whales have reportedly begun accumulating larger positions at this stage. In a market where timing can dramatically influence returns, the early window for MUTM is closing fast. With V1 development progressing, stablecoin plans in motion, a strong audit record and a fast-moving presale, many analysts believe MUTM could become one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch going into Q1 2026. If the current buying pace continues, Phase 6 could reach 100% allocation sooner than expected — making now one of the final opportunities for early-stage entry before the token edges closer to its launch price.

The stablecoin will be used to pay for games, anime, and digital subscriptions across Sony’s ecosystem.“As early as fiscal 2026” is the target now, said Nikkei. The stablecoin will also be backed by assets like government bonds to keep its value steady, and as is typical in crypto, all transfers will be low‑cost and work across time zones without delays. Sony is planning to build a dollar stablecoin project in partnership with Bastion Sony reportedly expects U.S. users to switch to stablecoin payments for subscriptions tied to its digital services. This matters because the U.S. made up more than 30% of Sony Group’s total external sales in the fiscal year that ended March 2025. Sony Bank applied for a U.S. banking license in October, and it will also set up a new subsidiary to run the stablecoin business with help from Bastion, a U.S. company that already issues stablecoins. Meanwhile, the global stablecoin market is currently worth $315.8 billion. Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC of course continue to dominate the place, with their circulating supply worth a combined $260 billion as of press time, according to data tracked by CoinMarketCap. The Trump administration has backed stablecoins. Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, has ties to Tether. And Congress adopted a stablecoin regulatory framework, the Genius Act, earlier this year. Standard Chartered predicts that the stablecoin market will grow to $2 trillion by 2028. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent says the market will hit $3 trillion by 2030.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-escrow-protects-xrp-price-heres-how/,"Debates about XRP’s supply often ignore how Ripple built its system to create stability. SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), a well-known crypto researcher on X, has brought that structure back into focus. He shared documents showing a framework that shapes how XRP enters the market and how Ripple manages its holdings. The system may look simple, but it plays a major role in how XRP holds value and how its supply remains controlled. REMEMBER: RIPPLE’S ESCROW WAS CREATED TO PROTECT THE PRICE OF XRP The escrow framework was built to avoid sudden XRP inflows that could cause sharp price swings, maintaining a predictable release schedule. “This mechanism is intended to ensure that a large number of XRP… pic.twitter.com/sOp4C4pvDh — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) November 29, 2025 Why Ripple Put XRP in Escrow Ripple established the escrow in 2017. The company locked 55 billion XRP in a secured setup with monthly release contracts. This removed uncertainty around future supply. The document states that the design ensures that “a large number of XRP will not enter the market at one time and lead to a substantial reduction in the price of XRP.” That line captures the intent. Ripple wanted a clear release path that protects the market from sudden changes. The system operates through preset smart contracts. Each contract unlocks on a fixed date. While Ripple can make deals with these tokens while in escrow , the company cannot alter the timing or accelerate access to the tokens. If Ripple does not use all released XRP in a given month, the unused amount returns to escrow with a new expiration period. What the Escrow Means for XRP’s Market Health This structure helps maintain stability. It also protects the asset’s price . It gives the market a predictable supply schedule. The documents show that nearly 40% of all XRP remained in escrow as of July 2025. Ripple cannot transfer that portion until each contract matures. This helps traders and institutions form expectations about liquidity months ahead. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The framework also supports Ripple’s plans for market development. Ripple expects to use unlocked XRP for market-making incentives and for sales to institutional buyers. These uses come from the original explanation of the system. The consistent release timeline provides institutions with the clarity they need to plan their operations. It also limits speculation about sudden supply shifts . How This Positions XRP for Future Growth As more institutions adopt cryptocurrencies, a predictable supply becomes more important. XRP benefits from a structure that supports stable liquidity. A market that understands the supply timeline can price the asset more accurately. The escrow system helps maintain that environment. The information in the documents and SMQKE’s post confirms the core value of this design. It limits disorderly supply movements, supports trust in long-term planning, and reinforces XRP’s role as a reliable settlement asset .

Arthur Hayes’ $BTC $250K Call, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and the Next Crypto to Explode December 1, 2025 • 10:05 UTC Michael Saylor just flipped his usual orange-dot Sunday chart to green , teasing a fresh Strategy move after weeks of market stress around its 650k $BTC treasury and the risk of selling coins if mNAV dips below 1. That shows how much of the current cycle still runs through a handful of public balance sheets instead of actual Bitcoin infrastructure. You benefit more when throughput and adoption scale than when one listed stock adds or removes a few thousand $BTC. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) leans into that with a Bitcoin Layer-2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine, pushing transactions from multi-minute confirmation windows into seconds while keeping $BTC at the core through a canonical bridge. $HYPER powers gas, staking, and dApp access on this L2, so network activity and token demand move together rather than relying on corporate treasury games. At a presale price of $0.013355 and $28.8M raised so far, you step into the Bitcoin scaling trade instead of chasing the next Saylor hint. Read our $HYPER price prediction for 2026 and beyond. Altseason 2026 Signals Put Maxi Doge In The Frame As The Next Crypto To Explode December 1, 2025 • 10:05 UTC Altcoin season did not show up in 2025, yet the altcoin season index now hovers around 24 with $BTC dominance sliding under 60% again after November’s bounce, the same zone that preceded earlier rotation cycles. Analysts are watching multi-year support on the altcoin/$BTC chart where past rallies ignited, signalling that whales are quietly restocking risk. You position best when liquidity starts shifting but sentiment still feels cautious, and that is prime meme territory. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) leans into meme culture and degen leverage while pairing it with actual token mechanics. Staking already runs with 72% APY that decays as more holders lock in, rewarding early conviction instead of exit liquidity. The supply is fixed and the contract audited, which caps dilution while the team pushes trading contests and 100x–1000x-style speculation tools to keep volume sticky through an eventual 2026 altseason. At $0.000271 and a $4.24M presale raise, you get meme-level upside without paying peak-euphoria prices. Here’s how to buy Maxi Doge now.

55199916,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=224557,1764583810,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Support: Unshakeable Foundation Forms in Low $80,000s, Says Glassnode",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-support-foundation-low-80000s/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Support: Unshakeable Foundation Forms in Low $80,000s, Says Glassnode Bitcoin investors, take note: a critical line in the sand has been drawn. According to on-chain analytics powerhouse Glassnode, Bitcoin has forged a formidable Bitcoin support level in the low $80,000s. This isn’t just a random price point; it’s a zone where buyer conviction appears to be hardening, potentially creating a springboard for the market’s next major move. Let’s decode what this means for your portfolio. What Does “Bitcoin Support” Actually Mean? In simple terms, a support level is a price zone where buying interest is strong enough to prevent the asset from falling further. Think of it as a price floor. When Glassnode identifies a new Bitcoin support area, they are signaling that a significant number of investors are willing to buy BTC at that price, creating a buffer against sell-offs. This analysis comes from their proprietary Cost Basis Heatmap, a tool that visualizes where large clusters of Bitcoin were previously purchased. How Did Glassnode Identify This Crucial Level? The firm didn’t pull this number from thin air. Their conclusion is rooted in on-chain data—the immutable record of all Bitcoin transactions. The recent decline to the low $80,000s acted as a stress test. The fact that the price stabilized and attracted buyers at that level allowed Glassnode’s models to confirm a consolidation of cost basis, effectively cementing it as a new support zone. This is crucial because it shifts the market narrative. Instead of viewing dips with fear, traders can now watch how price behaves at this newly established Bitcoin support . Key signals to watch include: Volume on Retests: High buying volume when the price touches the low $80,000s again confirms the support is strong. Holders’ Behavior: A lack of spending from wallets that bought near this level shows long-term confidence. Exchange Flows: Decreasing Bitcoin reserves on exchanges suggest holders are moving coins to cold storage, not preparing to sell. Why Should This Bitcoin Support Matter to You? For any market participant, understanding major support and resistance levels is fundamental. This newly identified Bitcoin support provides a clearer framework for risk management. If you’re considering an entry, areas near established support often offer more favorable risk-reward ratios. Conversely, a decisive break below this level would be a significant warning sign, indicating the underlying buyer demand has weakened. However, it’s vital to remember that no support is unbreakable. Glassnode itself cautions that this zone will be tested, especially if broader selling pressure intensifies. The true strength of this Bitcoin support will be proven not when the price is calm, but when it is under duress. Actionable Insights from the Data So, what can you do with this information? First, avoid the temptation to see this as a guaranteed bounce zone. Instead, use it as a key reference point in your analysis. Second, combine this on-chain perspective with other technical and fundamental indicators for a more complete picture. Finally, maintain a disciplined strategy; don’t let a single data point override your overall investment plan. In conclusion, Glassnode’s identification of robust Bitcoin support in the low $80,000s offers a valuable data-driven anchor in a volatile market. It highlights where committed capital is entering the ecosystem, providing a potential foundation for Bitcoin’s next leg higher. While markets are never predictable, such clear signals from on-chain analytics help investors navigate with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “Cost Basis Heatmap” in simple terms? A: It’s a visual tool used by Glassnode that shows price levels where large amounts of Bitcoin were originally bought (the “cost basis”). Dense clusters on the map indicate strong support or resistance zones. Q2: Does strong support guarantee the price won’t fall below $80,000? A: No. Support levels indicate areas of increased buying interest, not guarantees. They can be broken if selling pressure overwhelms buyer demand, which is why risk management remains essential. Q3: How is on-chain data different from regular price charts? A: Price charts show the outcome of trading (the “what”). On-chain data, like Glassnode uses, reveals the activity behind the trades (the “why”), such as how coins are moving between wallets and exchanges. Q4: Should I buy Bitcoin immediately because of this support level? A: Not necessarily. This information is one piece of analysis. Your decision should align with your individual investment strategy, risk tolerance, and a consideration of multiple market factors. Q5: How often do these major support levels change? A> They evolve as the market moves. Significant price breakthroughs or prolonged consolidation at new levels can establish fresh support zones, which analytics firms then work to identify.

""It Had Started a Bear Market Before!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoins-critical-indicator-turns-red-it-had-started-a-bear-market-before/,"The leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), continues its unabated decline. At this point, the price has fallen below $86,000. While altcoins accompanied the decline in Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) and major altcoins also experienced significant losses. According to CoinMarketCap, Ethereum fell 6% to $2,820 in the last 24 hours; XRP fell 6.7% to $2; and Solana (SOL) fell 7% to $126. This decline is thought to be due to growing concerns about global liquidity withdrawals, as the Bank of Japan hinted at an interest rate hike, highlighting the possibility of a decrease in yen-based carry trades. The recent decline in Bitcoin has opened the door to further declines, with one analyst pointing to a long-term bearish signal for Bitcoin, pointing to $74.5,000. Accordingly, market analyst Omkar Godbole said that BTC’s monthly MACD indicator has turned negative/bearish. According to the analyst, this signals a potentially prolonged bearish trend for Bitcoin, as has been the case in past cycles. Accordingly, the analyst noted that this indicator has historically signaled the beginning of major bear markets, including those in 2014, 2018, and 2022. “Similar patterns emerged following bearish MACD crossovers in both 2018 and 2014, and these signals preceded deepening bear markets.” The analyst said that although historical data does not guarantee another decline, the MACD crossover may not necessarily lead to a decline, but the current market environment supports a downtrend. While the analyst warned investors to be wary of downside volatility, he said initial support is at $84,500, marked by the trendline connecting the ascending lows of 2023-2024. If this level is broken to the downside, the analyst said the Bitcoin price could fall to the April low of around $74,500 and then the 2021 peak around $70,000, which would be the next supports. *This is not investment advice.

In risk-on phases, performance-based trading communities and leaderboard-driven contests often attract capital faster than passive ‘hold and hope’ meme coin projects. Maxi Doge targets retail traders without whale capital, combining 1,000x leverage culture, trading competitions, and staking rewards into a meme coin-driven trading hub. Preparing a rotation strategy before any confirmed $XRP breakout can help traders capture outsized upside instead of chasing extended large-cap moves late in the cycle. $XRP has crept back into the conversation as one of the few majors with truly asymmetric upside narratives still on the table. With some analysts floating $10 and even $20 targets if the macro and legal backdrop line up, traders are again gaming out what a confirmed breakout could do to wider risk appetite. If $XRP even starts closing weekly candles above prior cycle resistance, you’re likely looking at a market that flips aggressively risk-on. Historically, that’s when flows tend to cascade down the curve: from Bitcoin into large-cap alts, then into higher-beta sectors like meme coins and micro-cap narratives. For traders, the question isn’t just ‘will $XRP hit $10?’ but ‘how do you position if it tries?’. In a regime shift like that, majors can double or triple, but small caps and meme coins often move 10x–50x faster – both ways. Rotation strategy, not passive bag-holding, usually decides who captures the real upside. 💡 That’s the backdrop where Maxi Doge ($MAXI) starts to make sense as a narrative vehicle. It’s built explicitly around 1,000x leverage culture, trading competitions and meme coin-first branding. It’s a combination aimed at retail traders who want to surf the wave of a risk-on market, not just watch whales dictate the trend. $XRP Breakout Hype and the Shift to High-Beta Risk When majors like $XRP or $SOL enter sustained uptrends, you typically see volatility-per-dollar drop on the large caps and spike further out on the risk curve. That dynamic pushes more aggressive traders into the meme coin and altcoin sectors, where liquidity is thinner but each marginal dollar has more impact on price. The meme coin and trading-community space is already crowded with brands like $DOGE, $SHIB, and $PEPE defining the baseline for what ‘beta’ looks like in crypto. New entrants now need more than a dog logo – they need a clear culture, a trading hook, and a product loop that rewards consistent engagement during both chops and breakouts. In a potential $XRP-driven melt-up, high-beta meme coin plays with clear identities and mechanisms for competition will likely be the ones that capture rotational flows. 💡 Maxi Doge ($MAXI) positions itself as one of several options here, leaning heavily into gym-bro leverage memes and performance-based contests, rather than just passive holding culture. Why Maxi Doge Fits A Risk-On Rotation Playbook Where most meme coins stop at vibes, Maxi Doge leans into a full ‘Leverage King Culture, branding itself as a 240-lb canine juggernaut embodying 1,000x trading mentality. 💡 The core idea is simple: retail traders lack whale-level capital, so you compensate with conviction, discipline, and structured competitions that reward outsized ROI, not just raw size. That ethos is wired into the product loop. Holder-only trading contests and public leaderboards turn $MAXI into more than a static meme coin. Partner tournaments with futures platforms are also included in the $MAXI roadmap. $MAXI is set to become a scoreboard for who trades the best in a bull market. For a risk-on crowd, bragging rights plus rewards is a strong engagement flywheel. That in itself sets Maxi Doge up to be one of the best meme coins to watch. Under the hood, the presale has already raised $4.2M+ signaling early demand for the narrative rather than just thin hype. At the moment, $MAXI tokens are priced at $0.000271. Dynamic staking – currently at 73% – adds another layer for traders who want exposure without full-time screen-watching. ➡️ Check out our guide to buying Maxi Doge if you plan to join the presale. At the end of the day, if $XRP does ignite a full-blown risk-on phase, traders who already mapped out their high-beta rotation – including a meme coin-trading hub like $MAXI – will be better placed than those scrambling after the move. Consider $MAXI while the rotation thesis is still forming. 🚀 Join the Maxi Doge presale before the next price hike.

Key Takeaways: Japan plans to tax crypto gains at a flat 20%, matching the rate applied to stocks and investment funds. Crypto income would move into a separate tax category under the 2026 reform, split between national and local governments. Officials expect the change to boost trading activity and strengthen Japan’s digital-asset industry. The plan, first reported by Nikkei , signals a major shift in how the country treats crypto profits and could ease one of the biggest complaints among local investors. Japan Plans Separate Tax Regime for Crypto Income in 2026 Reform Under the proposal, income from cryptocurrency trading would no longer be lumped together with salaries or business earnings. Instead, it would fall under a separate taxation scheme, with 15% of revenue directed to the central government and 5% allocated to prefectural and municipal authorities. The reform is expected to be written into Japan’s 2026 tax policy outline, due later this year. At present, profits from digital assets are taxed at progressive rates that can climb as high as 55%, depending on total income. Critics say this structure discourages selling and distorts trading behavior, as investors try to avoid triggering steep tax bills. By contrast, gains from equities and investment trusts are already taxed at a uniform 20%. Japan might become the silent bull for Bitcoin Everyone is asking why BTC is falling But nobody is looking at Japan and that’s where the real longterm story is building Japan is about to flip the script Crypto reclassified as a financial product Flat 20% tax instead of… pic.twitter.com/19D310kA91 — Mrmemon /acc (@Mrmemon0147) December 1, 2025 Lawmakers backing the proposal argue that lowering the burden could revive trading activity in the domestic market and ultimately lead to higher overall tax revenue. They also see the reform as a way to encourage innovation across the broader technology sector, including companies building services around blockchain infrastructure. The effort reflects a wider view in government that cryptocurrencies have evolved into a standard investment category rather than a fringe asset class. Industry figures show strong participation at the retail level. Data from the Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association indicate there are around eight million active crypto accounts in the country, while spot trading volume in September alone reached approximately 1.5 trillion yen, or $9.6 billion. If enacted, the change would mark one of the most crypto-friendly tax reforms by a major economy in recent years. Japanese Asset Managers Build Crypto Fund Teams Ahead of Rule Shift As reported, Nomura Asset Management has formed a cross-division task force to prepare product strategies for a post-regulatory-change environment, while Daiwa Asset Management is coordinating closely with ETF specialist Global X Japan. Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management and Amova Asset Management are also evaluating fund lineups for both retail and institutional investors. Still, practical challenges remain. Asset managers must determine pricing benchmarks, ensure they can acquire crypto quickly enough to match investor flows, and put robust custody and security systems in place. The volatility of digital assets also looms large. Meanwhile, Japan is preparing a major reset of its crypto rulebook, moving to treat digital assets as financial products subject to insider trading laws and to lower the tax burden on profits. The Financial Services Agency is drafting measures that would cover 105 cryptocurrencies listed domestically, including Bitcoin and Ethereum .

Meanwhile, Uzbekistan is also moving forward with stablecoin adoption by launching a regulated sandbox in 2026 to test blockchain-based payment systems and allowing tokenized securities to be issued and traded domestically. This is part of the regional push across Central Asia where countries like Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan are quickly moving forward with stablecoin, CBDC, and digital asset initiatives. Sony Bank Plans US Stablecoin Sony Bank, the digital lending arm of Sony Financial Group, is preparing a major push into the US market with plans to launch its own US dollar-pegged stablecoin as early as 2026. According to reporting from Nikkei , the stablecoin is expected to play a key role in Sony’s huge entertainment ecosystem, and will allow users in the United States to pay for PlayStation games, subscriptions, anime content, and other digital services directly with a blockchain-based asset rather than traditional payment methods. The initiative is designed not only to expand Sony’s presence in the US, which is a region that accounts for roughly 30% of the company’s external sales, but it will also reduce the fees it currently pays to major credit-card networks. Report from NikkeiAsia Sony Bank submitted an application for a US banking license in October as part of its plan to establish a stablecoin-focused subsidiary. In addition to this, the company partnered with Bastion, a US stablecoin issuer backed by Coinbase Ventures. Sony’s venture arm also participated in Bastion’s recent $14.6 million funding round. If approved, the new subsidiary will allow Sony to issue its stablecoin under US regulatory oversight while directly integrating blockchain payments into its existing product lines. The stablecoin project is part of Sony Bank’s expansion into Web3, an area the company has been steadily developing over the past year. In June, the bank launched a dedicated Web3 unit, which was later named BlockBloom , to explore blockchain-based financial services including NFT storage, crypto wallets and exchange platforms. Announcement from Sony Bank Sony Bank said earlier this year that digital assets are becoming more central to new business models, and it plans to tap into the growing intersection of fan engagement, digital collectibles, and traditional financial services. BlockBloom’s mission is to merge these elements into a single ecosystem that connects artists, fans, real-world experiences, digital assets, and multiple forms of currency. This shift comes on the heels of Sony Financial Group’s recent spin-off from Sony Group, with its shares debuting on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in September. The separation was designed to give both companies clearer strategic pathways, with Sony Bank now using that independence to expand more aggressively into blockchain-driven products. Uzbekistan Tests Stablecoin Payments Stablecoins are making progress in other jurisdictions as well. Uzbekistan is preparing to integrate stablecoins directly into its national payment ecosystem, beginning with a tightly supervised regulatory sandbox that is set to launch on Jan. 1, 2026. According to local outlet Kun , the new law that was signed last week places the experimental framework under the authority of the National Agency for Perspective Projects and the central bank. The sandbox will allow selected pilot programs to test stablecoin-based payment systems built on distributed ledger technology. This is the country’s biggest step yet toward formalizing digital assets in its financial infrastructure. The initiative is part of a modernization push that will also allow Uzbekistan-based companies to issue tokenized shares and bonds beginning next year. Licensed stock exchanges will host a dedicated platform for trading these digital securities. The developments also follow comments made in September by Central Bank Chairman Timur Ishmetov, who said that studies on digital currencies were underway and warned that crypto activity must be conducted under strict oversight due to its potential impact on monetary policy. Central Bank Chairman Timur Ishmetov Alongside its stablecoin exploration, Uzbekistan is considering the introduction of a central bank digital currency, though Ishmetov indicated that such an instrument will be limited to interbank settlements rather than retail use. At the same time, regulators tightened their stance on crypto market participants, with the National Agency for Prospective Projects doubling monthly fees for exchanges to about $20,015 under a directive that was issued in March of 2024. The country’s digital asset ambitions form part of a regional trend across Central Asia, where governments are quickly advancing their own crypto and CBDC frameworks. In fact, Kyrgyzstan recently introduced a stablecoin pegged to the national currency and outlined plans for a CBDC and a state-run digital asset reserve. Kazakhstan, however, is still the regional front-runner. Authorities there have taken down 130 illicit crypto platforms tied to money laundering operations this year and continue to advance a dual-track digital asset strategy that includes a CBDC pilot , a state-backed stablecoin, and the establishment of a national crypto reserve in partnership with Binance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-01 11:30:00

Can SOL Rise Higher Than This Emerging Defi Crypto?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-etf-inflows-hit-621m-after-21-days-can-sol-rise-higher-than-this-emerging-defi-crypto/,"The institutional confidence level in Solana is rapidly escalating, with a monumental influx of $621 million into its exchange-traded funds within only 21 days. This monumental rise, coupled with a single-day contribution of $53.1 million, reflects a steadily increasing belief among institutional investors in the viability of the asset class. Even as institutional support propels Solana to the gates of the $150 level, a new crop of decentralized finance projects is attracting sophisticated investment interest. Of these, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is breaking records in its presale run and is ready with a revolutionary solution with immense growth potential, enough to rival even the most established names in the industry. Solana’s Institutional Endorse Solana’s recent price movement is directly related to this institutional investment influx. Top investment firms such as Bitwise and Grayscale, and most recently, a filing with the SEC for a Solana ETF by investment giant Franklin Templeton, reflect a deep institutional acceptance of SOL’s viability. This institutional support helps SOL greatly with market credibility and support levels, although the key question would be its ability to resist staying above $150. For those looking for the best crypto to invest in options available today, Solana stands out due to the aforementioned endorsement in the traditional financial sector. But those looking for the next big thing in crypto often look beyond established cryptocurrencies and into the best high growth projects available within a presale stage. Mutuum Finance: A Highly Promising DeFi Player Solana is basking in the glory of being an institutional darling, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) however is doing things its own way with a truly impressive public presale under its belt with a staggering amount of over $19,030,000 already being contributed by a rapidly growing community of 18,270 holders. The project is currently in Phase 6 of its presale with the MUTM token being only $0.035. A substantial 250% rise from its Phase 1 value shows the rising demand. With 95% of Phase 6 sold out, the opportunity to buy the token at this stage is rapidly impending. Phase 7 will initiate a rise of almost 20% with a value of $0.040, making the present phase the last entry stage before the next rise takes place. This can present a potential ROI of more than 400% for present investors with its impending launch value of $0.06, making MUTM a strong contender for those considering which crypto is the best investment option. Innovative Protocol and Urgent Incentives Mutuum Finance is doing much more than riding the presale wave; it is creating a complex lending platform with a two-market setup. Its innovative design fuses Peer-to-Contract pools for high liquidity assets with Peer-to-Peer markets for tailored loan services, providing a dynamic and optimal solution for lenders and borrowers. Security is always a core priority, with a trusted audit currently underway by Halborn Security for its lending and borrowing smart contracts prior to mainnet launch. Adding further impetus for potential investors, the project has built in a 24-hour leaderboard feature. This means that every day, the highest-ranked investor will be rewarded with an additional bonus of $500 MUTM. Moreover, the project has made it easier for people to acquire tokens by implementing unlimited purchases via credit cards. For those looking for the best crypto investment with sound fundamentals and timely potential, Mutuum Finance’s symbiotic incentives would be hard to resist. A Strategic Diversification Opportunity The remarkable ETF inflows only serve to re-emphasize Solana’s established strength, but the potential for an ‘explosive growth’ may always be found within new and sound projects such as Mutuum Finance, with the rapidly progressing presale stage providing a window of opportunity that is definitely ‘marketed’ against the already matured market performances of established cryptocurrencies. With a tested presale model, a new technological infrastructure, and a promising community, its importance as a top-rated crypto investment in the defi sector is firmly established within the crypto space. With the ever-growing evolution of the crypto marketplace, partnerships with projects showing both strong functionality and potential growth paths can be critical for greatest financial gains. Final Analysis on High-Potential Assets Solana’s institutional acceptance and Mutuum Finance’s grassroots success, which run alongside each other, represent the two different investment options available. Solana provides a stable means of growth with the backing of mainstream finance, whereas Mutuum Finance provides high growth with investment in a new crypto project with a lot of potential. With the presale period almost winding up, the opportunity to invest in the project under the present price is a one-time offer which shrewd investors are taking advantage of.

In a post on X, Sacks accused the outlet of pursuing a predetermined narrative and ignoring months of evidence he said disproved its claims. Sacks Rejects NYT Conflict Claims, Calls Narrative “False” and “Misleading” The New York Times published its report on Sunday, outlining how Sacks’s wide portfolio of technology and crypto investments could benefit from policy decisions he has helped shape as a special government employee. Source: New York Times The article detailed Sacks’s involvement in the administration’s artificial intelligence strategy, his meetings with Silicon Valley executives, and his long-standing ties to major tech founders. Sacks responded by calling the story the result of a five-month effort to construct a “hoax.” In his post, titled “INSIDE NYT’S HOAX FACTORY,” he said a team of reporters repeatedly shifted the focus of their accusations after he provided evidence disputing earlier claims. INSIDE NYT’S HOAX FACTORY Five months ago, five New York Times reporters were dispatched to create a story about my supposed conflicts of interest working as the White House AI & Crypto Czar. Through a series of “fact checks” they revealed their accusations, which we debunked… pic.twitter.com/o67ls3RmC6 — David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 30, 2025 “Today they evidently just threw up their hands and published this nothing burger,” Sacks wrote. According to Sacks, the Times’ allegations included a “fabricated dinner” with a major tech executive, supposed promises of presidential access, and claims that he influenced defense contracts. Each, he said, was “debunked in detail,” yet the investigation continued. He also criticized the paper for including only selected portions of responses he and his team had provided over several months. Sacks said the Times ignored key information that contradicted its framing. “At no point… was NYT willing to update the premise of their story to accept that I have no conflicts of interest to uncover,” he wrote. The Crypto Czar said he eventually hired the law firm Clare Locke, known for its defamation work, after concluding the Times was not pursuing a fair process. He attached the firm’s letter to the newspaper, saying the document provided “full context” for the exchanges. NYT Highlights Sacks’s Expanding Influence in Trump Administration’s Tech Agenda Sacks is best known as a co-founder and partner at Craft Ventures, a firm with hundreds of technology investments across software, crypto, and artificial intelligence. His government role, unpaid and structured under the “special government employee” designation, has faced scrutiny since early this year. In May, Senator Elizabeth Warren said Sacks was “financially invested in the crypto industry,” which she argued could allow him to benefit from policy changes developed inside the White House. Source: United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs While The Times report described Sacks as one of the most influential technology figures in the Trump administration and highlighted his role in drafting the administration’s AI Action Plan and hosting high-profile industry forums, the report detailed concerns raised by some officials about an AI summit Sacks helped plan in July. The event was initially expected to be hosted by the “All-In” podcast, which Sacks co-anchors. According to the Times, some White House staff were worried that sponsorship packages connected to the podcast would create the appearance of selling access. The arrangement was later changed, the report said. The Times also examined Sacks’s broad investment portfolio, which includes his long-standing network within Silicon Valley, where he has invested alongside figures such as Elon Musk and Peter Thiel for more than two decades. His ethics waivers, issued in March, noted that he had sold or begun selling many of his crypto and AI assets.

However, the Times said the filings do not provide details on the timing of those divestments. Notably, Sacks’s own spokesperson said the narrative of conflicts of interest was “false,” adding that his work for the government has cost him financially rather than benefited him.

Key Takeaways: Silver has doubled this year on rate-cut bets, a weaker dollar, and rising industrial demand. Bitcoin is down over 30% from its peak as crypto markets suffer their sharpest pullback since 2022. ETF outflows and on-chain losses show stress in crypto, even as metals draw fresh investor interest. Gold climbed to its highest level in six weeks on Monday as investors increased bets on a US interest-rate cut, pushing spot prices above $4,240 an ounce. Silver jumped even harder , touching a record near $57.86 before easing slightly, and is now up more than 100% this year. Rate-Cut Bets and Weak Dollar Fuel Silver’s Record Run The move comes as markets reprice expectations for looser monetary policy. Recent soft US data and dovish remarks from policymakers have fueled anticipation that the Federal Reserve could trim rates as soon as this month. Futures markets now imply a high probability of a cut, and the dollar has slipped to a two-week low, making metals cheaper for overseas buyers. Analysts also point to stronger industrial demand as a tailwind for silver, alongside its traditional role as a hedge when confidence in paper assets fades. While metals surge, crypto is wrestling with a very different mood. BREAKING: Silver hits new record high of $57.8 per ounce, is now up 100% this year. pic.twitter.com/td1UNjHTBh — The Spectator Index (@spectatorindex) December 1, 2025 Bitcoin has shed more than 30% from its October peak near $126,000 and now trades around $86,000, Linh Tran, Market Analyst at XS.com, said in a comment. November alone delivered a double-digit slide, capping the worst late-year performance since the 2022 bear market. In the past six weeks, the wider crypto market has lost about $1 trillion in value, with Bitcoin accounting for over $400 billion of that decline. Institutional flows tell a similar story. US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded roughly $3.5 billion in net outflows in November, the heaviest monthly withdrawal since approvals early last year. Investors have used the vehicles as a quick exit as macro risk rises, reversing the pattern that once amplified upside during the rally. Signs of stress also appear on-chain, where realized losses among short-term holders have spiked to levels last seen in late 2022, a signal of capitulation by late entrants and leveraged traders. Bitcoin ETF Outflows Ease as Institutional Base Holds Firm Still, there are hints that the bleeding may be slowing, Tran said. Late in November, ETFs registered a modest return to net inflows , adding about $70 million. While small relative to earlier exits, the shift suggests selling pressure could be exhausting itself. Cumulatively, ETFs still hold close to $120 billion in Bitcoin, around 6.5% of the network’s market value, indicating that the long-term institutional footprint remains intact. So does silver’s breakout foreshadow a crypto rebound? Historically, easier money lifts all risk assets, but timing matters. Metals often move first when rate expectations change. Digital assets tend to follow once liquidity actually turns. For now, Bitcoin appears locked in a volatile range between $80,000 and $90,000, with the risk of a deeper test toward $70,000 if macro conditions sour again. “In the medium and long term, if the Fed begins to signal clearer monetary easing, macro risks ease, and ETF flows shift from net outflows to neutral or net inflows, Bitcoin will have the runway to establish a new upward cycle,” Tran said.

Cardano’s ADA was among the worst-hit, with its price slipping by 8% over the past 24 hours. However, one crucial metric suggests a rebound could be on the way. Are the Bulls Coming Back? The past several months have been quite painful for Cardano’s investors, as the asset’s valuation currently trades below $0.40, representing a 60% decline from the local peak in mid-September. The market capitalization slipped under $15 billion, making it harder for ADA to return to crypto’s top 10 club. ADA Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the bearish conditions, some analysts believe there is light at the end of the tunnel. X user Ali Martinez observed ADA’s recent price performance and claimed that the TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal. Marcus Cornivus also chipped in, outlining the $0.38-$0.40 range as the “biggest demand zone.” The analyst thinks that if this floor holds, “the chart becomes a launchpad and the next wave opens fast.” He argued that the mid-range at $0.55-$0.60 is the first wall, and if momentum wakes up, there might be a breakout toward $0.82-$0.85. “This is the moment where ADA tells the story. Hold the base and the bounce fires. Lose it and the structure shifts. Right now, the odds lean toward strength, and the chart is still alive with energy,” the analyst concluded. A few days ago, X user Smith said he remains unfazed by ADA’s dump and used the opportunity to increase his exposure to the token. The analyst believes the coin has 10x potential, envisioning an explosion above $3. Observing Other Metrics ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) supports the thesis of a short-term recovery. The technical analysis tool ranges from 0 to 100 and measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes to help traders identify a possible pivot point. It currently stands below 30, meaning oversold territory and a potential buying opportunity. On the other hand, anything above 70 is interpreted as a bearish zone. ADA RSI, Source: CryptoWaves The asset’s exchange netflow over the past several months is also a sign of hope for the bulls. According to CoinGlass’s data, outflows have significantly surpassed inflows within that period, suggesting that investors have been shifting from centralized platforms to self-custody methods. This, in turn, reduces the immediate selling pressure.

While a recovery began in late November, it didn't last. Bitcoin, which rose above $91,000 with the recovery, entered December with a decline and fell to the $86,000 level. These ETF outflows were the largest in the last 9 months. Spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net outflows for four consecutive weeks, totaling $3.5 billion in outflows for the month, The Block reported. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF IBIT fund led the outflows, recording net outflows of $2.34 billion in November. IBIT, notably, saw its largest single-day outflow since its inception on the 18th of last month, with an outflow of $523 million. Nick Ruck, Head of Research at LVRG, said the outflow was driven by institutions taking profits and rebalancing their portfolios for the year-end after Bitcoin reached a new record high. He added that this activity didn't impact Bitcoin's underlying fundamentals. Ethereum's Uptrend Continues! Spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs also recorded their highest-ever net outflow, with $1.42 billion in net outflows, according to the data. In contrast, newly launched altcoin ETFs like Solana (SOL) and XRP have continued to record net inflows since their launch. Nick Luck noted that while new altcoin ETFs like Solana are attracting steady capital flows despite high volatility, institutional capital remains concentrated in Bitcoin and Ethereum, indicating that this structure is likely to continue until regulatory clarity and on-chain stability are achieved. *This is not investment advice.

By press time, XRP’s market capitalization stood at $123.15 billion, down from $134 billion a day earlier. The decline represents a staggering $10.85 billion wipeout, making the token the biggest loser among top assets by market cap. XRP one-day market cap chart. Source: CMC The sell-off also dragged XRP’s price significantly lower. The asset has fallen nearly 7% in the past 24 hours to trade at $2.03, erasing much of the momentum it attempted to rebuild earlier in the week. On a weekly timeframe, XRP is down nearly 1%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold XRP loses key support levels At its current level, XRP is signaling bearishness, with its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2.36 and its 200-day SMA at $2.65. The price now sits 13.6% below the shorter-term average and 22.9% below the longer-term one. The 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 45.8 in neutral territory, pointing to consolidation without immediate oversold pressure. XRP’s sell-off is part of the broader market downturn that saw major assets, led by Bitcoin ( BTC ), wipe out billions in the past 24 hours. Part of the decline was driven by a historic move in Japan’s bond market, where for the first time since 2008, yields on 2-year Japanese Government Bonds breached the 1% threshold, signaling rising expectations of a Bank of Japan rate hike. XRP fundamentals Notably, XRP’s market structure has weakened despite strong institutional developments, including significant inflows into the asset’s spot exchange-traded funds. Spot ETF inflows reached $666.6 million, driven largely by 21Shares’ new TOXR product, while exchange supplies fell 45% over the past 60 days, signaling sustained accumulation. Large holders also added 150 million XRP since November 25, underscoring ongoing long-term confidence. However, these supportive flows have not been enough to counter the aggressive wave of selling that hit as risk assets broadly weakened. Heavy derivatives unwinds and large-lot spot selling accelerated the decline, leaving the asset vulnerable to losing the $2 support. With XRP recently trading in tandem with the broader market, how major assets such as Bitcoin react to the current downturn will likely serve as a catalyst for XRP’s next major move.

That’s the staggering reality of stablecoins, and central bankers are no longer watching from the sidelines. In a pivotal statement, Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron declared that stablecoins have definitively shed their ‘fringe asset’ label. This marks a crucial turning point for the entire crypto ecosystem. Why Are Stablecoins Suddenly a Top Priority for Regulators? Governor Yaron’s announcement wasn’t made in a vacuum. He presented hard data that demands attention. The global market capitalization for stablecoins now exceeds $300 billion. To put that in perspective, that’s larger than the GDP of many nations. Furthermore, their monthly trading volume surpasses $2 trillion, integrating them deeply into global capital flows. When assets reach this scale, regulators have no choice but to engage. The core message is clear: the era of treating stablecoins as an experimental side project is over. Their sheer size and public adoption have forced a paradigm shift. Central banks, including the Bank of Israel, are now transitioning from observation to active preparation for supervision. What Does “Active Supervision” for Stablecoins Actually Mean? An “active supervisory framework” signals a move towards formal rules and oversight. This likely involves several key areas: Reserve Audits: Ensuring the fiat currency or assets backing each stablecoin are truly held and verifiable. Issuer Licensing: Creating official licenses for companies that issue stablecoins, similar to banks or money transmitters. Consumer Protection: Establishing rules to protect users from fraud, operational failures, or sudden de-pegging events. Financial Stability Monitoring: Assessing how large-scale use of stablecoins could impact the traditional banking system and monetary policy. This framework aims to bring clarity and safety to a market that has grown rapidly with minimal formal guardrails. The goal isn’t necessarily to stifle innovation, but to integrate these digital assets safely into the broader financial world. The Global Ripple Effect: Will Other Central Banks Follow? The Bank of Israel’s stance is a significant indicator of a global trend. When a major central bank publicly commits to regulating stablecoins , it creates pressure for others to define their positions. We’ve already seen similar movements from the European Union with MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation and ongoing discussions at the U.S. Federal Reserve and Treasury. This coordinated, if gradual, move towards regulation presents both a challenge and an opportunity. For the crypto industry, clear rules can reduce uncertainty and attract more institutional investment. For users, it promises greater security. However, the key will be designing regulations that manage risk without crushing the utility and efficiency that made stablecoins popular in the first place. What’s the Final Verdict on Stablecoins Entering the Mainstream? Governor Yaron’s statement is a watershed moment. It officially acknowledges what market data has shown for years: stablecoins are a fundamental piece of modern finance. They are no longer a niche tool for crypto traders but a critical infrastructure for global payments, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi). The journey from fringe to mainstream is complete. The next chapter is about building the responsible, supervised systems that will allow this $300 billion asset class to grow safely and benefit the global economy. Ignoring them is no longer an option for the world’s financial guardians. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What did the Bank of Israel Governor actually say about stablecoins? Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron stated that stablecoins can no longer be treated as fringe assets due to their massive scale—over $300B in market cap and $2T in monthly trading volume. He announced the central bank is preparing an active supervisory framework for them. Why are stablecoins so important to regulators now? Their enormous size and integration into global capital flows mean they pose potential risks to financial stability and consumer protection. Regulators believe they have grown too large and systemically important to remain unregulated. What is an “active supervisory framework”? It refers to a set of formal rules and oversight mechanisms that a central bank or regulator puts in place. This typically includes licensing for issuers, regular audits of reserves, consumer protection rules, and monitoring for systemic risk. Will this make stablecoins safer to use? In theory, yes. Proper regulation should increase transparency (e.g., proving reserves are held) and hold issuers accountable, reducing the risk of fraud or collapse. However, the specific rules will determine the final impact. Does this mean stablecoins are fully accepted by traditional finance? Not fully accepted, but they are now officially recognized as a major financial instrument that cannot be ignored. Acceptance and integration will be a gradual process shaped by the new regulations. How will this affect the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? While not directly linked, legitimizing and regulating a core piece of crypto infrastructure like stablecoins could reduce systemic risk in the ecosystem. This may improve overall investor confidence and pave the way for broader institutional adoption of digital assets. Found this breakdown of the shifting regulatory landscape insightful? The move of stablecoins into the mainstream is a story that affects every crypto user.

The initiative sparks curiosity about XRP's potential to excel in the market this week. This development leaves investors eager to see if XRP will lead the charge and which other coins might follow suit. XRP Recovery Potential: Eyeing Key Resistance Levels Source: tradingview XRP is trading in the $2.02 to $2.29 range, showing minor recent dips. It's facing a bit of a struggle, with its nearest resistance just above $2.40. The optimistic outlook sees it aiming for $2.68, sparking a potential growth of about 20% from the lower support at $1.89. Yet, it's important to note that XRP has slipped by just under 9% over the past six months, with a deeper drop over the month. Despite the fall, there may be room for recovery if market trends shift positively, especially if it breaches past those resistance hurdles. Conclusion XRP could see a strong performance this week due to the new collaboration. The partnership might boost its visibility and use, potentially attracting more investors. While other coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin remain stable, the specific deal could offer XRP a unique advantage. Anticipation around this news might drive trading volumes and price movements for XRP. This situation presents a chance for XRP to outshine its market peers shortly.

While headlines often focus on massive Bitcoin whale movements, new data reveals a crucial change: these giant holders are pulling back just as everyday investors step up their buying. This divergence sends a powerful signal about the market’s current health and its potential next moves. Let’s break down what this means for your portfolio. What Does Slowing Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Really Mean? On-chain data from analytics firm Santiment shows a clear trend: the pace of accumulation by major Bitcoin whale addresses is decelerating. These entities, often holding thousands of coins, are powerful market movers. Their reduced buying pressure removes a key pillar of support. Historically, when Bitcoin whale activity slows after a period of accumulation, it can indicate profit-taking or a wait-and-see approach, often preceding increased price volatility. This behavior is a classic late-cycle signal that analysts watch closely. Why Are Retail Investors Buying the Dip Now? In a fascinating counter-trend, addresses holding less than 1 BTC—typically retail investors—are increasing their purchases during price dips. This “dip-buying” suggests a few things: Long-term conviction: Smaller investors may see current levels as a good long-term entry point. Different time horizons: Unlike whales moving large sums, retail buys are often smaller and more frequent. Market maturation: Increased accessibility through exchanges and apps makes it easier for retail to act quickly. However, retail demand alone often lacks the sheer volume to drive a sustained bull run without institutional or Bitcoin whale support. How Do Macro Factors and ETFs Influence This Dynamic? The macroeconomic backdrop seems oddly positive. The Federal Reserve has ended quantitative tightening, and rate cuts are expected this year. Normally, this would be rocket fuel for risk assets like Bitcoin. Yet, upward momentum remains capped. Why? The market is currently trapped in a liquidity tug-of-war. Confidence in a strong rebound is low without two key factors recovering: ETF Fund Flows: Sustained net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs are crucial for bringing new, institutional capital into the market. On-Chain Liquidity: This refers to the active movement and trading of Bitcoin on the blockchain, indicating healthy market activity. Until these engines restart, the market may struggle to find decisive direction, regardless of retail Bitcoin whale divergence. What Are the Key Levels to Watch For a Recovery? Traders are closely monitoring the low $90,000s as a critical zone for a potential short-term recovery. A decisive break and hold above this level could signal renewed strength and potentially lure sidelined Bitcoin whale capital back into accumulation mode. However, without the supporting factors of ETF inflows and on-chain momentum, any move higher might face significant resistance. The current structural shift increases the market’s short-term vulnerability to downward moves. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Current Market This unique scenario, where retail and whale activity diverge, requires a nuanced strategy. First, understand that retail dip-buying provides a floor but not necessarily a launchpad. Second, keep a close eye on Bitcoin ETF flow data weekly; it’s a leading indicator for institutional sentiment. Finally, practice disciplined risk management. The increased short-term vulnerability means volatility is likely, so avoid over-leveraging. The return of the Bitcoin whale as a consistent buyer will be one of the most reliable signals that a new, sustained upward trend is beginning. In summary, the slowing Bitcoin whale accumulation alongside rising retail dip-buying paints a picture of a market at a crossroads. While the long-term thesis for Bitcoin remains intact for many, the short-term path hinges on a recovery in institutional participation through ETFs and on-chain activity. This divergence is a powerful reminder to watch what large holders do, not just what retail investors say. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is considered a Bitcoin whale? A: A Bitcoin whale is typically defined as an address or entity holding a very large amount of Bitcoin, often thousands of coins or more, giving them significant influence over the market. Q: Why is slowing whale accumulation a bearish signal? A: Whales provide massive buying power. When they stop accumulating, it removes a major source of demand, making the market more susceptible to sell-offs and increasing short-term price vulnerability. Q: Can retail investor buying offset whale selling? A> While retail buying can create support and slow downtrends, the sheer volume of capital controlled by whales means retail activity alone is often insufficient to drive a major bull market without institutional inflows. Q: What is the most important metric to watch now? A> Net flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have become a critical gauge. Consistent positive flows indicate institutional demand, which is needed to complement retail buying and potentially restart whale accumulation. Q: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? A> That depends on your strategy. For long-term holders, dip-buying aligns with dollar-cost averaging. For traders, the increased volatility and lack of clear whale support suggests caution and tight risk management are essential.

55204330,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=860642,1764590449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/55204330.jpeg,"Strategy’s Green Dots Suggest Flexibility, Fueling Interest in $HYPER Presale",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/strategy-green-bitcoin-dots-fuel-interest-bitcoin-hyper/,"What to Know: Strategy’s willingness to keep Bitcoin sales ‘on the table’ reflects a broader shift toward tactical, actively managed $BTC exposure without abandoning long-term conviction. As Bitcoin’s base layer remains constrained by low throughput and high, cyclical fees, traders increasingly look to Layer 2 infrastructure as leveraged expressions of $BTC upside. Bitcoin Hyper targets Bitcoin’s speed and programmability gap with an SVM-powered Layer 2 that aims for Solana-level performance while settling to Bitcoin. When you see a long-term Bitcoin accumulator suddenly flashing ‘green dots’ instead of just quietly stacking sats, you aren’t just watching a trade, you’re watching a shift in conviction. Many saw the green dots as a sign for more Bitcoin purchases, while others saw it as buybacks or a restructuring of assets. The willingness of major players like Strategy to keep potential $BTC sales on the table signals a massive evolution in the market. Even the loudest ‘HODL forever’ thesis is now being wrapped in active risk management. For you as a trader or allocator, that nuance changes everything. If the most visible corporate-style HODLers are comfortable dialing risk up and down around a core $BTC position, it legitimizes a more tactical approach for the rest of us. It’s no longer a binary choice between ‘all spot, all the time’ or exiting to fiat. Instead, we are seeing sophisticated traders keeping their ‘hard money’ core while rotating a slice of their stack into high-beta ecosystem plays. Why? Because everyone agrees on one thing: Bitcoin’s base layer is incredible for settlement, but it is too slow (~7 TPS) and too rigid for modern apps. The market is realizing that infrastructure, scaling, and programmability layers could outgrow $BTC itself on a percentage basis in a bull cycle. Just as we saw with Ethereum’s modular stack, the real leverage often lies in the layers built on top of the base asset. This is why tactical Bitcoin exposure is drifting toward Layer-2s. Traders are looking for leveraged expressions of Bitcoin’s strength without leaving the ecosystem, hunting for the infrastructure that finally unlocks $BTC for DeFi and gaming. And this is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) enters the fold. Bitcoin Hyper: The ‘Best of Both Worlds’ Engine If you believe Bitcoin will remain the king of settlement but acknowledge it can’t host high-speed gaming or complex DeFi, then you need a high-performance execution layer. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is designed to be exactly that. It creates a fusion that combines Bitcoin’s massive liquidity and security with a real-time Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) Layer-2 for execution. By integrating the SVM, Bitcoin Hyper isn’t just trying to be faster; it’s aiming for sub-second confirmations and throughput in the thousands of transactions per second. It leans into Solana-style performance while settling back to Bitcoin. This directly solves the biggest headaches we all face with $BTC: agonizingly slow block times and fees that spike when the mempool gets clogged. Crucially, this system relies on a Canonical Bridge . This decentralized bridge is the vital link that handles $BTC transfers into the ecosystem, ensuring that assets move securely between the mainnet and the Layer 2. It positions the network not as a competitor trying to kill Bitcoin, but as a modular extension that finally makes your $BTC usable for high-speed swaps, lending, and staking. For full details, check out our ‘ What is Bitcoin Hyper ’ guide. The Financial Upside: Whales and ROI Potential For traders who are reading the market’s ‘green dots’ as a sign to be nimble, the financial setup for $HYPER is looking increasingly attractive. Smart money is already making significant moves to secure its position before the public catches on. We aren’t talking about small change here; we are seeing massive whale conviction. In the last months, we tracked buy-ins of $500K and $379.9K . When wallets of this size start accumulating a presale token, it’s usually a signal that they see something the retail market hasn’t fully priced in yet. Currently, the token is priced at $0.013355. However, our experts see $HYPER hitting $0.08625 by the end of 2026. If you choose to invest at today’s price, hitting that target would give you an ROI of around 545%. The presale has already raised over $28.8M, and with staking rewards at 40% the incentives are aligned for early adopters. If you want $HYPER, get it soon, as a price increase is coming. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the $HYPER revolution. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

55204744,637087,1764590450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55204744.jpeg,Lazarus Group Tops Global Hack Mentions As Spear Phishing Attacks Surge,https://bitcoinist.com/lazarus-group-tops-global-hack-mentions-as-spear-phishing-attacks-surge/,"According to a report from South Korean security firm AhnLab, state-linked hacking organizations like the North Korea-backed Lazarus Group relied heavily on spear phishing to steal funds and gather intelligence over the last 12 months. The group often posed as conference organizers, job contacts or colleagues to trick people into opening files or running commands. Lazarus Group: Spear Phishing Turns More Realistic With AI Lures Reports have disclosed that one unit known as Kimsuky used artificial intelligence to forge military ID images and lodge them inside a ZIP file to make messages look legitimate. Security researchers say the fake IDs were convincing enough that recipients opened the attachments, which then ran hidden code. The incident has been traced to mid-July 2025 and appears to mark a step up in how attackers craft their lures. The aim is simple. Get a user to trust a message, open a file, and the attacker gets a way in. That access can lead to stolen credentials, seeded malware or drained crypto wallets. The groups linked to Pyongyang have been tied to attacks on finance and defense targets, among others. Lazarus Group Victims Asked To Execute Commands Some campaigns did not rely only on hidden exploits. In several cases, targets were tricked into typing PowerShell commands themselves, sometimes while believing they were following official instructions. That step lets attackers run scripts with high privileges without needing a zero-day. Security outlets have warned that this social trick is spreading and can be hard to spot. Lazarus Group: Old File Types, New Tricks Attackers also abused Windows shortcut files and similar formats to hide commands that run silently when a file is opened. Researchers have documented nearly 1,000 malicious .lnk samples tied to broader campaigns, showing that familiar file types remain a favorite delivery method. Those shortcuts can execute hidden arguments and pull down further payloads. Why This Matters Now This makes the attacks harder to stop: tailored messages, AI-forged visuals, and tricks that ask users to run code. Multi-factor authentication and software patches help, but training people to treat unusual requests with suspicion remains key. Security teams advocate basic safety nets: update, verify, and when in doubt, check with a known contact. According to reports, Lazarus Group and Kimsuky continue to be active. Lazarus, based on AhnLab’s findings, received the most mentions in post-cybercrime analyses over the last 12 months. The group has been singled out for financially motivated hacks, while Kimsuky seems more focused on intelligence gathering and tailored deception.

Ju Ki-young, CEO of the prominent analytics firm CryptoQuant, has issued a critical alert: many alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, are facing a severe altcoin liquidity drought. His analysis suggests that without urgent action to find new sources of capital, numerous projects may not survive the coming market cycles. This isn’t just about price volatility; it’s a fundamental question of which digital assets have a viable future. What is the Altcoin Liquidity Crisis? Ju Ki-young took to social media platform X to highlight a troubling trend: a consistent decline in altcoin liquidity . But what does this mean for the average investor? In simple terms, liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be bought or sold without drastically affecting its price. High liquidity means a healthy, active market. Declining liquidity, however, creates a dangerous environment. It leads to sharper price drops on sales and makes it harder for new money to enter, effectively starving a project of the capital it needs to develop and grow. According to Ju, this isn’t a minor issue—it’s an existential threat. Which Altcoin Strategies Will Survive? So, is all hope lost for altcoins? Not necessarily. Ju’s warning comes with a clear roadmap for survival. He argues that projects actively securing new altcoin liquidity channels have a significantly greater chance of long-term success. The key differentiator for survival will be a project’s ability to tap into institutional and structured financial flows. This strategic shift is becoming non-negotiable. Corporate Treasury Adoption: Following in the footsteps of companies like MicroStrategy with Bitcoin, altcoins that convince corporations to hold them as part of digital asset treasuries can unlock massive, stable pools of capital. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): The success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has paved the way. Altcoins that gain approval for their own ETFs or are included in broader crypto ETF baskets will access a flood of mainstream investor capital. Real-World Utility & Revenue: Projects that generate actual fees or revenue through decentralized applications (dApps), services, or protocols can create organic, sustainable liquidity cycles independent of mere speculation. What Happens to Altcoins Without a Plan? The converse of Ju’s analysis is a grim outlook for passive projects. Altcoins that are not proactively pursuing these new altcoin liquidity strategies face a substantially higher risk of fading into irrelevance. These projects often rely solely on retail trader enthusiasm and lack the fundamental economic engine or institutional backing to weather market downturns. They become vulnerable to: Death spirals during bear markets due to shallow order books. Inability to fund continued development and marketing. Being outcompeted by rivals with stronger financial foundations. Therefore, the market is likely heading toward a great divergence, separating the strategically sound from the merely speculative. How Can Investors Navigate This New Reality? For investors, this analysis provides a crucial new filter for evaluating altcoin opportunities. It’s no longer enough to look at whitepapers and community hype. The due diligence checklist must now include a hard look at a project’s altcoin liquidity strategy. Ask these questions before investing: Is the team actively engaging with institutions or discussing treasury strategies? Are there clear pathways or discussions about potential ETF inclusion? Does the project have a real, revenue-generating product with active users? How deep and resilient is the trading liquidity across multiple exchanges? Focusing on assets that provide clear answers to these questions can help mitigate risk and identify the projects built for longevity, not just the next pump. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for the Crypto Ecosystem CryptoQuant CEO Ju Ki-young’s warning is a vital wake-up call. The era of easy money and low-interest rates that fueled the last altcoin boom is over. The future belongs to cryptocurrencies that build robust, diversified, and institutional-grade altcoin liquidity frameworks. This impending liquidity squeeze will act as a natural selector, weeding out weak projects and strengthening the ecosystem’s foundation. For builders, the mandate is clear: innovate beyond technology and into finance. For investors, the imperative is to follow the smart money and the strategic liquidity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does ‘altcoin liquidity’ mean? A: Altcoin liquidity refers to how easily an altcoin can be bought or sold in the market without causing a major price change. High liquidity means a healthy, active market with many buyers and sellers. Q: Why are ETFs so important for altcoin liquidity? A: ETFs allow traditional investors (like retirement funds and everyday people through brokerages) to buy exposure to an asset without directly holding it. An altcoin ETF would funnel massive amounts of new, mainstream capital into that coin, dramatically increasing its liquidity and stability. Q: Are all altcoins at risk? A> Not all. According to the analysis, altcoins with strong fundamentals, real-world use, and teams actively pursuing institutional liquidity channels (like corporate treasuries or ETF plans) have a much better chance of survival and growth. Q: How can I check an altcoin’s liquidity? A> You can look at trading volume on major exchanges, the order book depth (the gap between buy and sell orders), and whether the price moves wildly on relatively small trades. Analytics platforms like CryptoQuant provide deep data on these metrics. Q: Is Bitcoin affected by this same liquidity issue? A> Bitcoin is in a different category due to its scale, recognition, and the recent approval of spot ETFs. It has already accessed massive new liquidity channels, which is partly why analysts are now focusing on the challenges for smaller altcoins. Q: What should I do with my current altcoin investments? A> Review your portfolio. Research whether each project has a clear, actionable strategy for attracting new forms of liquidity beyond retail trading. Consider reallocating towards projects that demonstrate this strategic thinking. Did this analysis help you understand the critical shift in the crypto market?

55204549,https://timestabloid.com/?p=91091,1764590716,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s the Link Between Ripple (XRP) and Apple Pay,https://timestabloid.com/heres-the-link-between-ripple-xrp-and-apple-pay/,"When web users tap “Buy Now,” they might not realize the heavy technical lifting behind that simple click. Under the hood, payment standards and protocols built behind the scenes shape whether money flows smoothly from card or crypto to merchants. The hidden interplay between open-payment standards and wallet ecosystems is quietly reshaping how digital value moves online. In a post on X, SMQKE brought to public attention a lesser-known connection: the work initiated by Ripple through its open-rail protocol suite and how that work influenced web payment standards adopted by W3C — standards now used by Apple Pay. This bridging hints at an underappreciated legacy: technologies born in crypto infrastructure may now enable everyday web payments. Origins of Interledger and Ripple’s Role The roots go back to 2015, when Ripple engineers — including co-creators Stefan Thomas and Evan Schwartz — introduced the Interledger Protocol (ILP) . ILP was built to link different ledgers — from traditional banks to blockchains — allowing seamless value transfers across otherwise isolated systems. After its release, Ripple contributed ILP to W3C’s Community Group for wider development, aiming to turn it into an open standard for payments across the web. Rather than keeping ILP purely within crypto rails, the intention was universal interoperability. Yes, Ripple helped edit the Payment Request API for Apple Pay through W3C Documented. https://t.co/o5dLJLprgS pic.twitter.com/hvYu3AiT1I — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) December 1, 2025 From Protocol to Browser: Payment Request API On the other side sits the web’s standard interface for triggering payments: the Payment Request API. This API enables websites to present a consistent checkout interface — one that can integrate multiple payment methods. As of 2018, browsers like Safari have implemented the API for Apple Pay. When a merchant uses the Payment Request API with Apple Pay, the browser constructs a Payment Request object listing supported methods. If Apple Pay is available, the browser presents the familiar Apple Pay sheet. Safari’s implementation treats Apple Pay as a payment method under the Payment Request umbrella. How Ripple’s Work Feeds Into Web Payments Saying Ripple “helped edit” the Payment Request API does not mean Ripple authored Apple’s payment system. Rather, Ripple — through ILP — contributed to the broader standardization of cross-ledger payments at W3C. That broader standardization helped shape how payment methods could be abstracted for the web. Because ILP envisions value routing across ledgers — including blockchains and fiat rails — payment standards built upon it can, in principle, support diverse underlying value networks. When a browser’s payment API accepts a method defined in a standards-compliant way, that method could correspond to ILP-based networks (crypto or otherwise).

What This Means for XRP, Crypto, and Web Payments For holders or proponents of XRP and related crypto infrastructure, this development offers a blueprint. If web payment standards stay open and flexible, building on ILP or similar protocols may allow true value interoperability: bridging fiat, crypto, and native ledger systems. That could make on-ramps and off-ramps smoother, not just for large institutions but for everyday users and merchants. However, this does not mean Apple Pay currently settles through XRP or any public blockchain by default. The Payment Request API only defines the interface. Actual value settlement still depends on implementation choices by wallets, networks, or connectors. In conclusion, the connection between Ripple’s early standards work and Apple Pay’s web interface may seem technical and subtle. But it matters deeply. Through ILP and W3C standardization, Ripple contributed to designing a world where value — whether fiat or crypto — can flow seamlessly through the web. That link, highlighted by SMQKE, suggests the foundational architecture behind crypto may already be shaping mainstream payment experiences. For anyone watching the intersection between blockchain finance, payments, and web tech, this convergence deserves close attention.

While a recovery began in late November, it didn't last. Bitcoin, which rose above $91,000 with the recovery, entered December with a decline and fell to the $86,000 level. These sharp declines in Bitcoin also had a negative impact on US spot ETFs, with spot Bitcoin ETFs seeing a net outflow of $3.5 billion in November. These ETF outflows were the largest in the last 9 months. However, towards the end of the month, ETF funds experienced inflows for three consecutive days, partially offsetting the outflow trend. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF IBIT fund led the outflows, recording net outflows of $2.34 billion in November. IBIT, notably, saw its largest single-day outflow since its inception on the 18th of last month, with an outflow of $523 million. Nick Ruck, Head of Research at LVRG, said the outflow was driven by institutions taking profits and rebalancing their portfolios for the year-end after Bitcoin reached a new record high. He added that this activity didn't impact Bitcoin's underlying fundamentals. Ethereum's Uptrend Continues! Spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs also recorded their highest-ever net outflow, with $1.42 billion in net outflows, according to the data. Nick Luck noted that while new altcoin ETFs like Solana are attracting steady capital flows despite high volatility, institutional capital remains concentrated in Bitcoin and Ethereum, indicating that this structure is likely to continue until regulatory clarity and on-chain stability are achieved. *This is not investment advice.

In a revealing statement, the Czech National Bank’s Governor, Aleš Michl, presented a compelling case. He suggested that a modest allocation to a spot Bitcoin ETF might generate returns comparable to a significant shift in traditional stock holdings. This analysis from a major European central bank marks a pivotal moment in the conversation about digital assets in institutional finance. What Did the Czech Central Bank Governor Actually Say? Governor Aleš Michl provided specific, data-driven scenarios. First, he noted that allocating just 2.5% of the bank’s reserves to a spot Bitcoin ETF could potentially match the returns of increasing its U.S. stock allocation from 38% to 50%. That’s a substantial 12-percentage-point stock shift potentially mirrored by a small digital asset slice. Second, he offered a historical perspective. Had the bank allocated 5% of its reserves to Bitcoin over the past decade, its annual return would have jumped by an impressive 3.5 percentage points. However, Governor Michl was quick to provide crucial context: this enhanced return would have more than doubled the portfolio’s overall volatility, according to reports from Wu Blockchain. Why Is This Bitcoin ETF Analysis So Significant? This isn’t just another bullish crypto tweet. The significance lies in the source. A sitting central bank governor is publicly modeling the impact of a Bitcoin ETF on national reserves. It signals a maturation in how serious financial institutions assess cryptocurrency. Institutional Validation: The analysis treats Bitcoin as a calculable asset class, not a speculative novelty. Risk-Aware Approach: The immediate acknowledgment of doubled volatility shows a balanced, professional evaluation. Portfolio Science: It moves the debate from “if” to “how much,” focusing on optimal allocation percentages. Balancing High Returns with High Volatility The Czech National Bank’s statement perfectly captures the central dilemma of crypto investing. The potential for outsized returns comes with the certainty of heightened risk. Doubling portfolio volatility is a serious consideration for any entity managing public or national funds. Therefore, this isn’t an endorsement to go all-in. Instead, it’s a framework for strategic diversification . The sub-5% allocation models discussed represent a “satellite” approach—a small, targeted position that seeks growth without overwhelming the core, stable portfolio. For institutional investors, this measured methodology is far more compelling than hype-driven maximalism. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Crypto Adoption? The Czech analysis could act as a blueprint. Other conservative institutions—pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and insurance companies—may now have a reference point. They can model what a 1%, 2%, or 5% allocation to a regulated Bitcoin ETF might do to their own balance sheets. The existence of spot Bitcoin ETFs is key here. These regulated products provide a familiar, accessible pathway for institutions that would never touch a private crypto exchange. The Czech scenario likely wouldn’t be discussed without this financial infrastructure in place. Conclusion: A Measured Step Toward Mainstream Finance The Czech National Bank’s calculations are a watershed moment. They demonstrate that serious financial authorities are not just watching crypto but actively stress-testing its role in modern portfolios. The core takeaway is nuanced: a small, carefully considered allocation to a Bitcoin ETF can enhance returns, but it must be sized appropriately to manage the accompanying volatility. This balanced, evidence-based perspective is exactly what’s needed to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is the Czech National Bank actually buying Bitcoin? A: No. Governor Michl’s comments were a theoretical analysis of past performance and potential scenarios. They do not announce any immediate investment action by the bank. Q: What is a spot Bitcoin ETF? A: A spot Bitcoin ETF is a regulated investment fund that tracks the price of Bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional brokerage account without needing to buy or store the cryptocurrency directly. Q: Why is a 2.5% or 5% allocation significant? A: For large, conservative institutions like central banks, even a 1% allocation represents a massive amount of capital and a major philosophical shift. These small percentages are considered a starting point for diversification into a higher-risk asset. Q: Does this mean Bitcoin is now a safe investment? A: Absolutely not. The analysis explicitly highlighted that such an allocation would dramatically increase portfolio volatility. Bitcoin remains a high-risk, high-potential-reward asset. Q: Could other central banks follow this idea? A: It’s possible. The Czech National Bank’s public modeling provides a credible framework that other institutions can study and potentially adapt, though each would make its own sovereign decision.

The market seesaw has left investors wondering which of these layer-1 blockchain coins will recover first. With interest high, this article explores the potential for a rebound and identifies which coin might lead the charge out of the downturn. Solana (SOL) Eyes Recovery After Recent Slide Source: tradingview Solana is navigating through a challenging phase with its price between $126 and $143. Despite a monthly drop of over 30%, there’s potential for a rebound. The coin is nearing its first resistance at $151. If it surpasses this, the next target is $168, marking a potential growth of over 20% from current levels. However, the current RSI indicates it's oversold, suggesting a possible upward correction soon. With strong support around $119, Solana might stabilize before aiming higher. Keep an eye on these levels as Solana plots its next move. Cardano's ADA Eyes Potential Rebound Amid Current Price Fluctuations Source: tradingview Cardano's ADA is hovering between roughly 40 and 44 cents. It's been a bumpy ride with a 5% drop this past week and over a third of its value lost this month. However, there's hope with a nearby resistance level at about 46 cents. If ADA breaks through this, it could challenge the next resistance near 49 cents. Positive momentum might lead to a potential rise of over 12% from where it stands now. Technical indicators like the RSI suggest it's oversold, hinting at a possible rebound. For now, ADA’s short-term moves are key, but there's room for optimism if it can defy the recent downward trend. Aptos (APT) Shows Possible Signs of Recovery Despite Recent Slump Source: tradingview Aptos (APT) is currently trading between one dollar and eighty-five cents and two dollars and twenty-six cents, reflecting a tough month with a price drop of over 40 percent. However, there might be a silver lining. The price could aim for two dollars and fifty-three cents, its nearest resistance level, which would mark an increase of approximately 15 percent from its highest current price. The crypto's six-month decline indicates some struggle, but the current low RSI suggests the token might be oversold, hinting at potential bounce-back opportunities. If positivity prevails, breaking through the resistance level of two dollars and ninety-four cents could offer a further upswing of nearly 30 percent. NEAR Protocol Eyes Potential Bounce Amid Price Pressure Source: tradingview NEAR Protocol has faced a tough time recently, with its price ranging from $1.74 to $1.93. The token has seen over a month-long downturn, dropping by a single-digit percentage this week and losing more than a fifth of its value in the past month. Despite these setbacks, it might be poised for a rebound. The first key level to watch is $2.05, a point of resistance. If NEAR climbs to this point, it reflects an approximate 7% gain from its current range. A further rise to $2.23 could see a recovery of over a sixth of its value, signaling a potential turn in fortunes for this digital asset. Conclusion The recovery potential of these coins varies based on individual factors. SOL shows resilience with strong development activity. ADA has a loyal community and ongoing upgrades. APT demonstrates rapid growth with promising tech. NEAR's focus on user-friendly features and partnerships can drive gains. Monitoring each coin’s unique strengths and engagement will help identify which rebounds first. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Un movimento intraday del 2-3% su un asset con una capitalizzazione di 1,7 trilioni di dollari è sufficiente per scuotere la leva finanziaria e mettere alla prova la convinzione degli investitori, specialmente quelli entrati più di recente. Per molti operatori esperti, questo tipo di volatilità non invalida la tesi rialzista su Bitcoin, ma modifica il modo di pensare al posizionamento in portafoglio. Invece di limitarsi ad accumulare BTC spot, sempre più trader cercano investimenti a “beta elevato” (high-beta) capaci di catturare il potenziale rialzista dell’ecosistema Bitcoin senza essere strettamente legati alle sue oscillazioni di prezzo giornaliere. È qui che entrano in gioco le narrative legate alle infrastrutture di Bitcoin. Layer 2 e Sidechain: La scommessa sulla scalabilità I Layer 2 di Bitcoin, le sidechain programmabili e i binari della DeFi si stanno proponendo come strumenti per partecipare alla prossima fase di crescita: non solo detenere BTC come riserva di valore, ma utilizzarlo all’interno di applicazioni ad alto throughput e basse commissioni. In questo contesto, progetti come Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) stanno emergendo. Attualmente in fase di sviluppo (presale), il progetto mira a colmare una delle lacune più evidenti del mercato: trasformare la base “store-of-value” di Bitcoin in un livello di transazione programmabile ad alta velocità. Perché la volatilità di fine ciclo favorisce i Layer 2 Quando Bitcoin sale costantemente per mesi e poi registra improvvisamente un’ombra ribassista sotto livelli chiave come gli 87.000$, stiamo osservando meccaniche tipiche di fine ciclo. L’alta leva finanziaria, i flussi di opzioni e le prese di profitto possono trasformare un ritracciamento di routine in una candela rossa brusca, anche se il trend macroeconomico rialzista rimane intatto. Questa dinamica tende a dividere il comportamento del mercato: Rotazione difensiva: Alcuni si spostano su stablecoin o fiat, attendendo che la volatilità si plachi. Ricerca di Alpha: Altri si spostano più avanti sulla curva del rischio, cercando narrative che potrebbero sovraperformare Bitcoin se il ciclo rialzista riprende. I progetti di infrastruttura allineati a Bitcoin – dai rollup alle sidechain – sono una destinazione naturale per questi capitali. Abbiamo già visto questo fenomeno con l’ascesa di progetti di scaling e primitive di restaking su BTC, tutti basati sulla stessa promessa: mantenere la sicurezza e il brand di Bitcoin, ma risolvere i problemi di basso throughput e mancanza di smart contract nativi. L’approccio tecnico di Bitcoin Hyper La proposta principale di Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) è tecnica e diretta: unire il livello di settlement (regolamento) di Bitcoin a un livello di esecuzione basato sulla SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) . In pratica, si tratta di un design modulare : Layer 1: Bitcoin garantisce la finalità e la sicurezza. Layer 2: Un livello SVM in tempo reale gestisce il trading ad alta frequenza, i pagamenti e l’attività delle dApp. L’obiettivo è ottenere transazioni più veloci ed economiche e una scalabilità notevolmente migliorata, potenzialmente in grado di posizionare Bitcoin sulla mappa degli investitori istituzionali interessati alla DeFi. Integrando la Solana Virtual Machine, il progetto punta a fornire prestazioni di smart contract in grado di eguagliare o superare i benchmark di throughput di Solana, ma in un contesto BTC-centrico. Il sistema si basa su un bridge canonico decentralizzato per i trasferimenti di BTC, accoppiato a un singolo sequencer che ancora periodicamente lo stato delle transazioni sulla blockchain principale di Bitcoin. Dati di Mercato e Roadmap Sul fronte dei finanziamenti, la fase di presale ha raccolto oltre 28,8 milioni di dollari , con una valutazione del token $HYPER a $0.013355. Questo segnala che una parte del mercato è disposta a sostenere una tesi speculativa ma chiara: un Layer 2 compatibile con SVM e protetto da Bitcoin potrebbe catturare un’attività significativa se la prossima fase di BTC sarà guidata dall’utilizzo reale e non solo dall’apprezzamento del prezzo. Le proiezioni di prezzo (basate su analisi speculative) indicano potenziali target di $0.20 nel 2026 e $1.50 entro il 2030, a condizione che il Layer 2 raggiunga un’adozione mainstream. Il rilascio del progetto è previsto in una finestra compresa tra il Q4 2025 e il Q1 2026 .

Users demand tools that not only secure their digital assets but also empower them to interact with the broader ecosystem seamlessly. Today, we are thrilled to announce a groundbreaking partnership that pushes the boundaries of what a crypto wallet can do. Pione Wallet, a leading multi-chain non-custodial wallet, has officially integrated the powerful StealthEX instant crypto exchange . This strategic integration marks a monumental leap forward for Pione Wallet users, transforming their secure digital vault into a versatile trading powerhouse. With the robust engine of StealthEX now built directly into the Pione Wallet interface, users can instantly swap over 2,000 different cryptocurrencies without ever having to leave the security of their wallet. This fusion of top-tier security and unparalleled convenience delivers a non-custodial swap experience that is second to none, empowering users with unprecedented choice and control over their digital wealth. What Is StealthEX? The Engine Behind the Crypto Swaps To understand the power of this new feature, one must first get to know the engine driving it: StealthEX. Founded in 2018, StealthEX has established itself as a premier instant cryptocurrency exchange service, designed from the ground up with the user's privacy and control in mind. Unlike traditional centralized exchanges, StealthEX operates on a completely non-custodial basis. So, what does this mean for the user? Non-Custodial Security: StealthEX never stores your funds. During a swap, your crypto is sent directly from your wallet, exchanged, and the new asset is sent back to your wallet in a single, streamlined process. This eliminates the significant counterparty risk associated with leaving assets on a centralized exchange, which can be a target for hacks or subject to freezes. With StealthEX, you are always in control. Registration-Free Experience: In a world increasingly concerned with data privacy, StealthEX stands out by being completely registration-free. There are no lengthy sign-up processes, no Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements , and no accounts to manage. You can initiate an exchange instantly, saving time and protecting your personal information. A Universe of Assets: The most striking feature of StealthEX is its sheer breadth of choice. The platform provides access to a massive selection of over 2,000 coins and tokens across dozens of blockchains. From market leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum to the latest DeFi gems and niche altcoins, the possibilities for portfolio diversification are virtually endless. Competitive, Transparent Rates: StealthEX functions as a liquidity aggregator. Its sophisticated algorithm scans multiple major exchange providers in real-time to find the best available exchange rate for your desired trading pair. The rate you see is the rate you get, with all network and exchange fees clearly included in the final calculation before you confirm, ensuring full transparency. By integrating StealthEX, Pione Wallet isn't just adding a feature; it's embedding a world-class, trustless liquidity gateway directly into its core infrastructure. Pione Wallet: Your Secure Gateway to Web3 For those new to the ecosystem, Pione Wallet is far more than just a place to store crypto. It is a comprehensive, secure, and user-friendly gateway to the entire world of Web3. Designed to cater to both crypto newcomers and seasoned veterans, Pione Wallet is built on a foundation of uncompromised security and intuitive design. The philosophy of Pione Wallet is simple: true ownership. In a landscape where the phrase ""not your keys, not your crypto"" is a cardinal rule, Pione Wallet ensures you are always the sole custodian of your assets. Here are the core strengths that make Pione Wallet a preferred choice for users worldwide: True Non-Custodial Ownership: When you create a wallet with Pione, the private keys—the master password to your funds—are generated and encrypted directly on your device. You and you alone have access to them. The team at Pione Wallet can never access your funds, making it a true self-custody wallet. Robust Multi-Chain Support: A modern crypto portfolio is rarely confined to a single blockchain. Pione Wallet is a versatile multichain wallet that allows users to seamlessly manage a diverse range of assets across major networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, Tron, and many more. This eliminates the need to juggle multiple wallet applications for different chains. An All-in-One Command Center: Pione Wallet is designed to be the only app you need to navigate Web3. Beyond sending and receiving crypto, it includes a beautiful gallery to manage your NFTs, built-in staking features to earn passive income on your holdings, and a powerful dApp browser. Through WalletConnect, users can securely connect to thousands of decentralized applications, from DeFi protocols to blockchain games. Intuitive and User-Friendly: Cryptocurrency can be intimidating, but Pione Wallet's clean and logical interface flattens the learning curve. Essential functions are easy to find, portfolio tracking is clear and concise, and the overall experience is designed to be empowering, not overwhelming. Pione Wallet has already established itself as a top-tier secure crypto wallet. Now, with the addition of a powerful crypto exchange, its utility has expanded exponentially. The Power of Integration: Why This Partnership Matters The synergy between Pione Wallet's security and StealthEX's liquidity creates a user experience greater than the sum of its parts. This integration addresses three of the biggest challenges in crypto: convenience, security, and choice. Unmatched Convenience: The In-Wallet Swap Before this integration, swapping one asset for another typically involved a cumbersome and risky process: Send crypto from your secure non-custodial wallet to a centralized exchange. Wait for the deposit to be confirmed. Execute the trade on the exchange's platform. Initiate a withdrawal of the new asset back to your secure wallet. Pay network fees for both the deposit and the withdrawal. This multi-step process is not only time-consuming but also introduces multiple points of potential failure and adds extra costs. The Pione Wallet and StealthEX integration completely revolutionizes this workflow. Now, the entire exchange happens within a single interface. An `in-wallet swap` means you can exchange Bitcoin to Ethereum, or any of the 2000+ other assets, in just a few taps without your funds ever leaving the non-custodial environment. It's the most direct, efficient, and cost-effective way to manage and rebalance your portfolio. Enhanced Security: A Truly Trustless Process As mentioned, sending your assets to a centralized exchange means temporarily giving up custody. In that time, your funds are at the mercy of the exchange's security. The integration of a non-custodial exchange service like StealthEX is a security game-changer. The entire swap remains within the principles of self-custody. You authorize the transaction from your wallet, the swap is executed by StealthEX's smart routing system, and the new coins are sent directly back to the very same wallet. At no point are your funds held in a large, centralized ""honeypot"" account, drastically reducing your exposure to external threats. It's like upgrading your personal bank vault to have a direct, secure pneumatic tube to a global currency exchange that operates 24/7, with no intermediaries ever touching your gold. Unprecedented Choice: From a Portfolio to a Universe Many users hold a few mainstream assets but are curious about exploring emerging projects. This integration breaks down the barriers to exploration. A Pione Wallet user is no longer limited to the assets they currently hold; they now have a gateway to a market of over 2000+ cryptocurrencies. Want to swap some of your Bitcoin gains into a promising new Layer-1 token? Or trade some Ethereum for a gaming token you've been researching? Now, you can do so instantly. This opens up a world of possibilities for diversification, hedging, and capitalizing on market trends, all from the trusted and familiar interface of your Pione Wallet. A Future Built on Security and Accessibility The integration of StealthEX into Pione Wallet is more than just a new feature; it is a testament to a shared vision. Both projects are deeply committed to empowering individuals in their crypto journey by providing tools that are secure, private, and immensely powerful. This partnership reinforces Pione Wallet's position as a leading `crypto wallet with exchange` functionality, offering a holistic Web3 experience that prioritizes user control above all else. For users, this means less complexity, more security, and infinite possibilities. Ready to experience the future of crypto management?

The chart, posted alongside new data on Strategy’s rapidly expanding Bitcoin position, showed a total of 87 purchase events, bringing the company’s holdings to 649,870 BTC worth about $59.45 billion at an average cost of $74,433 per coin. What if we start adding green dots? pic.twitter.com/a19bD33KzD — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 30, 2025 The familiar orange dots reflected each individual accumulation since 2020, while the green dotted line captured immediate attention as traders debated its meaning. Analysts Clarify MicroStrategy’s ‘Green Dot’ Metric Analysts later clarified that the green dotted line represents Strategy’s average purchase price, a rolling figure that updates only when new Bitcoin is acquired. It reflects the company’s dynamic cost basis rather than Bitcoin’s price or any form of prediction. With each new buy, the line shifts depending on whether Bitcoin was purchased above or below the previous average. Because Strategy’s positions are large, some buying events have pushed the line sharply higher, especially between 2024 and 2025, when the firm accelerated accumulation during Bitcoin’s run toward the $100,000 region. Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET The chart confirmed that Strategy’s portfolio remains profitable, with the Bitcoin stack up 22.9% as of Nov. 30. Bitcoin has been trading in the $95,000 to $110,000 range in late 2025, keeping the company comfortably above its $74,433 average cost. Yet while the holdings show gains and the “green line” hints at more aggressive buying according to some analysts, Strategy’s stock has fallen more than 60% from recent highs, and this disconnect is feeding new questions about the long-term sustainability of Saylor’s strategy. Strategy Signals It May Sell Bitcoin if Market Pressures Mount In a development that marks a shift from years of strict “never sell” messaging, Strategy quietly acknowledged that Bitcoin sales are now possible under specific stress conditions. CEO Phong Le said the company would consider selling some of its holdings only if two events occur at once: if Strategy’s market-to-net-asset-value ratio falls below one and if the company cannot raise new capital. Le noted that he does not want to be the executive who sells Bitcoin but added that financial discipline must take priority in a hostile market. He described a scenario where selling a portion of the treasury becomes mathematically justified to protect what he calls “Bitcoin yield per share,” especially if issuing new equity becomes more dilutive than liquidating a small fraction of BTC. The company’s mNAV is currently 1.01, but this level has been unstable throughout 2025. Source: Strategy Tracker Earlier in the year, the ratio traded as high as 3.3, but by mid-November it slipped under 1.0 for the first time since Strategy began acquiring Bitcoin. A drop below one means the market values the company at less than the worth of its Bitcoin holdings, undermining the premium that allows Strategy to raise capital cheaply. Le warned that if the company cannot access cash while operating below that threshold, selling becomes an option of last resort. Strategy’s $21B Fundraising Stands Firm as Bitcoin Drops 32% From All-Time High Despite these risks, Strategy has raised $21 billion so far in 2025 , nearly matching its 2024 total. The company secured $11.9 billion through common equity, $6.9 billion through preferred equity, and $2 billion via convertible debt across seven different securities. Investor appetite remains strong, even as the firm faces roughly $800 million in annual dividend obligations tied to its preferred shares. Le said the plan is to maintain these payments using capital raised at a premium, adding that consistent dividend performance helps strengthen market confidence. Strategy also introduced a new “BTC Credit” dashboard last week to reassure investors amid volatile market action.

While a recovery began in late November, it didn't last. Bitcoin, which rose above $91,000 with the recovery, entered December with a decline and fell to the $86,000 level. These sharp declines in Bitcoin also had a negative impact on US spot ETFs, with spot Bitcoin ETFs seeing a net outflow of $3.5 billion in November. These ETF outflows were the largest in the last 9 months. Spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net outflows for four consecutive weeks, totaling $3.5 billion in outflows for the month, The Block reported. However, towards the end of the month, ETF funds experienced inflows for three consecutive days, partially offsetting the outflow trend. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF IBIT fund led the outflows, recording net outflows of $2.34 billion in November. IBIT, notably, saw its largest single-day outflow since its inception on the 18th of last month, with an outflow of $523 million. Nick Ruck, Head of Research at LVRG, said the outflow was driven by institutions taking profits and rebalancing their portfolios for the year-end after Bitcoin reached a new record high. He added that this activity didn't impact Bitcoin's underlying fundamentals. Spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs also recorded their highest-ever net outflow, with $1.42 billion in net outflows, according to the data. In contrast, newly launched altcoin ETFs like Solana (SOL) and XRP have continued to record net inflows since their launch. Nick Luck noted that while new altcoin ETFs like Solana are attracting steady capital flows despite high volatility, institutional capital remains concentrated in Bitcoin and Ethereum, indicating that this structure is likely to continue until regulatory clarity and on-chain stability are achieved.

CEO Paolo Ardoino announced the company maintains “a multi-billion-dollar excess reserve buffer and an overall proprietary Group equity approaching $30 billion,” but Hayes argues this diversification masks dangerous exposure to volatile assets. Hayes contends Tether is positioning for Federal Reserve rate cuts that would crush their Treasury income. The Tether folks are in the early innings of running a massive interest rate trade.

Tether CEO Fires Back with Detailed Financial Disclosures In a recent X Post, Ardoino swiftly countered Hayes’s insolvency claims with comprehensive data. “Tether had (at end of Q3 2025) ~7B in excess equity (on top of the ~184.5B stablecoin reserves) + another ~23B in retained earnings as part of our Tether Group equity,” the CEO explained. re: Tether FUD From latest attestation announcement (Q3 2025): ""Tether will continue to maintain a multi-billion-dollar excess reserve buffer and an overall proprietary Group equity approaching $30 billion.""

The CEO accused critics of deliberately misrepresenting Tether’s position. “S&P made the same mistake of not considering the additional Group Equity nor the ~500M in monthly base profits generated by U.S Treasury yields alone,” Ardoino stated, suggesting “ some influencers are either bad at math or have the incentive to push our competitors. ” His defense comes after S&P Global downgraded USDT’s peg-stability rating from 4 to 5 on November 26, citing increased exposure to “ high-risk “ assets and “ persistent gaps in disclosure. “ Industry Veterans Dismantle Tether’s Insolvency Claims Joseph Ayoub, former head of digital asset research at Citi, noted that Tether’s disclosed assets don’t represent all corporate holdings. “Their disclosed assets =/ all corporate assets,” he explained, noting Tether maintains a separate equity balance sheet comprising mining operations and corporate reserves that aren’t publicly reported.

Ayoub noted that banks operate on significantly lower fractional reserves of 5-15% in liquid assets compared to Tether’s overcollateralized structure. His conclusion, “ Tether isn’t going insolvent , quite the opposite; they own a money printing machine . “ S&P Downgrade Sparks Fierce Industry Backlash Ardoino responded defiantly to S&P’s rating action and recurrent criticism of Tether’s operational model. “We wear your loathing with pride,” the CEO declared, positioning Tether as “the first overcapitalized company in the financial industry, with no toxic reserves” that proves “the traditional financial system is so broken that it’s becoming feared by the emperors with no clothes.” He challenged banks to publish their reserve ratios, suggesting they likely consist of “ 3 olives and a half chewed gum. “ Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski added that “ The S&P only attacks Tether, because Tether is challenging and beating the old financial guard at their own game. ” The S&P only attacks Tether, because Tether is challenging and beating the old financial guard at their own game. These old corporate entities cannot handle companies like Tether & Rumble taking their market share — their only recourse is to attack us because they’re losing. https://t.co/UUbaYpXAUq — Chris Pavlovski (@chrispavlovski) November 26, 2025 The attacks surprised many, considering USDT maintained its peg through the 2018 crash, 2022 Terra/Luna collapse, and 2023 banking crisis. Yet the downgrade carries serious implications. With a “5” rating and MiCA regulations prohibiting USDT from EU exchanges , no major institutional fund can legally hold the stablecoin. This could favor competitors like Circle’s USDC , PayPal’s PYUSD, or tokenized fiat alternatives, potentially shifting liquidity away from a company that generated more net profit than BlackRock last year and is tipped to surpass Saudi Aramco in profitability.
