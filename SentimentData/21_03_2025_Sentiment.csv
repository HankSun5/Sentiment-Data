However, Hayes cautioned that while BTC may have bottomed, stock markets could face more pain ahead. BTC Bottomed At $77,000? Hayes Thinks So Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes recently took to X to declare that BTC may have likely bottomed at $77,000. The acclaimed crypto market commentator referred to the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) latest remarks signaling the end of quantitative tightening (QT). Hayes remarked: JAYPOW delivered, QT basically over Apr 1. The next thing we need to get bulled up for realz is either SLR exemption and or a restart of QE. Was BTC $77K the bottom, prob. But stonks prob have more pain left to fully convert Jay to team Trump so stay nimble and cashed up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Needs Weekly Close Above This Level To Confirm Market Bottom, Analyst Says For the uninitiated, QT is one of the Fed’s monetary policies aimed at reducing the money supply by selling off assets like government bonds or letting them mature without reinvesting. While this helps control inflation, it can also lead to higher interest rates and slower economic growth. The Fed began its most recent QT cycle nearly three years ago in June 2022 to combat high inflation resulting from COVID-era economic stimulus. Now that inflation appears to be easing, the Fed has little reason to continue QT. Yesterday, the Fed announced that from April 1 onwards, it will slow the pace of its balance sheet drawdown. Such a shift in monetary policy is likely to benefit risk-on assets like BTC and stocks. As stated in his X post, Hayes emphasized that the next potential bullish catalysts could be either a Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption or the start of quantitative easing (QE). To explain, the SLR exemption temporarily allowed banks to exclude certain assets, like US Treasuries and central bank reserves, from their leverage calculations to encourage lending and support financial markets during crises. Similarly, QE is a monetary policy through which the Fed increases the money supply in the economy, potentially benefiting high-risk assets like BTC. Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff Jirlin echoed Hayes’ sentiments, stating that an end to QT from April onwards would be “great for both crypto and equity markets.” Jirlin added that the current monetary policy is the tightest he has observed since 2010. Bitcoin Not Out Of The Woods Yet While market optimism has increased following the Fed’s recent comments, the premier cryptocurrency is not fully out of the woods yet. For instance, BTC recently broke down through a 12-year trend line against gold, raising fears of heightened economic uncertainty in the near term.

Martinez tells his 133,500 followers on the social media platform X that if XRP ( XRP ) falls below $2, it risks witnessing a deeper drawdown due to a lack of consolidation below the price level. “XRP testing the waters! Below $2, a gap with no significant support could pull it to $1.60.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on a chart citing on-chain data from blockchain analytics platform Glassnode, it appears that there’s an “air gap” between $2 and $1.60, indicating a weak foundation for XRP around that price zone. XRP is trading at $2.56 at time of writing. Next up is the layer-1 protocol Solana ( SOL ). According to Martinez, SOL is facing a “big test” at a resistance level a few percentage points above the current price. “$135 stands as the most important resistance.” Source: Ali Martinez/X The widely followed analyst further says that investors in the sixth-largest crypto asset by market cap are capitulating based on the altcoin’s net unrealized profit/loss metric (NUPL), an on-chain indicator that measures whether accumulators of a coin are in a state of profit or loss. Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on the trader’s chart, SOL’s NUPL is hovering below the zero line, indicating that investors are witnessing losses and in the midst of capitulation. Solana is trading at $132 at time of writing, down by around 55% from the all-time high price of $293 reached January 20th. Looking at the top memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Martinez says that the altcoin has recorded significant demand in a week. “Whale alert! Over 110 million Dogecoin bought up in a week. Big players are betting on a breakout.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Dogecoin is trading at $0.173 at time of writing.

According to people familiar with the matter, Tim Cook decided to overhaul leadership in the firm’s AI divisions after losing confidence that AI chief John Giannandrea was the right person to lead important product innovations. Vision Pro architect Mike Rockwell takes over Siri In a notable development, Cook has directed the creation of Siri, Apple’s virtual assistant, under Mike Rockwell, who had previously overseen work on Vision Pro. This decision is the latest sign that the tech needs to urgently remake its AI strategy, following criticism that the company is falling behind rivals. Rockwell will now report to Craig Federighi, the software chief, in a move that removes Siri from Giannandrea’s controls. The changes are expected to be made public to employees this week. Apple’s top brass, aka the “Top 100,” met at the company’s secretive annual offsite summit recently to debate the company’s future, and AI was at the center of those discussions. The move reflects the mounting pressure on the tech firm to provide AI-powered innovations that can rival those from industry leaders. Despite AI being a major marketing point of the iPhone 16, Apple’s AI has been widely criticized for being underwhelming. Then there’s the new Apple Intelligence platform, which will launch later than expected and, when it does, is unlikely to attract consumers’ attention. Siri’s long-anticipated improvements, including deeper integration with users’ data for more customized responses, have also repeatedly fallen behind schedule. Apple had hyped these new Siri features for months, trying to stimulate sales of the iPhone 16, but the technology still wasn’t ready. The company was even forced to announce additional delays earlier this month, causing internal frustration. The Apple executive Robby Walker, who led Siri, reportedly described the delays as “ugly” in a recent team meeting, saying there was widespread disappointment among staff. Apple’s trouble with AI coincides with a wider downturn in tech stocks; its shares have slid 14% this year. On Thursday, the company’s stock fell less than 1% to $214.62 in midday trading in New York. Why Apple is betting on Rockwell Rockwell, who serves as the vice president of Apple’s Vision Products Group (VPG), has been recognized as a problem solver and a proponent of groundbreaking technology. He was a key figure in the creation of the Vision Pro headset, which, while a technological marvel, has not yet found commercial success. He is Apple’s first such hire, and his appointment represents a shift in the company’s strategy toward AI. Rockwell, unlike Giannandrea, is not a former Google executive with long-standing knowledge of the AI research field; he has no background in heading up AI teams. However, Apple is increasingly presenting Vision Pro and other hardware innovations as “AI products,” indicating a strategy that emphasizes the part of AI that specifies hardware rather than simply innovations based on software. As Rockwell steps up to his new position, Paul Meade—previously leading Vision Pro’s hardware engineering—will take over management of the Vision Products Group going forward. Apple reshapes Siri leadership amid AI push Since its launch in 2011, Siri has suffered a long-running series of engineering and performance problems. After all, the digital assistant has had so many leaders throughout the years, from Scott Forstall, who headed its software, to Eddy Cue, who ran services, to Federighi and Giannandrea in 2018. Now, with Rockwell in charge and Federighi once again overseeing the division, Apple is looking for a fresh start. Giannandrea is still at Apple, but his focus is shifting away from Siri’s day-to-day operations. He’ll continue to lead research and other AI-focused efforts at Meta, including a robotics-centric team. However, the tech firm’s hesitance to lose Giannandrea indicates an intention to be consistent as it reorganizes its AI division. Apple has been preparing for this leadership transition for months. For example, he’s worked on using analytics to help develop what he’s built at Apple. Last year, the company hired a veteran who’d successfully executed complex development projects before—Kim Vorrath—to come help the Siri shop. More recently, a different Rockwell lieutenant, Aimee Nugent, was transferred to assess and assist the Siri group. Rockwell himself has been outspoken about Siri’s failings and called for a more personalized, intelligent assistant. Brad said that during the development of the Vision Pro, he had imagined Siri playing a central role in controlling the device, but those plans didn’t come to fruition at launch. With Apple Intelligence coming to the Vision Pro through a software update in April, Rockwell’s recent hands-on session with AI-powered technology could be decisive. As the tech firm seeks to reposition itself as a player in AI, the industry and investors will closely watch the success of his tenure. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The ETF would hold both PENGU and Pudgy Penguin nonfungible tokens (NFT), as well as other cryptocurrencies, such as SOL and ETH, that may be necessary to the purchase, sale or transfer of PENGU and the associated NFTs. Nashville, Tennessee-based Canary Capital filed an S-1 form with the SEC on March 20. This is the first proposed EFT that includes NFTs. The ETF will be structured as a trust that is expected to hold 80%-95% PENGU and 5%-15% NFTs. No custodian or exchange have been selected yet. First they released the NFT, then plushies and now an ETF There are 8,888 Pudgy Penguin NFTs that range in price on Open Seas from 9.86 ETH ($19,499 at the time of writing) to 9,000 ETH ($17.8 million), although all but three of the NFTs listed were selling for 500 ETH ($988,805) or less. According to the S-1, Canary Capital “will select which NFTs to purchase by considering factors such as price, relative rarity, perceived desirability of a particular NFTs traits and characteristics, and the overall collection value.” The Pudgy Penguins NFT collection was launched in July 2021 on Ethereum. In May 2023, Pudgy Penguins signed with the WME talent agency. Retailer Walmart (and later others) has carried a line of stuffed toys called plushies depicting the penguins since September. The PENGU token launched on Solana in December 2024 with an airdrop of 25.9% of the 88.89 billion tokens to NFT holders distributed according to the rarity of the holder’s NFTs, and other community members. It had an initial market cap of around $2.8 billion and traded on Binance , Bybit and OKX. Canary Capital has faith in altcoins and their ETFs Igloo, Canary Capital’s parent company, posted a statement on X, saying , in part, “We believe that Pudgy Penguins is the face of crypto, Representing innovation and the mass adoption of blockchain technology. Being included in this filing is a strong validation of that belief.” Canary Capital has been a pioneer in altcoin ETFs. It has filed documents with the SEC to create ETFs tracking Litecoin , Hedera , Solana , and XRP . PENGU “has very few identified use cases apart from a collector’s item, the S-1 noted. There is no guarantee that it will continue to gain in value, it added. The token opened at $0.00689 on March 20, hit a high for the day of $0.00732 at 4:00 p.m. GMT and sank to $0.00646 at the time of writing. Its all-time high of $0.0428 was reached on Jan.6, according to CoinGecko. It has a market cap of around $406 million and 24-hour trading volume of $161 million.

The announcement on the soon-to-be-defunct website stated that the company intends to shift its focus and explore new opportunities. The LG Art Lab platform will officially close on June 17, 2025. The enthusiasm surrounding non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has noticeably waned since its 2022 peak. Initially, NFTs were introduced as revolutionary assets in the digital art and collectibles space. However, the sector ran into challenges such as market oversaturation, declining value, and a decline in consumer interests over time, which led to reciprocal changes within the industry, including the closure of many NFT trading platforms. In January 2025, Quidd, an NFT marketplace under Animoca Brands, announced its closure. The platform ceased operations on January 3, 2025. MakersPlace , another digital art platform, also shut down its operations in early 2025 due to “ongoing market challenges” after six years of operation. Many NFT trading platforms were shut down as early as 2024. GameStop launched its NFT marketplace in July 2022, during the peak of NFT trading and decided to close down the platform in early 2024. The closure was influenced by declining trading volumes after the peak November 2022 period, company layoffs, and declining interest and demand for NFTs. LG Art Lab announces closure to its community Per an announcement made on the LG Art Lab’s website, users will be unable to make purchases on the platform starting on March 10. The company says the LG Art Lab team will automatically transfer users’ NFTs to their wallets by April 30 so that the pieces can be resold. The notice also states that collectors and artists can manually transfer their artworks from the NFT marketplace to their own wallets. “Please note that Ethereum minted NFTs can be resold in other platforms (e.g. Opensea),” the notice read. The notice did not cite any specific reason for the closure of the platform. Instead, it vaguely expressed the company’s intention to explore other business opportunities. “As the NFT space continues to evolve, we believe it is the right time to shift our focus and explore new opportunities,” it read. The platform will shut down completely on June 17, but customer support for Art Lab users will be available until July 18. “While this chapter is coming to an end, our passion for digital art and innovation remains strong, and we look forward to seeing how the NFT space continues to grow and evolve,” LG said. Rise of LG Art Lab Launched in September 2022, LG Art Lab was designed to integrate digital art into consumers’ living rooms. The platform allowed users to buy, sell, and display NFTs directly on their LG smart TVs. LG Art Lab debuted during the period when interest in NFTs was at an all-time high. The platform aimed to make digital art accessible to a larger audience. The platform operated on the Hedera blockchain and later expanded to Ethereum, offering a range of digital artworks. Prices of the NFTs offered by LG Art Lab varied significantly. Some pieces like the “Bloom” animation from Bryan Brinkman cost the equivalent of $59.82, while a piece from Amadon sold for almost $4,000. Users could complete transactions on LG Art Lab using LG Electronics’ cryptocurrency wallet app, Wallypto. This made the process of acquiring and displaying digital art easier. Art Lab was launched shortly after Samsung launched a similar NFT TV marketplace in partnership with Nifty Gateway. The Samsung NFT TV marketplace has outlasted the LG NFT marketplace as they are so far still operational. The NFT market has experienced fluctuations across the spectrum since its boom in the early 2020s, and many companies are recording investment losses. The Australian Open’s Artball program, which linked NFTs to specific plots on the tennis court, saw the value of its tokens plummet by up to 90% as the initiative lost momentum. The sector has experienced a general decline in interest, but some sectors, such as gaming and virtual real estate, continue to find value in NFTs.

Phase 3 is currently priced at $0.02, with the project just a step away from the next price increase, coupled with a lot of excitement for its upcoming exchange listing. While several DeFi cryptocurrencies like XRP focus on cross-border payments and others like Polygon develop layer-2 scaling solutions, MUtuum Finance (MUTM) built a disruptive new mechanism that combines decentralized lending mechanics with a self-sustaining buy pressure system. Analysts monitoring the token’s trajectory contend that it could upend market expectations, with utility-driven demand propelling it past established competitors. Presale Momentum Accelerating Investors scrambling to secure entry into the final run of Phase 3 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale before the $0.025 rise. Phase 4 price kicks in soon and has brought third phase capacity within striking distance. Those who participate now will see their token value appreciate by 25% with the next stage launch, and buying the projected launch price of $0.06 now translates into a 200% gain for early buyers. Initial listings from listings have forecast of breaching into $3.50 in the months after going live — 17,400% increase from the current phase. Such growth potential is largely a result of Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) structured tokenomics, integrating platform revenue into strategic buybacks, establishing cyclical demand to the platform that stabilizes and enhances the token’s market value. As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts attention, comparisons to XRP and Polygon fade. As XRP struggles with regulatory greyness and Polygon with saturation of scalability, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is delivering real financial utility through its overcollateralized lending platform. Borrowers gain liquidity by collateralizing their assets and locking them in the pool by overcollateralizing their loan value while lenders earn dynamic variable interest rates applied to pool utilization. This creates a balance that entices players of all risk profiles from risk-averse to yield-seeking investors, and will cultivate an environment in which the token demand grows with the user adoption. The Tokenomics Driving Long-term Demand At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s charms is the buy-and-distribute business model that redistributes a share of platform fees back to the open markets when tokens are bought back from them. These tokens are then distributed to whoever staked the token, which incentivizes long term holding and reduces sell pressure. At the same time, users become able to deposit assets like ETH or DAI into our system to create mtTokens—yield-generating representations of their deposits which are transferable. These not only improve liquidity but also bring Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into the larger DeFi ecosystem, allowing for greater usage beyond just native platforms. As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ramps up towards exchange listing, the engineering team has smart contract audit initiated with industry leader Certik, a major achievement set to further cement investor confidence. The results will be reported through official channels when finalized, in accordance with the project’s commitment to transparency. Further solidifying the ecosystem’s stability and interoperability, the team also plans to introduce an overcollateralized stablecoin after launch. As Phase 3 allocations deplete, the opportunity to get MUTM at presale prices is closing in on both advantage and value. Those who get in on the ground floor set themselves up not just for near-term profits, but potentially exponential earnings as the platform’s user base grows. With a plan of crypto that diffuses away from speculative tokens to real-world utility and sustainable mechanics., Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a front-runner and ready to leapfrog the competition of both speculative tokens and Legacy Platforms. Seizing the Opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is born away from the true hype-driven cycles that seem to have plagued much of the crypto market. Combined with its presale, structured token burns, and rewards structures this one looks set for a lightning-fast rise. There is a level of immediate demand in something like MUTM that is very hard, if not impossible, to replicate, which is exactly why MUTM may represent the very rare intersection of innovation and immediacy that an investor looking for an asset rooted in functionality, rather than frenzy, would want to own. Get tokens now—before Phase 3 closes and prices rise.

The allegations were made by Wu Blockchain, a crypto news platform, when it shared a scoop on X (formerly Twitter) claiming that several projects paid huge intermediary fees to have their tokens listed on two of South Korea’s leading crypto exchanges, Upbit and Bithumb. According to Wu Blockchain, the fees were approximately $2 million and $10 million, respectively, and they were orchestrated by intermediaries related to Upbit’s shareholders and market makers. Some of the projects informed Wu Blockchain that they provided an intermediary fee ranging from 3% to 5% of the total token amount, before getting listed on Upbit successfully. The news platform also reported that this wasn’t the case with all the seven projects they reached out to. According to them, three of the projects reported that they didn’t pay any intermediary fee before they got listed. SCOOP: Several projects told WuBlockchain that they paid huge intermediary fees to have their tokens listed on South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Upbit and Bithumb. The fees were approximately US$10 million and US$2 million respectively. The intermediaries are… pic.twitter.com/PODtooUaYd — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 20, 2025 Upbit’s response and message to users In response to these allegations, Upbit denied the allegations in a press release addressed to its users, stating, “Upbit does not allow the involvement of external agencies to assist or intermediate trading support, and all procedures are conducted directly by Upbit employees.” The exchange also mentioned that it evaluates projects through a strict internal review process based on its trading support procedures and that it does not proceed with trading support under any financial compensation conditions. The exchange urged users and projects to avoid companies or individuals that approach them for intermediary fees, claiming that they are illegal brokers and unrelated to Upbit. The exchange also requested that Wu Blockchain share with them the list of digital assets listed on their platform that paid such intermediary fees as well as concrete evidence and supporting materials backing up the claim as they are setting up an investigation into the matter. Upbit also asked users to report cases of intermediary interference in its press statement. In response to the request, Wu Blockchain mentioned that it couldn’t disclose that information as it has to protect its source. Upbit’s battles with regulators Upbit recently had a run-in with South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which accused the platform of KYC violations numbering thousands. The regulator also discovered that Upbit facilitated transactions with unregistered foreign service providers, which violates South Korea’s specific Financial Information Act. All these violations led to the regulators sanctioning the platform on February 25, 2025, placing a ban on the platform’s ability to onboard new users. New users on the platform won’t be able to deposit or perform withdrawals from March 7 until June 6. The parent company of Upbit, Dunamu, has appealed the move and is working on overturning the decision. In a move that signified that the company may be actively working to be on the right side of the law, the platform announced earlier today that it will be revealing six companies suspected of engaging in Ponzi fraud via the platform and will be limiting the withdrawal of asset to the companies in accordance the Enforcement Decree of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act of South Korea. In its concluding post on X, Wu Blockchain urged the South Korean regulators to look into the matter, especially regarding the market markers. Given Upbit’s current progress, if these intermediary fee and market marker allegations turn out to be true, it will be a major setback for the platform. This would bring back more scrutiny on the platform which may be seeing itself pay out millions of dollars in fines due to previous violations. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Among the latest entrants, Arctic Pablo Coin shines as the Best meme coin to buy thanks to its innovative features and high-potential presale opportunities. Meanwhile, established meme coins like Sudeng and Toshi continue to make notable strides in the market, drawing increased investor interest. This article explores the latest developments surrounding these three coins, with a particular emphasis on Arctic Pablo Coin’s cutting-edge approach and the excitement surrounding its presale phase. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Mechanism: Enhancing Scarcity and Value Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) distinguishes itself through a strategic deflationary mechanism designed to enhance token scarcity and, consequently, value. During its presale, any unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation every week. Additionally, tokens remaining after the presale’s conclusion are also burned, fostering a deflationary environment that benefits investors by potentially increasing the value of their holdings over time. These token burn transactions are meticulously recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and trust within the community. This strategic mechanism further reinforces why Arctic Pablo Coin shines as the Best meme coin to buy as its controlled supply and growing demand create a strong investment case. With each burning event reducing the circulating supply, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as a promising asset in the competitive meme coin market. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: Seize the Opportunity at Nippy Nook The meme coin presale has reached an exhilarating milestone known as Nippy Nook, marking the 15th phase of its journey. Currently, APC is available for $0.000079 per token. Early investors have the potential to experience a remarkable return on investment (ROI) exceeding 10,027.85% as the price progresses from Nippy Nook to the anticipated launch price of $0.008. To illustrate, an investment of $100 today would secure approximately 1,265,686 APC tokens, which could grow to a value of $10,125.49 upon listing at $0.008. The presale has already raised over $1.95 million, reflecting strong community support and investor confidence. As Arctic Pablo Coin advances through its presale phases, the token price is set to increase, making the current phase an opportune moment for potential investors to join at a favorable entry point. Sudeng Coin: A Rising Contender in the Meme Coin Market Sudeng Coin (HIPPO) has been steadily gaining traction in the cryptocurrency market, drawing increased investor interest. Currently trading at approximately USD 0.004172, HIPPO boasts a 24-hour trading volume of $29,887,001, reflecting strong market activity. This consistent engagement highlights the growing confidence in Sudeng Coin’s potential. As meme coins continue to capture the attention of crypto enthusiasts, HIPPO stands out as a promising contender. With its active trading volume and expanding community, Sudeng Coin could present lucrative opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the ever-evolving meme coin world. Toshi Coin: A Growing Meme Coin Opportunity Toshi Coin (TOSHI) is currently trading at approximately USD 0.0003784, maintaining its position as a notable player in the meme coin sector. Despite limited recent updates, the token continues to attract interest from investors seeking high-growth opportunities in the crypto space. With meme coins gaining mainstream traction, Toshi Coin’s market presence and potential for price surges make it an intriguing option. As the broader cryptocurrency market evolves, TOSHI could benefit from increased adoption and speculative trading. Investors keeping an eye on emerging meme coins may find Toshi Coin to be a promising asset in their portfolio. Final Words: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Meme Coin Charge In the ever-evolving realm of meme coins, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) stands out with its innovative deflationary mechanism and the exciting opportunity presented by its presale phase, Nippy Nook. With a current price of $0.000079 and the potential for substantial returns, Arctic Pablo Coin is positioning itself as the best meme coin to buy for those seeking promising investment avenues. While Sudeng and Toshi continue to make their mark, the unique features and strategic approach of Arctic Pablo Coin make it a compelling choice for investors looking to capitalize on the dynamic cryptocurrency market.

This breakout brings renewed optimism, as analysts believe a stronghold above this level could trigger a rally toward higher prices. However, if ETH fails to maintain support above $2,000, a significant drop could follow, leading to further market instability. Related Reading: On-Chain Data Signals Key Test For Solana At $135 Level – Insights Macroeconomic uncertainty and trade war fears have continued to shake the crypto market, with Ethereum being one of the most affected assets. The recent price action reflects investor caution, as global financial conditions remain unpredictable. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that ETH is trading at a critical level that will determine its long-term direction in the coming weeks. Bulls must sustain momentum to solidify a bullish structure, while bears are watching for signs of weakness to drive prices lower. With ETH at a pivotal juncture, the next few trading sessions could be decisive for its trajectory. Ethereum at a Crossroads: Breakout or Breakdown? Ethereum has lost over 57% of its value since mid-December, with bulls struggling to reclaim higher prices as selling pressure dominates the market. Despite occasional relief rallies, ETH has remained under key resistance levels, leaving investors uncertain about its next move. Speculation about a potential recovery and a continuation of the downtrend are colliding, as price action shows no clear direction. The $2,000 level has become the ultimate test for Ethereum. Bulls must defend this price with conviction to sustain any meaningful recovery. Losing this support could lead to a sharp decline, pushing ETH into deeper bearish territory. Jelle stated in his analysis that either ETH is about to put in a massive reclaim or it’s about to jump off a cliff. The $2,000 level is the key limit that will determine Ethereum’s next move. If bulls can maintain strength above this mark, a push toward $2,300 and beyond could follow. However, failure to hold $2,000 would signal further downside, with the next major support sitting around $1,750. Ethereum’s fate hangs in the balance, and the coming days will be crucial in deciding whether it regains bullish momentum or continues its descent. Related Reading: XRP Bulls Face A Big Test – Metrics Show $2.40 As The Most Critical Resistance Level Ethereum Battles to Hold $2,000: Key Levels to Watch Ethereum is currently trading at $1,980 after days of struggling below the crucial $2,000 mark. Bulls managed to briefly push the price above this level, but sustaining it is now the real challenge. Holding above $2,000 is critical for Ethereum’s recovery, as it would signal strength and open the door for a rally toward the $2,200 mark. The $2,200 level is the most important resistance for ETH to reclaim in order to confirm a bullish reversal. A successful break and consolidation above this point would indicate that bulls are regaining control, potentially leading to a move toward higher targets. However, if Ethereum fails to hold above $2,000, selling pressure could increase, leading to a deeper correction. A drop below this level could trigger a sharp decline, pushing ETH toward the $1,800 support zone. If this support fails, the next major liquidity level would be around $1,750, where buyers might step in to prevent further downside.

According to its website, Manifest, which is “coming soon,” will be backed by home equity investments (HEIs) and offer a tokenized ETF , $USH (U.S. Housing). Lopez added that Manifest is revolutionizing tokenization by using ETF-style diversification to U.S. real estate and structuring it into a smart contract available on transparent public blockchains. Unlike traditional ETFs available on a legacy exchange, $USH utilizes blockchain technology to boost liquidity, programmability, and global accessibility, providing a groundbreaking approach to acquiring real estate exposure. Manifest’s $USH offers a blockchain-powered alternative to traditional real estate ETFs Manifest Founder and CEO Nathaniel Sokoll-Ward said the announcement is crucial for ETF investors because they will soon have the option to invest in diversified U.S. real estate that is not tied to real estate investment trusts (REITs) or direct ownership. He added that instead of using a product like the Vanguard Real Estate ETF, which has assets predominantly made up of real estate rental businesses, investors will have “the option to gain capital-efficient, direct exposure to the dominant real estate asset class in the country: owner-occupied single-family residential real estate equity.” Manifest’s $USH marks a major advancement beyond traditional real estate ETFs. According to Sokoll-Ward, $USH integrates blockchain technology to improve liquidity, capital efficiency, and tax benefits. Unlike publicly traded REIT ETFs, which face stock market volatility, centralized management, limited trading hours, and high fees, $USH operates entirely on-chain and is backed by Home Equity Investments. He added that this structure “eliminates intermediaries, reduces fees, increases transparency and ensures that all assets are fully collateralized by real estate equity.” VanEck Ventures, which co-led Manifest’s $2.5 million pre-seed funding round with Lattice Fund, was launched by the fund giant last October. The $30 million early-stage fund marked VanEck’s expansion into venture capital and was created to invest in “visionary founders operating at the intersection of fintech, digital assets and artificial intelligence.” Tokenized real estate set for growth as blockchain reshapes the market According to Lopez, tokenized financial products like $USH represent the next evolution in asset management, introducing 24/7 liquidity, seamless global settlement, enhanced accessibility, and direct programmability. These features have driven growth in DeFi and stablecoins in recent years, areas where traditional ETFs fall short. Developers can now access these assets and build products that enable margin against them, a previously unavailable capability. As per Statista , real estate tokenization will likely emerge as a key segment in the broader tokenized asset market, accounting for around one-third of the total tokenized assets in the global market by 2030. This is a sign of the growing acceptance of blockchain technology in real estate, as it allows fractional ownership and better liquidity. About 12% of real estate companies reported using asset tokenization in 2023, reflecting an increasing trend in digital modes of investment. Conventional real estate investments are frequently plagued by liquidity constraints as such property transactions are slow and costly. Market liquidity was highlighted as a top challenge by 60% of respondents in a 2024 European real estate industry experts survey. Manifest’s $USH is an example of a blockchain-based ETF that leverages tokenization to become tradable 24/7, bring transaction costs down by reducing counterparty risk and improve accessibility through tokenized ownership.

42073358,https://coingape.com/?p=245157,1742521523,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Canary Capital Files for Pengu ETF With US SEC, PENGU Price To Soar?",https://coingape.com/canary-capital-files-for-pengu-etf-with-us-sec-pengu-price-to-soar/,"Canary Capital has submitted a registration filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the launch of the first-ever Pengu exchange-traded fund (ETF). This move adds to the growing list of crypto asset managers seeking regulatory approval for digital asset-based ETFs. According to the filing published on Thursday, the proposed ETF will invest in the PENGU token, which is the official token of the Pudgy Penguins NFT project, as well as in Pudgy Penguins NFTs themselves. The filing also states that the ETF will hold other digital assets, including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), to support trading and transfers. Canary Capital Files for Pengu ETF In the registration statement , the ETF is defined as an investment trust that invests in digital assets such as PENGU tokens and Pudgy Penguins NFTs, among others. Regarding these holdings, Canary Capital emphasized that these ones are critical for monitoring the token and the NFT assets. If launched, the ETF will allow investors to track the price of PENGU and other NFTs in its portfolio without owning or hosting them as physical assets. The trust may also contain other assets in the form of digital media for the buying and selling besides conversion and redemption of the fund. “Other non-security digital assets owned by the trust include SOL and ETH that may be necessary or incidental,” the filing added. The Pudgy Penguins project released the Ethereum-linked PENGU token in December. The project has been popular in the crypto sphere as a collection of NFT and social networking. Although PENGU was first developed on Ethereum, there is a growing sentiment that it can be regarded as a Solana meme coin since most of its trading activity transpire in Solana platforms. PENGU Market Reaction and Price Movement Following the ETF announcement, the PENGU token saw a sharp 10% price increase during early trading. It broke above previous resistance levels and moved past the Ichimoku cloud, indicating a possible shift in momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for PENGU moved from 44.86 to 62 shortly after the news, indicating increased buying activity. The RSI remains below the overbought level of 70, suggesting that further gains are still possible. Many of the analysts are now focusing on the $0.0093 as the next level of resistance backed by the Robinhood listing last week. A breakout above that level means the token will be trading above the $0.010 mark, the first time in a month. However, if the momentum disappears, the token may fall back to $ 0.0062 support area. Growing List of Crypto ETF Applications Canary Capital is not the only firm pursuing ETF approval for non-traditional digital assets. In recent months, several asset managers have submitted filings for altcoin ETFs , including ones focused on Dogecoin (DOGE), Sui, Hedera, and BONK. These filings followed the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs by the SEC in 2024. Despite the recent trend, the SEC has delayed decisions on many of these applications, especially those involving meme coins and smaller tokens. Some market participants have raised questions about whether ETFs for meme coins and NFTs will meet regulatory standards. “The likelihood of approval for these funds remains unclear due to high volatility and limited trading history,” a statement from the filing added. Mixed Reactions From the Crypto Community On Pengu ETF The ETF proposal has sparked different responses from traders and analysts online. Some have raised doubts about investor demand for a fund tied to a meme coin and NFT project that is less than six months old. Social media commentator @beast_ico wrote, “We don’t need ETFs for ghost chains, much less sub 6 month old memecoins.” Others noted that despite the ETF news, the price reaction was short-lived, and sustained momentum may depend on broader market trends. Industry observer Alex Krüger commented, “New ETFs for crypto assets have become an irrelevant joke,” citing weak asset inflows into recently launched funds.

The Trump appointee shared a video where he listed the agency’s discoveries and those that have been discontinued. In the footage Hegseth posted on his official X page, he announced his decision to sign a memo directing the termination of over $580 million in DOD contracts. Hegseth said this would only affect the brands that do not align with the priorities of “this president or the department.” “In other words, they are not a good use of taxpayer dollars,” he said, pointing out that taxpayers fund the department and are owed transparency and the right to know their money is being used well. Another round of @DOGE findings here at the Department of Defense. pic.twitter.com/PSrHn8Zjlq — Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (@SecDef) March 20, 2025 Hegseth shared programs DOGE has terminated Hegseth began the list with an HR software effort he said was supposed to take a year and cost $36 million. Unfortunately, it has gone for years and gulped up to $280 million without doing what it was supposed to. “We’re not doing that anymore,” he said before moving on to reveal they also ended another batch of DOD grants worth $360 million. Next, he talked about cutting about $11 million from the navy budget and $9 from a university budget geared towards approaching “equitable AI and machine learning models.” “I need lethal machine learning models, not equitable machine models,” he said. After that, Hegseth revealed that as part of their effort to curb wasteful spending on external consulting services, they canceled $30 million in contracts with Gartner and McKinsey. Hegseth said that brings the total amount of cuts up to $800 million. He added this was only possible because the DOD partnered with DOGE as part of its efforts to ensure taxpayer funds are going to the warfighters who actually need them. “They’re working hard,” Hegseth praised DOGE before adding that the DOD appreciates the nobility of its task to cut excessive spending and is also working hard with them to make it happen. As the video ended, the Defense Secretary said no more time would be wasted and promptly signed the documents making the cuts permanent. In the comment section of the post, rather than appreciative comments from a public who recognizes the importance of what DOGE and the DOD are doing, the majority of the replies were scathing. DOD accused of going too far to eliminate DEI from the armed forces In the past couple of days, there has been much backlash from US citizens, especially members of the African American community, who feel they are being targeted by efforts disguised as cost-cutting attempts. Recently, the DOD, following President Trump’s executive order to eliminate DEI from the armed services, has flagged tens of thousands of images, posts, and content for removal. Some of the posts that have now been removed include references to Black military heroes like the Tuskegee Airmen, Medal of Honor recipients and other notable figures such as Jackie Robinson, as part of what is being called a “Digital Content Refresh” to comply with the directive. The content that was targeted involved those related to race, ethnicity, and observances like Black History Month, and it has led to the deletion of photos and posts about Black soldiers, women, and minorities, something that has triggered a mass outcry within the African American community. Jackie Robinson’s page has since been restored to its original URL on the Department of Defense website — and no longer says ‘DEI.’ pic.twitter.com/MQ5csI4XVB — Pop Base (@PopBase) March 19, 2025 On X, formerly Twitter, many have ranted and raved, calling out the DOD for only getting rid of pictures of colored servicemen while leaving images of only the white ones up and also renaming bases after Confederate generals. They worry this undermines the recognition of the contributions these men made to the war while they lived. Hegseth, who was appointed in January 2025, is in support of the war against DEI. He has declared “DEI is dead,” and argued that such programs erode camaraderie and threaten military mission execution. People now link his leadership at the DOD with the erasure of Black soldier history, and many have been seen criticizing or questioning the moves under his X posts.

Top Cryptos Under $1 To Watch in 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/price-surge-coming-soon-top-cryptos-under-1-to-watch-in-2025/,"The idea of buying a cryptocurrency under $1 and seeing it soar has always been appealing. With small initial capital, the potential for high gains remains a strong draw. Many well-known coins, like Dogecoin, started cheap and later delivered massive returns. Choosing wisely today could mean spotting tomorrow’s biggest performers. As 2025 approaches, several promising cryptos under $1 stand out. These digital assets combine strong fundamentals with innovative use cases that could drive their value higher. This list highlights the best options, including BlockDAG, Polygon (MATIC), TRON (TRX), Algorand (ALGO), Kaspa (KAS), and Dogecoin (DOGE). While their prices remain low, their potential remains high. BlockDAG Speed & Scalability Leading to $204.5M Presale BlockDAG is redefining blockchain efficiency with its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure. This design enables multiple blocks to be processed simultaneously, ensuring faster transactions and better scalability. BlockDAG’s infrastructure makes it a prime choice for decentralized applications (dApps) and Web3 developers needing speed and security. Unlike many low-cost cryptos that rely on hype, BlockDAG has demonstrated real progress. Its presale has already raised $204.5 million, providing strong community backing. Priced at $0.0248 per BDAG in Batch 27, it has surged 2,380% from its initial launch. With over 18.8 billion BDAG coins sold and $6.5 million in miner sales, BlockDAG is preparing for major exchange listings, with 10 top-tier platforms already in focus. The ongoing affiliate program also offers a 5% cashback in USDT, adding further value to early supporters. Polygon: The $491M Layer-2 Powerhouse Fueling Ethereum’s Future Polygon (MATIC) continues to be a powerhouse in the crypto space, thanks to its ability to enhance Ethereum’s scalability. As a Layer-2 solution, it provides faster, more cost-effective transactions, helping solve Ethereum’s congestion issues. With an expanding network of dApps and strong institutional partnerships, Polygon remains a favorite among developers. Currently priced at $0.2521, Polygon holds a market cap of approximately $491 million, reinforcing its standing in the industry. Its advancements in zero-knowledge (ZK) technology and Ethereum compatibility further position it for long-term success. As Ethereum-based projects grow, Polygon’s role as a scaling solution could significantly increase its value. TRON: The $20.87B Blockchain Powering Digital Content TRON (TRX) has established itself as a major force in decentralized applications, particularly in entertainment and content-sharing platforms. With its fast processing speeds and minimal transaction fees, TRON continues to see widespread adoption in gaming, streaming, and social media services. At $0.2451, TRON boasts a market cap of about $20.87 billion, demonstrating its dominance in the blockchain space. The network’s focus on digital content monetization ensures its relevance, while its ongoing development and partnerships make it a stable yet promising choice among cryptos. ALGO: The Green Blockchain With Real Use Cases Algorand (ALGO) is a standout due to its environmentally friendly proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, reducing energy consumption compared to traditional blockchains. The project has made strides in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), providing a secure and scalable infrastructure. Currently priced at $0.2488, Algorand has a market cap of $35.96 billion, highlighting its strong presence in the industry. By bridging traditional finance with decentralized solutions, Algorand continues to attract institutional partnerships. Additionally, its commitment to carbon-negative initiatives aligns with the rising demand for sustainable blockchain networks. Kaspa (KAS) is Redefining Transaction Speed Kaspa (KAS) is carving its niche by focusing on ultra-fast transactions. Its blocked structure allows multiple blocks to be created simultaneously, significantly improving scalability. This innovation enables the network to handle high transaction volumes efficiently without congestion. Priced at $0.0750 with a market cap of $2.89 billion, Kaspa presents a unique opportunity for those looking to invest in speed-optimized blockchain technology. Its expanding developer community and refined architecture position it as a key player in the future of high-performance blockchains. The Meme Coin DOGE Endures Dogecoin (DOGE) may have started as a joke, but its market relevance remains strong. As one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies, DOGE has built a loyal community and gained widespread acceptance as a payment option. Now trading at $0.2023 with a market cap of $29.68 billion, Dogecoin’s appeal extends beyond memes. Its continued integration into payment systems and community-driven growth ensure its lasting presence in the crypto space. Which Crypto Has the Best Potential? The best cryptos under $1 offer a unique mix of affordability and growth potential. While SHIB faces speculative challenges and Hedera must clear resistance before a true breakout, BlockDAG is emerging as the strongest contender. With its $204.5 million presale, 18.8 billion coins sold, and rapid expansion, BlockDAG is proving its staying power. Analysts believe its price could reach $1 by 2025, presenting a 3,932% ROI for early buyers. As it continues to attract attention and build out its ecosystem, those looking for high-growth potential should consider BDAG before the next price jump. For those who want to seize an opportunity before the next surge, BDAG’s presale remains open—but not for long.

As the top meme coin fluctuates near the support and resistance levels, market analysts have predicted the higher and lower possibilities. Both the technical analysis and historical data suggest how the prices could reverse higher or further consolidate in days to come. Dogecoin Price Faces Critical Test: Will Support Hold or Break? Dogecoin price is facing strong resistance at $0.176, with a Bearish Tweezer candlestick pattern forming on the daily chart. According to Trader Alan, this pattern is a strong reversal signal, suggesting that selling pressure is increasing. The resistance level has already seen a false breakout, where Dogecoin price briefly moved above $0.176 but failed to hold. This failure indicates weak bullish momentum and a possible downward move. The analyst suggests that if the price moves lower, Dogecoin price could retest the $0.143 support level. If selling pressure intensifies, the meme coin may trade within a range between $0.143 and $0.176. A break below this support could trigger further declines, pushing the top meme coin to a deeper correction phase. However, if buyers step in and defend the $0.143 level, Dogecoin price may continue consolidating within this range. Analyst states that for a bullish breakout to occur, DOGE must establish higher lows and build momentum near the $0.176 resistance level. A sustained move above this resistance could invalidate the bearish outlook, leading to an upward trend. Source: X Analyst Predict Possible 16% Breakout Analyst Ali Martinez has identified an ascending triangle pattern on Dogecoin price charts, indicating the potential for a breakout. This bullish pattern forms when higher lows develop while the price repeatedly tests a horizontal resistance level. In this case, the key range for a breakout is between $0.16 and $0.18. Martinez suggests that if DOGE price closes outside this range, either upward or downward, a 16% price move could follow. A breakout above $0.18 could lead to further bullish momentum, while a breakdown below $0.16 may result in a sharp decline. Source: X Trendline at $0.14269 Could Influence Meme Coin Rally Moreover, analyst DOGE Capital noted that Dogecoin price is following a historical pattern observed in past market cycles. The analyst points to a repeating structure where DOGE accumulates within a triangular wedge before breaking out. The key support level to watch is around $0.14269, which has previously acted as a launchpad for the meme coin rally. DOGE Capital’s analysis suggests that when DOGE price retests this historical trendline, it tends to rebound and initiate a strong upward move. If this pattern repeats, DOGE could see another bullish breakout in the coming weeks. Source: X Meanwhile, following the Fed’s FOMC meeting, the meme coin has shown strong upward momentum. Analysts have identified key price targets at $0.38, $0.48, and $0.60, citing bullish market conditions and increased trading volume as driving factors.

Indeed, buying ADA at its 200DMA has proven to be a great short-term trading strategy in recent weeks. After testing its 200DMA in early February, the Cardano price rallied 50% in 10 days. Meanwhile, after falling back to the 200DMA in late February, the Cardano price rallied as much as 80% in early March. Could history be about to repeat itself? Well, traders would be wise to realize that the situation in the crypto market right now is very different than it was a few weeks ago. Trump’s announcement that Cardano would be included in a strategic US crypto reserve in early March was the catalyst for that stunning rally. However, ADA didn’t make it into the digital asset stockpile, and the government has announced no plans to include it in the stockpile in the future. Meanwhile, after a lot of hype that Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson would meet with key officials in the Trump administration in February, he was eventually snubbed and not even invited to the administration’s crypto event earlier this month. Last at $0.72, the Cardano price is down about 40% from its earlier monthly highs, justified amid the pricing out of all this hype. Cardano has been suffering amid a broader malaise in the crypto market as macro conditions turn for the worse. The Fed threw the bulls a bone earlier this week when they slowed the rate of their quantitative tightening . BREAKING: FED SAYS QT ENDS APRIL 1ST. MONEY PRINTER IS COMING BACK. MASSIVELY BULLISH FOR BITCOIN! pic.twitter.com/b4MHNfwc9l — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) March 19, 2025 But the outlook for the US economy remains murky, with risks to growth and inflation remaining sticky rising. A further deterioration of the macro backdrop could easily be the trigger for a renewed crypto market drop in the weeks ahead, and Cardano could easily lose its 200DMA. How Low Could Cardano Go? Just as the convincing break above the 200DMA in early November signified the start of a powerful bullish trend, a convincing break below the 200DMA in the coming weeks could signal the start of a new bearish trend. Its entirely feasible that the Cardano price might soon retest its February lows in the $0.55 area, and potentially even support in the form of the mid-2024 highs in the $0.40s. Would it be a good idea to buy Cardano at these levels? Well, it depends on the risk appetite of the investor. Cardano could do very very well in the years ahead. Its blockchain has a lot of potential for real world adoption, especially as it pivots towards becoming the go-to Bitcoin DeFi chain. However, this is highly speculative. In its many years of existence, Cardano has failed to garner anything close to the real world adoption seen by rivals like Bitcoin , Ethereum and Solana . That being said, deteriorating macro conditions aside, risks are titled towards major cryptos seeing a lot of growth before Trump’s term is finished. The US President has specifically marked out crypto as an industry that he wants to support, as he reiterated in remarks today. BREAKING: THE FULL TRUMP SPEECH: pic.twitter.com/tfyVzLQhqt — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) March 20, 2025 Growth in the broader industry would be expected to “lift all boats”, meaning Cardano could do very well over the next few years. Buying it on the dip is thus probably not a bad idea. That said, cryptos with a better track record of adoption like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana are probably safer bets with arguably just as much upside potential.

Gox crypto exchange and co-founded Ripple has shared new details about his ambitious space station company Vast, which he hopes will help expand the human race into a multi-planetary species. In a March 20 interview with Bloomberg, Jed McCaleb confirmed that Vast is on track to launch Haven-1 — a commercial space station still under construction — into orbit by May 2026. If McCaleb’s startup succeeds, it will be better positioned to win a lucrative contract from the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration to replace the International Space Station. Contracts are expected to be handed out in mid-2026. If Vast fails or loses the NASA contract to a competitor, McCaleb could see $1 billion wiped from his net worth and the commercial future of his space station firm would be in doubt, according to the report. “There are not that many folks who are willing to dedicate the amount of resources and time and risk tolerance that I am,” McCaleb told Bloomberg. Vast’s founder, board chair and tech fellow Jed McCaleb. Source: Vast McCaleb is known to be a “deliberate risk-taker” with hyperrational tendencies, according to long-time friend and former business partner Sam Yagan, who added: “He’s maybe slightly eccentric in his willingness to take what you and I would see as a lot of risks.” McCaleb’s aspiration to put humans on other planets draws similarities to multibillionaire and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. “It’s super important that people take this leap from where we are today to this potential world where there’s a lot of people living off the Earth,” said McCaleb, who founded Vast in 2021. Vast is building its spacecraft with components developed by SpaceX, such as a docking adapter to connect SpaceX’s Dragon capsule to Vast’s station and an in-space internet system that will provide WiFi on the station via Starlink. Key specifications Vast’s Haven-1 model. Source: Vast McCaleb’s firm has also booked SpaceX flights to send its hardware into orbit and deliver crew to its station, and SpaceX has agreed to carry astronauts for Vast as long as NASA gives its go-ahead. Vast’s close ties to SpaceX stem partly from it hiring key personnel who previously worked there, including Max Haot, who now serves as Vast’s CEO and president. Vast is competing with the likes of Axiom Space, Voyager Space Holdings, Lockheed Martin and the Jeff Bezos-founded Blue Origin to win the next major NASA contract. McCaleb also wants to create ‘artificial gravity’ Part of Vast’s long-term plans is to create artificial gravity replicating Earth-like conditions by accelerating or rotating the spacecraft, as many ISS workers who have spent lengthy periods in space have reported organ damage. The ISS also uses a technology that recycles wastewater into potable water and carbon dioxide into breathable oxygen. Haven-1 won’t feature this due to its short-term crew visits, but Vast plans to incorporate it into its future model, Haven-2, by 2028, which will be designed for longer-term stays. Both McCaleb and Haot say they’re willing to board flights themselves.

After McCaleb’s first success with the internet file-sharing service eDonkey in the 2000s, his next notable achievement was founding Mt. Gox in 2010. His time at Mt. Gox was short-lived, with McCaleb selling a majority stake in 2011. Mt. Gox went on to become the world’s largest Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange until 2014 when a $400 million hack sent the company into bankruptcy. Several months later, McCaleb began his next venture — creating the XRP ( XRP ) crypto token on the Ripple protocol in 2012. McCaleb owned 9% of the XRP tokens from the onset but sold the majority of them after 2013 when he left Ripple following disagreements with the company’s other founders. He has netted billions of dollars from those XRP sales and Ripple equity between 2014 and 2022. McCaleb also founded the Stellar network in 2014 — a fork of the Ripple protocol — along with the Stellar ( XLM ) crypto token, which now boasts an $8.7 billion market cap, CoinGecko data shows.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP’s surge past $2.50, BNB’s bullish momentum, and Qubetics’ presale and partnership success are fueling excitement in the crypto market. Table of Contents Qubetics: Transforming asset tokenization XRP breaks $2.50 after SEC lawsuit dismissal announcement BNB gears up for a bullish breakout Why Qubetics, XRP, and BNB are worth watching The cryptocurrency market is witnessing exciting developments, with Qubetics, XRP, and BNB standing out as major players. Qubetics is transforming tokenized assets, securing massive investments in its crypto presale and forming key partnerships to enhance liquidity and security. XRP surged past $2.50 after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the dismissal of the SEC lawsuit, boosting investor confidence. Meanwhile, BNB shows strong bullish indicators, hinting at a potential breakout rally. Qubetics: Transforming asset tokenization Qubetics is leading tokenized investments by offering a marketplace that fractionalizes real-world and digital assets, making them accessible to investors worldwide. From real estate and commodities to equities and intellectual property, the platform aims to unlock new opportunities for diversification and wealth creation. Qubetics’ crypto presale: A massive opportunity for early investors Qubetics’ crypto presale has been nothing short of a massive success, raising $15.2 million with over 501 million TICS tokens sold. Unlike traditional ICOs, Qubetics uses a unique 7-day presale stage system, ensuring a 10% price increase every Sunday at 12 AM. Currently, TICS is priced at $0.1181, but analysts predict it will reach $1 by the end of the presale, offering early investors a potential 746% ROI. However, the real gains may come post-launch. With the mainnet set to launch in Q2 2025, price forecasts suggest TICS could surge to $10 or even $15. This makes Qubetics one of the trending crypto presales for potentially high, long-term rewards. Strategic partnerships: Strengthening Qubetics’ ecosystem To ensure a secure and efficient blockchain experience, Qubetics has formed high-profile partnerships that enhance its liquidity, security, and usability. CertiK security audit: Qubetics is undergoing a comprehensive audit by CertiK, one of the most trusted blockchain security firms. This assessment will strengthen network security, smart contract reliability, and user trust, ensuring Qubetics is a secure and attack-resistant ecosystem. SWFT Blockchain collaboration: Qubetics has partnered with SWFT Blockchain to develop a state-of-the-art wallet, simplifying blockchain transactions and setting a new standard for secure asset management. Qubetics x 1inch: Qubetics is proud to announce its integration with the 1inch Network, a leading DeFi aggregator that connects users to hundreds of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for optimized trades, unmatched liquidity, and the best possible rates. This strategic partnership positions the Qubetics Wallet at the forefront of decentralized trading offerings. With these strategic partnerships, Qubetics is positioning itself as a secure, scalable, and transformative blockchain ecosystem, making it a top contender in the crypto space.

Following the announcement, XRP surged 14% to surpass $2.50, with analysts expecting further gains. Whales have taken notice — wallets holding at least one million XRP have increased their holdings by 6.5% in the past two months, accumulating 46.4 billion XRP worth $114 billion at current prices. Additionally, XRP network activity has surged, with unique wallet interactions increasing sixfold in March. With regulatory uncertainty behind it and growing institutional adoption, XRP is set for continued bullish momentum. BNB gears up for a bullish breakout BNB’s price action suggests an impending breakout, as the crypto has rebounded from recent lows with strong momentum. Previously, BNB attempted a trendline breakout, but resistance at $640 (the 61.80% Fibonacci level) caused a temporary dip to $605. However, the broader market recovery has sparked a V-shaped reversal, with BNB forming four consecutive bullish candles, signaling renewed upside momentum. Key indicators supporting a bullish rally include: MACD and signal lines are close to a positive crossover, reinforcing buying strength. The stochastic RSI lines rebounded from the oversold region, initiating a fresh, bullish cycle. If BNB breaks past the $640 resistance, it could trigger an extended rally, making it one of the top altcoins to watch in the coming weeks. Why Qubetics, XRP, and BNB are worth watching Qubetics stands out with its $15.2m presale, upcoming mainnet launch, and strong partnerships. Meanwhile, XRP and BNB continue showing signs of strength. Keeping an eye on these projects as the crypto market heats up could lead to significant gains in 2025 and beyond.

With Solana ETFs and Kaspa’s 11% Breakout, It Might Be—Here’s Why!",https://thecoinrise.com/is-qubetics-the-top-crypto-presale-of-2025-with-solana-etfs-and-kaspas-11-breakout-it-might-be-heres-why/,"Which blockchain projects are leading the next wave of innovation? Some cryptocurrencies fade into obscurity, while others continue to break new ground. Solana’s first-ever futures ETFs in the U.S. have signaled an institutional shift. Kaspa’s network efficiency has fueled double-digit gains, drawing serious attention. But neither has solved a major issue that plagues global finance: seamless, cost-effective cross-border transactions. Qubetics ($TICS) the top crypto presale is changing that. Designed for real-world usability, Qubetics is redefining how digital assets move across economies. Unlike its predecessors, this multi-chain non-custodial wallet offers businesses and individuals an advanced transactional ecosystem, solving the inefficiencies that traditional financial systems and legacy blockchains have struggled with for years. Qubetics: The Future of Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics isn’t just a blockchain initiative—it’s reshaping the future of digital finance. With a cross-border transaction at its core, Qubetics enables seamless global transactions without reliance on third parties. High fees, slow settlements, and complex onboarding have kept digital assets from reaching mainstream commerce, but Qubetics is eliminating these barriers. International trade, freelance payments, and remittances all suffer from inefficient banking rails. A business selling goods across borders faces steep conversion fees and unpredictable settlement times. With Qubetics, transactions happen in real time, cutting costs and eliminating middlemen. Similarly, a professional receiving payments from abroad no longer waits days for clearance—Qubetics provides instant liquidity one of the top crypto presale. More than 23,400 token holders have already recognized its potential, securing over 501 million $TICS tokens in its crypto presale . Currently in its 26th stage, the presale has raised over $15.2 million, with $TICS priced at $0.1181. Early participants stand to gain a 746% ROI at $1, 4,130% ROI at $5, and 12,591% ROI at $15, making Qubetics one of the top crypto projects to invest in right now. Solana: Institutional Adoption Accelerates Solana’s network efficiency and developer activity have positioned it as a top-tier blockchain. With Volatility Shares launching the first-ever Solana futures ETFs in the U.S., institutions now have a new gateway to gain exposure without directly holding SOL. The introduction of these ETFs—Solana ETF (SOLZ) and the leveraged 2X Solana ETF (SOLT)—is a major milestone. Unlike traditional crypto trading, ETFs provide regulated, mainstream access to digital assets, driving liquidity and adoption. Since the announcement, Solana’s price has surged above $130, gaining 6% in just 24 hours, reflecting growing confidence. The Expanding Ecosystem Solana’s ultra-fast transactions and low fees continue to attract developers, leading to new DeFi and NFT innovations. Whether it’s on-chain gaming or decentralized finance applications, Solana remains a formidable player in blockchain scalability. Kaspa: The Scalable Proof-of-Work Blockchain Kaspa has gained traction as a high-speed proof-of-work blockchain with rapid transaction finality. Unlike Bitcoin, which struggles with scalability, Kaspa’s GhostDAG protocol allows simultaneous block confirmations, improving efficiency without sacrificing security. Kaspa’s resilience in the market has been evident. Recently, its price surged 11%, demonstrating solid recovery momentum. Currently, it trades at $0.077583, marking a 3.65% increase in the past 24 hours, outperforming the general market’s 2.45% rise. Why Kaspa Stands Out Kaspa’s structure enables high transaction throughput, making it a viable alternative for industries requiring real-time confirmations. This unique architecture keeps network congestion minimal, ensuring smooth operations even during peak usage. The Takeaway: Which Project Has the Strongest Future? Each of these projects addresses different facets of blockchain innovation. Solana is accelerating institutional adoption, Kaspa is redefining PoW scalability, and Qubetics is solving real-world financial inefficiencies. For those looking at high-potential opportunities, Qubetics’ presale remains a standout, with its cross-border transaction solutions proving critical for the evolving digital economy. Qubetics is also pioneering AI-driven smart contracts, reducing settlement times and eliminating inefficiencies in financial transactions. With regulatory-friendly automation and a scalable infrastructure, it is positioning itself as the top crypto presale , offering businesses and individuals a seamless way to engage with blockchain without technical barriers.

Atai, which is developing mental health treatments using psychedelics like DMT and MDMA, has become the latest public company to announce plans to buy Bitcoin. It plans to buy $5 million of Bitcoin ( BTC ), its founder and chair Christian Angermayer wrote in a March 20 Substack post. “Drug development is a cash-hungry, long-term venture,” he said. “The necessary steps to achieve regulatory approval can easily take more than a decade.” TechCrunch reported in January that, according to multiple data sets, the number of startups shutting down rose in 2024 compared to 2023 as firms failed to receive more funding to keep running. Angermayer said the approval process is essential for drug development, but it exposes firms to financial risks while sticky inflation and high interest rates have caused the current “biotech winter.” Source: Christian Angermayer He added that the current industry approach is to put cash reserves in near-zero-yield accounts, as “preserving capital was more important than earning a return on their cash balance.” “This context sets the stage for considering unconventional treasury moves — like adding Bitcoin to the treasury — to address the twin threats of inflation and low-yielding reserves, and in general to optimize and maximize shareholder value.” Atai will join at least five other public medical companies that have bought Bitcoin in recent months with the aim of boosting shareholder returns. Biotech firm Quantum BioPharma said on March 20 that it had now spent $3.5 million in total to buy BTC and other cryptocurrencies after an initial $1 million investment in December. Medical device maker Semler Scientific said last month that since it started in May, it had spent a total of $280.4 million buying 3,192 BTC. Hoth Therapeutics , Acurx Pharmaceuticals and Enlivex Therapeutics said in separate statements on Nov. 20 that each of them would buy $1 million in Bitcoin. Related: Michael Saylor’s Strategy plans to offer 5M shares to buy more Bitcoin Atai’s Angermayer said his firm’s Bitcoin buy would primarily be as a long-term inflation hedge but also a short-term diversification play. He added that Bitcoin is likely to have short-term price fluctuations, so the Berlin-based firm is holding mostly US dollars, short-term securities, and stocks for its desired run rate into 2027. Atai’s $5 million put would mean it is able to buy just over 59 BTC at its current price of around $84,300 and make it the world’s 52nd largest holder among public firms, according to Bitbo data . Bitcoin has struggled to keep afloat amid a wider market rout due to US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and fears of a US recession, which Trump hasn’t ruled out. Atai’s share price rose early in March 20 trading to a peak of $1.47 but tapered off to close the day down 1.44% at $1.37, according to Google Finance. Its stock has sunk nearly 93% from its mid-2021 public debut peak but is up 3% so far this year.

The announcement came in a video posted on social media platform X, where Garlinghouse noted the regulatory agency’s decision to end its pursuit of further litigation. Besides this interesting development, another major financial development has taken center stage in the crypto market in the past 24 hours; the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting. Fed Keeps Interest Rates Steady Amid Uncertainty The outcome of the latest Fed meeting can be divided into six key decisions. First, the Federal Reserve opted to maintain interest rates at their current level, keeping the borrowing rate in a range between 4.25% and 4.5% for the second consecutive meeting. This decision is part of a continued pause in the Fed’s tightening cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: 6 Key Events To Watch Out For In Crypto This Week Secondly, the Fed noted that uncertainty surrounding the economy has increased, and third, the Fed’s updated projections were the shift in expectations for rate cuts in 2025. The median forecast suggests 50 basis points of cuts for the year, but a growing number of Fed officials are less convinced that rate reductions will be necessary. In December, only one official anticipated no rate cuts in 2025. However, there’s now a more divided outlook, and that number has now risen to four, as noted in a post on social media platform X by analysts at The Kobeissi Letter. Beyond interest rates, the Fed revised its economic growth projections downward for 2025, suggesting that policymakers see slower expansion ahead. This adjustment comes alongside an increase in the Fed’s inflation forecast for the same period, reflecting concerns about price pressures persisting longer than previously anticipated. With inflation remaining a key focus, the central bank is treading carefully as it evaluates the right time to pivot toward a looser monetary stance. Fourthly, the Fed announced that it would slow the pace of its balance sheet runoff beginning in April. This is alongside a sharp reduction in the Fed’s 2025 growth projections and a markup in their 2025 inflation forecast. Implications For Crypto Markets And Digital Assets For the crypto industry, the Fed’s decision to hold rates steady and its mixed messaging on future cuts introduce a dynamic situation to Bitcoin and others. The fact that the Fed is still concerned about inflation and economic uncertainty shows that the path to more accommodative policies regarding the crypto industry may not be as smooth.

However, if the Fed stays hesitant to cut rates and economic growth slows as projected, digital assets may face headwinds later in the year, which may slow down the predicted growth by crypto analysts.

Ethereum rallied from the low $1,900s on Wednesday to nearly $2,100 and was last just below $2,000. The Fed slowed the pace of its quantitative tightening (QT) program on Wednesday, a strong signal to the market that a new liquidity wave is on the horizon, if not here just yet. BREAKING: FED SAYS QT ENDS APRIL 1ST. MONEY PRINTER IS COMING BACK. MASSIVELY BULLISH FOR BITCOIN! pic.twitter.com/b4MHNfwc9l — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) March 19, 2025 Liquidity in the financial system is the life blood for altcoins like Ethereum . And a lack of it since 2022 amid the Fed’s aggressive monetary tightening approach and quantitative tightening has hobbled growth in the altcoin market. While Bitcoin has been carried by narratives like the hugely successful 2024 ETF launch and its growing acceptance as “digital gold”, most major altcoins have struggled to keep pace. The lack of liquidity in the US financial system has meant that alt-coin seasons, like that in early 2024 and in wake of Trump’s election victory have disappointed. Indeed, a darkening of the macro backdrop as risks to US economic growth rise and inflation threatens to rebound has weighed heavily on the market in recent weeks. But the prospect of the end of QT and, eventually, the start of a new liquidity wave, could substantially lift the mood in the market. Could Ethereum soon rally back to record highs? Where Next for the Ethereum Price? While it has rallied a solid 13% from earlier monthly lows and snapped a short-term downtrend, Ethereum is yet to break back above its 21DMA. This is a level that has offered stiff resistance going pretty much all the way back to the start of 2025. That suggests price risks still remain titled to the downside in the short-term. Moreover, a more nuanced analysis of the macro backdrop also suggests risks remain tilted to the downside. Yes, the Fed is slowing QT and that means we are one big step closer to a new wave of liquidity. But a lot needs to happen first before that new wave of liquidity comes. Indeed, QE liquidity waves have always in the past followed some sort of crisis/market turmoil. And that might be exactly what we get in 2025 – the US economy is at risk of tilting into recession amid Trump’s trade wars and D.O.G.E austerity and the US government needs to refinance a massive $9 trillion of its debt. Things need to get a lot worse first before the Fed pulls the trigger on a new wave of money printing. That suggests that Ethereum potentially has a other further to drop in 2025, before QE sends it to the moon in 2026. That’s looking very far ahead. Savvy traders focused on the market’s short-term outlook should closely watch upcoming US economic data releases and trade war news. As well failing to reclaim its 21DMA, Ethereum has also so far failed to reclaim the long-term support-turned-resistance $2,100 level. Risks remain tilted towards a retest of mid-2023 lows around $1,500 before QE, and general crypto industry growth thanks to regulatory support from the Trump administration sends us to new all time highs in the coming years.

In a market filled with hype-driven projects, only a few bring real innovation to the table. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is one of those rare gems, introducing a deflationary mechanism that permanently removes unsold tokens, increasing scarcity and potential value. Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies like Comedian and AI Companions continue to generate excitement with strong trading volumes and investor interest. As the crypto market surges with new developments, Arctic Pablo Coin is leading the way with its presale success. This article will cover the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin, Comedian, and AI Companions, with a special focus on Arctic Pablo Coin’s token burn strategy and presale potential. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Game-Changing Token Burn Strategy A fundamental challenge for many meme coins is controlling supply. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) tackles this head-on with an aggressive token burn mechanism, ensuring a deflationary environment that strengthens its long-term value. Arctic Pablo Coin is in the Best New Meme Coins to Join Now. Unlike projects that simply hold unsold tokens, Arctic Pablo Coin permanently removes them from circulation every week during the presale. This reduction in supply enhances scarcity, potentially driving up value as demand increases. Additionally, any tokens left unsold after the presale will also be burned, ensuring that only actively purchased tokens remain in the ecosystem. These transactions are recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), offering full transparency and accountability. With supply shrinking each week, early adopters stand to benefit the most as fewer tokens remain available. This strategy not only protects investor interest but also builds long-term sustainability for the project. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: The Nippy Nook Stage is Here—Don’t Miss Out! Momentum is building fast for meme coin presale, which has now entered its 15th phase—Nippy Nook. With each phase, the price has steadily increased, rewarding early investors. At the current presale price of just $0.000079, those who seize the opportunity now could potentially see an ROI of over 10,027.85%, with the launch price set at $0.008. A $1,000 investment today would yield approximately 12,656,860 APCs. At the launch price of $0.008, that investment could grow to a staggering $101,254.88. With over $1.95 million already raised, Arctic Pablo Coin is gaining massive traction, and as it moves through different phases, the price will only go up. As new locations unlock, the entry price rises—securing APC at its current rate is a rare opportunity. The Arctic Pablo Coin presale is quickly approaching its final stages, and investors are rushing to grab their share before the price hikes again. Will you be part of this exclusive opportunity before it’s too late? Comedian’s Market Performance: A Strong Trading Volume Signals Interest As the meme coin market continues to expand, Comedian is attracting significant attention with its active trading. Currently priced at $0.0553, Comedian has achieved an impressive 24-hour trading volume of $21,378,383.15. This level of activity indicates strong investor confidence and liquidity, essential factors in sustaining long-term growth. Comedian’s rise demonstrates how niche-themed cryptocurrencies can capture the market’s imagination, further reinforcing the potential of meme-based projects. AI Companions Sees Stable Growth in the Crypto Market Artificial intelligence remains a hot trend, and AI Companions is leveraging that interest with its solid market presence. Priced at $0.2198, AI Companions has achieved a 24-hour trading volume of $3.89 million, signaling steady engagement from investors. With AI-driven projects gaining momentum, AI Companions continues to attract attention from those looking for the next breakthrough technology-backed crypto asset. Final thoughts: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Meme Coin Revolution The cryptocurrency market is witnessing exciting developments, with Comedian and AI Companions making waves in their respective categories. However, the spotlight remains on Arctic Pablo Coin, thanks to its game-changing token burn mechanism and skyrocketing presale performance. With the Nippy Nook phase in full swing and prices set to rise, this could be one of the most strategic entry points for those looking to invest in the next big meme coin sensation.

Despite a neutral 'Crypto Fear & Greed' index, Ethereum's Telegram and search interest remain low, indicating weak demand and user growth. Capital outflows from digital asset investment products are at record highs, with ETH ETFs seeing consistent net outflows, though Grayscale's mini trust shows modest growth. Given the poor Q1 performance and challenging technical setup, I see no compelling reason to be long ETH despite its low expense ratio. As the market quickly closes in on the end of the first quarter of the year, it has been a rough start to 2025 for Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) to say the least. Down nearly 40% year to date, ETH's recent performance is actually even worse when going back to mid-December: Data by YCharts On December 16th, ETH came within $45 of $4k per coin. In less than three months, ETH's price had fallen by more than 57% percent from the peak in December. Is there any reason for Ethereum holders to exhibit optimism? In this Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ( ETH ) article, we'll look at market sentiment, capital flows in the market, and the technical setup for ETH that I'm currently seeing. Market Sentiment For those who want a more fundamental update to Ethereum's network usage, I'd invite readers to check out my iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (NASDAQ: ETHA ) article from early-March. In that piece, I went over the network usage and fee metrics for the blockchain through February. Very little has changed in that regard through the first few weeks of March. Despite the lack of growth in network fees, market sentiment more broadly appears to be improving: Crypto Fear and Greed Index (TrendSpider) At a 49 reading in the 'Crypto Fear & Greed' index on March 20th, market sentiment is showing a swift spike out of bearish territory and puts the overall market sentiment at 'neutral.' For Ethereum specifically, indications are much less rosy: IntoTheBlock Telegram Sentiment - derived from machine learning connotation analysis of Telegram messages by token - is showing very little interest in Ethereum through Telegram going back to December. This could certainly be more indicative of declining Telegram usage than anything else, as Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) Telegram Sentiment trends look fairly similar to the chart above. That said, search interest from the general public also shows declining interest over time: Ethereum Search Interest (Google Trends) Worldwide search data for 'Ethereum' shows broad declines in 'interest over time' over the last five years. The index reading for this search interest data has been under 20 since Ethereum's price peak in December. This does not seem indicative of what would be expected with robust demand and user growth. To be sure, it has been capital flows rather than utility truly driving this market for a while. US ETF Supply & Capital Flows Through March 14th 2025, digital asset investment products have seen the worst five week outflow streak on record: CoinShares After another $1.7 billion came out of cryptocurrency investment products last week, the month to date net flow is negative by nearly $2.7 billion and the total net flow over the last five weeks is negative by $6.4 billion. The asset class is dangerously close to negative net flows year to date, and one more week like the one we had through March 14th would do the trick. The early indications through Wednesday do indeed look a bit better. Data tracked by Farside Investors shows nearly $500 million in BTC ETF demand. Ethereum has not been so lucky: Net Flows BTC ETFs ETH ETFs 17 Mar 2025 $274.6 -$7.3 18 Mar 2025 $209.1 -$52.8 19 Mar 2025 $11.8 -$11.7 3 Day Sum $495.5 -$71.8 Source: Farside Investors, $ in millions Ethereum ETFs have seen net outflow each of the first three days during the week of March 17th. The Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust has seen $17 million in single week outflow through March 19th. However, the overall trend in ETH supply held through the fund remains positive: ETH Coin Supply Trend (TheBlock) At 462.6k ETH-USD held through the fund, Grayscale's mini trust has grown ETH token supply by 1.7% year to date. From an expense ratio standpoint, ETH is the standout in the market with an annual fee of just 15 basis points. The Block The fund is also top four regarding the share of spot ETF volume. ETH has actually seen this grow in recent weeks with share of volume eclipsing 10% every session since March 12th. That said, ETH share of spot ETF volume is still well off highs from late last year. At that time, the fund often had a share of volume in excess of 20%. Additional Considerations As we approach the end of March, we can look at the Q2 seasonality implications for Ethereum. April has historically been the best month for ETH based purely on mean change: ETH Seasonality (TrendSpider) Going back to 2016, Ethereum's mean change in April is 26% and the coin has made a positive return 75% of the time. Though we shouldn't gloss over the fact that Q1 should have been a terrific quarter for ETH based on past seasonality trends as well - and the actual performance between January and March turned out to be quite horrible. My interpretation of Ethereum's technical setup is indecisive: ETH-USD Weekly (TrendSpider) On one hand, we can see the coin hanging on to the 300-week moving average for dear life. On the other hand, I see $2,100 per coin serving as support on weekly closes going back to late 2023. That level was breached on a close the week of March 3rd, failed a back test the week of March 10th, and is currently still under that key level as of article submission on March 20th. I, personally, would not entertain taking a stab at that trade from the long side until we see the coin take back $2,100 on a weekly close. It's entirely possible that the breakdown the week of March 3rd is a fake out and the 300-week MA will indeed hold as support. But at this point, that would just be a guess and not one that I'm going to make today. Closing Summary You could talk me into the merits of a technical bounce for ETH, given how aggressive the selloff has been over the last three months. I find it particularly interesting that investment capital flow for the asset is now quite competitive with that of Bitcoin's year to date. But bear in mind, this is largely coming with net outflows over the last several weeks, and Bitcoin has simply been hit harder in this regard than Ethereum has. The year-to-date investment flows could easily flip to negative if the week of March 17th mirrors what we have been seeing over the last month. While sentiment figures have indeed improved when observed through the 'Crypto Fear & Greed' index, I think the lack of interest in Ethereum through platforms like Telegram and Google Search are fairly troubling. In a way, we have the market we deserve in crypto right now. Usage and user interest are not what have been generally driving coin price action. Rather, capital flows from speculators who expect to sell to someone else at a higher price continue to drive gains (and losses). For tax-advantaged exposure to ETH, traders can do a lot worse than the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF at a 0.15% expense ratio. But at this point, I still don't see a compelling reason to be long ETH based on any fundamental trends. Furthermore, I think the technical setup has challenges. Even though Q1 was a really bad quarter for ETH, it can always get worse!",ETH-USD|ETH,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-21 02:54:44

Per the South Korean media outlets Jeju Sori and Newsis , the a branch of the Jeju District Court, on the island province of Jeju, rejected an appeal from the teacher – unnamed and aged in their 30s. South Korean Teacher Jailed for Two Years The court ordered the teacher to serve two years in jail, after hearing they had stolen 80 million won ($54,500) and spent most of the money on unnamed cryptoassets. The headquarters of the Jeju Provincial Police agency in Jeju, South Korea. (Source: Yonhap News TV/Screenshot) The court heard that the teacher “embezzled” the money from students and their parents, as well as “fraudulently selling second-hand goods” in an “online scam” worth approximately 7 million won ($4,770). The court dismissed the defendant’s appeal, noting that the judge in the teacher’s previous trial had already “taken the defendant’s remorse into account.” The teacher’s legal team had also argued that the defendant had “paid back” part of the money stolen from the students. But the appellate court said there was “no reason to take this into consideration in sentencing,” as the original court verdict, in November last year, had already done so.

The court heard that the defendant worked as a teacher at a high school in Jeju, where they began stealing money in March last year. The prosecution explained that the teacher had discovered that some of their students had “financial problems.” The teacher then deceived the students by saying that they would resolve these problems, taking funds from students and their parents alike.

With increasing adoption and community-driven hype, DOGE remains a strong contender in the crypto market. However, its large supply and reliance on speculative interest make such a surge challenging. Meanwhile, emerging projects with lower market caps and strong fundamentals are gaining attention as potential alternatives. Lightchain AI has already raised over $17.9 million at a presale price of $0.007 , positioning itself as a high-growth AI-powered blockchain asset. As investors seek opportunities beyond traditional meme coins, newer tokens with innovative use cases may reach key price milestones before DOGE. This article explores whether Dogecoin can hit $2 or if another crypto will achieve it first. Dogecoin’s Bullish Momentum and Community Support One of the strongest aspects of Dogecoin (DOGE) is its very active community and the continued growth in the market, which leads to sudden rises. In these few years, DOGE has been able to maintain the upswings during bull trends notwithstanding the fact that that is frequently based on attracting people from social media platforms, celebrities or getting a place on the major exchanges list. Thus, its supporters can effectively increase trading volume and as a result, it is one of the most lasting meme coins in the market. Nevertheless, it is the major issue of the large circulation S1of DOGE that the price spikes result in that challenges the issue of long-term growth. Positive attitudes can remain in the case when $2 would be expected with the help of an inflow of money, whole market support and, therefore, the need for broader market momentum. It is uncertain whether its tribe-inspired vigor is strong enough to lift DOGE to uncharted territories or if investors will choose coins with better fundamentals and lower market capitalization. Could Lightchain AI Overtake DOGE in the Race to $2? Lightchain AI is rapidly emerging as a strong competitor in the crypto market, raising the question of whether it could reach $2 before Dogecoin (DOGE). While DOGE has an established community and historical price surges, its large supply makes substantial price increases challenging. In contrast, Lightchain AI’s AI-powered blockchain model is attracting investors looking for innovation and real-world utility. With growing adoption and increasing interest in AI-driven cryptocurrencies, Lightchain AI has the potential to see faster price appreciation due to its lower market cap and strong fundamentals. Unlike DOGE, which relies heavily on social media-driven hype, Lightchain AI offers practical applications that could sustain long-term growth. As investors explore alternatives beyond meme coins, Lightchain AI’s momentum could position it as a leading candidate to hit $2 before Dogecoin. Which Will Reach $2 First, DOGE or Lightchain AI? The race to $2 between Dogecoin (DOGE) and Lightchain AI presents two very different investment narratives. DOGE, backed by a strong community and historical price surges, relies heavily on market sentiment and social media-driven hype. However, its large circulating supply makes a rapid move to $2 difficult without significant institutional backing. On the other hand, Lightchain AI, an emerging AI-powered blockchain project, is gaining traction due to its real-world utility and growing adoption. With increasing interest in AI-integrated cryptocurrencies, Lightchain AI’s lower market cap gives it the potential for faster price appreciation compared to DOGE. While Dogecoin remains a popular choice among retail investors, Lightchain AI’s innovative approach and strong fundamentals may give it a competitive edge in reaching the $2 milestone first. The coming months will determine which asset prevails. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-21 03:00:00

This comes just weeks after President Trump teamed up with Elon Musk to cut government agencies, which led to thousands of USAID job losses and the elimination of most foreign aid contracts. According to Politico , Trump wants to shrink USAID and focus it on global health, food security, disaster response, and countering China. The proposal argues that current development programs are “inefficient and fragmented,” spread too thin across too many sectors and countries, which leads to poor results. Trump To Rebuild Under His Image Trump’s plan aims to focus on areas crucial to U.S. interests, like promoting peace, stability, and economic opportunities that benefit American businesses. It also targets global threats, such as pandemics. The proposal suggests that all aid programs should have clear end dates and be closely measured for success. After significantly reducing the 60-year-old agency, Trump aims to rebuild it under his image. Agency To Leverage Blockchain Tech According to a memo circulating among State Department staff and reviewed by WIRED, the Trump administration plans to rename the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as US International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA), and to bring it directly under the secretary of state. The document states that as part of its reorganization, the agency will “leverage blockchain technology” as part of its procurement process. The agency will use blockchain technology to improve security, transparency, and traceability in its aid distribution. However, it’s unclear whether this will involve cryptocurrency, stablecoins, or simply using blockchain to track aid. The memo comes as USAID staff are uncertain about the agency’s future. USAID was a major target of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk. After President Trump’s inauguration, the State Department placed all USAID staff on administrative leave, cut the workforce, and halted some payments to global partners, including those providing lifesaving aid. Is It Unnecessary? According to Linda Raftree, a consultant helping humanitarian groups adopt new tech, few blockchain projects have succeeded in the sector because the technology is often unnecessary. “It feels like a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist,” she says, noting that in most cases, existing tools could do the job just as well. Besides, Giulio Coppi from Access Now says blockchain offers no clear advantages over other tools like payment systems, and its promotion as a “tech solution” has shown little real impact. Critics Argue Over Flexibility However, Blockchain technology has seen some success in the humanitarian sector, such as the UNHCR’s pilot project providing stablecoins to Ukrainians and trials by the Kenya Red Cross. While blockchain can make money transfers faster and easier, it also introduces new burdens for small NGOs. The proposed adoption of blockchain at USAID aims to tie funding to results, but some employees argue this approach may not be flexible enough in disaster or conflict zones. Critics, like Linda Raftree, feel this push supports claims of corruption within USAID, even though the agency already pays based on completed work.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|REGULATION|ASIA|DOGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-21 03:24:40

The impersonation scam involves the fraudsters sending out messages through text and encrypted messaging platforms by impersonating a Binance representative, telling users of a crypto account breach and instructing them to set up a new wallet, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) said in a March 21 statement. The text messages look real at first glance because they appear in the same legitimate text message thread as Binance communications. Australia’s federal police say they have found at least 130 people who have been targeted by this scam so far. Source: Australian federal police “The messages allegedly contained fake verification codes and were often ‘spoofed,' meaning they appeared in a legitimate existing message thread from the well-known cryptocurrency exchange,” the AFP said. “A support phone number was also sent, but when the targets called it, they were instructed to protect their accounts by transferring their cryptocurrency to a ‘trust wallet,' which was controlled by the scammer and allowed the assets to be stolen.” Online text messaging services allow messages to be sent from a Sender ID, such as a company name, rather than a phone number and can be exploited to spoof text messages, according to a March 1, 2019 report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Once a phone receives the sham communication, it’s reportedly grouped based on the Sender ID, appearing in the same thread as other messages with the same ID. The AFP says it conducted an email and text blitz to warn the 130 people they identified who might have been exposed to this scam. AFP Commander Cybercrime Operations Graeme Marshall said once the funds are transferred to the thief’s wallet , they are quickly transferred through a network of wallets, making seizure or recovery difficult. The attack mimics another string of scam messages reported by X users on March 14 , where fraudulent emails spoofing Coinbase and Gemini attempted to trick users into setting up a new wallet using pre-generated recovery phrases controlled by scammers. Related: Australia’s ‘Barefoot Investor’ takes on crypto scammers stealing his likeness The police said red flags for this type of scam include unsolicited contact from someone claiming to be from Binance about an account breach, pressure to act quickly and prompts for a seed phrase . Binance Chief Security Officer Jimmy Su said in the AFP statement scammers often impersonate trusted platforms , exploiting certain telecom loopholes to manipulate sender names and phone numbers. Su says Binance has a tool to confirm official Binance channels, and if in doubt, “stop and verify through official sources,” such as the contact information on the official website. Source: Binance Australia In December last year, the Australian government announced plans for an SMS Sender ID Register and an enforceable industry standard to crack down on similar scams, which have impacted Australian airline Qantas and tech giant Apple in the past. Under the standard, telecom companies must determine whether messages sent under a brand name correspond with the legitimate registered sender and submit and provide their legitimate Sender IDs for the register. The register is set to launch in late 2025, with a pilot SMS Sender ID Register operating as a stopgap in the meantime, according to Australia’s minister for communications, Michelle Rowland. In August last year, the AFP revealed that a total of 382 million Australian dollars ($269 million) had been lost by Australians to investment scams during the previous 12 months, with around 47% of them being crypto-related.

This hearing is happening in Washington, and if confirmed, Atkins would replace Mark Uyeda, who’s been holding the seat in an acting capacity since January. Atkins previously served as an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008. After his time at the agency, he founded Patomak Global Partners, a consulting firm based in Washington, D.C. His return to the SEC comes at a time when the agency is already in the middle of major changes, many of which affect the crypto industry. If confirmed, Atkins is expected to pull back enforcement actions and make it easier for private companies to go public. Senate to review crypto-related nominees alongside Atkins The confirmation hearing won’t just be about Atkins. The Senate panel is also reviewing Jonathan Gould, a partner at Jones Day, who is being nominated to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Gould previously worked as chief counsel and senior deputy comptroller at the OCC before joining the law firm. The committee will also consider Luke Pettit, who has been nominated to be the assistant secretary for financial institutions at the U.S. Treasury Department. The focus is mainly on Atkins because of the SEC’s new direction, especially when it comes to crypto. Acting chair Uyeda has already rolled out a number of changes this year while Atkins waits for confirmation. Since January, the SEC has dropped more than 10 crypto-enforcement cases, including ones involving Kraken, Gemini, Robinhood, and TRON. The agency has also ended litigation tied to climate-reporting rules and allowed companies to easily block shareholder proposals they don’t like. Another big update came this week when the SEC stopped pursuing its appeal in the lawsuit against Ripple. The case has dragged on for four years and three months, according to Brad Garlinghouse, the company’s CEO. He said on Wednesday during the Digital Assets Summit in New York, “It’s been almost four years and about three months since the SEC originally sued us, certainly a painful journey in lots of ways.” He added, “I really deeply believed that we were going to be on the right side of the law and on the right side of history.” Garlinghouse didn’t hold back. He told the crowd, “The system just feels broken. That we had to fight this fight for the industry and you had an SEC attacking the industry, particularly the Ripple case. There were no victims, there was no investor loss. They were just not acting in good faith.” After the announcement, XRP spiked 10%, bringing the price to $2.49. This is the latest in a string of enforcement rollbacks by the SEC in 2025. None of the companies involved—Kraken, Gemini, Robinhood, or TRON—had to pay penalties in the dropped cases. Also on Thursday, the SEC publicly confirmed that Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining does not fall under U.S. securities laws. That applies to activity on networks like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance issued a formal clarification saying that PoW mining doesn’t meet the Howey Test, meaning it’s not considered an investment contract and doesn’t require registration under the Securities Act. The clarification only applies to public blockchain networks and only to mining-related activities. The commission stated that individuals and mining pools don’t need to register any transactions connected to mining. This move gives miners legal clarity for the first time and removes the fear of being hit with securities violations just for operating rigs. This news came after the SEC confirmed that memecoins do not count as securities. That stance, combined with the dismissal of crypto-related enforcement cases and the latest confirmation on PoW mining, signals a full 180 on how the SEC is handling crypto under Uyeda—and potentially under Atkins, too. If the Senate confirms Atkins, he’s expected to continue this path. That includes cutting back enforcement, making IPO approvals faster, and writing clear rules for crypto instead of just suing companies. Every action this year points to a lighter, rule-based approach, not the old strategy of regulation through lawsuits. With Atkins’ background in financial consulting, his time at the SEC and the fact that he’s been a Bitcoin investor since 2011, he’s seen as someone who understands how the agency works from the inside. But this time, his job won’t be to keep it running. It’ll be to change it—and fast. The Senate hearing on March 27 will determine whether that plan moves forward.

It’s built on blockchain technology, offering a decentralized alternative to TradFi (traditional financial) services. From lending and borrowing to DEXs (decentralized exchanges) and yield farming, DeFi aims to democratize finance, making it more accessible, efficient and transparent. In this guest post, we’ll explore what DeFi is, the key innovations driving its growth, the challenges it faces and what the future holds for the DeFi ecosystem. What is DeFi DeFi refers to a set of financial services built on blockchain platforms, particularly Ethereum , which operate without the need for traditional intermediaries like banks, brokers or payment processors. These services are powered by smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code and are accessible to anyone with an internet connection. DeFi includes applications such as the following. Lending and borrowing platforms – Where users can earn interest by lending their cryptocurrency and borrowing at competitive rates DEXs – Where users can trade cryptocurrencies directly without the need for intermediaries Stablecoins – Cryptocurrencies that are pegged to stable assets like the US Dollar, providing stability in the volatile world of crypto Yield farming – T he process of earning rewards by providing liquidity to DEXs or other platforms. Unlike traditional finance, DeFi platforms are open to everyone, eliminating the need for intermediaries, which reduces costs and increases access to financial services for millions of people worldwide. The key innovations behind DeFi Several key innovations are driving the growth of DeFi and are likely to define its future. 1. Smart contracts Smart contracts are the backbone of DeFi. These contracts automatically execute, enforce or verify the terms of a contract when predefined conditions are met, removing the need for a trusted intermediary. They allow financial agreements to be executed with complete transparency and security, without relying on banks or financial institutions. Smart contracts have enabled the rise of decentralized lending, borrowing and automated market-making. 2. Liquidity pools Liquidity pools are essential to the functioning of decentralized exchanges. They allow users to collect their tokens into a pool and earn a share of the trading fees in return. This decentralized method of creating liquidity has greatly improved the accessibility and functionality of DEXs, ensuring that users can trade assets without waiting for buyers or sellers. 3. DAOs (Decentralized autonomous organizations) DAOs are governance structures that enable the decentralized management of DeFi protocols. Through DAOs, token holders can vote on important decisions, including protocol upgrades, fee structures and treasury management. This innovative approach ensures that decisions are made collectively and transparently – in line with the interests of the community. 4. Stablecoins Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to a stable asset, such as the US Dollar or gold, to maintain a stable value. They address one of the main concerns about cryptocurrencies – their volatility. By using stablecoins, users can store value, make transactions, and interact with DeFi protocols while avoiding the price fluctuations of typical cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The challenges faced by DeFi While DeFi has immense potential, it’s not without its challenges. Here are some key obstacles it faces. 1. Security risks DeFi protocols are primarily driven by smart contracts, and while these contracts are designed to be secure, vulnerabilities can still be exploited. High-profile hacks and bugs in code have resulted in the loss of millions of dollars in user funds. This makes the space risky, especially for newcomers who may not fully understand the technical nuances. 2. Regulatory uncertainty Since DeFi operates outside traditional financial institutions, it faces regulatory challenges. Governments around the world are still grappling with how to regulate DeFi activities, such as lending, borrowing and trading, especially given the cross-border nature of the ecosystem. The regulatory environment will likely evolve, and how regulators approach DeFi could have a significant impact on its future growth. 3. Scalability issues Currently, many DeFi applications run on the Ethereum blockchain, which, while highly secure, is often criticized for being slow and expensive, especially during periods of high demand. While Ethereum 2.0 aims to address these issues by shifting to a PoS (proof-of-stake) consensus mechanism, scalability remains a critical challenge that will need to be addressed for DeFi to achieve widespread adoption. The future of DeFi The future of DeFi is incredibly promising, and several key developments are likely to shape its evolution. 1. Interoperability between blockchains One of the biggest limitations of DeFi today is that most applications are confined to the Ethereum blockchain. However, interoperability between blockchains is improving, allowing DeFi protocols to expand across multiple networks, such as Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain and Avalanche. This will enable DeFi to grow in terms of both accessibility and liquidity. 2. Layer-two solutions To address scalability issues, layer-two solutions such as Optimism, Arbitrum and Polygon are already helping to scale DeFi by providing faster and cheaper transactions while still relying on the security of the Ethereum network. As these solutions mature, we can expect DeFi applications to become more efficient, leading to greater adoption. 3. Institutional participation As DeFi continues to grow, we can expect more institutional players to enter the space. Institutional investors, hedge funds and traditional financial institutions are already exploring DeFi as an alternative investment and lending vehicle. This could bring a wave of new capital into the space, further accelerating growth. 4. Improved security protocols As the DeFi space matures, security will become even more critical. Developers and security experts will work on improving the security of smart contracts and creating more robust auditing and monitoring tools to prevent hacks and fraud. Increased collaboration with cybersecurity firms will be essential for building trust in DeFi. Conclusion The rise of DeFi has opened up new possibilities for users to take control of their financial assets without relying on centralized intermediaries. With innovations like smart contracts, liquidity pools and stablecoins, DeFi is poised to revolutionize traditional financial systems. However, challenges such as security risks, regulatory uncertainty and scalability issues remain, and these must be addressed for DeFi to reach its full potential. The future of DeFi looks bright, with greater interoperability, institutional participation and improved security protocols on the horizon. As the space continues to evolve, the potential for DeFi to democratize finance and create a more inclusive financial ecosystem is immense. It’s an exciting time to be involved in the world of DeFi, and its impact on the financial sector will only continue to grow.

As of recent market data, Pi has lost more than 18% in the last 24 hours, raising concerns among investors. If PI fails to maintain its $0.95 support level, further declines could push the coin to as low as $0.87. On the other hand, a shift in sentiment could see it rise back to $1.34 and beyond, but bulls face a difficult challenge to regain momentum. Why is Pi Coin Falling? Several factors have contributed to Pi Coin’s sharp decline in value, and the situation has left investors scrambling for answers. Binance and Coinbase Listing Failures A factor behind Pi’s downfall is the delay in listing the coin on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Both platforms previously teased the possibility of listing PI, sparking speculation and optimism among investors. However, the failure of these listings to materialize has dampened sentiment, leading to a drop in demand for Pi Coin. The lack of official exchange listings has left many to question the coin’s future and viability in the broader market. Decreasing Supply and Deflationary Pressures Although Pi Network has not formally announced a coin burn, the supply of Pi is steadily shrinking. Several mechanisms have contributed to this decrease: Transaction Fees : Pi’s transaction fees are burned permanently, with over 528,671 PI tokens burned by early March at a rate of 3,000–4,000 tokens daily. While this may sound beneficial from a supply reduction perspective, the deflationary pressure has not been enough to offset the broader market sentiment surrounding the coin. Unverified Accounts : Tokens held by users who missed the Know Your Customer (KYC) deadline have been burned, further reducing the coin’s total supply. As of now, the circulating supply stands at approximately 6.8 billion PI tokens. These measures aim to address fake and abandoned accounts, but they have also intensified the perception of a decreasing supply. Investor Sentiment: FUD or a Genuine Concern? The drop in Pi Coin’s value has sparked widespread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the market. Sentiment has worsened by 80% within a single day, with some users even claiming “manipulation” and “panic” selling. Trading volume has decreased by 37%, signaling a reduction in market activity.",Short News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-21 03:46:11

This marks a 2.7% increase in the past week, slowly recovering from previous losses. While the broader market remains cautious, investors appear to now be closely monitoring whether BTC can sustain its upward trend or if further corrections are on the horizon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Transfer Count Lowest Since 2023—Is This Bearish? Bitcoin Bullish Indicators Emerges Amid the ongoing Bitcoin price movement, CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan has provided insights into the current market structure. In a recent post titled “Past Bull Cycle vs. Current Market”, Dan examined the similarities between previous market cycles and the present conditions. He highlighted that while bear market phases often feel like prolonged downturns, they also present key accumulation opportunities. Dan explained that in past market cycles, significant stop-loss movements signaled major sell-offs, leading to prolonged bearish sentiment. However, in the current cycle, such massive liquidations have not occurred, and Bitcoin’s recent drop remains within the standard 30% correction range. He noted that while some fear the onset of a bear market, broader macroeconomic trends suggest that the bull cycle is still intact. “과거 상승사이클과 현재 시장” 암호화폐 시장의 하락사이클에서는 첫번째 지표처럼 엄청난 크기의 손절의 움직임이 여러번 나옵니다. 누가봐도 하락사이클로 인식이 되고 시장이 망했다는 생각이 들 정도가 됩니다. 그리고 그 최악의 구간은 약 1년간 지속됩니다. 하지만 그 최악의 구간에서… pic.twitter.com/eQvd7yA2rn — Crypto Dan (@DanCoinInvestor) March 20, 2025 The analyst further pointed out that short-term uncertainties, such as geopolitical tensions and trade disputes, may be influencing market sentiment. However, once these factors subside, the market could see a strong rally. The analyst noted: Uncertainty in the market is an unavoidable element that will always accompany the investment landscape. Therefore, we analyze and respond to the market while managing risk. Exchange Outflows Indicate Re-Accumulation Another CryptoQuant analyst, CryptoOnCain, provided additional insight by highlighting Bitcoin’s highest exchange outflow on a 90-day moving average since January 2023. This data suggests that Bitcoin is being withdrawn from exchanges at a rapid pace, a sign that investors could be accumulating BTC rather than preparing to sell. Historically, such significant outflows have preceded bullish moves, as reduced exchange supply tends to create upward pressure on price. Related Reading: The Fed Blinked — The Bitcoin Bull Run Return Is Now Inevitable The analyst noted that a similar pattern was observed in early 2023 when Bitcoin hit its lowest price in that cycle before rallying. If this trend continues, it could indicate a shift toward stronger market confidence in BTC’s long-term potential.

U.S. markets are falling across the board while funds chase returns in countries most investors have stopped paying attention to. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) is up more than 7% this year, and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA), which tracks developed markets outside North America, has jumped over 11%. At the same time, all three major U.S. indexes are down. The Nasdaq Composite has fallen into correction territory. The S&P 500 briefly dropped into correction, too. The Russell 2000, which covers smaller U.S. companies, is almost in a bear market with a drop nearing 20% from its recent high. Investors started backing away from U.S. stocks as Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies bounced between threats and backpedals. That shook confidence in both consumers and businesses. The market saw it clearly. Big firms started warning clients that the U.S. was no longer the safest play. Citigroup, Bank of America, HSBC, and BCA pull back on U.S. bets Citigroup cut its U.S. stock rating from overweight to neutral earlier this month. Dirk Willer, one of their strategists, told clients, “The news flow from the U.S. economy is likely to undershoot the [rest of the world] in coming months, and at least tactically, U.S. exceptionalism is therefore unlikely to roar back.” That’s straight from their client note. Michael Hartnett at Bank of America had already warned in January that U.S. strength was topping out. He pointed to falling fiscal stimulus and a fading edge over other markets. HSBC and BCA Research also lowered their views on the U.S. around the same time. Nobody’s calling it safe anymore. Jeremy Folsom, an analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, broke it down in a research note this week. “While U.S. stocks have performed well in recent history, investors who remain concentrated within just a single market may leave their portfolios vulnerable to country-specific risks, such as shifts in political regimes and other idiosyncratic factors,” he wrote. Jeremy added, “We have encouraged investors to remain invested in developed market (DM) equities, given the attractive valuations, and emerging market (EM) equities, for potential growth. We believe that both can help to provide diversification to portfolios.” Germany rallies as Trump threatens NATO, and China jumps on defense boost Investors aren’t just running from the U.S. They’re finding reasons to go long in places like Germany and China. Germany’s DAX index is up more than 15% in 2025. That came after the German government approved new spending on infrastructure and defense. Why? Because Trump signaled that he might pull back U.S. support for NATO. According to NBC News, the Trump administration is considering stepping away from NATO command, a role the U.S. has held since Eisenhower. That kind of move has major consequences, and investors are watching every headline. With Germany approving more military and public spending, investors think the country could finally break out of its long slump. Germany just barely avoided recession in 2023 and 2024. The country’s move to spend more has started lifting market sentiment. The STOXX Europe 600, which tracks European stocks more broadly, is also up about 9% this year, mostly thanks to the rally in Germany. Trevor Yates at Global X said this will likely reach more parts of the economy. “I think it’ll have kind of a trickle-down effect on the rest of the economy and then different sectors as well. It will affect consumers, I think, down the line as well, just given how much pressure they’ve been over the past couple years.” Trevor also said Global X is telling investors to look at group-based strategies like ETFs because “the whole economy should see these benefits.” Over in China, stocks are soaring even faster. The iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) has gained around 21% in 2025. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI) is up more than 22%. Investors are coming back after Beijing approved a 7.2% increase in defense spending to “firmly safeguard” national security. The rally also got a push from rising interest in DeepSeek, which helped bring investors back to Chinese tech and innovation. The possible return of Trump tariffs has added fuel to these global markets. Investors don’t think the tariffs are just a bluff this time. They’re starting to act like real policy. That means the trade system could be changing fast. And Wall Street is not waiting around to find out how bad it gets. Analysts warn of deeper realignment if U.S. economy stumbles Katie Stockton at Fairlead Strategies said international stocks could keep outperforming the U.S. this year. “We do think that international markets have the potential to do better than the U.S. for much of this year,” Katie said. “That doesn’t mean they’re buys right here and now, but perhaps somewhere, people might want to build some relative exposure into the next downdraft and develop global Europe versus US.” Dario Perkins at TS Lombard wrote a note titled “Is the U.S. now uninvestable.” That’s the tone right now. Dario wrote, “Three months ago, investors were convinced that Trump 2.0 would make a bad situation in Europe and China even worse. Instead, Trump has become a catalyst for big policy changes.” He said both Germany and China had already responded and more countries would follow. “It is still early days, and there may be setbacks, but these policy shifts could mark the start of a major realignment in international trade and a genuine rebalancing of global demand.” But he ended with a warning: “Make no mistake – a US recession would bring down the entire world.” That’s where things stand. Trump’s policies are causing global money to move. Countries that used to get ignored are now pulling in capital. This isn’t some short-term strategy. It’s the result of economic data, policy moves, and hard numbers. No one’s calling the U.S. uninvestable yet, but they’re clearly not betting on it anymore. And if Trump keeps pushing on trade and defense, expect the money to keep flowing out. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The SEC has decided not to pursue further legal action, confirming that Ripple is no longer under threat from the regulatory body. This decision has had an immediate impact on XRP’s price, which surged following the announcement. The legal saga, which began with the SEC’s claim that Ripple violated securities laws by selling XRP, has been a major point of contention in the cryptocurrency space. Despite a series of favorable rulings for Ripple, the SEC continued to appeal in January 2024, even after the resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. The ongoing legal challenges frustrated Ripple and its supporters, especially since the court had already ruled in Ripple’s favor, declaring that XRP is not a security. Where Is The Official SEC Statement? While Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC seems to have come to an end, some are still waiting for the official word from the SEC itself. A user raised a valid point, questioning why there hasn’t been an official statement yet from the SEC about dropping the appeal against Ripple. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett responded, explaining that the SEC still needs to formally approve the withdrawal of its appeal. Once the Commission gives the green light, they can expect a press release similar to the one issued earlier this year when the SEC dismissed its lawsuit against Coinbase. https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1902806790254817454 Terrett added that the SEC typically addresses matters of litigation and enforcement during their closed meetings.

Paul Atkins, a known supporter of digital assets, is set to appear before the Senate Banking Committee on March 27 for his confirmation hearing. If approved, he could take over as SEC Chair as early as April. His nomination signals a big shift from the tough enforcement approach seen under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. A New Era for Crypto Regulation? Eleanor Terrett reports that Donald Trump’s SEC Chair nominee, Paul Atkins, is set to face the Senate Banking Committee for his nomination hearing next Thursday. Alongside him, Jonathan Gould, Trump’s pick for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), will also have his hearing. However, Atkins is no stranger to the SEC—he’s served as a commissioner before and has spent years advising on financial compliance. Unlike past regulators, he believes in a more balanced approach to crypto oversight, focusing on growth rather than aggressive crackdowns. The SEC’s Softened Approach Since stepping in on January 20, Interim Chair Mark Uyeda has made big moves that have given the crypto industry some breathing room. A crypto task force, led by Republican SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, was formed last month to address key regulatory issues, including defining which crypto assets qualify as securities. Several lawsuits against major platforms—like Coinbase, Uniswap, Robinhood Crypto, OpenSea, and Kraken—have been dropped. And just this week, the SEC finally closed its long-running case against Ripple, removing one of the biggest regulatory threats to XRP. Meanwhile, the agency is also reviewing over 60 spot crypto ETF proposals, signaling potential shifts in its approach to crypto regulation. Trump’s Crypto Push Atkins isn’t the only sign of change. President Trump has been pushing a more crypto-friendly agenda, recently signing an executive order to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Some experts believe this reserve could soon expand to include altcoins like XRP, signaling broader government acceptance of digital assets. Warnings from Experts Not everyone is on board with the SEC’s restructuring. According to a Bloomberg report , legal and academic experts are raising alarms over the SEC’s restructuring, warning that major staff and leadership cuts could weaken investor protection and market stability. A group of top academics, including Joel Seligman, compared the situation to the period before the 2008 financial crisis when weak oversight led to market failures. They fear that if the SEC loses its grip to enforce regulations, bad actors in the financial markets could take advantage, putting investors at greater risk.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-21 05:08:45

The exchange wants clear rules that distinguish digital assets from traditional securities and is urging Congress to take the lead in defining regulatory boundaries. The Call for Clearer Rules It’s a new day for crypto in America: White House Crypto Summit Overwhelming bipartisan support in the House and Senate to repeal the DeFi broker rule Big steps by the bank regulators to end Operation Choke Point 2.0 Bipartisan stablecoin framework bill advanced out… — Faryar Shirzad (@faryarshirzad) March 20, 2025 SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce recently asked for industry input on crypto regulations, and Coinbase responded with a detailed roadmap. The exchange argues that the SEC’s current approach creates uncertainty, making it difficult for businesses and investors to navigate the space. According to Coinbase’s chief policy officer, Faryar Shirzad, a well-structured and transparent framework will provide certainty for developers, clear guidelines for industry players, and strong protections for investors. Shirzad praised Ripple for securing a huge legal victory against the SEC. He congratulated CEO Brad Garlinghouse and legal head Stuart Alderoty for standing their ground. He pointed out that the SEC dropping its appeal confirms a key legal point—crypto tokens themselves aren’t investment contracts. Shirzad slammed Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler for misleading the public on this for years, saying Ripple’s fight has finally cleared things up. Now, he says it’s time for Congress to step in and create proper rules for crypto. He credited Ripple for pushing the law forward and helping bring clarity to the industry. Separating Crypto from Traditional Securities In his blog post he addressed one of the key issues of SEC’s classification theory and how digital assets are classified. It believes that cryptocurrencies that don’t represent ownership in a business should be treated as commodities, not securities. This distinction is crucial because it would allow financial markets to integrate blockchain-based assets more smoothly, improving liquidity and efficiency. Plus, Coinbase is pushing back against the SEC’s stance that secondary market sales of digital commodities should be considered securities transactions. It argues that once an asset is in circulation, its trades should not fall under securities laws, making it easier for crypto assets to move freely in the market. Congress Should Take the Lead Coinbase also believes that broader crypto regulations shouldn’t be left solely to the SEC. Instead, it’s calling on Congress to set the foundation for how digital assets are governed. The exchange argues that lawmakers, not regulators, should define the boundaries and resolve existing uncertainties in the industry.

McCullough studied Polymarket's historical data and removed markets with probabilities above 90% or below 10% after outcomes were already known but not yet settled, to keep the analysis accurate, according to a Dune dashboard summary. Polymarket slightly but consistently overestimates event probabilities across most ranges, potentially due to biases like acquiescence bias, herd mentality, low liquidity, and participant preference for high-risk bets, McCullough's research found. Longer-term markets, ones that ask bettors to consider an event far-out, look more accurate because they include many outcomes that are clearly unlikely, making predictions easier, McCullough explained in an interview with Polymarket's The Oracle blog . McCullough gives the example of Gavin Newsom becoming president (a question with $54 million in volume) during the last election to show that longer-term Polymarket markets often include obviously predictable outcomes, like Newsom clearly not winning, which boosts the platform’s accuracy numbers for these long-term predictions. In contrast, head-to-head sports markets, which have fewer extreme outcomes such as long-shot presidential candidates, and a more balanced distribution, present a clearer representation of predictive accuracy, McCullough found, showing notable improvements in accuracy as events unfold and revealing periodic accuracy spikes. Sports is a growing sector for Polymarket, with nearly $4.5 billion in collective volume wagered on the outcomes of the NBA, MLB, Champions League, and Premier League finals, according to data portal Polymarket Analytics. McCullough's findings about the accuracy of Polymarket are likely to be of interest in Ottawa, where Polymarket shows that new Liberal Party of Canada leader Mark Carney now has a significant lead over his Conservative rival Pierre Poilievre, even more than what poll aggregators are showing .",Markets|Polymarket,EN,0,0,MARKET|RESEARCH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-21 05:26:14

Since March 11, Dogecoin price has rebounded over 15 percent to trade at about $0.1721. Dogecoin price has depicted a high correlation with Bitcoin price, thus likely to rebound in the near future. Moreover, the crypto market is bound to significantly benefit from the easing yields in the U.S. bond market amid the ongoing bull rally for gold. Dogecoin Price Expectations From a technical analysis standpoint, Dogecoin price has been forming a macro rising trend, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. After a notable decline since the second inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, Dogecoin price has been retesting the lower border of a rising channel in the past two weeks. In the daily time frame, Dogecoin price has been forming an ascending triangle, after being trapped in a parallel falling trend. As a result, a consistent close above the resistant level around $0.178 will result in a 15-20 percent spike in the coming days to retest the upper border of the falling logarithmic trend. However, a consistent close below 16 cents could trigger further sell-off towards the next target of about 14 cents. Fundamental Outlook Dogecoin has grown to a vibrant memecoin ecosystem backed by institutional investors participating in mining processes and global merchants accepting it for payments. As of this writing, the Dogecoin network has about 6.2 million on-chain holders. According to on-chain data analysis, the Dogecoin network has recorded a significant spike in whale activities during the last week. In the past week, Dogecoin investors with an account balance of between 1 million and 10 million added around 110 million coins to currently hold about 10.44 billion.

At the Digital Asset Summit, Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin reiterated the central role of Layer-2 networks, emphasizing their importance in enhancing scalability and supporting next-generation applications. Meanwhile, major ETF issuers, including BlackRock and Bitwise, are pushing for regulatory approval to allow staking within Ethereum ETFs, a move that could improve investor returns and attract additional capital. However, these developments come amid growing concerns from investors. While Layer-2 adoption has reduced transaction fees, it has also led to a decline in Ethereum’s base-layer revenues, raising questions about its long-term sustainability. Similarly, Ethereum ETFs have experienced continued outflows, reflecting broader uncertainty in the market. As the ecosystem adapts to these shifts, Ethereum faces both new opportunities and economic challenges that will shape its future trajectory. The Push for Staking in Ethereum ETFs Gains Momentum as NYSE Arca Files Rule Change Proposal The landscape for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States is evolving rapidly, with a growing push to allow staking—a key feature that could enhance investment returns. On Thursday, this movement gained significant traction as NYSE Arca submitted a proposed rule change that, if approved, would permit Bitwise’s spot Ethereum ETF to engage in staking and earn yield. At the same time, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, voiced strong support for the inclusion of staking in Ethereum ETFs, stating that such a move could unlock additional demand and fundamentally change how investors interact with these products. Under the leadership of former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, the notion of staking within ETFs seemed like a nonstarter. The SEC had taken a hard stance on crypto staking, citing concerns over securities laws and potential risks to investors. When Ethereum ETFs were approved and launched in July 2024, they did so without staking capabilities, limiting their ability to generate additional yield for investors. BlackRock, Fidelity, and other issuers secured regulatory approval but had to forgo staking—a mechanism that allows Ethereum holders to participate in securing the blockchain network while earning passive rewards. However, the regulatory climate is shifting. With a more crypto-friendly government now in place, optimism is growing that Ethereum ETFs could soon be granted permission to stake their holdings. If approved, the rule change would mark a major milestone in the evolution of crypto investment products, allowing ETFs to generate revenue beyond just price appreciation. Staking has long been a central component of Ethereum’s ecosystem since the network transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake (PoS) in 2022. The PoS mechanism allows investors to lock up their ETH in the network to help validate transactions, and in return, they receive rewards in the form of additional ETH. For traditional investors, this represents a significant opportunity. Currently, the average staking yield for Ethereum hovers between 3-5% annually—an attractive incentive that could make spot Ethereum ETFs more appealing, particularly in comparison to their Bitcoin counterparts, which lack staking capabilities. The push to incorporate staking into ETFs aligns with growing institutional interest in Ethereum as a yield-generating asset. “There are a lot of fairly complex challenges that have to be figured out, but if that can get figured out, then it’s going to be sort of a step change upward in terms of what we see the activity around those products is,” Mitchnick added. NYSE Arca’s recent filing is not the only proposal in favor of staking-enabled ETFs. Grayscale, 21Shares, and Fidelity have already submitted similar proposals, indicating strong demand from multiple issuers. If the SEC greenlights these rule changes, Ethereum ETFs would become more competitive with traditional yield-bearing assets such as dividend-paying stocks, corporate bonds, and real estate investment trusts (REITs). This could potentially draw more institutional capital into Ethereum, further legitimizing its role in the broader financial market. Despite the excitement, Ethereum ETFs still lag significantly behind Bitcoin ETFs in terms of market demand. BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF holds approximately $2.3 billion in assets under management (AUM), compared to nearly $48 billion in AUM for the firm’s Bitcoin ETF. Regulatory Hurdles and Potential Roadblocks While momentum is building, significant regulatory hurdles remain. The SEC has historically been cautious about staking, often associating it with securities-related risks. The agency has taken enforcement actions against crypto firms engaged in staking services, citing concerns over investor protection and opaque financial structures. For Ethereum ETFs to be granted staking privileges, ETF issuers will likely need to provide detailed disclosures about how staking rewards will be managed, how risks will be mitigated, and how investor funds will be safeguarded. Additionally, the SEC may seek assurances that staking within ETFs does not lead to unintentional classification of ETH as a security. The debate over whether Ethereum should be classified as a commodity or a security has persisted for years, and any regulatory misclassification could have wide-ranging implications for the industry. Joe Lubin Champions Layer-2 Scaling as Ethereum Faces Investor Skepticism In related news, Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin took center stage at the Digital Asset Summit, reinforcing the pivotal role of Layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions in Ethereum’s long-term vision. Speaking in an interview, Lubin stressed that the Ethereum network is uniquely positioned to remain the dominant force in blockchain infrastructure, thanks to its extensive security guarantees and mature ecosystem. Lubin further highlighted another emerging Layer-2 solution, MegaETH, which he believes will contribute to Ethereum’s scalability and efficiency. His remarks shed light on Ethereum’s strategy of fostering Layer-2 development rather than competing with newer Layer-1 chains, many of which have struggled to gain the same level of trust and adoption. However, while Ethereum’s leadership continues to bet on Layer-2 expansion, some investors remain skeptical about its long-term implications—particularly in relation to Ethereum’s economic model and the sustainability of its revenue streams. Ethereum’s Layer-2 networks, which include rollups and sidechains, have seen an explosive rise in adoption. According to L2Beat , there are now more than 140 unique Ethereum scaling solutions, with over 60 rollup networks in operation. These scaling solutions reduce congestion on the Ethereum mainnet by processing transactions off-chain while still settling security proofs back to Ethereum’s Layer-1. However, investors and analysts have raised concerns that Layer-2 networks could be undermining Ethereum’s core economic value rather than enhancing it. Critics argue that these solutions divert transaction fees away from Ethereum’s mainnet, reducing its revenue and potentially weakening its security model. A stark example of this came with the Dencun upgrade, implemented in March 2024, which drastically lowered gas fees for Layer-2 transactions. While this improved usability for Ethereum users, it had an unexpected downside—Ethereum’s base layer revenue collapsed by 99% by September 2024. Ethereum’s gas fees, once a significant source of validator revenue, have plummeted by 95% since Dencun’s implementation. This has raised concerns that Ethereum’s long-term economic sustainability may depend on alternative revenue models, such as maximal extractable value (MEV) or Ethereum ETFs incorporating staking yields. Ethereum Price Struggles The Ethereum network’s economic shift has coincided with significant price volatility in Ether (ETH), with the cryptocurrency experiencing a prolonged downtrend in 2025. Since peaking earlier in the year, ETH’s price dropped to $1,759 on March 11, reflecting broader market concerns and a risk-off sentiment among institutional investors. Analysts warn that Ethereum’s price trajectory remains uncertain, with some forecasting a continued decline in 2025 unless new bullish catalysts emerge.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-21 05:30:00

Their analyses, while conducted on different timeframes, both highlight breakouts from constrictive patterns that have prevented any major swings over the last few weeks. Dogecoin Could Surge 16% (1-Hour Chart) Ali Martinez presented a one-hour Dogecoin chart on X that shows the token trading within a narrowing range defined by a symmetrical triangle. According to Martinez, DOGE initially saw a steep decline—approximately 16.46%—from around $0.18, dropping just above $0.14 before recovering and forming progressively higher lows. The upper limit of the triangle rests near $0.18, while the lower support line extends upward from the vicinity of $0.144. Martinez points to the $0.16–$0.18 corridor as a key area that has contained Dogecoin’s price action. He remarks that a clear and convincing hourly close above this zone might release the buying pressure that has been consolidating over the past ten days. Citing symmetrical triangle theory, Martinez estimates that such a breakout could spark a 16% upswing from the breakout point. “Dogecoin will break out! A close outside $0.16-$0.18 could trigger a 16% price move,” Martinez wrote via X. Related Reading: Dogecoin Shark & Whale Population Rises—Price Turnaround Incoming? Falling Wedge Breakout (1-Day Chart) CW, on the other hand, shared a daily Dogecoin chart illustrating what he interprets as a falling wedge formation stretching back to December 2024, when DOGE briefly climbed to around $0.48 before reversing course into a prolonged downtrend. In a falling wedge, the price typically forms lower highs and lower lows, converging toward a narrowing apex. CW notes that Dogecoin has finally crossed above the wedge’s downward-sloping resistance line yesterday, an event widely viewed as a bullish reversal signal once the breakout is confirmed by subsequent candles holding above that line. Related Reading: Dogecoin At Make-Or-Break Point After Multi-Year Trendline Test CW’s analysis relies heavily on Fibonacci retracements drawn from DOGE’s most recent major upswing. He identifies crucial Fibonacci levels at $0.2027 (the 0.236 retracement), $0.2564 (the 0.382 retracement), $0.2999 (the 0.5 retracement), $0.3433 (the 0.618 retracement), $0.40513 (the 0.786 retracement), and $0.4839 (the 1.0 retracement). These levels often serve as potential price floors or ceilings in either bullish or bearish market environments. CW believes that now that the token has escaped its descending wedge, it could climb through these retracement levels in succession, provided the broader market remains supportive. Ultimately, he sets his sights on the 1.618 Fibonacci extension at $0.71. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.17.

The announcement , made on Mar. 20 in a press release, indicates DTCC’s growing engagement with blockchain-based financial solutions. ERC-3643, also known as the T-REX protocol, is an open-source smart contract standard designed for issuing and managing permissioned tokens. It ensures that only authorized users, even on public blockchains, can hold these assets by using a decentralized identity framework. More than 40 tokens have been developed and managed using the standard, which has been used to tokenize $28 billion worth of assets across more than 180 jurisdictions. ERC-3643 will be integrated into DTCC’s ComposerXTM platform, which includes ComposerX Factory, a tokenization engine for managing financial data. This integration aims to improve risk management, security, and compliance in digital asset markets while reducing operational costs and complexity.

It has been testing blockchain applications, such as tokenized private asset tokenization on an Avalanche ( AVAX ) subnet and tokenized U.S. Treasury Bill settlements on the Canton Network. The support from DTCC indicates that American regulators are becoming more receptive to blockchain-based finance. In a related development, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has also been exploring blockchain applications. To discuss the launch of its pilot program for digital asset markets, it announced on Feb. 7 that it would host a CEO Forum with prominent industry leaders such as Circle ( USDC ), Coinbase, Crypto.com, MoonPay, and Ripple ( XRP ). Stablecoins and other tokenized non-cash collateral are to be tested as part of the initiative.

42082060,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=697168,1742535504,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42082060.jpeg,XRP and Mt. Gox’s Jed McCaleb is using his crypto fortune to fund a $1B space station,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jed-mccaleb-crypto-fortune-1b-space-station/,"Jed McCaleb, the same guy who created XRP and started Mt. Gox, is now paying out of pocket to get a private space station into orbit. The company building it is called Vast. Jed is the only person paying for the whole thing. No investors. No partners. Just him. The project could get him a huge NASA contract in 2026. That deal would be worth billions. If it doesn’t happen, Jed says he’s totally fine with losing a billion. As of December 2024, he controlled $3.3 billion through two private foundations he fully funded himself. “It’s super important that people take this leap from where we are today to this potential world where there’s a lot of people living off the Earth,” Jed said from Vast’s headquarters in Long Beach, California. “There’s not that many folks that are willing to dedicate the amount of resources and time and risk tolerance that I am.” Jed is 50 years old. He grew up on a farm in Arkansas. He dropped out of the University of California at Berkeley. He’s never worked in aerospace. He made all his money by getting into new tech early and getting out before the government showed up. Vast was founded in 2021. Jed hired Max Haot in 2023 to run the company as CEO. Max is now leading the team that’s building a prototype station called Haven-1. Jed comes down from San Francisco once a week. He still owns the company fully. Max drives a Cybertruck. Jed drives a Model 3. Vast works with SpaceX to launch Haven-1 by 2026 Vast is working with SpaceX to send its hardware into space. The company already booked SpaceX launches for its modules and for astronaut crew missions. SpaceX agreed to carry astronauts on behalf of Vast as long as NASA gives approval. Vast is also using SpaceX parts to build its station. That includes a docking adapter for the Dragon capsule and a Wi-Fi system that will work in space using Starlink. NASA plans to retire the International Space Station by the end of 2030. Elon Musk has said that timeline should move faster. Vast wants to be ready before it’s gone. If they can get Haven-1 up first, and if it works, they could win NASA’s contract to keep astronauts in orbit. That would mean a steady stream of money. Vast is building Haven-1 right now. The station will be about 33 feet tall and 14.5 feet wide. It’ll fit inside a Falcon 9 rocket. It’ll hold four people. Inside, it’ll have about 1,600 cubic feet of space. That’s twice the space in a regular RV. It will have separate sleeping areas, wood paneling, a big window, and a table for the crew to eat together. Construction started in January. The original launch date was set for August this year. That was delayed. Now they’re aiming for May 2026. They’ve already tested a prototype of the module to make sure it can hold pressure. The team is now working on power, propulsion, and everything else needed to support a live crew. Haven-1 won’t have the same life-support systems as the ISS. There will be no recycling of water or air. The station is designed for short stays. Max said, “Right now we are not a space station company. We are an aspiring space station company.” If the first mission works, Vast will send another module called Haven-2 in 2028. That’s supposed to be the start of a larger space base. It would grow into something big enough to fully replace the ISS. Haven-2 will eventually include recycling systems for water and oxygen. But that won’t happen right away. For the first few years, they don’t plan to have anyone live up there permanently. Max met Jed in 2022 while looking for investors for Launcher, his rocket startup. Launcher had raised $30 million. They had built a rocket engine and two satellites. Both of those satellites failed after they made it into space. Jed offered to buy the company instead of just investing. He told Max to take the role of president. Later, Max became CEO. He first said no, but then agreed after realizing Launcher couldn’t get the funding it needed. The terms of that deal were never shared. Jed’s crypto billions came from XRP, Ripple, and Mt. Gox Before building a space company, Jed was already rich from crypto. He launched Mt. Gox in 2010. It was one of the first Bitcoin exchanges. He sold most of it in 2011. In 2014, Mt. Gox crashed. It went bankrupt. Over $400 million worth of coins were lost. That made it the biggest crypto failure in history until FTX collapsed in 2023. Jed still had a small stake when it crashed. He said he lost money too. He wasn’t fined or charged. He moved on to XRP. He co-created the Ripple protocol. He also held 9% of all XRP when it launched. He had disagreements with his co-founders and left Ripple in 2013. But he kept his XRP and sold it slowly over the next decade. From 2014 to 2022, he made about $3.2 billion by selling XRP and Ripple shares. That’s according to XRPScan, which tracks transactions on the XRP Ledger. Nic Carter, founding partner at Castle Island Ventures, said, “He’s one of the top 10 most important crypto founders, even though nobody really knows him. The other ones are these pretty flamboyant, loud, extravagant people.” Jed doesn’t talk much. He works with the same people he always has. He still works with Sam Yagan, who started a file-sharing company with him more than 20 years ago. Sam called Jed a “deliberate risk-taker.” He said: “He’s hyperrational about these things. But he’s maybe slightly eccentric in his willingness to take what you and I would see as a lot of risks.” Jed’s first startup was eDonkey. It launched in 2000. It let users share music and movies online for free. The company made millions off ads. Then it got shut down in 2006 after Jed agreed to pay $30 million to the music industry to avoid lawsuits. He now splits his time between his house in Costa Rica and another one in Berkeley. He flies his own plane. Vast needs NASA’s contract to survive long term Vast wants to build more than just one station. They’re also working on artificial gravity. That would mean spinning modules that create a gravity-like effect using centrifugal force. The goal is to make space more livable long-term. Living in microgravity has caused health problems for astronauts, including weakened bones and muscles. But all of that is far away. Right now, they’re focused on getting Haven-1 into space. Vast has grown from fewer than 200 people to 740 in the last year. Their Long Beach facility runs 24 hours a day. Some teams are building the space station. Others are expanding the headquarters. Competitors like Axiom Space, Blue Origin, and Voyager Space are all building their own space stations too. But Jed is spending his own money. That gives Vast an edge. “Vast is the only one that’s coming up with a solution that is primarily self-funded and ready to go,” said Chad Anderson, managing partner at Space Capital. He has no stake in Vast but is invested in SpaceX. Even though they’re close to SpaceX, Jed said he doesn’t know Elon Musk well. “I’ve met him a couple of times—he probably wouldn’t remember me,” he said. Both Jed and Elon dropped out of school. Both started software companies in the early 2000s. Both invested in OpenAI. There’s already been one lawsuit against Vast. A former employee said they tried to cut corners. But it hasn’t stopped the project. The company hasn’t had major public scandals. Jed isn’t running around trying to take over government policy. He’s at home with his wife and three kids. Then he flies down to Long Beach once a week to see what’s going on. If Vast wins the NASA contract in 2026, the government will buy time on its stations. That deal is the only path to steady revenue. Without that, the company probably can’t survive. “It’s a matter of existence for us to win that competition,” Max said. Vast already booked more flights with SpaceX for future missions. Both Jed and Max said they’re willing to go to space themselves. “As a kid, I spent a lot of time outside exploring, looking up at the sky to see how amazing it is,” Jed said. The next two years will decide everything. Haven-1 is still being built. NASA is still reviewing. The contract decision is expected mid-2026. Until then, Jed’s still betting $1 billion that crypto money can build a space station. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump once again reaffirmed his commitment to crypto adoption in his recent speech at the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit. Additionally, Trump-linked executives at Renatus Tactical Acquisition Corp I are planning a $179 million SPAC deal to acquire a US-based crypto or blockchain firm. However, the Trump administration’s crypto-friendly policies have sparked mixed reactions, with some critics warning of potential centralization risks. Eric Trump Joins Metaplanet as Adviser Metaplanet, a Bitcoin-stacking firm based in Japan, appointed Eric Trump , the son of US President Donald Trump, to its newly formed strategic board of advisers. The company announced the decision on March 21, and believes that Trump's business expertise and commitment to Bitcoin adoption are key assets in its mission to become a global leader in the Bitcoin economy. Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich pointed out Trump's contributions, and stated that his experience in finance, real estate, and brand development, along with his strong ties to the Bitcoin community, will be instrumental in accelerating the company’s growth as a major Bitcoin Treasury Company. The appointment is part of Metaplanet’s broader strategy to assemble a board of influential people who are dedicated to advancing Bitcoin adoption worldwide. By bringing in high-profile business leaders and advocates, the firm plans to solidify its position in the digital asset space and expand its influence in global markets. Metaplanet share price (Source: Google Finance ) The news had an immediate impact on Metaplanet’s stock, which surged 17.8% to 4,730 Japanese yen ($31.74) in the first 80 minutes of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, according to Google Finance data . Investors seemed to respond very positively to the announcement, which signals that people have some confidence in the firm’s strategic direction and its growing Bitcoin reserves. Metaplanet currently holds about 3,050 Bitcoin, which is valued at approximately $4.1 billion. This makes it the 12th largest corporate Bitcoin holder, according to data from BitBo’s BitcoinTreasuries.NET . The company has been actively expanding its Bitcoin reserves through various financial instruments since its initial purchase on April 23 of 2024. With a clear focus on strengthening its Bitcoin position, Metaplanet mow plans to also align itself with industry leaders and advocates who share its vision for the future of Bitcoin. Donald Trump Speaks at Digital Asset Summit President Donald Trump is also still very focused on strengthening his administration’s ties with the cryptocurrency industry. In a pre-recorded address at the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit on March 20, Trump once again reaffirmed his commitment to making the United States the “crypto capital of the world.” He praised some of recent regulatory changes and placed a lot of emphasis on the role of blockchain pioneers when it comes to transforming the banking and payment system while enhancing privacy, security, and economic prosperity. He also talked about the importance of dollar-backed stablecoins in maintaining the dominance of the US dollar in global finance. Donald Trump’s video message at the Digital Asset Summit Since taking office, Trump signed multiple executive orders in support of digital assets, including the establishment of the Working Group on Digital Assets and a Bitcoin strategic reserve. His administration’s proactive stance was also demonstrated through the first-ever White House Crypto Summit on March 7, where key industry executives convened to talk about the future of cryptocurrency regulations. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reinforced the government’s focus on stablecoin regulations, and presented them as a means of sustaining the US dollar’s status as the global reserve currency. Bo Hines, who is executive director of the Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, confirmed that a stablecoin bill will likely be presented to Trump within the next two months. Despite the administration’s enthusiasm, the White House Crypto Summit received mixed reactions from the crypto community. Institutional investors largely welcomed the event as a historic milestone, while retail investors and Bitcoin supporters were more skeptical. Critics accused the gathering of catering to industry lobbyists promoting state-backed digital assets rather than fostering true decentralization. Bitcoin maximalist Justin Bechler labeled the summit as a “gathering of rent-seeking lobbyists pushing state-approved surveillance tokens.” The market response was also unfavorable, with Bitcoin dropping by more than 7% in the days after the summit and the announcement of the Bitcoin strategic reserve order. While Trump’s administration is taking concrete steps toward integrating digital assets into the financial system, there is still division in the crypto community over the long-term implications of these policies. For now, the industry can only wait for more developments that could shape the future of cryptocurrency adoption in the United States. Trump-Linked Firm Eyes Crypto Deals Meanwhile, three executives from Trump Media & Technology Group are leading a new company that may buy a US-based crypto or blockchain firm, due to the Trump administration’s strong support for the sector. Renatus Tactical Acquisition Corp I, a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) based in the Cayman Islands, is seeking to raise $179 million through public and private offerings, according to a regulatory filing on March 14, which was first reported by Forbes . Renatus Tactical plans to raise $178.94 million Eric Swider, the CEO of Renatus Tactical, is a director at Trump Media and previously served as the CEO of Digital World Acquisition Corp., the SPAC that facilitated Trump Media’s public listing. Alexander Cano, the operating chief of Renatus Tactical, was formerly the president of Digital World, while Devin Nunes, the CEO and chair of Trump Media, also serves as the chair of Renatus Tactical. While the company did not share any specific acquisition targets, it is exploring businesses related to data security and technology applications in both military and civilian sectors. Although it could acquire businesses globally, the SPAC intends to focus on high-potential companies based in the United States. Renatus Tactical pointed to the Trump administration’s recent moves to integrate digital assets into the US financial system, including an executive order issued in early March to establish a Bitcoin reserve and a crypto stockpile, as well as a January directive to form a working group to draft cryptocurrency regulations. The company acknowledged that its close ties to Trump Media could pose some challenges, as some businesses and service providers may be reluctant to engage because of its affiliation with the president. This issue already affected major corporations kike Tesla, whose stock fell by more than 40% this year due to backlash over CEO Elon Musk’s role as the White House cost-cutting czar. The controversy surrounding Musk’s position led to protests, including burned Tesla vehicles and vandalized dealerships across the United States. Donald Trump net worth (Source: Forbes ) Donald Trump maintains a majority stake in Trump Media, which operates the social media platform Truth Social. His net worth has been estimated at $4.8 billion by Forbes and over $6.5 billion by Bloomberg , with his 114.75 million shares in Trump Media accounting for a big portion of his wealth.

The volatility has shaken investor confidence, triggering millions of dollars in liquidations across both long and short positions. For the past few days, the overall cryptocurrency market has witnessed a price surge followed by a drop. This pattern has been ongoing for the last couple of weeks, leaving investors and traders confused. Current Price Momentum ADA is currently trading near $0.72 and has recorded a 2% price drop in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume declined by 25%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels With notable price fluctuations in recent days, ADA appears to be forming a symmetrical triangle pattern on the four-hour timeframe. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price momentum, if the asset breaks out of the pattern and closes a four-hour candle above the $0.74 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 13% to reach $0.83 in the near future. Besides this short-term price prediction, if the asset breaks down from the pattern and falls below $0.70, it could decline to the crucial support level of $0.65 in the coming days. Based on expert analysis, a potential breakout or breakdown will determine the price direction in the coming days.

The initial euphoria around the mainnet launch seems to be fading fast as the PI cryptocurrency extends its weekly losses to more than 43%. As a result, the altcoin has dropped out of the top 20 crypto list, from the 11th spot last week. Pi Network Euphoria Is Fading Quickly The euphoria surrounding Pi Coin seems to be fading quickly amid the consistent delays in Binance listing plans, which has been a major hit on the market sentiment. Another major common grievance among Pi Coin investors is the lack of a clear roadmap for the Open Mainnet launch. While other crypto projects have offered transparent timelines, Pi Network’s future plans are ambiguous. This has led to growing discussions about whether Pi is a scam. Clarifying it, Dr Altcoin , who’s been closely associated with the project said: Clearly, there is a lack of communication and transparency from the Pi Core Team, which can lead some to misconstrue the Pi Network as a scam. However, I have been involved with the project for many years and have not found sufficient evidence to label it as such. The analyst further stated that the Pi Core team needs to step up efforts in terms of effectively communicating with the Pi community and not leave gaps in the process. Where Is Pi Coin Price Heading Next? The Pi Coin price has been on a vertical fall over the past week, breaking under crucial support levels of $1.4, $1.2, and $1.0. This major correction comes ahead of the Pi token unlocking event this week. While token unlock has been a major concern for investors, a large number of Pioneers from the Pi Network community have also been locking their PI holdings off lately. For now, the next support for Pi Coin price stands at $0.82. Crypto market analyst Kripto Bilgi stated that the sentiment around this altcoin is very weak while predicting a fall to $0.30. Besides, a Pi price prediction also hints at a bearish phase ahead for the asset.

42082236,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142127,1742535967,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Fear Grips Crypto Market: Fear & Greed Index Plummets to 31 – Investor Alert!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-fear-3/,"Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts! The market mood has taken a noticeable turn. Just when we were settling into a neutral stance, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has dramatically shifted, signaling a wave of fear sweeping through the cryptocurrency landscape. Let’s dive into what this means for you and your crypto investments. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does It Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a crucial tool provided by Alternative.me, is designed to gauge market emotions. Think of it as a sentiment thermometer for the crypto world. It swings between 0 and 100, with 0 representing “Extreme Fear” and 100 indicating “Extreme Greed”. This index isn’t just some arbitrary number; it’s a composite score derived from several key market indicators, giving us a holistic view of the prevailing market sentiment . Here’s a breakdown of what fuels this index: Volatility (25%): Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 and 90 days. Unstable markets often breed fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares the current market momentum and volume to the last 30 and 90-day averages. Strong buying momentum can suggest greed, while weak momentum can indicate fear. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment trends on social media platforms, primarily focusing on crypto-related hashtags and engagement rates to understand the public mood. Surveys (15%): Conducts periodic crypto surveys to directly gauge investor sentiment and expectations. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s dominance in the overall crypto market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal a flight to safety during fearful times. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries to understand general public interest and curiosity. Sudden Plunge into the ‘Fear Zone’: What Triggered the Shift? As of March 21st, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stands at 31, a significant 18-point drop from the previous day. This sharp decline has pushed the index from the “Neutral” zone (previously hovering around 49) firmly into the “Fear” zone. But what’s behind this sudden shift in market sentiment ? Several factors could be contributing to this increased fear : Broader Economic Uncertainty: Global economic headwinds, including inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions, often spill over into the crypto markets, making investors risk-averse. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased regulatory discussions and actions around cryptocurrencies can create uncertainty and fear of potential clampdowns. Market Corrections: After periods of growth, market corrections are natural. These pullbacks can trigger fear, especially among newer investors who haven’t experienced market cycles. Negative News Flow: Any negative news, be it exchange hacks, project failures, or unfavorable macroeconomic data, can quickly amplify fear in the crypto market. Navigating the ‘Fear Zone’: What Does it Mean for Crypto Investors? Entering the ‘Fear’ zone isn’t necessarily a doomsday scenario. In fact, it can present both challenges and opportunities for crypto investors. Let’s break it down: Challenges: Emotional Decision Making: Fear can lead to impulsive selling, often at market lows. This is a classic pitfall in investing. Increased Volatility: Periods of fear often coincide with heightened crypto volatility . Price swings can be more dramatic and unpredictable. Potential for Further Downturn: Fear can be self-fulfilling. If enough investors panic and sell, it can indeed drive prices lower. Opportunities: Buying Opportunity?: Savvy investors often see ‘fear’ as a potential buying opportunity. As Warren Buffett famously said, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” Lower prices can mean a chance to accumulate assets at a discount. Cooling Off Period: After periods of exuberance (greed), a ‘fear’ phase can be a healthy market correction, setting the stage for more sustainable growth in the long run. Focus on Fundamentals: During fearful times, it’s crucial to revisit your investment thesis, focus on the fundamentals of the projects you believe in, and avoid being swayed by short-term market noise. Actionable Insights: How to Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in Your Strategy The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t a crystal ball, but it’s a valuable tool to add to your crypto investment toolkit. Here’s how you can use it effectively: Gauge Market Sentiment: Use it as a general indicator of overall market sentiment . Is the market feeling greedy or fearful? This can help you understand the prevailing mood. Contrarian Investing: Consider a contrarian approach. When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’, it might be a signal to cautiously explore buying opportunities. Conversely, ‘Extreme Greed’ might suggest caution and potential profit-taking. Risk Management: Be more cautious during ‘Fear’ periods. Reduce leverage, manage your portfolio risk, and avoid making rash decisions. Combine with Other Analysis: Don’t rely solely on the Fear & Greed Index. Use it in conjunction with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and news monitoring for a more comprehensive view. The Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Fearful Markets Bitcoin dominance , one of the components of the index, deserves special attention during periods of fear. Historically, when fear rises in the crypto market, investors tend to flock to Bitcoin as a perceived safer haven compared to altcoins. This often leads to an increase in Bitcoin’s dominance. Monitoring Bitcoin dominance alongside the Fear & Greed Index can provide further insights into the type of fear driving the market – is it a general crypto market pullback, or a specific altcoin-related concern? Is Crypto Volatility Exacerbating Fear? Yes, undoubtedly! Crypto volatility is a double-edged sword. While it presents opportunities for high gains, it also amplifies fear during downturns. The inherent crypto volatility means that price drops can be sharp and sudden, triggering stop-loss orders and further fueling panic selling. Understanding and managing your risk tolerance in the face of crypto volatility is paramount, especially when the Fear & Greed Index is signaling heightened anxiety.

According to Metaplanet, establishing the new board and Eric’s appointment will strengthen the company’s position in the larger Bitcoin economy. The firm expects Trump’s background in business, finance, and real estate to fuel the company’s growth further. Metaplanet’s Representative Director, Simon Gerovich even showed support for Trump’s appointment, claiming the business leader will be a valuable asset in advancing the company’s vision. Metaplanet plans to add more influential leaders to its Strategic Board of Advisors In its press release, Metaplanet asserted it would add more high-profile figures and thought leaders worldwide to its new board to drive Bitcoin adoption. Eric Trump is now the only known member of the board; however, the firm is soon to make other appointments. Eric Trump’s appointment, nevertheless, is expected to enhance the company’s hold in the Bitcoin market. Simon Grevich even commented, “We are honoured to welcome Eric Trump as our first board member of our Strategic Board of Advisors and look forward to welcoming him to our annual meeting.” He added that Trump’s business experience and love for the Bitcoin community will play a critical role in accelerating the firm’s vision of becoming one of the world’s leading Bitcoin Treasury Companies. Metaplanet bought 150 BTC on March 18, working towards its 21,000 BTC acquisition target by 2026 Metaplanet has also been actively purchasing Bitcoin in the past few days. On March 18, the Japanese firm bought about 150 Bitcoins for about 1.88 billion yen or $83,671 per Bitcoin. However, after the BTC purchase, its stock slid slightly by 0.5% on the day. Nonetheless, its shares picked up on March 21. For the first 80 minutes of the trading day on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the staking firm’s shares jumped 17.8% to 4,730 Japanese yen, roughly $31.74. Moreover, on March 5, the company purchased 497 BTC, and its stock price rose by almost 20% consecutively. Not to mention, the firm’s BTC yield from Jan. 1 to March 18 for the ongoing quarter was 60.8%, a smaller change from the previous quarter, which saw a yield of 310%. So far, the company has issued more than 44 million common shares of company stock to buy Bitcoin, earning the name “Asia’s MicroStrategy” for its similar buying approach to Michael Saylor’s Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy. As per the latest data from Bitcoin Treasuries, Metaplanet currently holds 3,200 BTC, acquired at an average cost of $83,107 per coin. While this has led to a modest 1.8% profit, the firm remains vulnerable to Bitcoin price fluctuations. The firm faced potential losses multiple times in March 2025, when Bitcoin’s price fell below its acquisition cost. In fact, last week, Bitcoin dipped as low as $76,555—its lowest price since November 2024—putting downward pressure on Metaplanet’s portfolio. Nonetheless, the market has seen a slight recovery since. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $84,413, reflecting a 1.5% fall over the past 24 hours. This offers a narrow margin of safety for Metaplanet’s holdings but underlines the ongoing volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Of the 2,632 respondents surveyed by CoinGecko between February and March, 25% were “fully bullish,” and 19.3% indicated they were “somewhat bullish” for crypto AI tokens in 2025. Around 29% of respondents were neutral on the subject, while a combined 26.3% were either somewhat bearish or bearish. Responses on crypto AI product sentiment. Source: CoinGecko The survey response was similar when it came to crypto AI products, which comes as the “use cases combining crypto with AI have improved and are seeing more widespread adoption,” said CoinGecko’s crypto research analyst Yuqian Lim. “This perhaps shows that crypto participants are not differentiating between crypto AI’s investing or trading potential and the technology itself,” said Lim. “Such market sentiments might in turn reflect expectations that now is the time for crypto AI to move beyond the conceptual stage and mature as a sector.” CoinGecko’s cryptocurrency tracker shows that the top artificial intelligence coins by market capitalization are around $23.6 billion, led by Near Protocol ( NEAR ), Internet Computer (I CP ) and Bittensor ( TAO ). There’s also a separate group of AI agent coins, such as Artificial Super Intelligence ( FET ), Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), ai16z (AI16z) and others, which command a market cap of $4.5 billion. CoinGecko surveyed 2,632 participants between Feb. 20 and March 10 and grouped participants whether they were long-term crypto investors or short-term traders. It also asked participants to categorize themselves on whether they saw themselves as early or late adopters and laggards of crypto AI. It found that some of the earliest adopters — known as “innovators” — had a higher share of bearishness compared to some of the later adopters. “Laggards” were the most bearish, in line with expectations.

Farrar expects to see further experimentation with crypto AI tokens, as they allow retail investors to speculate on smaller market cap ideas that largely aren’t as accessible in the stock market. “Things tend to start off like this in the open-source world; you see a ton of tinkering, and then perhaps we’ll see something really big come of it.” Crypto AI verticals that Farrar’s firm has a close eye on include decentralized GPU provider protocols, decentralized data providers, payment infrastructure for AI agents leveraging blockchain tech and crypto trading bots. “There’s also an opportunity for crypto to be used as a video to authenticate content as AI-generated or human-generated,” Farrar added.

Historically, bullish rallies tend to begin when the score surpasses 60, while extended periods below 40 signal bear market conditions.

Ether on exchanges falls to near-decade low,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-supply-decline-crypto-exchanges-price-prediction-analysts?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Ether’s supply on crypto exchanges has dropped to its lowest level since November 2015, leading some analysts to predict a major price rally despite recent bearish sentiment. “Ethereum's holders have now brought the available supply on exchanges down to 8.97M, the lowest amount in nearly 10 years (November, 2015),” crypto analytics platform Santiment said in a March 20 X post. Ether’s supply on crypto exchanges has reached its lowest point since November 2015. Source: Santiment Santiment said ETH had been rapidly leaving crypto exchanges, with balances now 16.4% lower than at the end of January. This suggests that investors are moving their ETH into cold storage wallets for long-term holding, potentially holding more conviction that Ether’s ( ETH ) price will rise in the future. A significant decline in ETH supply across crypto exchanges can signal a potential price surge soon, commonly known as a “supply shock.” However, a surge will only happen if demand remains strong or increases to outpace the reduced supply. It was recently seen in Bitcoin ( BTC ). On Jan. 13, Bitcoin reserves on all crypto exchanges dropped to 2.35 million BTC , hitting a nearly seven-year low that was last seen in June 2018. Just a week later, Bitcoin surged to a new high of $109,000 amid the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. Some crypto traders and analysts anticipate a similar scenario for Ether. Crypto trader Crypto General told their 230,800 X followers that it is “Just a question of time before the big supply shock.” Crypto commentator Ted said in a March 19 X post that with ETH supply on crypto exchanges decreasing by the day, “buyers will soon compete, leading to bidding wars.” Related: ‘Successful’ ETH ETF less perfect without staking — BlackRock Meanwhile, crypto trader Naber said in an X post on the same day that the largest ETH accumulation is taking place, and it may lead to Ether reaching the $8,000 to $10,000 price range. Even at the lower end of $8,000, Ether would be up 64% from its all-time high of $4,878, reached in November 2021. While the supply decline is giving crypto traders hope for ETH, other signals have recently cast a bearish shadow over the asset. Its performance against Bitcoin has been at its lowest in five years. Daan Crypto Trades said in a March 19 X post that it is “unlikely to see this anywhere near its highs anytime soon.” Ether is down 26% over the past 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap Ether is currently trading at $1,971, down 26% over the past month according to CoinMarketCap data. Meanwhile, spot Ether ETFs have had 12 straight days of outflows totaling $370.6 million, according to Farside data. “This has been one brutal downtrend,” Daan Crypto Trades added.

Technical indicators suggest that SHIB is on the verge of a significant breakthrough or breakdown in price movement and will decide if it bounces back or declines further. Analysts suggest that the crypto is struggling to regain its previous momentum throughout the market. Market analysts place a lot of emphasis on the meme coin’s capability to cross the resistance barrier at $0.00001190. If the SHIB price breaks this level and continues receiving buyers, the target could be $0.00001220 or higher. The bullish target could further be boosted by an RSI above 60, a MACD golden cross, or both. Without initially crossing this resistance price point, SHIB could drop into bearish territory, retesting $0.00001140. If these levels don’t hold SHIB until the next bearish target of $0.00001080, sentiment will only worsen. The vague ambiguity connected to SHIB has made several investors reevaluate their stakes. Some long-term holders remain optimistic, awaiting possible ecosystem changes and an overall market recovery. Meanwhile, others are moving towards more substantive tokens beyond the meme-driven gimmick. Such a shift in investor behavior brings about a massive exodus from SHIB into emerging projects with genuine utility and growth prospects. Investors Are Moving Toward Rexas Finance With Rexas Finance (RXS) luring investors interested in escaping further down the meme coin rabbit hole, Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to struggle at resistance levels. RXS, unlike meme coins, has structures around its economics, a well-defined roadmap, and multi-layered real-world applications. Utility tokens are gaining increasingly over SHIB and similar speculative assets, and the trend shows no sign of stopping. The presale performance of Rexas Finance is one of the primary reasons for its massive appeal. The token presale is currently at $0.200 after selling more than 456.423 million tokens and raising above $47.285 million. Anticipation is building ahead of the token’s scheduled listing on major exchanges on June 19, 2025, at $0.25. With over 91.28% of the presale completed, SHIB holders, who have been desperately trying to see gains, are set to witness a successful launch. Unlike meme coins dependent on hype, RXS adoption goes beyond price speculation. It has been created with sustainability in mind. Rexas Finance is built around a financial ecosystem composed of smart contracts, DeFi apps, and ecosystem partners. This degree of functionality forces rational investors to shift from speculative meme tokens to Rexas Finance—investing in packs with tangible value. To meet the highest security standards, the token is audited by CertiK, which allows investors to put their funds into RXS confidently. The increased supply of verified and branded tokens positions RXS as a favorable choice, strengthening it against the high-risk, low-utility meme coins. The sheer demand for trustworthy and verified tokens gives Rexas Finance another notable edge. Is SHIB Starting to Fade Away? The current market situation indicates that Shiba Inu is dealing with substantial technical resistance and a change in investor interest and sentiment. Investors who are purely interested in meme trends are also losing interest. Despite still being supported by a community, the long-term sustainability of SHIB looks bleak as new projects such as Rexas Finance seem to be catching more attention. One of the primary worries for SHIB holders is the severely inflated supply. With more than 589 trillion tokens circulating, witnessing significant price appreciation remains a pipe dream. Unlike low-supply tokens, which can be appreciated exponentially based on demand, SHIB needs a colossal market cap increase to show decent price movement. This severely limits the scope for investors willing to take risky bets to get adequate returns on SHIB when plenty of better alternatives exist. The fact that investors accept and opt for RXS and other high-utility SHIB alternatives shows that the market matures. The market’s focus seems to have evolved from meme-centered speculation to sound financial projects. In the long term, there may be potential for SHIB to witness short-term spikes, but the trend is fairly straightforward—tokens with real-world applications will take over the next phase of the crypto market. Final Thoughts: Should You Stay or Go? For those who still own SHIB, the decision comes down to risk tolerance and long-term market views. If SHIB can break critical resistance levels and maintain buying pressure, it could still have some upside potential. Regardless, it is becoming increasingly difficult to justify leaving capital tied to a highly speculative asset, especially with the growing competition from utility-driven tokens. On the contrary, Rexas Finance displays stronger growth signals than expected before the official exchange listing. The ongoing presale success and the structured development approach make it a starkly more favorable option for long-term gain seekers. Early investors in RXS could be in for a substantial return on investment, provided primary exchange listings set for June come through. In conclusion, innovation is the driving force behind the market’s development. The crypto space has seen meme coins have their time, and moving forward, the next phase will likely stem from actual projects that guarantee utility, security, and sustainable growth. For many investors, this means shifting focus from speculative assets like SHIB and looking closer at Rexas Finance.

At press time, Lazarus held 13,441 BTC worth $1.14 billion, according to data source Arkham Intelligence . That's 16% more than Tesla's bitcoin stash of 11,509 BTC. Last month, Lazarus Group struck crypto exchange Bybit, draining $1.4 billion in ether (ETH) from the platform. Recently, some of the stolen funds have been converted into bitcoin, with 12,836 BTC distributed across 9,117 unique wallets, as Bybit's CEO Ben Zhou confirmed . Tesla acquired its bitcoin stash four years ago and has been HODLing ever since, making it the world's fourth-largest publicly listed company in terms of BTC holdings. The striking contrast between Tesla and Lazarus Group emerged even as President Donald Trump's positive stance on cryptocurrency has sparked calls for accelerated BTC adoption among corporations and sovereign nations worldwide. On Thursday, Trump reaffirmed his commitment to making the U.S. the ""undisputed Bitcoin superpower and the crypto capital of the world."" Against this backdrop, it will be interesting to see if Tesla and other U.S. corporations respond to being overshadowed by a North Korean hacker. Meanwhile, the U.S. government holds 198,109 BTC worth over $16 billion, representing coins seized in enforcement actions. Trump recently announced the same as the strategic reserve. .",Markets|Bitcoin|Tesla|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|EXCHANGE|ARKM|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-21 06:11:33

It comes ahead of a federal election slated to be held on or before May 17, which current polling shows is shaping up to a dead heat between Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s Labor and the opposing Coalition led by Peter Dutton. The Treasury Department said in a March 21 statement that crypto exchanges, custody services and some brokerage firms that trade or store crypto will come under the new laws. The regime imposes similar compliance requirements as other financial services in the country, such as following rules safeguarding customer assets, obtaining an Australian Financial Services Licence and meeting minimum capital requirements. Australia’s Treasury says its new crypto regulations have four priorities. Source: Australian Department of the Treasury In August 2022, the government initiated a series of industry consultations to draft a crypto regulatory framework . “Our legislative reforms will extend existing financial services laws to key digital asset platforms, but not to all of the digital asset ecosystem,” the Treasury said in its statement. Small-scale and startup platforms that don’t meet specific size thresholds will be exempt, along with firms that develop blockchain-related software or create digital assets that aren’t financial products. Payment stablecoins will be treated as a type of stored-value facility under the Government’s Payments Licensing Reforms; however, some stablecoins and wrapped tokens will be exempt. “Dealing or secondary market trading in these products will be not treated as a dealing activity, and platforms where they are traded will not be treated as operating a market simply because of that trading activity,” the Treasury said. As part of its crypto agenda, Albanese’s government has also promised to work with Australia’s four largest banks to better understand the extent and nature of de-banking. There will also be a review into a central bank digital currency and an Enhanced Regulatory Sandbox in 2025, allowing businesses to test new financial products without needing a license. Related: May election could open floodgates to institutional crypto: OKX Australia CEO Albanese’s government intends to release a draft of the legislation for public consultation. However, a change of government could be on the horizon with a looming federal election, a date for which is yet to be called. Dutton’s center-right Coalition had earlier promised to prioritize crypto regulation if it wins the election. The latest YouGov poll published on March 20 shows the Coalition and Labor neck in neck for a two-party preferred vote. The Coalition leads for topline voting intention, while Albanese continues to lead as preferred prime minister. Source: YouGov Caroline Bowler, the CEO of local crypto exchange BTC Markets, said in a statement shared with Cointelegraph that the areas of reform are sensible and would keep Australia competitive with global peers. However, she thinks there “will be additional detail required, on capital adequacy and custody requirements.” “We need to ensure that these requirements aren’t overly burdensome for business investment in Australia,” Bowler said. Kraken Australia’s managing director, Jonathon Miller, said there is an “urgent need for bespoke crypto legislation” to address the existing confusion and uncertainty in the country’s industry. “We believe that by establishing a clear crypto regulatory framework and mitigating problems like debanking, government can remove the barriers hampering growth in the Australian economy,” he said.

Synthetix Network price analysis revealed a strong bearish market scenario. The SNX/USD value dropped to $0.869 in the last 24 hours. Technical indicators give a negative signal; at the same time, the price charts also depict relatively bearish market conditions. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as we shall explore in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $6.07 by 2030. Why is SNX down? The cryptocurrency market is under bearish pressure, and SNX faces the same sentiment. However, it is discouraging that SNX has been following a bearish price curve after December 8, 2024, over the larger picture. The SNX price dropped to $0.869 losing 0.50% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.61 for the current year. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach $5 by 2029. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach the $6 level by the fourth quarter of 2030. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $6.97, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $6.97 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Synthetix historic price sentiment SNX price history Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price has declined to the $0.89 range.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,SNX|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-21 07:07:25

Despite years of hype around cryptocurrencies, most shoppers still automatically grab their credit cards when standing at the register. The cashier’s bewildered look when you mention Bitcoin says it all. SpacePay is tackling this problem head-on with a solution that might actually work in the real world. They’ve created a payment platform with a surprisingly low 0.5% transaction fee, compatibility with over 325 crypto wallets, and an instant settlement system that protects merchants from price swings. No wonder they’ve pulled in nearly $1 million during their presale, with $SPY tokens currently going for $0.003153. Bridging the Gap Between Crypto and Everyday Commerce Most shop owners definitely don’t have time to learn complicated new systems. They need something that works with what they already have, according to retail experts familiar with payment technologies. That’s where SpacePay gets it right. Instead of forcing merchants to trash their existing setup, their system works with standard Android payment terminals through a simple software update. It’s like giving your old smartphone a superpower upgrade. For customers, it’s refreshingly simple too. Scan a QR code with your crypto wallet app, tap confirm, and you’re done. No awkward waiting, no complex wallet addresses to type in, no technical mumbo-jumbo. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1898473072790810829 Slashing Transaction Fees for Merchants Credit card processors have been gouging small businesses for years. Those 2.5% to 3.5% fees might not sound like much until you run the numbers. Consider a neighborhood bookstore generating $40,000 in monthly revenue. Under conventional payment processors, they’re losing about $1,200 each month to transaction fees. By implementing SpacePay’s 0.5% structure, their monthly fee burden shrinks to just $200 – keeping an additional $1,000 in their business every month. SpacePay pulls this off by cutting out all those middlemen in traditional payment networks. When you swipe a credit card, your payment bounces between five or six different companies before reaching the merchant days later. With blockchain technology, SpacePay creates a more direct path without sacrificing security. Visit SpacePay Presale Protection from Crypto’s Wild Price Swings The biggest obstacle preventing widespread adoption of cryptocurrency payments remains price volatility. No restaurant owner wants to accept Bitcoin for a $100 meal only to find it’s worth $80 by closing time. SpacePay’s solution is brilliantly easy. When someone pays with crypto, the merchant gets exactly what they charged in their local currency – instantly. If you sell a $150 designer t-shirt that’s exactly what lands in your bank account, whether Bitcoin crashes or moons five minutes later. They pull this off with some clever tech that locks in the exchange rate during the transaction. If the market goes crazy during those few seconds, SpacePay absorbs the difference. Merchants just see reliable payments hitting their account without the roller coaster ride. This removes the biggest fear factor for businesses, according to retail consultants. They don’t need to worry about crypto prices or understand blockchain – they just get paid what they’re owed. The Technology Behind Seamless Crypto Transactions Behind SpacePay’s user-friendly exterior lurks some seriously clever engineering. Most payment systems check things one at a time – like standing in a single security line at the airport. SpacePay runs multiple security checks simultaneously – like having several security gates operating in parallel. While your traditional payment processor is still checking your account balance, SpacePay has already verified your wallet, confirmed the merchant’s details, and locked in the exchange rate. The speed comes from what tech people call “parallel processing,” but you don’t need to understand the jargon to appreciate the results. Payments complete in seconds instead of minutes, with security that’s actually stronger than traditional systems. Every transaction gets recorded on the blockchain, creating an unchangeable record that even the craftiest fraudsters can’t tamper with. Think of it as having a high-tech security camera watching over every penny, but better. How to Participate in the SpacePay Ecosystem Getting involved with SpacePay is refreshingly easy, even if you’re not a crypto expert. Their $SPY token is currently priced at $0.003153, though this will likely increase as the presale moves forward. Head over to SpacePay’s official website and connect whatever crypto wallet you normally use – MetaMask and WalletConnect are popular choices. The platform accepts various cryptocurrencies including ETH, BNB, MATIC, USDT, USDC, AVAX, and BASE. For those without cryptocurrency holdings, traditional bank card payments are also fully supported. After connecting your wallet, just pick how many tokens you want and follow the prompts to complete your purchase. Remember to keep a bit extra in your wallet to cover network fees.

Enter Rexas Finance (RXS), a new kid on the block that’s catching eyes as a possible XRP rival. Its fresh approach and growth potential are turning heads. But why are investors jumping ship from XRP to RXS? Let’s dive deeper to find out. Why Ripple Investors Are Switching to XRP Rival, Rexas Finance (RXS) 1. Tapping Into a $121 Trillion Market with RWA Tokenization A major factor driving XRP investors to switch to Rexas Finance is its fresh take on turning real-world assets into tokens. It’s often hard to buy and sell traditional assets like property, artwork raw materials, and ideas. Rexas Finance is shaking things up by putting these assets on the blockchain as tokens. This makes them easy to trade, get hold of, and move around the world. The global commodities market is worth about $121 trillion, and Rexas Finance aims to be the entry point to this untapped potential. While XRP deals with payment solutions, RXS gives investors partial ownership of valuable real-world assets. This opens up investment chances and creates a more open financial system. 2. Explosive Presale Performance and Growth Potential of the XRP Rival XRP investors seeking high ROI opportunities are flocking to Rexas Finance’s presale, which has been nothing short of impressive. Current Presale Stage : Stage 12 Current Price: 1 RXS = $0.20 Launch Price: $0.25 Tokens Sold: 454,446,358 RXS Funds Raised: $46.88 million More than 90.91% of presale RXS tokens have already been bought, and the RWA token is in high demand. Investors are hurrying to buy their tokens before the price goes up at launch. Market experts think RXS could hit $23 by Q3 2025 making it one of the best early-stage cryptocurrencies to invest in. Rexas Finance Tokenomics 3. Security and Transparency: CertiK Audit Verified Security concerns have historically influenced decisions regarding crypto investments, particularly due to the legal ambiguities related to Ripple. Rexas Finance offers investors reassurance through its CertiK audit confirmation. CertiK, a prominent blockchain security company, has meticulously examined RXS smart contracts, guaranteeing they are secure and devoid of weaknesses. It is also a plus that Rexas Finance operates on Ethereum, a reliable blockchain, as one of the best ERC-20 tokens to invest in . This degree of transparency and security plays a crucial role in Ripple investors’ choice to transition to the XRP rival. 3. Multi-Chain Integration and DeFi Opportunities Unlike XRP, which largely operates within its own ecosystem, Rexas Finance is designed for multi-chain integration. This means it can seamlessly interact with various blockchain networks, enabling greater flexibility, interoperability, and expansion into decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. RXS holders will be able to: Participate in DeFi staking and yield farming Use RXS tokens for governance decisions Trade tokenized assets across multiple blockchain networks This multi-chain architecture ensures long-term viability and mass adoption for the XRP rival, something the Ripple token has struggled with beyond the financial industry. Final Thoughts: Is RXS- XRP Rival the Future for Ripple Investors? With its innovative approach to RWA tokenization, multi-chain compatibility, and strong security framework, Rexas Finance is emerging as a serious competitor in the crypto market. The combination of massive market potential, explosive presale growth, and real-world asset accessibility makes RXS a compelling XRP rival for investors seeking higher returns and long-term sustainability. As XRP holders jump ship, Rexas Finance (RXS) is rapidly gaining traction. With its robust ecosystem and the ability to unlock a $121 trillion market, it’s no surprise that investors are making the switch. Will RXS be the next big thing in crypto? Time will tell, but the signs are pointing toward a promising future.

Gox & Ripple Co-Founder Jed McCaleb Aims to Replace ISS with Haven-1 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News From Crypto to Space! Jed McCaleb, known for founding Mt. Gox and co-creating Ripple, is now aiming for the stars—literally. His latest venture, Vast, is building a commercial space station called Haven-1, which is expected to launch by May 2026. If everything goes as planned, McCaleb could secure a multi-billion-dollar contract from NASA to help replace the aging International Space Station (ISS). But if things go south, he could lose a staggering $1 billion, putting the future of his space dreams in trouble. Just in: @JedMcCaleb , co-founder of #MtGox and #Ripple , plans to launch Vast’s ""Haven-1"" space station into orbit and secure a NASA contract by 2026. #CoinPedia #CryptoNews #Blockchain #CryptoMarket — Coinpedia (@CoinpediaNews) March 21, 2025 Haven-1: The First Step Vast is developing Haven-1, a 33-foot-long space station set to launch with SpaceX in 2026. It will hold four people and offer basic amenities, but unlike the International Space Station (ISS), it won’t recycle water or air, making it suitable only for short stays. NASA plans to retire the ISS by 2030, and Vast wants to be ready to take its place. The SpaceX Partnership McCaleb has always been known as a bold risk-taker, willing to go all-in on ambitious projects. According to his long-time friend and former business partner Sam Yagan, McCaleb is “slightly eccentric” in his willingness to take massive risks. His vision aligns with that of elon musk elon musk Elon Musk Is the Co-founder of Tesla, an investor and entrepreneur. He was born on the 28th of June,1971, and is based in Pretoria, South Africa. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, earning a bachelor's degree in Arts and physics, and the Wharton School, earning a bachelor's degree in science, and economics. In 2003 Musk founded Tesla, an electric vehicle and clean energy company. Elon Musk is a crypto enthusiast, he has a complex relationship with cryptocurrency. He purchased $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency. Musk was honored with Axel Springer Award, an award given to innovative people, who build new markets, change markets, and contribute to society.

Moreover, Vast has already secured multiple SpaceX launches for Haven-1 and future modules. SpaceX will also provide parts like the docking adapter and Wi-Fi system. If Haven-1 proves successful, Vast plans to launch Haven-2 by 2028, leading to a larger space base with life-support systems. Jed made billions from crypto, first launching Mt. Gox in 2010, which later collapsed in 2014. He then co-founded Ripple and held 9% of XRP, selling his stake over the years for around $3.2 billion. Despite his wealth, Jed has stayed out of the spotlight and prefers taking big risks quietly. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News Today, 21st March : Pi Network, Trump News, Sensex Today, Bitcoin Price , The Race for NASA’s Contract Vast is competing with companies like Blue Origin and Axiom Space.

Jed and Vast’s CEO, Max Haot, are even open to going to space themselves. The next two years will determine if McCaleb’s space gamble pays off—or if it becomes just another bold but failed experiment. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

42085496,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142130,1742541038,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Meteora MET Token Proposals Unveiled: A Major Shift in DeFi Governance?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/meteora-met-token-proposals/,"Exciting developments are brewing in the Solana DeFi ecosystem! Meteora, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on Solana, has just dropped two significant governance proposals concerning its native MET token. For those deeply invested in the world of crypto and decentralized finance, these proposals signal a potential shift in how MET tokens are distributed and utilized within the Meteora ecosystem. Let’s dive into the details of these crucial proposals and understand what they mean for liquidity providers, the team, and the future of Meteora. Understanding the Meteora MET Token Proposals Meteora’s announcement on X has sparked considerable interest within the Solana community. The core of the buzz revolves around two distinct yet interconnected proposals, both aimed at refining the crypto token allocation strategy for the MET token. These proposals are not just minor tweaks; they represent a potential recalibration of the tokenomics that could have a lasting impact on the platform’s growth and community engagement. Proposal 1: Boosting Liquidity Provider (LP) Rewards – Currently, liquidity providers on Meteora are allocated 10% of the total MET token supply. This proposal suggests increasing this allocation to 15%. Proposal 2: Team Allocation Adjustment – The second proposal focuses on the team’s allocation, suggesting a 20% share of the MET supply. These proposals are now published online for community review and discussion, paving the way for a governance vote that will ultimately decide their fate. But what exactly are the motivations behind these proposed changes, and what are the potential implications? Why Increase MET Allocation for Liquidity Providers? Liquidity is the lifeblood of any DEX. A healthy pool of liquidity ensures smooth trading, reduces slippage, and attracts more users to the platform. Increasing the MET liquidity providers allocation directly addresses this fundamental need. By offering a larger slice of the MET token pie to LPs, Meteora aims to: Incentivize Greater Liquidity Provision: A higher MET reward can be a powerful magnet, attracting more users to deposit their assets and contribute to the platform’s liquidity pools. Enhance Platform Stability: Deeper liquidity makes the platform more robust and less susceptible to price volatility and manipulation. Attract New Users: A platform known for its attractive LP rewards can draw in new users seeking yield opportunities in the DeFi space. Foster Community Engagement: Rewarding LPs strengthens the bond between the platform and its community, fostering a sense of shared ownership and participation. Consider this scenario: Imagine you are deciding where to provide liquidity for your Solana tokens. Platform A offers a 10% token allocation as LP rewards, while Platform B, like a potentially revamped Meteora, offers 15%. The higher reward on Platform B becomes a significant incentive, potentially swaying your decision and attracting more capital to Meteora. Examining the Proposed 20% Team Allocation The proposal to allocate 20% of the MET supply to the team is another critical aspect of this governance update. Team allocations in crypto projects are often a subject of scrutiny and debate. Transparency and justification are key to gaining community trust and acceptance. A 20% allocation for the Meteora team could be justified by considering several factors: Incentivizing Long-Term Development: A substantial team allocation ensures that the core developers and contributors are incentivized to continue working on the project, driving innovation, and maintaining the platform over the long term. Attracting and Retaining Talent: In the competitive crypto space, attracting and retaining skilled developers, marketers, and community managers requires competitive compensation. Token allocations can be a crucial tool in this regard. Funding Future Growth: A portion of the team allocation can be strategically used to fund future development initiatives, marketing campaigns, and ecosystem expansion efforts. Alignment of Interests: By holding a significant stake in the MET token, the team’s interests become closely aligned with the success and long-term health of the Meteora platform and its community. However, it’s essential for the Meteora team to clearly communicate how these tokens will be vested, utilized, and contribute to the platform’s growth. Transparency in this area is paramount to building trust and avoiding concerns about potential token dumps or undue influence. Navigating DeFi Governance: Community Participation is Key These Solana DEX proposals from Meteora underscore the importance of DeFi governance in shaping the future of decentralized platforms. Unlike traditional centralized exchanges, DEXs like Meteora empower their communities to participate in key decisions through governance mechanisms. This means that the fate of these MET token allocation proposals ultimately rests in the hands of the MET token holders and the broader Meteora community. Here’s how you can get involved and contribute to the governance process: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on Meteora’s official communication channels, such as their X account and governance forums, for updates and discussions related to these proposals. Review the Proposals: Carefully read the full proposal documents available online to understand the details, rationale, and potential implications of each proposal. Engage in Discussions: Participate in community discussions on forums, Discord, or Telegram to share your thoughts, ask questions, and engage with other community members. Vote (If Eligible): If you hold MET tokens and are eligible to participate in governance voting, make sure to cast your vote based on your informed opinion. Your voice matters! Active participation in DeFi governance is not just about influencing decisions; it’s about shaping the future of the platforms and ecosystems you are invested in. By engaging with Meteora’s proposals, the community can collectively contribute to a more robust, equitable, and thriving DeFi environment. The Potential Impact on the Meteora Ecosystem and MET Token Price The outcome of these Meteora MET token allocation proposals could have a significant impact on the platform’s ecosystem and the MET token price. Let’s consider some potential scenarios: Scenario Potential Impact on Ecosystem Potential Impact on MET Token Price Both Proposals Approved Increased liquidity, stronger community engagement, potential for faster growth, incentivized team development. Potentially positive due to increased utility and demand for MET tokens to earn LP rewards and participate in governance. Only LP Allocation Increase Approved Improved liquidity, enhanced platform stability, positive community sentiment among LPs. Potentially moderately positive as increased LP rewards can drive demand for MET tokens. Only Team Allocation Approved Ensured team motivation and resources for development, potential long-term growth focus. Potentially neutral to slightly negative if community perceives team allocation as excessive without clear benefits. Transparency is key to avoid negative price pressure. Both Proposals Rejected Missed opportunity to enhance LP incentives and potentially secure long-term team commitment. Potentially neutral to slightly negative as lack of change might be seen as stagnation. It’s crucial to remember that token prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, including market sentiment, broader crypto trends, and project-specific developments. These proposals are just one piece of the puzzle, but they are undoubtedly a significant development for Meteora and its community. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Meteora and its Community Meteora’s unveiling of these two important MET token allocation proposals marks a pivotal moment for the Solana-based DEX. The decisions made by the community in the upcoming governance vote will have far-reaching consequences for the platform’s liquidity, team motivation, and overall ecosystem health. By increasing the allocation for liquidity providers, Meteora aims to bolster its platform’s foundation and attract more users. The proposed team allocation, if implemented transparently and strategically, can ensure continued development and long-term growth. As the DeFi landscape continues to evolve, proactive governance and community engagement are essential for the success of decentralized platforms. Meteora’s approach to involving its community in these crucial decisions sets a positive example and highlights the power of decentralized governance in shaping the future of finance.

Bitcoin price has declined by 1.2% to trade at $84,197. XRP and Solana have also edged lower with 1% and 4% dips, respectively. Dogecoin also recorded a brief rally to $0.17 before reversing. Following this decline, the total cryptocurrencies market capitalization has dropped to $2.86 trillion. Data from Tradingview shows that TOTAL is ending its rebound and could lose support at the lower parallel channel. Total Crypto Market Cap As the market sentiment flips bearish and fear grips the market again, can XRP, SOL, and DOGE lead the market recovery? Dogecoin Price Poised to Lead Cryptocurrencies Recovery Dogecoin could lead a recovery for cryptocurrencies, with top analysts predicting that the price is on the verge of a major breakout. Popular analyst Carl Moon identifies a falling wedge pattern on DOGE’s one-day price chart. A move above the upper trendline will trigger a 171% rally towards $0.43. DOGE/USDT: 1-day Chart Another analyst Ali Charts has also shared a bullish Dogecoin price prediction in the near term. He stated, “Dogecoin will break out! A close outside $0.16-$0.18 could trigger a 16% price move.” The bullish price forecast by analysts comes as Santiment data shows that whales are buying the dip. In the last three days, large DOGE addresses holding between 100M and 1B DOGE have purchased 80M DOGE. Dogecoin whales XRP Price Reverses Despite Bullish News XRP price is unable to break resistance at $2.50 and trades at $2.41 today. Various news like Bitnomial’s launch of the first XRP futures have failed to attract demand from buyers. Buyers are likely to remain on the sidelines until the SEC issues a statement confirming the appeal dismissal. The XRP four-hour price chart shows mixed signals. The RSI is at 51, and tipping south, indicating the lack of strong buying pressure. Meanwhile, a bull flag pattern has emerged on the 4-hour price chart. This bullish pattern supports a bullish Ripple price forecast with a possible 16% rise that will push the cryptocurrencies price to $2.87. XRP/USDT: 4-hour Chart Solana Holds Critical Support Amid Price Dip Solana price today trades at $128 after a 4.5% drop in 24 hours. Despite this drop, SOL is holding a critical support zone between $120 and $130, with analyst Coinvo saying that as long as this support holds, Solana can rally to new highs. Solana Price Chart One of the catalysts that could break out Solana from this zone is the recent launch of a DEX by PumpFun. The meme coin launchpad has launched its own DEX, which could stir high trading volumes, driving a bullish Solana price forecast . Summary of Cryptocurrencies Price Prediction Cryptocurrencies price have dropped today. Crypto traders refrained from buying despite President Trump making a speech at the Digital Assets Summit.

In a white paper published by the Australian Treasury, the country's government says it will embrace tokenization, real-world assets (RWAs), and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as part of a broader push to modernize its financial system. While ruling out a retail CBDC for now, the government sees a wholesale CBDC version and tokenized settlement infrastructure as key to unlocking market efficiency and broader asset access. The government says that the Australian Treasury, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, as well as the Reserve Bank of Australia are planning to launch pilot trials that use tokenized money, including stablecoins, to settle transactions in wholesale tokenized markets. ""Markets for tokenized assets may be able to increase automation, reduce settlement risk, lessen reliance on multiple financial intermediaries, simplify trading processes, reduce transaction costs, and provide broader access to traditionally illiquid assets,"" the report reads. The white paper also presents a licensing structure for crypto exchanges, which will be known in Australia as Digital Asset Platforms (DAPs). Operators of DAPs will need to meet financial services obligations such as capital adequacy and disclosure requirements while also using third-party custodians to store customer assets. The Government is also planning on addressing industry concerns of de-banking through its DAP licensing regime, it said in the white paper, to allow for banking partners to better engage in risk management. This anti-debanking effort in Australia follows continued U.S. hearings on the topic, where Senator Tim Scott’s FIRM Act seeks to stop regulators from using ""reputational risk"" to block out crypto firms from accessing banking rails.",Policy|Australia|crypto regulation,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET|ASIA|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-21 07:12:48

Let’s understand why a Japanese Bitcoin company is making such bold moves in the crypto space: Diversification and Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating traditional markets, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a valuable asset for diversification and a hedge against inflation. Metaplanet’s substantial Bitcoin holdings reflect this sentiment. First Mover Advantage in Japan: Japan has a progressive stance on cryptocurrency regulation.

Trump Crypto Influence: Political and Market Implications Eric Trump’s appointment inevitably brings the “ Trump Crypto Influence ” narrative into play.

Mainstream Investor Interest: The association with the Trump name could attract attention from mainstream investors who might have been hesitant about crypto previously. It could be seen as a signal of growing legitimacy. Geopolitical Dynamics: A Japanese company with a Trump family member on its advisory board adds an interesting layer to the geopolitical landscape of crypto, especially considering the U.S.-Japan relationship. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities Ahead While the appointment of Eric Trump is undoubtedly a significant development for Metaplanet, challenges and opportunities remain: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin investment strategy , while bold, also carries inherent risks. Effective risk management and strategic diversification will be crucial. Regulatory Uncertainty: Global crypto regulations are still evolving. Metaplanet will need to stay agile and adaptable to navigate changing legal landscapes in different jurisdictions. Public Perception: The crypto industry still faces skepticism from some quarters. Building trust and fostering positive public perception will be essential for long-term success. However, the opportunities are equally compelling: First-Mover Advantage: Metaplanet’s early and aggressive adoption of Bitcoin positions them as a pioneer in the corporate crypto space, potentially yielding significant long-term rewards.

Market analysts believe that there’s enough possibility that ETH could see another 50% drop to $1,000 as some early ETH whales resolve to heavy profit booking. Ethereum Price Struggles to Regain $2,000 Amid the overall market uncertainty, Ethereum continues to face some selling pressure as bulls fail to regain control over $2,000 levels. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has stated that investors should maintain caution before building fresh positions in ETH. “Ethereum hits $2,000. Cool, but zoom out! The big picture is brewing something bigger,” Martinez stated. As per the below chart shared by Martinez, if bulls fail to hold the Ethereum price above $2,050, it risks further falling to the next support at $1,500, and even below all the way to $1,095 levels, per his recent ETH price prediction. Source: Ali Charts As of press time, the ETH price is trading 2.26% down at $1,973 with its daily trading volume dropping over 40% to $12.21 billion. Furthermore, the ETH futures open interest has also dropped 4% under $20 billion. A recent ETH price prediction also hints that the crypto will hover near $2K for some time ahead. Early ETH Whale Sells 34,125 Coins Blockchain analytics platform SpotonChain reported that a major ETH whale appears to have secured a massive profit of $65.66 million, marking a staggering 4,156% return on investment. The whale’s holdings date back to March 2017 when they acquired the ETH from platforms like Changelly, Bitfinex, ShapeShift, and Binance at an average cost of just $46.3 per token. The whale, identified as “0x086,” deposited its entire ETH holdings of 34,125 ETH to crypto exchange Coinbase a few hours ago. This transaction happened at an average Ethereum price of $1,970. Source: SpotonChain Currently, the ETH whale activity remains mixed as some big players are moving it from exchange and moving it to staking to earn the extra yield. These are specifically the long-term ETH holders holding with diamond hands. BlackRock Explains Why Ethereum ETFs Are Struggling Despite Ethereum price eyeing a relief rally past $2,000, there’s no major relief for spot Ethereum ETFs. The outflows have continued through March 2025 so far, highlighting a major drop in institutional sentiment. While speaking at the Digital Asset Summit (DAS) in New York City, BlackRock’s head of digital assets Robbie Mitchnick explained the real reason behind this fall. Mitchnick suggested that the ETFs could have performed better if they had included staking, noting that the absence of this feature made the launch “less perfect.” “A staking yield is a meaningful part of how you can generate investment return in this space. And all the [Ether] ETFs, of course, at launch did not have staking,” he said. On Thursday, crypto asset manager Bitwise filed a proposal to introduce staking on Ethereum ETFs . The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has proposed amendments to allow the listing and trading of shares for the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, incorporating staking capabilities.

Phase 3 starts from $0.02 per token, and with the momentum building, everyone is anticipating a price increase even sooner. This phase draws nearer to full capacity, foreshadowing urgency for latecomers who want to take advantage before Phase 4 takes the cost of entry to $0.025 — a 25% jump from today’s price tag. Investor Confidence and Presale Rise Steadily The project’s measurable growth trajectory has investors quickly filling Phase 3 allocations. This tokenomics means early backers can lock in tokens for $0.02, and when those tokens hit exchanges, the price will stand to triple to $0.06, a massive 200% profit. Such mathematical certainty stands in stark contrast to the fickle nature of meme coins, delivering deliver clarity in a market clouded by hysteria. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) analysts now forecast post-launch valuations in the $1.50 to $5 range, the former representing a 7,400% jump from the current presale price. Whether such predictions hold true depends on the platform’s readiness for launch and its ability to translate the presale interest into actual use post-launch. The presale to date with $4.1 million broken demonstrates that institutional and retail trust is solid, with a $100,000 giveaway giving ten of the first presale participants each $10,000. Not only does this tactic fuel urgency, but it also reinforces community bonds, thus solidifying a base of loyal supporters ahead of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s entry into the market. All new Lending System with Token Nature Mutuum Finance (MUTM) extends yield farming capabilities by creating mtTokens which represent deposited assets in dynamic fashion including DAI and ETH. ERC tokens managed by Mutuum Finance produce time-based interest while eliminating the need to sell assets. Furthermore, mtTokens increase interoperability by allowing users to move their tokens between DeFi platforms and outside of the Mutuum ecosystem. Mutuum Finance protects the protocol from defaults by forcing borrowers to deposit assets worth more than their requested loan amount. Each $5,000 USDT loan requires ETH collateral worth $7,000 for the lender to remain covered and ensure liquidity pool integrity. The peer-to-peer lending options emerging for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have become important loan options since traditional credit providers do not support these assets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates with another distribution channel since the platform can acquire tokens through open market purchases of their own tokens. Users who stake mtTokens receive additional MTokens and also create constant market purchase demands. The sustainable feedback loop prevents token sellers from appearing in the market and helps keep sustained value throughout market price fluctuations. The project’s roadmap includes a functional overcollateralized stablecoin that adds new DeFi product options for users. The decentralized stablecoin operates as a self-stabilizing cryptocurrency to oppose centralized alternatives because it maintains complete decentralization while being transparent through user-deposited collateral. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) utilizes adjustable interest rates that follow market conditions to create an investment platform that services moderate and aggressive borrowers and cautious lenders. With a restricted time frame to phase 3, it represents one of the last chances to get tokens below $0.025, with exchange listings ready to instantly create price increases. Not only do early participants benefit from the 200% launch return but they also set themselves up for exponential growth as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) adds users and products. Getting in Before the Boom For those with a focus on functional, utilizable projects over transient fads, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a letting-in opportunity for investors. Investing in tokens at $0.02 now secures instant returns at launch and primes portfolios for potentially even quadruple-digit returns in the future as adoption grows. Head to the official channels of Mutuum Finance now to join in before the conclusion of Phase 3—latecomers back of the line; they may well miss out on the lowest price tier in a project that is setting a new course for the future of DeFi.

Recent data from CryptoQuant is raising eyebrows and sparking concern among Bitcoin enthusiasts and investors alike. The Bitcoin Bull Score, a key metric for gauging market sentiment, has plummeted to 20 – its lowest point in two years. This significant drop begs the question: what does this alarming decline in the Bitcoin Bull Score really signify for the future of crypto, and should you be worried? What is the Bitcoin Bull Score and Why Does it Matter? The Bitcoin Bull Score is an indicator developed by crypto analytics platform CryptoQuant to assess the strength of bullish sentiment in the Bitcoin market. Think of it as a barometer for market optimism. It’s calculated based on a variety of on-chain and market indicators, providing a composite view of whether the market leans towards bullish or bearish expectations. A higher score suggests stronger bullish momentum, while a lower score indicates weakening bullishness and potentially growing bearish sentiment. Why is this score so important? Here’s a breakdown: Market Sentiment Gauge: It offers a quick snapshot of the prevailing mood in the Bitcoin market, helping traders and investors understand the overall direction. Historical Significance: Historically, the Bitcoin Bull Score has been a reliable indicator of market trends. Scores above 60 have often preceded significant bull rallies, while sustained low scores have coincided with bearish phases. Predictive Potential: While not foolproof, the Bitcoin Bull Score can provide valuable clues about potential future market movements, aiding in strategic decision-making. Historical Bitcoin Bull Score Trends Bull Score Range Market Condition Potential Outcome Above 60 High Bullish Sentiment Potential Bull Rally 20-60 Neutral to Cautiously Bullish Market Consolidation or Gradual Growth Below 20 Low Bullish Sentiment Potential Bearish Market or Downturn Two-Year Low: A Cause for Concern? The current drop of the Bitcoin Bull Score to 20 is undeniably noteworthy because it marks a two-year low. This isn’t just a minor dip; it’s a significant decrease signaling a considerable weakening of bullish sentiment. According to CryptoQuant’s report on X, such low levels have historically been associated with periods of market weakness. This raises a critical question: Are we on the cusp of another extended bearish phase in the crypto market? To understand the gravity, consider these points: Historical Precedent: Past instances of the Bitcoin Bull Score falling to similar levels have often been followed by prolonged periods of price stagnation or decline. Market Psychology: A low Bitcoin Bull Score can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. When investors see bearish signals, fear can grip the market, leading to sell-offs and further price drops. Broader Economic Factors: It’s crucial to consider the broader economic landscape. Factors like inflation, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical uncertainties can amplify the impact of a low Bitcoin Bull Score on the crypto market. CryptoQuant’s Analysis: What Are the Experts Saying? The insights from CryptoQuant are particularly valuable because they are a leading provider of on-chain data and crypto analysis . Their reports are closely watched by traders and institutions for informed decision-making. CryptoQuant’s alert regarding the plunging Bitcoin Bull Score underscores the seriousness of the situation. Their expertise in analyzing market indicators lends credibility to the potential implications of this low score. Why trust CryptoQuant’s crypto analysis ? Data-Driven Approach: CryptoQuant relies on verifiable on-chain data and sophisticated algorithms for their analysis, offering a more objective perspective compared to sentiment-based opinions. Proven Track Record: They have a history of identifying key market trends and providing timely insights that have proven beneficial to their users. Comprehensive Metrics: CryptoQuant analyzes a wide array of metrics beyond just price, offering a holistic view of market health, including miner activity, exchange flows, and investor behavior. Navigating Potential Bearish Market Conditions If the low Bitcoin Bull Score indeed foreshadows a bearish market , what should investors do? Panic selling is rarely the answer. Instead, consider a strategic approach: Review Your Portfolio: Assess your risk tolerance and portfolio allocation. Is your portfolio positioned to withstand a potential market downturn? Risk Management: Implement risk management strategies such as setting stop-loss orders and diversifying your holdings. Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on market developments and further crypto analysis from reputable sources like CryptoQuant. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that crypto markets are cyclical. Bear markets, while challenging, can also present opportunities for long-term investors to accumulate assets at lower prices. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider employing a DCA strategy to gradually invest over time, reducing the risk of investing a lump sum at market peaks. Conclusion: Vigilance is Key in the Crypto Market The drop in the Bitcoin Bull Score to a two-year low is a significant development that warrants attention. While it doesn’t guarantee a prolonged market downturn , it certainly serves as a strong warning signal. By understanding the implications of this metric, staying informed with reliable crypto analysis , and adopting prudent risk management strategies, investors can navigate these potentially turbulent times with greater confidence. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and periods like these emphasize the importance of informed decision-making and a balanced perspective.

However, sentiments signal potential shifts, with experts forecasting impressive actions for altcoins in the coming trading sessions. As altcoin season speculations emerge, analyst Altcoin Sherpa focused on the AI project Fartcoin. He highlighted $0.2905 as the crucial foothold for FARTCOIN’s potential recoveries. Altcoin Sherpa @AltcoinSherpa · Follow If this FARTCOIN level holds, next stop would be the $0.55-$0.65 region up next hot air rises 7:33 pm · 20 Mar 2025 182 Reply Copy link Read 21 replies Sherpa believes the altcoin could soar toward $0.65 if bulls defend the key support. That would translate to an approximately 45% surge from Fartcoin’s current price of $0.3590. Meanwhile, the nearest resistance at $0.4088 remains crucial for the altcoin’s trajectory. FARTCOIN failed to break this obstacle with its latest attempt. Another rejection will likely trigger declines toward $0.2905. Breaching this zone will demonstrate bear dominance and delay the anticipated near-term bounce-back. A decisive move past $0.4088 could support extended gains to $0.55 – $0.65, above which FARTCOIN will meet a long-term resistance at $0.6920. Broad market sentiments would be vital in determining Fartcoin’s short-term price direction. Meanwhile, the crypto landscape could be on the verge of an “altcoin season,” according to analysts. The materializing altcoin season Crypto trader and analyst Ash Crypto observed a vital technical setup for the altcoin market. The weekly chart reveals altcoin market capitalization, excluding Bitcoin. Source – Ash Crypto on X Meanwhile, the key development is the bullish divergence between the Relative Strength Index and altcoins’ market cap. The divergence suggests strengthening underlying momentum despite a bearish price outlook, suggesting impending turnarounds. The market cap printed a higher low after the latest retracement, suggesting a possible support barrier. The Relative Strength Index formed a lower low after the higher low price pattern. That printed a bullish divergence, which often heralds significant reversals. The uptrend line confirms buyers reentering to defend the key support. The latest green candlesticks highlight revived investor optimism, empowering the bullish divergence indicator. The market cap could rally to $1.2 trillion if it holds the trendline and the Relative Strength Index confirms the emerging reversal. However, breaching the trendline might see the altcoin market revising the support at $800 – $900 billion. That would further delay the anticipated 2025 altcoin season. Current altcoin market outlook The market capitalization of all altcoins maintained downtrends with lower lows and higher lows since mid-December 2024. The altcoin market cap recently secured a reliable support barrier at $1.03 trillion, catalyzing bounce-back speculations. However, the rebound might not be easy as prices remain beneath key MAs. The 200-day SMA presents a significant resistance at $1.16 trillion. Also, the largest altcoin by value, Ethereum, hints at bearish near-term actions. ETH trades at $1,970 after losing over 2% in the past day. Invezz highlighted a potential Ethereum crash to $1,250, a more than 36% dip from Ethereum’s current price. Amidst the uncertainty, FARTCOIN enthusiasts will watch the resistance at $0.4088 and the support barrier at $0.2905.

According to a recent report by WIRED, a government memo that has been circulating among State Department officials reveals the Trump administration’s plans for the United States Agency for International Development. Originally procured by the media outlet Politico, the 13-page document excerpt outlines structural changes intended for the humanitarian agency under the Trump administration. Aside from changing its name to the U.S. International Humanitarian Assistance or IHA, USAID will reportedly start incorporating blockchain technology into its procurement process. “All distributions would also be secured and traced via blockchain technology to radically increase security, transparency, and traceability,” stated in the memo. According to the memo, the use of blockchain technology in the agency is aimed at bolstering innovation and efficiency, as well as allowing for “more flexible and responsive programming focused on tangible impact rather than simply completing activities and inputs.” In early February, USAID staff were put on administrative leave before Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE ( DOGE ) slashed it workforce down from 10,000 to 300 staffers. Moreover, the State Department ordered it to stop sending a portion of payments to partner organizations around the world Read more: Trump’s pro-crypto address at DAS boosts Bitcoin confidence: expert However, it is still unclear how blockchain technology will play a role in the agency’s day-to-day operations. There are a few possibilities, one of them includes the use of a blockchain ledger to record the distribution of aid, making it more transparent and traceable. Another possible outcome is for the agency to start distributing monetary aid through cryptocurrencies like stablecoin to its partners instead of cash transfers. Just a day prior, Trump delivered a virtual address at the Digital Assets Summit where he urged the U.S. Congress to pass stablecoin regulations and establish simple rules for stablecoins and market structures. In the past, there have been instance where blockchain technology have been used by humanitarian organizations. In 2022, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees or UNHCR ran a small pilot project which distributed funds through stablecoins to displaced Ukrainians due to the Russia-Ukraine war. Similarly in 2018, The Kenya Red Cross Society launched a pilot project called “Blockchain Technology in Humanitarian Programming,” in which the blockchain was used to record transactions and to help people receive funds without needing to open a bank account. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which works with the Kenya team, also helped to develop the Humanitarian Token Solution.

Trump Hosts Private White House Dinner as Part of Broader Tech Diplomacy Talks The talks were part of a broader diplomatic initiative that included a private dinner hosted by former President Donald Trump at the White House on March 18. Trump later shared on Truth Social that he and senior U.S. officials met with Tahnoon to discuss enhancing bilateral cooperation in economic and technological arenas. While the specifics of the meetings were not publicly disclosed, sources cited by Bloomberg said the UAE delegation aimed to explore greater access to U.S. technology, particularly semiconductors, following U.S. export restrictions imposed in 2023. Tahnoon also expressed interest in building tech infrastructure within the U.S., reinforcing the UAE’s long-term commitment to its American partnerships.

This follows MGX’s $2 billion investment in Binance earlier this month. During his U.S. visit, Tahnoon also met with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and spoke with tech leaders including Oracle’s Larry Ellison, BlackRock’s Larry Fink, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang. He even held a video call with Elon Musk, discussing ways to modernize government systems. With control over a $1.5 trillion financial empire, Tahnoon’s engagements signal a potential surge in UAE-led investment and collaboration in U.S.-based digital innovation. UAE Tops “Most Crypto-Obsessed Countries” List in 2025 A new study shows that the UAE has ranked first among the world’s “most crypto-obsessed countries” in 2025, having an exceptional crypto adoption growth at 210%. The UAE has scored 98.4%, with the highest crypto ownership rate at 25.3%. As reported, the UAE is poised to become a key destination for crypto and stablecoin ventures seeking refuge from the EU’s newly implemented Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The regulatory framework, which took full effect on December 30, is creating significant challenges for crypto firms within the 27-member bloc, prompting many to consider relocating, according to industry experts. Experts said that the UAE’s proactive positioning as a crypto hub, combined with its clarity on policies, makes it a compelling choice for companies looking to maintain global operations.

According to data from SoSoValue, 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively pulled in $165.75 million in net inflows on Thursday, a huge leap compared to just $11.8 million the day before. It also marked the fifth straight day of positive inflows, with nearly $700 million entering Bitcoin ETFs over that period. BlackRock’s IBIT led the charge with a whopping $172.14 million in net inflows, bouncing back after a day of zero movement. Other players like VanEck’s HODL, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Grayscale’s mini Bitcoin Trust also saw more modest gains of $11.9 million, $9.19 million, and $5.22 million, respectively. However, not everyone benefited. Funds like Bitwise’s BITB, Grayscale’s ETHE, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC saw investors pulling out nearly $32.7 million altogether, showing that sentiment still varies across providers. The surge in ETF demand comes after a rough five-week stretch of outflows. Investors had been holding back due to concerns over trade war talk, rising geopolitical tensions, and macro uncertainty. But Wednesday’s Fed meeting brought some relief. You might also like: Red alert: Bitcoin price rebound could fade as technical patterns turn bearish Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled a more dovish tone, suggesting that inflationary pressure, especially from potential Trump-era tariffs, may be temporary. That opened the door to possible future rate cuts, sparking optimism in risk-on markets like crypto . Bitcoin responded quickly, shooting up 4.5% to $85,786 and even briefly hitting $87,431. Ethereum and Solana joined the rally with 4% and 6% gains, respectively. The total crypto market cap climbed 3% to $2.947 trillion, while futures markets saw $355 million in liquidations, mostly from short positions. Adding to the bullish sentiment was yesterday’s SEC announcement confirming that mining activities for Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash won’t fall under current securities laws. However, when writing, Bitcoin ( BTC ) was down 2% in the last 24 hours, exchanging hands at $84,165 per coin. While ETF inflows signal a resurgence of demand for regulated BTC exposure, analysts remain divided on Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. Analyst RJT_WAGMI points out that Bitcoin is hanging right at a crucial technical level, testing a descending trendline while butting heads with the 100-day moving average and the Ichimoku Cloud. The analyst noted that a breakout from the zone could trigger a strong rally, but if Bitcoin gets rejected here, it may lead to a downside move. Source: X/RJT_WAGM Trader Great Mattsby offers a bigger picture, noting that Bitcoin is still tracking within a long-term upward logarithmic trend channel, hinting the next major peak might not arrive until 2025-26 — so there could still be room to run. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju brings a macro lens, arguing that while retail demand is strong, especially via ETFs, it doesn’t reflect on-chain like it used to. He believes the bull cycle might technically be over, not in a crash sense, but more that it could take another 6 to 12 months for Bitcoin to punch through its all-time high, thanks to tight liquidity and broader economic conditions.

The rally was largely driven by speculation around U.S. President Donald Trump’s virtual appearance at the Digital Asset Summit in New York. However, following his speech, BTC quickly retracted its gains, falling to $84,000, as traders were left disappointed by the lack of groundbreaking crypto policies. Ahead of Trump’s statement, rumors circulated on X, suggesting he might announce zero capital gains taxes on certain cryptocurrencies or unveil a strategic U.S. Bitcoin reserve plan. Neither materialized. Instead, Trump reiterated his promise not to sell Bitcoin confiscated by the government and urged Congress to pass clear stablecoin legislation. His most significant comment was a pledge to make the U.S. a global leader in cryptocurrency . However, traders who bought into the pre-speech hype swiftly sold on the news, triggering the sharp price correction. Analysts Predict a Potential Bitcoin Correction While Bitcoin’s rapid dip disappointed some, chartered market technician Aksel Kibar noted that the price could still correct further, potentially falling to $73,700. He highlighted that BTC’s long-term chart still suggests a pullback to this level, which could determine the market’s direction in the coming months. Bitcoin’s price action wasn’t entirely driven by Trump’s remarks. On March 19, BTC also responded positively to the release of the FOMC minutes, where Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank’s quantitative tightening (QT) regime would slow down. Powell also hinted at two possible interest rate cuts in 2025, boosting market optimism. Futures and Spot Market Activity A large portion of Bitcoin’s recent volatility has been driven by futures market activity, but the reappearance of the BTC Coinbase premium suggests that spot market demand may be returning. This could indicate renewed buying interest, providing some stability to the market despite the recent pullback. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes celebrated what he described as the Fed’s implicit confirmation that QT would essentially end by April 1, but he warned that BTC could still face volatility .

42086320,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142140,1742542830,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Bithumb Raid: Seoul Prosecutors Investigate Crypto Exchange Over Fund Misuse Scandal,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bithumb-exchange-raid-seoul/,"In a stunning development shaking the South Korean cryptocurrency landscape, Bithumb, a leading crypto exchange, has become the center of a high-stakes investigation. Seoul prosecutors have launched a raid on the exchange, acting on allegations of significant fund misuse by its former CEO. This move signals a serious escalation in regulatory scrutiny within the crypto sector and raises critical questions about corporate governance and investor protection in the rapidly evolving digital asset market. For crypto enthusiasts and investors closely monitoring market dynamics, this Bithumb raid is a pivotal event with potentially far-reaching consequences. What Triggered the Seoul Prosecutors’ Raid on Bithumb? The raid, executed on March 20th, was reportedly initiated following a referral from South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS). The FSS, the primary financial regulator in the nation, flagged concerns regarding the alleged misuse of corporate funds by Bithumb. According to local news outlet YTN, the core of the investigation revolves around accusations that Bithumb corporate funds were improperly diverted to assist its former CEO in purchasing an apartment. This action, if substantiated, could represent a serious breach of fiduciary duty and potentially violate financial regulations. To understand the gravity of the situation, let’s break down the key elements: The Allegation: Bithumb is accused of using company funds to facilitate a personal real estate transaction for its former CEO. The Regulator’s Role: The Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) investigated the allegations and deemed them serious enough to warrant prosecutorial involvement, referring the case to Seoul prosecutors. The Action: Seoul prosecutors, upon receiving the referral, conducted a search and seizure raid at Bithumb’s offices, indicating a formal criminal investigation is underway. The Exchange’s Status: Bithumb is one of South Korea’s largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges, making this raid a significant event for the entire industry. This raid underscores the increasing vigilance of South Korean regulators towards cryptocurrency exchanges, particularly concerning the management and utilization of corporate funds. It also highlights the potential risks associated with leadership transitions and corporate governance within these often rapidly growing and less mature financial entities. Why is the Bithumb Raid a Major Development for the Crypto Exchange Industry? The Bithumb raid sends shockwaves throughout the cryptocurrency industry for several compelling reasons. Bithumb is not just any crypto exchange; it is a cornerstone of the South Korean digital asset market, which is globally recognized as one of the most active and influential. Any legal action against such a prominent player has immediate and far-reaching implications. Consider these points to understand the significance: Market Impact: Bithumb’s trading volume and user base are substantial. Negative news surrounding the exchange can trigger market volatility, affecting not only Bithumb but also the broader cryptocurrency market sentiment, especially in South Korea. Regulatory Precedent: This raid sets a precedent for how South Korean authorities will handle allegations of financial misconduct within crypto exchanges. It signals a zero-tolerance approach towards fund misuse and corporate malfeasance. Investor Confidence: Incidents like this can erode investor confidence in crypto exchanges, raising concerns about the safety and security of their investments. This is particularly critical in a market where trust is paramount. Global Scrutiny: As South Korea is a major crypto hub, actions taken by its regulators are closely watched globally. This case will likely influence regulatory approaches in other jurisdictions as well. Compliance Pressure: The raid intensifies pressure on all crypto exchanges to enhance their compliance frameworks, internal controls, and corporate governance practices to avoid similar scrutiny and legal repercussions. The Seoul prosecutors ‘ involvement signifies that this is not merely a regulatory matter but potentially a criminal investigation. This elevates the stakes significantly for Bithumb and its current management. The outcome of this investigation could have profound consequences for the exchange’s future operations and its standing in the market. Delving Deeper: What Constitutes ‘Fund Misuse’ and its Implications? The core allegation – fund misuse – warrants closer examination. In corporate contexts, fund misuse generally refers to the inappropriate or unauthorized use of company assets, often for personal gain or purposes not aligned with the company’s interests. In the case of Bithumb, the accusation centers on diverting corporate funds to aid the former CEO’s personal property acquisition. Potential implications of such fund misuse can be severe, both legally and reputationally: Aspect Implications of Fund Misuse Legal Ramifications Criminal charges for individuals involved (e.g., embezzlement, breach of trust). Fines and penalties for the company. Potential suspension or revocation of operating licenses for the crypto exchange. Civil lawsuits from shareholders or affected parties. Reputational Damage Loss of trust from users and investors. Negative brand perception and damage to Bithumb’s reputation. Decreased trading volume and market share. Difficulty in attracting new users and partners. Operational Disruptions Ongoing investigation and legal proceedings can distract management and resources. Potential regulatory sanctions may impact daily operations. Increased scrutiny from banks and financial institutions, potentially affecting banking relationships. It’s crucial to remember that these are allegations at this stage, and the investigation is ongoing. However, even the initiation of such a high-profile investigation underscores the risks inherent in the crypto industry and the importance of robust corporate governance. South Korea Crypto Regulation: A Landscape of Increasing Scrutiny The South Korea crypto regulation environment has been evolving rapidly, marked by an increasing focus on consumer protection, anti-money laundering (AML), and market integrity. South Korea was one of the first countries to implement comprehensive regulations for the cryptocurrency sector, demonstrating a proactive approach to managing the risks and opportunities presented by digital assets. Key aspects of South Korea’s crypto regulatory landscape include: Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) Registration: Crypto exchanges operating in South Korea are required to register as VASPs with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU) and comply with stringent AML and KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements. Real-Name Verification: Trading on exchanges typically requires real-name verification for user accounts, aimed at enhancing transparency and preventing illicit activities. Information Security Management System (ISMS) Certification: Exchanges must obtain ISMS certification to demonstrate robust cybersecurity measures and protect user data. Travel Rule Compliance: South Korea has implemented the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel Rule, requiring exchanges to exchange originator and beneficiary information for crypto transactions exceeding a certain threshold. Ongoing Regulatory Development: South Korean regulators continue to refine and expand crypto regulations, adapting to the evolving nature of the market and emerging risks. This includes discussions around investor protection, stablecoin regulation, and DeFi (Decentralized Finance). The Bithumb raid can be seen as part of this broader trend of heightened regulatory scrutiny. It signals that South Korean authorities are not only focused on establishing regulatory frameworks but are also actively enforcing them, particularly when it comes to allegations of financial misconduct and corporate governance failures within crypto exchanges. Impact of the Bithumb Raid on Investor Confidence and Market Stability The immediate aftermath of the Bithumb raid is likely to be felt in investor confidence and market stability, especially within the South Korean crypto market. News of such a significant investigation can create uncertainty and apprehension among investors, potentially leading to market volatility. Potential impacts on investor confidence and market stability include: Short-Term Market Fluctuations: News of the raid could trigger sell-offs or increased trading volatility for Bithumb and potentially other South Korean exchanges as investors react to the uncertainty. Erosion of Trust: Incidents like this can erode the overall trust in cryptocurrency exchanges, particularly among retail investors who may be more risk-averse. Increased Scrutiny of Other Exchanges: The Bithumb case may prompt regulators to intensify their scrutiny of other crypto exchanges in South Korea and globally, leading to further investigations or compliance checks. Potential for Contagion: Negative sentiment surrounding one major exchange can sometimes spread to the broader market, affecting the prices of cryptocurrencies and the overall market capitalization. Long-Term Regulatory Impact: The outcome of the Bithumb investigation could influence future regulatory decisions and enforcement actions in the crypto sector, both in South Korea and internationally. For investors, it is crucial to stay informed, exercise caution, and diversify their holdings to mitigate risks associated with market volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Monitoring developments in the Bithumb case and the broader regulatory landscape is essential for navigating the evolving crypto market. Actionable Insights: Navigating Risks in the Crypto Exchange Landscape The Bithumb raid serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks within the cryptocurrency exchange landscape. While crypto exchanges provide crucial gateways to the digital asset market, they also operate within a complex and often rapidly changing regulatory environment. For users and investors, understanding and mitigating these risks is paramount. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Due Diligence in Exchange Selection: Thoroughly research crypto exchanges before using them. Consider factors such as regulatory compliance, security measures, reputation, transparency, and user reviews. Security Best Practices: Implement robust security practices, including strong passwords, two-factor authentication (2FA), and secure storage of private keys (consider hardware wallets for long-term holdings). Diversification: Do not keep all your crypto assets on a single exchange. Diversify across multiple exchanges and storage solutions to reduce the risk of loss due to exchange-specific issues. Stay Informed about Regulations: Keep abreast of the evolving regulatory landscape in your jurisdiction and the jurisdictions where exchanges you use are based. Regulatory changes can impact exchange operations and user access. Understand Exchange Risks: Be aware of the risks associated with centralized exchanges, including counterparty risk, security breaches, regulatory actions, and potential market manipulation. Consider Decentralized Alternatives: Explore decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and DeFi platforms as alternatives to centralized exchanges, understanding their unique risks and benefits. By taking a proactive and informed approach to engaging with crypto exchanges, users can better navigate the risks and opportunities within this dynamic market. The Bithumb case underscores the need for continuous vigilance and responsible participation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for South Korean Crypto? The Bithumb raid by Seoul prosecutors marks a potentially watershed moment for the South Korean cryptocurrency market and the broader global crypto industry. It highlights the increasing scrutiny that crypto exchanges are facing from regulators worldwide and underscores the critical importance of corporate governance, compliance, and investor protection within this sector. The outcome of this investigation will be closely watched and could set significant precedents for future regulatory actions and industry practices. As the investigation unfolds, the crypto community awaits further details and clarity on the allegations and their potential ramifications. One thing is clear: the era of unchecked growth in the cryptocurrency space is giving way to an era of heightened regulation and accountability. For crypto exchanges, the message is resounding: robust compliance, ethical conduct, and investor protection are no longer optional – they are imperatives for survival and sustainable growth.

As the price kept plunging, the volume increased by more than 40%, which suggests the traders could have turned bearish on PI. Amid the rising attacks on PI on social media platforms and some exchanges refusing to list the token, is there any possibility of the token revamping a strong rebound as it has almost reached the lowest point? Besides, the Pi supply is steadily decreasing due to the removal of transaction fees from circulation. Nearly 528,671 PI had been burned by early March at a rate of 3000-4000 tokens per day, although it has not announced any formal coin burn. The tokens of users who missed the KYC deadline were burned, and hence this deflationary mechanism sparks the speculation of a positive impact on its value. The short-term price action of PI suggests the token has reached one of the lowest points after its mainnet launch. The bearish influence prevails despite the price testing the lower support of the falling wedge. This could point towards an extended bearish action, dragging the levels below $0.65, while the technicals hint towards a potential rebound. The stochastic RSI has reached the oversold zone and if it consolidates as it did in previous times, then the Pi price is expected to remain accumulated at around $1. Besides, if the RSI triggers a bullish rebound, then the token is expected to rise and test the resistance at $1.02 and if it clears these levels, it may enter an important resistance zone between $1.19 and $1.24. Until and unless the Pi Network price does not clear these levels, bearish clouds may continue to haunt the rally with a possibility of plunging to $0.7 or below. The optimism surrounding the PI price rally appears to have been fading quickly as the uncertainty over the open mainnet launch persists. With no clear roadmap and delayed listing by popular exchanges like Binance, it could have shaken the investor’s confidence in the token. Besides, there are no clear timelines; the future of the token remains vague, which raises the speculation that it is a scam. Therefore, the market participants are advised to be vigilant before being conclusive.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|ALTCOIN|BNB|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-21 07:51:12

This marks a continuation of its poor performance, with the coin losing more than 43% of its value over the past week. The excitement surrounding the mainnet launch is quickly fading, and Pi Coin has slipped out of the top 20 cryptocurrencies, down from the 11th spot just last week. What is Causing The Decline? Notably, Pi Coin’s value has declined due to delays in its listing on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Initial optimism surged when these platforms hinted at a potential listing, but the failure to follow through led to a decrease in demand for the coin. Another common concern is the lack of a clear roadmap for the Open Mainnet launch. While other crypto projects offer transparent timelines, Pi Network’s plans remain uncertain, leading to rumors and discussions about whether it’s a scam. Transparency Issues and More Dr. Altcoin, who has been closely involved with Pi Network, clarified that while there is a communication gap, there is no solid evidence to label Pi Network as a scam. However, he emphasized that the Pi Core Team needs to improve transparency and communication to restore investor confidence. In a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), Justin Bons, founder of CyberCapital pointed out several issues with the network. He suggested that contrary to its claims of decentralization, Pi Network remains heavily centralized. 1/9) WARNING: PI is a straight-up scam!

PI is an investment scam; it is that bad: — Justin Bons (@Justin_Bons) March 19, 2025 Justin Bons criticized Pi Network for lack of transparency, claiming insiders might control 20% of the supply. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou also shared similar concerns, labeling it “more dangerous than meme coins.” Bons also criticized the five-year-delayed mainnet launch, calling the network’s promises of innovation and decentralization misleading. He also claimed that Pi Network’s core technology was copied from Stellar (XLM). Token Unlock Ahead, More Decline Further? Pi Coin’s price has dropped significantly, falling below $1.0 ahead of the upcoming token unlocking event. The upcoming release of 129 million Pi coins, worth $140.61 million, is expected to negatively impact the coin’s value. Large token unlocks like this have historically led to price declines.

On March 21, local media Hankyung reported that the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Financial Services Commission is considering sanctions against crypto exchanges for allegedly operating in the country without reporting as an operator to the appropriate regulators. South Korean financial authorities require crypto exchanges to report to regulators as virtual asset service providers (VASPs) under the country’s Specified Financial Information Act. The FIU is investigating a list of exchanges and is conducting consultations with related agencies. The regulator is also considering sanctions, such as blocking access to the exchanges, as they begin to prepare countermeasures. Exchanges operated without VASP reports The list of exchanges that have allegedly provided services to South Koreans without the appropriate VASP reports includes BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix and KCEX. The exchanges reportedly provided marketing and customer support to Korean investors without going through the country’s compliance process. Under the country’s laws, operators of crypto sales, storage, brokerage and management are required to report to the FIU. If exchanges don’t comply, their business will be considered illegal and subject to criminal penalties and administrative sanctions. An FIU official said in the report that measures to block access to the exchanges included in the list are being reviewed. The official said the financial regulator is currently consulting with the Korea Communications Standards Commission, the regulator in charge of the internet, on how they can block access to the exchanges. Related: Wemix denies cover-up amid delayed $6.2M bridge hack announcement South Korean exchanges face scrutiny Apart from foreign exchanges, South Korean crypto exchanges are also facing scrutiny over suspicions and rumors of financial misconduct. On March 20, prosecutors raided Bithumb following suspicions that its former CEO, Kim Dae-sik, embezzled company funds to purchase an apartment. The authorities suspect that the exchange and its executive may have violated some financial laws during the apartment purchase. However, Bithumb responded that Kim had already taken a loan to repay the funds. In addition, rumors of intermediaries getting paid to list projects on Bithumb and Upbit surfaced. Citing anonymous sources, Wu Blockchain said projects claimed to have paid intermediaries millions to get listed on the exchanges. Upbit responded, demanding the media outlet to disclose the list of digital asset projects that paid brokerage fees.

42086322,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142142,1742544025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bold Move: Hong Kong’s EDA Group Dives into $5M Cryptocurrency Investment,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/hong-kong-eda-group-crypto/,"In a surprising turn of events that underscores the growing mainstream acceptance of digital currencies, Hong Kong-listed EDA Group has announced its consideration of a significant foray into the crypto world. Imagine a traditional industrial group stepping into the volatile yet promising realm of cryptocurrency – that’s precisely what EDA Group is contemplating. This potential $5 million investment isn’t just about chasing trends; it’s a strategic move to integrate blockchain technology into their core operations, signaling a possible shift in how businesses perceive and utilize virtual assets. Let’s delve deeper into what this exciting development means and why it could be a game-changer. Why is EDA Group Exploring Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Adoption? EDA Group’s interest in cryptocurrency isn’t a shot in the dark. It’s a calculated step towards leveraging the transformative power of blockchain technology. The company explicitly stated its intention to utilize blockchain to enhance industrial development and streamline payments . But what does this actually mean? Let’s break it down: Enhanced Industrial Development: Blockchain can revolutionize various industrial processes by providing transparency, security, and efficiency. Think about supply chain management, where tracking goods becomes seamless and tamper-proof. For a diversified group like EDA, this could translate to significant operational improvements across different sectors they operate in. Streamlined Payments: Cryptocurrencies offer faster and potentially cheaper cross-border payment solutions compared to traditional banking systems. This is particularly relevant in today’s globalized economy where businesses frequently engage in international transactions. By adopting crypto for payments, EDA Group could reduce transaction costs and improve the speed of financial operations. Future-Proofing Operations: Embracing blockchain and virtual assets isn’t just about immediate gains; it’s about positioning EDA Group at the forefront of technological innovation. As industries increasingly integrate blockchain, early adopters like EDA stand to gain a competitive edge. Setting Up a Dedicated Department for Virtual Asset Operations EDA Group isn’t just dipping its toes in the water; they are planning a full dive. The proposal to establish a dedicated department to oversee virtual asset operations speaks volumes about their commitment. This isn’t a casual side project; it’s a strategic initiative requiring specialized expertise and focused management. Here’s why this dedicated department is crucial: Specialized Expertise: The cryptocurrency market is complex and requires a unique skillset to navigate. A dedicated department ensures that professionals with the necessary knowledge in blockchain, crypto trading, and virtual asset management are at the helm. Risk Management Focus: The announcement explicitly mentions that the department will also manage risks. This is paramount in the volatile crypto market. Effective risk management strategies are essential to protect investments and ensure compliance with evolving regulations. Strategic Development: A dedicated team can focus on developing and implementing a comprehensive virtual asset strategy aligned with EDA Group’s overall business objectives. This includes identifying opportunities, exploring partnerships, and ensuring seamless integration of crypto operations. This proactive approach to virtual asset operations demonstrates that EDA Group is serious about making cryptocurrency a meaningful part of their business strategy, not just a speculative venture. Institutional Crypto Investment: A Growing Trend? EDA Group’s potential investment is part of a larger, more significant trend: the increasing institutional adoption of cryptocurrency. For years, crypto was largely seen as a retail phenomenon, but now, major institutions are entering the fray. Why is this happening, and what does it mean for the future of crypto? Factors Driving Institutional Crypto Investment: Factor Description Maturing Market The cryptocurrency market is becoming more mature with better infrastructure, regulated exchanges, and sophisticated investment tools. Diversification Benefits Crypto assets offer diversification benefits as they often have low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds. Inflation Hedge Some institutions view cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a hedge against inflation, especially in times of economic uncertainty. Technological Innovation The underlying blockchain technology is increasingly recognized for its potential to disrupt and improve various industries. Client Demand Many institutional investors are responding to growing client demand for exposure to digital assets. Examples of institutional crypto adoption are becoming more common. Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have made significant Bitcoin investments. Major financial institutions are offering crypto services and investment products. This growing trend suggests that institutional crypto investment is not just a fad but a fundamental shift in the financial landscape. Challenges and Risks in Hong Kong Crypto Investments While EDA Group’s move is exciting, venturing into Hong Kong crypto investments is not without its challenges and risks. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and regulatory landscapes are still evolving. What are some of the key hurdles EDA Group might face? Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate wildly, leading to potential losses. Managing this volatility is crucial for any institutional investor. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong, and globally, is still developing. Changes in regulations could impact crypto investments and operations. Security Risks: Cybersecurity threats, including hacking and theft, are a significant concern in the crypto space. Robust security measures are essential to protect virtual assets. Operational Complexity: Managing crypto assets, ensuring compliance, and integrating them into existing business processes can be complex and require specialized expertise. Public Perception: Despite growing acceptance, some segments of the public and traditional finance still view cryptocurrencies with skepticism. Managing public perception and ensuring transparency is important. EDA Group’s plan to set up a dedicated risk management department is a clear indication that they are aware of these challenges and are taking proactive steps to mitigate them. Navigating the Hong Kong crypto regulatory environment and implementing robust security protocols will be critical for their success. Actionable Insights: What Can Businesses Learn from EDA Group’s Crypto Consideration? EDA Group’s potential crypto investment offers valuable lessons for other businesses considering entering the virtual asset space. Here are some actionable insights: Strategic Approach is Key: Don’t treat crypto as a speculative side project. Integrate it strategically into your business objectives, whether it’s for enhancing operations, improving payments, or diversifying investments. Dedicated Expertise is Essential: Establish a dedicated team or department with the necessary expertise to manage virtual asset operations and navigate the complexities of the crypto market. Prioritize Risk Management: Develop robust risk management strategies to address market volatility, security threats, and regulatory uncertainties. Focus on Blockchain Utility: Explore how blockchain technology can be applied to improve your industry processes and create new efficiencies beyond just cryptocurrency investment. Stay Informed and Adaptable: The crypto landscape is rapidly evolving. Stay informed about regulatory changes, market trends, and technological advancements, and be prepared to adapt your strategies accordingly. By taking a strategic, informed, and risk-aware approach, businesses can effectively explore the opportunities presented by cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, just as EDA Group is considering. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Future of Finance EDA Group’s consideration of a $5 million cryptocurrency investment is more than just a news headline; it’s a powerful signal of the evolving financial landscape. It highlights the growing acceptance of virtual assets by traditional businesses and underscores the transformative potential of blockchain technology. This bold move by a Hong Kong-listed company could pave the way for more institutional investments in crypto and accelerate the integration of digital currencies into mainstream finance. As EDA Group ventures into this exciting new frontier, the world will be watching closely, learning valuable lessons about the future of money and business in the age of cryptocurrency.

Recently the United States doubled down on crypto development, announcing its intent to build a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. With US dollar-backed stablecoins spreading fast, thanks to Trump’s pro-crypto stance, Europe has already raised red flags over monetary control. Now, China is weighing its options. A recent article by Zhang Ming, a top economist from China’s National Finance and Development Laboratory, highlights the risks of these digital assets strengthening US dollar dominance. The Rising Influence of Dollar Stablecoins Stablecoins pegged to the US dollar have become dominant in crypto trading and decentralized finance (DeFi). Many people in countries with weaker currencies use them as a store of value. Zhang warns that these digital assets could further solidify the US dollar’s global financial power, as they connect the real-world credit of the dollar with the virtual economy. Expanding China’s CBDC Scope One of Zhang’s key suggestions is expanding the use of China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan. Currently, it mainly serves as a digital alternative to cash (M0) for retail transactions. However, Zhang suggests that it should also cover bank deposits (M1 and M2) and business transactions. Although China has already conducted some business-to-business (B2B) cross-border CBDC payments, Zhang believes the digital yuan must go further to counter the rise of dollar-backed stablecoins. He did not mention mBridge, China’s existing cross-border CBDC project, which has international ambitions but also faces concerns over its involvement with sanctioned countries like Russia. China’s Stablecoin Potential Another option is for China to develop its own stablecoins. Zhang views this as an unexplored area, but China has already started experimenting—mainly through Hong Kong. The region has approved several crypto exchanges, launched a stablecoin regulatory sandbox, and recently saw Standard Chartered form a stablecoin venture with Animoca Brands and Hong Kong Telecom. To strengthen the Chinese yuan’s international role, Zhang suggests leveraging major Chinese platforms like Ant Group’s Alipay and Ant International. These companies already have a strong presence in Asia and beyond. By integrating digital tokens into their global payment networks, China could boost the yuan’s influence and counterbalance the dominance of US dollar stablecoins. US-China Tech War and the Future The rivalry between China and the US is not just about trade but also about technology. While the US supports innovation in the crypto space, China is focusing on government-controlled digital finance. This difference in approach could shape the future of global finance. If China’s strategy succeeds, it may change how international transactions are conducted. However, widespread adoption of the digital yuan will take time, and it remains to be seen whether it can truly challenge the US dollar. China’s crypto strategy is a clear sign of its ambitions to reshape global finance. Whether it succeeds or not, it is already influencing how nations view digital currencies and financial independence.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|FIAT|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-21 08:02:38

On March 20, the Treasury released a new policy paper outlining plans to bring key parts of the digital asset industry under existing financial services laws. According to authorities, the regulations would help “identify opportunities, manage risks, unlock innovation, protect consumers and uphold market integrity.” Under the proposed framework, crypto platforms that hold digital assets for customers, such as exchanges, custodians, and certain brokerages, will need to operate under an Australian Financial Services Licence. Platforms that deal in tokenized stored-value facilities, such as some stablecoin issuers, will also be brought into the fold. These issuers will need to meet the same requirements as other stored-value providers, including clear rules for redeeming value and safeguarding customer assets. Authorities noted that this approach would “address the unique risks of [Digital Asset Platforms] and Tokenised SVFs,” with additional disclosure rules to be implemented for tokens that don’t have clear issuers. However, businesses that create digital assets for non-financial purposes, maintain infrastructure or build blockchain software won’t be regulated under the new laws.

Stablecoins used for payments will face oversight similar to that of traditional non-cash payment systems, as they’ll be treated as stored-value facilities under the broader payments reform. However, dealing in these tokens or trading them on secondary markets won’t automatically count as financial dealing. The platforms involved in such trades won’t be considered financial markets simply because they list stablecoins or wrapped tokens. A draft law is expected to drop sometime in 2025, with rollout dates to be confirmed once the legislation is finalized. Addressing debanking in Australia The government also addressed the growing problem of de-banking, where crypto businesses are denied banking services. Officials said they’re working closely with Australia’s major banks to “understand the extent and nature of de-banking.” In recent years, de-banking has become a major headache for crypto firms in Australia, with big players like Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, NAB, and HSBC Australia cutting off or restricting services to such entities. “De-banking can have a devastating impact on de-banked businesses and individuals. It can also stifle competition and innovation in the financial services sector and negatively impact Australia’s economy,” authorities noted, adding that the proposed framework would strengthen risk management across the crypto sector and, in turn, improve trust with banks. Looking ahead, regulators will also explore how tokenisation could reshape asset markets, assess crypto tax reporting standards, monitor DeFi developments, and weigh the potential benefits of a central bank digital currency for Australia’s financial system.

According to a Mar. 20 post on X by Tether chief executive officer Paolo Ardoino, Tether ( USDT ) purchased a net $33.1 billion in U.S. Treasuries last year. This put it ahead of countries like Germany, Canada, and Mexico. In a separate post, Ardoino also noted that Tether’s global presence has grown rapidly, with USDT adoption surpassing 400 million users, mostly in developing nations. https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1902689997766922318?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw As of Mar. 21, USDT leads the stablecoin market with 62.45% of the $230 billion total supply, according to DeFiLlama data .

A proposed stablecoin bill could limit offshore issuers from accessing U.S. Treasury markets. U.S.-based competitors like USDC may gain from this bill at the expense of Tether. Nevertheless, Ardoino is still optimistic about Tether’s role in the U.S. Treasury market. During a Mar. 11 event hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, Ardoino made the case that Tether’s investments strengthen and diversify the U.S. debt markets. “We’ve done more for financial inclusion than anyone else,” he said. “And while doing that, we’re buying back U.S. debt. If we were a country, we’d be the 18th largest holder of U.S. Treasuries.” Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent continue to push for stablecoin-friendly policies, stressing their role in maintaining the dollar’s global dominance.

A significant shift is underway in the regulatory landscape. The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), under the watchful eye of South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC), has initiated strong enforcement actions. Their target? Overseas crypto exchanges operating within South Korea without proper registration. This move signals a serious escalation in how South Korea is approaching the regulation of digital assets, and it could have far-reaching implications for both users and exchanges alike. Let’s dive into the details of this developing situation. What’s the Buzz About Korean Crypto Exchange Regulations? The core issue revolves around registration. According to a report in The Korea Economic Daily, the FIU is cracking down on overseas platforms that are serving Korean users without being registered under the Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information. Think of it as needing a license to operate within South Korean financial territory. This isn’t just a minor procedural matter; it’s about compliance with local laws designed to protect users and maintain financial integrity. Which exchanges are in the crosshairs? The report names some prominent players in the global crypto exchange arena: BitMEX KuCoin CoinW Bitunix KCEX These are not small, obscure platforms. They are exchanges with significant global reach, indicating the seriousness of the FIU’s enforcement efforts. The primary enforcement measure being considered is website access blocks. Imagine waking up one day and finding you can no longer access your preferred exchange – that’s the potential reality for Korean users of these unregistered exchanges . Why is the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) Taking Such Decisive Action? The FIU’s actions are rooted in the need to enforce crypto regulations and ensure a level playing field. The Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information is the legal backbone for this enforcement. But why is this law so important in the context of cryptocurrency? Here’s a breakdown: Combating Illicit Activities : Unregistered exchanges can be breeding grounds for illegal activities like money laundering, terrorist financing, and tax evasion. Registration and oversight help to mitigate these risks. Investor Protection : Registered exchanges are subject to regulatory scrutiny, which includes measures to protect users’ funds and data. This protection is often absent with unregistered platforms. Fair Market Practices : Regulations promote fair trading practices and transparency, ensuring that all market participants operate under the same rules. National Financial Security : By regulating crypto exchanges, the FIU aims to maintain the integrity and stability of the national financial system, preventing unregulated entities from undermining it. In essence, the FIU’s enforcement is about bringing order and accountability to the rapidly evolving crypto space within South Korea. It’s about safeguarding the financial system and protecting Korean citizens who are engaging with cryptocurrencies. Impact on Korean Crypto Users and Unregistered Exchanges This enforcement action has significant implications for both Korean users and the targeted unregistered exchanges . For Korean Users: Potential Access Restrictions : The most immediate concern is the potential blocking of website access. This could lock Korean users out of their accounts on these exchanges, making it difficult to manage or withdraw their assets. Need to Shift to Registered Exchanges : Korean users may need to transition to using locally registered exchanges to ensure uninterrupted access to crypto trading and services. This might involve account closures and asset transfers. Increased Awareness of Regulatory Compliance : This action serves as a strong reminder to Korean crypto users about the importance of using regulated platforms and being aware of local crypto regulations . For Unregistered Exchanges: Reputational Damage : Being targeted by a major financial regulator can significantly damage an exchange’s reputation and erode user trust. Loss of Korean Market Share : Website blocks mean losing access to the Korean market, which is a significant crypto market globally. Pressure to Comply or Exit : Exchanges will face pressure to either comply with Korean regulations by registering or to withdraw from serving Korean users altogether. Registration can be a complex and costly process. Global Regulatory Scrutiny : This action from South Korea could set a precedent and encourage other jurisdictions to take similar enforcement measures against unregistered exchanges . Navigating the Complexities of Cryptocurrency Enforcement Globally South Korea’s move is not happening in isolation. Globally, we are seeing a trend of increased regulatory scrutiny and cryptocurrency enforcement . Governments and financial watchdogs worldwide are grappling with how to regulate the decentralized and often borderless nature of cryptocurrencies. Challenges in Crypto Regulation: Cross-border Nature : Cryptocurrencies operate globally, making it challenging for individual nations to regulate them effectively. Exchanges can easily operate from jurisdictions with lax regulations. Technological Complexity : The underlying technology of cryptocurrencies is complex, making it difficult for regulators to fully understand and regulate all aspects of the ecosystem. Balancing Innovation and Control : Regulators need to strike a balance between fostering innovation in the crypto space and mitigating risks. Overly strict regulations can stifle innovation, while lax regulations can lead to financial instability and illicit activities. Evolving Landscape : The crypto space is constantly evolving with new technologies, applications, and business models emerging rapidly. Regulations need to be adaptable to keep pace with this evolution. Despite these challenges, the trend is clear: regulatory oversight of the crypto industry is here to stay and is likely to intensify. South Korea’s enforcement action is a strong signal of this global trend. Staying Ahead: Actionable Insights for Crypto Participants In this evolving regulatory environment, what should crypto users and businesses do to stay ahead of the curve? For Crypto Users: Prioritize Registered Exchanges : When choosing a crypto exchange, especially if you are based in or accessing services from a specific jurisdiction like South Korea, opt for platforms that are registered and compliant with local regulations. Stay Informed About Regulations : Keep yourself updated on the latest crypto regulations in your jurisdiction and any jurisdictions where you use crypto services. Regulatory changes can impact your access and usage. Diversify Your Holdings : Don’t keep all your crypto assets on a single exchange, especially an unregistered one. Diversification across multiple platforms, including registered ones, can mitigate risks. Understand KYC/AML Requirements : Be prepared to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements on regulated platforms. This is part of the regulatory framework to ensure compliance and security. For Crypto Exchanges (especially overseas platforms): Assess Regulatory Compliance Needs : If you are serving users in specific jurisdictions like South Korea, proactively assess your compliance requirements and take steps to register or comply with local regulations. Engage with Regulators : Maintain open communication with regulatory bodies and seek guidance on compliance matters. Proactive engagement can help navigate complex regulatory landscapes. Enhance Compliance Infrastructure : Invest in robust KYC/AML compliance infrastructure and processes to meet regulatory standards and build trust with users and regulators. Geographic Strategy Review : Re-evaluate your geographic strategy in light of increasing regulatory scrutiny. Decide whether to invest in compliance for specific markets or adjust your market focus. Conclusion: A New Era of Crypto Regulation Dawns in South Korea South Korea’s forceful action against unregistered exchanges marks a significant moment in the evolution of crypto regulations . It underscores the growing global determination to bring the crypto industry under regulatory oversight. For Korean crypto users, it’s a wake-up call to prioritize registered platforms and stay informed about compliance. For overseas exchanges, it’s a clear signal that operating in major markets like South Korea requires adherence to local laws and regulations. The era of operating outside the regulatory framework is rapidly closing, and a new era of compliance and accountability is dawning in the world of cryptocurrency.

His high profile and support for the industry have resulted in massive price rallies for his supporter cryptocurrencies. One such event is today, as the Kekius Maximus, an Ethereum meme coin, is flourishing with price gains under the same influence, surging nearly 100%. But what exactly happened, and will the rally continue? Elon Musk’s Post Sparks Kekius Maximus Price Rally This Thursday, Elon Musk posted on X , giving his followers a look into his office set up at the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). However, more than his role in establishing a D.O.G.E., his wall and the caption gained attention, as he displayed a painting of the famous frog theme meme coin, Kekius Maximus, and added ‘My DOGE office with the late great Kekius Maximus on the wall,’ resulting in the immediate price jump of the token. This resulted in a massive 110% price jump from $0.015 to $0.033 within a few hours. At the same time, the trading volume surged from $4.15M to $15.5, displaying high investors attention. Although the token has moved down the peak and trades at $0.02717, it has maintained a 40% surge over the last 24 hours and nearly 100% over the week. Not the First Kekius Maximus Price Surge Due to Elon Musk News Kekius Maximus has a history of volatility in Musk’s influence. In January, the token’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.40, marking nearly a 40,000% surge within a few hours. This happened when Musk adopted the Kekius meme coin briefly and set it as his profile picture on X. Interestingly, even before this, he had posted and described the image of “Pepe the Frog Emperor” as “amazing.” This left investors and early adopters of the token in heavy profits, where one made 17,000% returns on their investment. However, this Kekius price rally was short-lived and ended once he changed his profile picture again. As a result, the token tumbled, losing 92% of its value. Ever since then, it has been in a significant consolidation. This leaves investors in doubt about whether this bullish trajectory will continue. Will Kekius Maximus Price Rally Sustain? The Elon Musk effect on meme coins is a known phenomenon, where his endorsements or talks influenced these asset prices. The leading meme-themed cryptocurrencies affected by him are Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and now Kekius Maximus. Although the current surge is impressive, such rallies are short-lived as the hype ends soon. More importantly, those who benefitted from the hype ended up selling their tokens for profit, resulting in selling pressure and a downtrend. However, it is uncertain how well this rally will be sustained, as some analysts argue about a downtrend like the last time, whereas others supporting the Musk-fueled rally believe in a further uptrend. Regardless, Musk’s further involvement is important for the continuity of the surge.

Here Are Those Exchanges,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/south-korea-launches-investigation-into-five-major-cryptocurrency-exchanges-operating-in-the-country-here-are-those-exchanges/,"South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has initiated an enforcement process against several international cryptocurrency exchanges operating illegally in the country without proper registration. South Korea's FIU Moves to Sanction Unregistered Crypto Exchanges FIU is also considering blocking access to these platforms in cooperation with the Korea Communications Standards Commission (KCSC). According to local reports, the exchanges included on the sanctions list are BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix and KCEX. These platforms are accused of violating South Korea’s anti-money laundering (AML) and financial regulations by operating without the necessary approvals. South Korea's regulatory framework requires all crypto exchanges to register with the FIU and adhere to strict AML policies. Platforms that fail to do so are considered illegal operators and could face serious penalties, including access restrictions and criminal charges. To ensure compliance, the FIU is reportedly working with the KCSC to block website access to blacklisted exchanges, preventing South Korean users from trading on these platforms. South Korea’s Strict Stance on Crypto Regulations The move is in line with South Korea's broader regulatory crackdown on the cryptocurrency industry, aimed at protecting investors and preventing financial crimes. Authorities have taken similar steps in the past, including delisting non-compliant exchanges and tightening AML enforcement on both domestic and foreign trading platforms. While the timeline for sanctions and website restrictions remains unclear, the FIU's latest action signals a firm stance against unregulated cryptocurrency activities in South Korea. *This is not investment advice.

Overall crypto market capitalization fell 3.2% in the past 24 hours, with BTC sliding from $86,000 to under $84,000, ether (ETH) dropping below $2,000 and Solana's SOL falling 5%. XRP showed steady declines bringing Wednesday’s 10% spike to a 4.8% gain over a weekly basis, while BNB Chain’s BNB continued to edge higher, bringing weekly gains to over 8%. At press time, Tron’s TRX and TON were the only major tokens in the green, rising 2% each. TRX was floated on Solana for the first time ever on late Thursday in an attempt to expand its user base. TON saw retail demand after the Toncoin Foundation said that venture capital firms now hold over $400 million worth of the asset after fresh investments. Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting delivered a brief upside catalyst markets had been waiting for, propelling BTC past $85,000 as no rate cuts were announced. However, the Fed said it would scale back its “quantitative tightening” program starting in April which traders likely interpreted as an indirect rate cut, Singapore-based QCP Capital noted in a Telegram broadcast. Options markets have started to position accordingly. “The chance of BTC reaching above $100K by June 30 has increased from 20% to nearly 30% in the last 24 hours,” Dr. Sean Dawson, head of research at onchain options platform derive.xyz, told CoinDesk in an email. “While the probability of ETH remaining above $2000 by June 30 is now a coin flip – was 40% 24 hours ago. Nearly 60% of ETH options traded on Derive.xyz in the last 24 hours were calls bought, indicating a bullish sentiment. For BTC, 34% of all volume was bought, reflecting demand for downside protection,” Dawson added. FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich, who eyes the $80,000 support level as a critical area to watch for a break of support, maintained a cautious tone. “It’s important to note that the crypto market has yet to break above its 200-day moving average, currently sitting close to $2.9 trillion. A strong rally above this level could trigger an active buying phase, but there’s also a risk of bears setting up a trap, as they’ve done several times before,” Kuptsikevich said in a Telegram message. “For bitcoin to maintain momentum, staying above this key level is crucial. If it does, it could spark renewed interest in buying a variety of coins that have been in a correction phase for a while,” he added, referring to broader altcoin and memecoin markets.",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|Solana|TRX|TON|XRP,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|SOL|TON,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-21 08:14:48

The country’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has identified multiple platforms illegally functioning in the country. Reportedly, crypto exchanges such as KuCoin and BitMEX face increased scrutiny for failing to register as virtual asset service providers (VASPs) under the Specific Financial Information Act. South Korea Targets Unregistered Crypto Exchanges As part of South Korea’s crypto regulatory efforts, the Financial Intelligence Unit has cracked down on multiple crypto exchanges alleged of illegally operating in the country. These platforms include BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix, and KCEX. While these exchanges have reportedly failed to register as virtual asset service providers (VASPs) under the Specific Financial Information Act, they face increased scrutiny. They have been found to be operating Korean websites, targeting local investors with marketing and customer support, all without proper registration or disclosure. An FIU official revealed that the regulator is currently analyzing measures to block access to these crypto exchanges. They further cited, We are currently reviewing access blocking measures for unreported overseas exchanges that are providing services to domestic investors through consultation with the Korea Communications Standards Commission. We are organizing damage cases and related data to strengthen communication between the authorities, and we expect to take tangible measures within this year. Kucoin and Other Major Exchanges Targeted for Sanctions According to local reports, South Korea crypto exchanges such as BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix, and KCEX are deemed as illegally operating in the country. As they have failed to adhere to proper regulatory norms, the FIU targets them for sanctions. Notably, the financial watchdog has initiated procedures to take proper actions against these crypto exchanges. With intense scrutiny, the FIU is consulting with relevant organizations to proceed further. This development follows the nation’s recent rejection of the notion of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The Bank of Korea has dismissed the possibility of adopting a crypto reserve citing its volatile nature and inherent risks. In addition, the Bank of Korea is currently experimenting with its CBDC project . The central bank will launch a CBDC pilot program in April, possibly lasting for three months. South Korea’s Crypto Regulations: An Overview The country has been introducing comprehensive measures to oversee the crypto industry. The country’s main objective is to maintain a balance between market growth and user protection. Recently, the country announced its decision to implement solid anti-money laundering regulations.

Notably, the leading exchanges often have great influence in the market and any major announcement from them could impact the asset’s prices. For context, the exchange has recently extended its support for Broccoli and other cryptocurrencies. Following its announcement, all the crypto prices have skyrocketed, reflecting the heavy influence of the exchange. Considering that, the latest delisting announcement could trigger a widespread selloff of the mentioned tokens. Meanwhile, the crypto exchange said that it often conducts periodic evaluations to ensure compliance with industry standards. Failing to meet the criteria results in the delisting of the tokens. The exchange mentioned several aspects behind its delisting decision like project commitment, trading liquidity, regulatory concerns, and security risks. A Closer Look Into The Binance Announcement The exchange will halt trading for AERGO, AST, BURGER, COMBO, and LINA starting March 28 at 03:00 UTC. Several key services, including futures contracts, margin trading, and staking options, will be stopped before the official removal date. Notably: Binance Futures will close all positions and conduct an automatic settlement for AERGOUSDT, COMBOUSDT, and LINAUSDT perpetual contracts on March 27 at 09:00 UTC. Margin Trading for the affected tokens will be disabled from March 26 at 06:00 UTC, with users advised to close positions before liquidation. Deposits of these tokens will not be credited after March 29, and withdrawals will be unsupported after May 27. In addition, the exchange said that it will introduce a Vote to Delist feature, allowing the community to have a say in future delisting decisions. However, the current batch of delisted tokens will not be part of this initiative. How These Five Tokens Are Performing? AERGO price was down more than 6% to $0.06845 following the Binance announcement, with its trading volume soaring 43% to $30.46 million. On the other hand, AST price plunged about 28% to $0.03375 with its one-day volume rocketing 88% to $5.25 million. Simultaneously, BURGER price retreated 48% to $0.1127 while COMBO price declined 20%. Linear Finance price also recorded a slump of over 32%, indicating the waning market interest in the tokens.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Credible Crypto tells his 462,900 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may reclaim the $100,000 range if BTC can break through resistance around the $88,000 level. “We’re at a key inflection point around this region, but since we went up to tag it BEFORE going down to range lows this is a good sign. It increases the odds that if we reject here but hold range lows [at around $78,000], the next move up will be expansion and a true breakout through not just this level but the original supply zone above in RED that we first rejected from. All eyes on this key zone for now.” Source: Credible Crypto/X The analyst says Bitcoin’s dip to the $84,000 range after tagging $87,000 on Thursday keeps the flagship crypto asset on target to reclaim the $100,000 level. “A perfect rejection so far.” Source: Credible Crypto/X Bitcoin is trading for $84,427 at time of writing, down 1.5% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst suggests payments token XRP may dip below $2.00 before rallying to its all-time high of about $3.40. “This is still the game plan for XRP by the way. If we don’t get it, we don’t get it, and we ride spot to double digits regardless. But I’m not interested in jumping into fresh longs mid-range. Hoping people choose to fade this push so we get what would be a fantastic opportunity.” Source: Credible Crypto/X XRP is trading for $2.45 at time of writing, down 1.7% in the last 24 hours.

42089065,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=697260,1742548519,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42089065.jpeg,"Tesla (TSLA) heads for 9th straight red week, its longest losing streak ever",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tesla-tsla-9th-red-week-streak/,"Tesla is heading into its ninth straight weekly loss, making this its longest losing streak in history. The drop started early this year and hasn’t stopped. As of this week, shares are down 42% in 2025, wiping out every gain the company made after the presidential election. That’s according to data tracked through Thursday’s close. The stock fell again on Thursday, dipping by as much as 2.5% after Tesla said it was recalling 46,000 Cybertrucks. The issue was tied to a cosmetic panel on the truck’s exterior, which could boost crash risks. The company filed the recall with U.S. regulators and notified owners directly. Schlossberg says Tesla’s fall isn’t over Speaking Thursday on CNBC’s Power Lunch , Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, said the stock hasn’t bottomed out yet. He said Tesla is still being priced like a futuristic tech company, even though it hasn’t delivered what’s been promised for years. “Tesla has further to fall,” Boris said . “It has been treated as a tech fantasy on autonomous driving. But the longer it takes to crack autonomous driving, the more the market will treat it like a regular car company.” Boris said the company’s whole value rests on hopes of full autonomy. If that doesn’t happen soon, traders and institutions will stop pricing in tech-style growth and will start treating it like a carmaker with tight margins. “Valuation and everything else at Tesla is really dependent upon this dream of autonomous driving,” Boris said. “Until they actually achieve it, [the stock] could be rerated as purely a core car company. And the car business is a tough business — it has much lower multiples than Tesla is getting — so there’s so much more compression to go in Tesla, unless it really achieves a breakthrough. So at this point, I think it’s really not a buy.” Boris also mentioned other companies during that segment. He said he’s currently holding Five Below, the discount retailer. When asked about Cava, a Mediterranean fast-casual chain, Boris said, “Love the business, hate the stock.” That came just hours before JPMorgan issued an upgrade on Cava, telling investors to buy the stock following its recent pullback. Back on Wall Street, traders weren’t in the mood to buy anything. On Thursday, the S&P 500 lost 0.2%, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3%, and the Dow slipped just over 11 points. That weakness rolled straight into Friday morning. Futures for all major indexes were down, with the S&P 500 off 0.41%, Dow futures down 180 points, and the Nasdaq 100 sliding 0.46%. Musk talks to employees as FBI investigates sabotage While investors watch the price charts, things behind the scenes are also getting weird. Late Thursday night, Elon Musk called a surprise all-hands meeting at Tesla’s Austin factory, where he spoke directly to employees. The meeting ran past 10 p.m. local time and was live-streamed on X, the social media platform Musk owns. Elon told employees to stay calm and hold onto their stock. “If you read the news, it feels like Armageddon,” he said during the live meeting. “I can’t walk past a TV without seeing a Tesla on fire. I understand if you don’t want to buy our product, but you don’t have to burn it down.” He was talking about a string of attacks and fires at Tesla charging stations and dealerships. The FBI is investigating incidents in Las Vegas, Kansas City, and Missouri, where equipment was set on fire or damaged. So far, no arrests have been made. No suspects have been named either. This wasn’t some PR stunt. Elon looked serious. He tried to reassure workers while also pushing them to stay focused. “There are times when there are rocky moments, a little bit of stormy weather but I’m here to tell you the future is bright and exciting,” he said. The outside noise isn’t helping either. Donald Trump, now in his second term as president, said this week that he’s buying a Tesla himself. He even brought a bunch of Tesla EVs to the White House South Lawn. There was no official event—just a drive-up and photo op. Nothing else was announced. Then came the interview on Fox News with Howard Lutnick, the U.S. Commerce Secretary. He told viewers to buy Tesla stock while it’s cheap. “It’ll never be this cheap again,” Howard said on live TV. That led to questions about whether his comments broke federal conflict of interest rules, since government officials aren’t supposed to promote individual companies publicly. On the macro side, traders are still trying to process the latest Fed update. On Wednesday, Fed policymakers confirmed two rate cuts are still on the table for 2025. But at the same time, they raised their inflation forecast and lowered their GDP growth expectations. That combo is causing some investors to worry about stagflation—where inflation keeps rising but the economy slows down. Fed Chair Jerome Powell also said that Trump’s tariff policies could delay progress on inflation. That inflation warning has already hit stocks hard. The Nasdaq is still sitting more than 10% below its recent peak, which qualifies as correction territory. The S&P 500 briefly dipped into correction last week too. Even so, there are some small bright spots on the indexes. The S&P 500 is still on pace to finish the week up 0.4%. The Dow is heading for a 1.1% gain, which would be its best weekly performance since January. But the Nasdaq? It’s down 0.4% for the week and is about to finish its fifth straight red week, the worst run since May 2022. As for Tesla, this ninth straight red week could easily stretch into a tenth if something doesn’t change fast. The Cybertruck recall, the sabotage incidents, the valuation pressure, and the autonomy delays are all crashing into the stock at once. The hype isn’t working anymore.

No longer confined to the crypto ecosystem, stablecoins are making bold moves into mainstream finance, promising to reshape how businesses and individuals manage and move money. Are you ready to witness the financial revolution powered by stablecoins? Unlocking Mainstream Adoption of Stablecoins: A New Era for Finance Recent insights from The Block, highlighted in a Foresight Ventures report, underscore a significant trend: stablecoins are rapidly transitioning from niche crypto assets to essential components of the broader financial infrastructure. This shift is not just incremental; it’s a fundamental evolution driven by the compelling advantages stablecoins offer to both crypto-native users and traditional financial participants. The report emphasizes that future growth hinges on this wider mainstream adoption , signaling a powerful vote of confidence in the technology. What’s fueling this surge in adoption? Several key factors are at play: Real-World Use Cases: Stablecoins are no longer just for trading crypto. They are finding practical applications in everyday transactions, cross-border payments, and corporate treasury management. Infrastructure Development: Companies like Stripe, a global payments giant, are now supporting USDC payments, demonstrating a serious commitment to integrating stablecoins into existing financial rails. Growing Ecosystem: Web3 payment providers like Helio are showcasing impressive user growth, boasting 450,000 active wallets and 6,000 merchants. These numbers are not just figures; they represent real-world adoption and utility. Why the Shift to Traditional Finance? Exploring the Benefits of Stablecoins Why are stablecoins making such significant inroads into traditional finance ? The answer lies in the unique advantages they bring to the table. Let’s delve into the core benefits that are driving this integration: For Consumers: Enhanced Liquidity and Yield Opportunities Increased Liquidity: Holding assets on-chain via stablecoins offers users greater control and faster access to their funds. Say goodbye to lengthy settlement times and limited banking hours. Yield Generation: The decentralized finance (DeFi) space opens up avenues for earning yield on stablecoins through staking, lending, and other protocols. This can potentially offer returns that are significantly higher than traditional savings accounts. Accessibility: Stablecoins can provide financial access to underserved populations who may not have easy access to traditional banking services. For Businesses: Streamlined Operations and Cost Savings Optimized Cross-Border Transactions: Stablecoins can dramatically reduce the costs and complexities associated with international payments. Faster settlement times and lower fees compared to traditional wire transfers make them an attractive alternative for global businesses. Automated Payments: Smart contracts and blockchain technology enable the automation of payments, reducing manual processes and potential errors. This can lead to significant efficiency gains in accounts payable and receivable. Transparency and Traceability: Blockchain’s inherent transparency provides a clear audit trail for all transactions, enhancing accountability and reducing the risk of fraud. Stablecoins Reshaping Corporate Financial Management: A Paradigm Shift The impact of stablecoins extends beyond individual users and payment processing; they are poised to revolutionize crypto ecosystem and corporate financial management. Businesses are increasingly recognizing the strategic value of incorporating stablecoins into their financial operations. Here’s how stablecoins are reshaping the corporate finance landscape: Area of Corporate Finance Impact of Stablecoins Benefits Asset Optimization Stablecoins enable efficient management of digital assets and seamless conversion between crypto and fiat. Improved treasury management, reduced volatility exposure. KYC/AML Processes Integration of KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance tools within stablecoin platforms. Enhanced security and regulatory compliance, reduced risk of illicit activities. Revenue Generation Expanded on-chain revenue opportunities through DeFi participation and new business models. Diversification of revenue streams, access to new markets and customer segments. Payment Solutions Evolved: Stablecoins as the Future of Transactions At their core, stablecoins are fundamentally transforming payment solutions . They offer a compelling blend of stability and the advantages of blockchain technology, positioning them as a powerful alternative to traditional payment methods. Consider these key advancements in payment solutions driven by stablecoins: Programmable Money: Stablecoins can be programmed via smart contracts to execute complex payment logic and conditional transactions, opening up entirely new possibilities for automated and customized payments. Instant Settlement: Unlike traditional payment systems that can take days to settle, stablecoin transactions are typically settled within minutes, or even seconds, providing near-instant finality. Global Accessibility: Stablecoins transcend geographical boundaries, enabling seamless and cost-effective payments across borders, regardless of banking infrastructure limitations. Challenges and Considerations: Navigating the Road Ahead While the potential of stablecoins is immense, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that lie ahead. Regulatory clarity remains a key factor. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to regulate stablecoins, and the evolving regulatory landscape will significantly impact their adoption and growth. Furthermore, ensuring robust security and scalability of stablecoin infrastructure is paramount to maintain user trust and facilitate widespread adoption. Interoperability between different stablecoin networks and traditional financial systems is also crucial for seamless integration. Conclusion: The Dawn of a Stablecoin-Powered Financial Future Stablecoins are not just a fleeting trend; they represent a paradigm shift in the financial landscape. Their expansion into traditional financial infrastructure is accelerating, driven by compelling benefits for consumers, businesses, and the broader financial ecosystem. As adoption continues to grow and regulatory frameworks mature, stablecoins are poised to play an increasingly pivotal role in shaping the future of finance. The integration of stablecoins marks a significant step towards a more efficient, accessible, and innovative financial world. Embrace the change – the stablecoin revolution is here.

At the time of writing, ETH is trading near $1,976, but bears are attempting to drive the price lower. If sellers manage to break below $1,950, ETH could decline to $1,872, and a further increase in selling pressure might push it down to $1,800 before any meaningful recovery occurs. Bulls Eye Above $2,000 If buyers successfully defend $1,950, Ethereum (ETH) may gain momentum to retest the psychological resistance at $2,000. A breakout above this key level could fuel a rally towards $2,075, where the latest pullback began. If ETH surpasses this hurdle, it could extend gains to $2,150 or even $2,225, strengthening the bullish outlook. Should Ethereum (ETH) sustain bullish momentum beyond $2,225, it might trigger a rally toward the highly anticipated $3,000 level. However, achieving this milestone would require strong market participation and sustained buying pressure.

42089388,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142174,1742549151,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Report: Korean Crypto Lender Delio’s Shocking $258M Bankruptcy Exposes Creditor Crisis,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/delio-crypto-lender-bankruptcy-report/,"In a dramatic turn of events shaking the Asian cryptocurrency landscape, South Korean crypto lending platform Delio has disclosed a staggering debt of $258.7 million (378.7 billion won). This revelation, brought to light by bankruptcy trustee Jung Dong-hyun, has sent shockwaves through the crypto community, leaving creditors in a state of uncertainty. Let’s delve into the details of this developing crypto lender bankruptcy saga and understand the implications for investors and the wider market. What Triggered the Delio Crypto Lender Bankruptcy? While the full picture is still unfolding, the bankruptcy declaration points to significant financial distress within Delio. According to the exclusive report by Digital Asset, the bankruptcy trustee, representing law firm Hyunwoo, presented alarming figures at the first creditors’ meeting. As of March 12, the total registered bankruptcy claims reached a colossal 378.66 billion won. This sum breaks down into: Cash Claims: 15.62 billion won (approximately $10.6 million) across 48 cases. Virtual Asset Return Claims: 363.04 billion won (approximately $248.1 million) spanning 1,162 cases. These figures paint a stark picture of the magnitude of Delio’s financial woes. The exchange rate used for conversion is from November 22, 2024, the date bankruptcy was officially declared. The sheer volume of claims for virtual asset returns suggests a significant portion of the debt is tied to users’ cryptocurrency holdings on the platform. Understanding the Impact of Delio Bankruptcy on Creditors The immediate concern for many is, understandably, the fate of the creditors. With claims totaling $258.7 million, the question on everyone’s mind is: Will creditors recover their funds? Here’s what we know and what it could mean for those affected: Significant Debt Burden: The sheer size of the debt indicates a potentially lengthy and complex bankruptcy process. Recovery prospects will depend on the value of Delio’s remaining assets and the legal proceedings. Uncertainty for Virtual Asset Holders: A large portion of the claims are for the return of virtual assets. The volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets adds another layer of complexity. The value of assets at the time of bankruptcy declaration versus the time of potential distribution could vary significantly. Legal Battles Ahead: With over 1,200 cases registered, legal proceedings are expected to be intricate and potentially drawn-out. Creditors will likely need to navigate a complex legal landscape to pursue their claims. Precedent in South Korea: This Korean crypto news development adds to the growing concerns surrounding the stability of crypto lending platforms, particularly in South Korea, a region with a significant crypto investor base. Delio and the Broader Crypto Lending Platform Landscape Delio’s predicament is not an isolated incident. The crypto lending platform sector has faced increasing scrutiny and challenges, especially after market downturns and high-profile collapses in the past year. What lessons can be learned from this situation? Challenges Highlighted by Delio’s Bankruptcy: Risk Management in Crypto Lending: The case underscores the inherent risks associated with crypto lending platforms. High yields often come with elevated risks, and users need to be acutely aware of these trade-offs. Regulatory Scrutiny: Incidents like Delio’s bankruptcy are likely to accelerate regulatory discussions and potentially lead to stricter oversight of crypto lending platforms globally, and particularly in South Korea. Transparency Concerns: The lack of transparency in some crypto lending platforms’ operations and risk management practices is a significant concern. Users often have limited visibility into how their assets are managed and the risks involved. Contagion Risk: Failures in one part of the crypto ecosystem can have ripple effects. The Delio situation could impact investor confidence in other similar platforms, potentially leading to further instability. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Amidst Crypto Debt Concerns In the wake of Delio’s crypto debt crisis, what steps can crypto investors take to protect themselves and navigate this volatile landscape? Diversification is Key: Avoid concentrating your crypto holdings on a single platform, especially for lending purposes. Diversify across different platforms and asset types. Due Diligence is Crucial: Thoroughly research any crypto lending platform before entrusting them with your assets. Understand their risk management practices, security measures, and regulatory compliance. Risk Assessment: Evaluate your risk tolerance. High-yield crypto lending inherently carries risks. Only allocate funds you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of korean crypto news and global regulatory developments in the crypto space. Regulatory changes can significantly impact the operations and viability of crypto platforms. Consider Cold Storage: For long-term holdings, consider moving your crypto assets to cold storage wallets where you have complete control over your private keys, minimizing platform-specific risks. Conclusion: Navigating the Turbulent Waters of Crypto Lending The Delio crypto lender bankruptcy serves as a stark reminder of the risks inherent in the cryptocurrency market, particularly within the lending sector. While crypto lending platforms can offer attractive yields, they also come with significant counterparty and market risks. The unfolding situation in South Korea will be closely watched by investors, regulators, and industry participants alike. As the bankruptcy proceedings progress, the focus will remain on the recovery prospects for creditors and the broader implications for the future of crypto lending.

Naheta, a former SoftBank executive with past investments in Nvidia and ARM, will officially join Bakkt’s leadership team from today. Alongside current CEO Andy Main, he’s expected to help steer the company deeper into blockchain-enabled payments. Naheta is also joining Bakkt’s board of directors. The centerpiece of the announcement is a planned integration of Bakkt’s trading and brokerage platform with DTR’s stablecoin-based payments infrastructure. DTR’s infrastructure, according to a press release , leverages a suite of APIs, blockchain technology, and a proprietary routing system to help reduce costs and complexity in its solutions. Bakkt says the combination will unlock new revenue streams in both crypto trading and cross-border payments, pending regulatory approvals.

Data shows that institutional options market makers are ramping up selling activity while tightening implied volatilities. This signals the expectations of a short-term sideways movement for Bitcoin ahead. Where’s BTC Price Heading Next? BTC price has struggled to break past the $84,000 resistance despite the recent initial thrust after the FOMC meeting . This shows that bulls have not mustered enough strength for a rally ahead. As the impact of the Trump tariff war on the US equity market intensifies, President Donald Trump has asked the US Federal Reserve to announce rate cuts soon. Crypto market veterans like Arthur Hayes expect the Fed rate cuts to come by April which could push the Bitcoin price even higher. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has outlined pivotal support and resistance levels for Bitcoin (BTC) using pricing bands. He noted: A break and hold above $94,000 could propel Bitcoin toward a surge to $112,000. Conversely, a drop below $76,000 would place the next critical support levels at $58,000 and $44,000. Source: Ali Martinez BTC’s daily trading volume has dropped by 31% to $25 billion ahead of today’s Bitcoin options expiry. It will be interesting to see whether BTC resumes the uptrend in the near time. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Resume Again US Bitcoin ETFs have recorded five consecutive sessions of inflows. On Thursday, March 20, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $166 million, signaling growing investor interest in the market. BlackRock’s IBIT led the surge, achieving the highest single-day net inflow among Bitcoin spot ETFs at $172 million, as per data from Farside Investors.

With over 6,300 holders purchasing MUTM tokens since the presale commenced, fundraising has surpassed $4.1 million, according to data. Currently costing $0.02 in Phase 3, the next price level for the token will rise to $0.025, providing existing investors with instant 25% profits. With an initial listing goal of $0.06, early adopters have the chance to turn a 3x profit at launch. Analysts also estimate post-listing growth could drive MUTM to $3.50 as of late 2025, echoing the trend established by XRP and SHIB meteoric rises. Ripple (XRP): The 2017 Sensation Seven years ago, Ripple’s blockchain solutions caused a frenzy when XRP increased by 13,570% in less than a year. Investors that held throughout the early volatility rode stakes of $1,000 up to $136,700 by December 2017. Having faced regulatory turbulence that dampened its momentum, XRP is still a case study in exponential gains. Shiba Inu (SHIB) 2021 Run The 2021 explosion of Shiba Inu broke all conventional logic of investing — small bets turned into generational wealth. A $100 buy at SHIB’s August 2020 launch would have ballooned to $17.3 million at its October 2021 market high. One Hyped Gamble of a New Era in Crypto Despite skepticism over it as a speculative gamble, its success highlighted the crypto market’s hunger for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Momentum Is Gaining Over Presale Mutuum Finance ’s presale Phase 3 is also well underway, with slots already disappearing ahead of the $0.025 price hike. By allowing users to borrow on collateralized assets or earn interest through mtTokens, the project creates an inherent demand for MUTM by utilizing a lending model. Tokenomics directs the platform fees to buybacks, where the repurchased tokens are distributed to stakers with a focus on price pressure for the overall growth. With a $0.06 listing price, this mechanism puts Phase 3 investors on track for 200% returns on launch. The presale structure of Mutuum Finance encourages early involvement. The price increase of each phase secures profit for previous buyers and entices new capital. The transition to Phase 4 will amplify this urgency, as subsequent stages reduce the gap to the $0.06 debut. And forecasts post-launch only indicate even higher potential: conservative estimates have MUTM at $1.80 within a matter of months, while bullish models cite $3.50 as demand grows. Just for reference, a $500 investment today would turn into $87,500 if prices reached the upper target. Mutuum Finance stays focused on security The team has confirmed that Certik are performing smart contract audits and that the results will be published through official channels when completed. This move strengthens confidence in an industry often plagued by weaknesses, reassuring investors that the platform can withstand exploits. Timing the Opportunity Historical precedents — XRP’s 2017 surge, SHIB’s 2021 breakout — speak to the payoffs of spotting the next potential winner down the road. Mutuum Finance combines these fundamentals with DeFi attributes to provide real practicality that has been missing from previous hype cycles. With Phase 3 filling rapidly, the opportunity to obtain tokens at $0.02 will not be around for long. Those who skip this step risk overpaying as prices climb toward launch. Market veterans know patterns: assets that fuse utility, scarcity, and strategic demand mechanics often outperform. With 6,300 holders and counting, Mutuum Finance’s presale trajectory suggests growing faith in its model. With Certik audits pending and exchange listings imminent, the project meets the criteria that turned XRP and SHIB investors into millionaires. An action delay at this point could cost the opportunity for first-floor pricing defining crypto’s most calendared bets.

According to Meteora’s Mar. 20 post on X, these changes aim to make liquidity provider rewards fairer, support new token launches, and secure long-term incentives for the team. The first proposal suggests revising the LP Stimulus Plan. Originally, 10% of the MET supply was set aside to reward liquidity providers, but since the program has been running longer than its expected December 2024 end date, Meteora wants to increase this to 15%. This adjustment ensures that early and new LPs receive rewards without devaluing tokens. The first two proposals are live on https://t.co/OeTKWfH27W . These proposals address key community concerns about the LP Stimulus Plan, M3M3 and more. Watch the community call to see @0xSoju & @0xmiir go through these proposals live. — Meteora (@MeteoraAG) March 20, 2025 Early contributors will receive 2% of MET under the updated plan, while all LPs will receive 8% equally. The original points multiplier system has been replaced by this. An extra 3% of MET will go to Launch Pools and Launch Pads in order to avoid reward dilution for retail LPs. The second proposal focuses on the team. Meteora plans to allocate 20% of the MET supply to its team, with a six-year vesting period to maintain long-term commitment. Within this, 2% will go to M3M3 token holders. M3M3 is Meteora’s stake-to-earn platform, which lets users earn fee rewards from permanently locked liquidity pools. You might also like: Meteora co-founder Ben Chow resigns amid LIBRA memecoin scandal This move follows the mismanagement of M3M3 by its original creators, which led to investor losses. To maintain fairness, the distribution will be based on two snapshots and wallets connected to questionable activity will be blocked. Meteora has experienced rapid growth in the past few months. According to DeFiLlama data , the platform’s trading volume surged 33 times, from $990 million in December 2024 to $33 billion in January 2025. Due to its rapid growth, Meteora now holds a 9% market share and is ranked fourth among DEXs by trading volume. While the broader DEX market was on a downturn, Meteora raked in $195 million in monthly fees in February. Despite its achievements, Meteora is currently facing legal issues that may impact its future. Burwick Law, a New York law firm, filed a class-action lawsuit against Meteora, KIP Protocol, and Kelsier Ventures on Mar. 13. According to the lawsuit, they defrauded retail traders and misled investors by manipulating liquidity during the LIBRA token launch.

Announced on March 21, this move underscores the company's growing focus on Bitcoin and its ambition to become a global leader in cryptocurrency treasury management. Eric Trump, known for his leadership in real estate, finance, and brand strategy, is expected to play a central role in supporting Metaplanet’s digital asset goals. He also serves as a Web3 ambassador for World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralized finance project associated with his father, former U.S. President Donald Trump. His involvement reflects his interest in digital innovation and financial autonomy. Metaplanet’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, highlighted Eric Trump’s expertise as a vital addition to the company's roadmap. “His business acumen, love of the Bitcoin community and global hospitality perspective will be invaluable in accelerating Metaplanet’s vision of becoming one of the world’s leading Bitcoin Treasury Companies,” he stated. This strategic partnership arrives at a crucial time for Metaplanet. Just days before the announcement, the company issued 2 billion yen in zero-coupon bonds, intended entirely for acquiring more Bitcoin. This funding effort aligns with the firm’s ambitious target of accumulating 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and doubling that to 21,000 BTC by 2026. According to industry data, Metaplanet currently holds 3,200 BTC, positioning itself as a major corporate Bitcoin holder. However, its average purchase cost leaves it vulnerable to sharp market fluctuations. March 2025 tested this vulnerability, with Bitcoin experiencing notable dips that temporarily pushed Metaplanet’s portfolio into the red. Although the market has since rebounded slightly, the narrow margin between acquisition costs and market value highlights the volatility that still defines the crypto landscape . Despite these price swings, Metaplanet remains firm in its belief in Bitcoin's long-term potential. With Eric Trump joining a team of prominent financial figures, the company is reinforcing its commitment to navigating crypto market risks with strategic foresight. The creation of the Strategic Board of Advisors is more than a branding move—it represents a focused effort to surround Metaplanet with experienced voices in the fields of finance, blockchain, and digital innovation. Together, they are expected to guide the company’s direction as it pushes deeper into the crypto space. While market sentiment remains mixed and Bitcoin continues to show price sensitivity, Metaplanet's latest actions illustrate a proactive and confident approach. With fresh capital, an influential advisor, and clear goals, the company appears poised to advance its position as a corporate leader in Bitcoin accumulation. As the year progresses, all eyes will be on how Metaplanet’s bold strategy unfolds—and whether this high-profile appointment will help them achieve their long-term goals in the digital asset sector. Eric Trump’s appointment , the 10,000 BTC target , and the market volatility Metaplanet faces form the backbone of a high-stakes expansion plan that could shape how corporations approach cryptocurrency in the years ahead.",,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-21 09:32:52

Web3 prediction platform Polymarket is making waves with claims of remarkable accuracy. A recent study indicates that Polymarket’s prediction platform has achieved an astonishing 94% accuracy rate in forecasting certain events. But is this impressive number too good to be true? Let’s dive into the details and explore what this means for the future of crypto predictions. Decoding Polymarket’s Impressive Polymarket Accuracy Rate According to a CoinDesk report citing a Dune dashboard curated by data scientist Alex McCullough, Polymarket has demonstrated strong forecasting capabilities. McCullough’s analysis reveals that the platform is hitting accuracy levels close to 90% for specific events. This data comes directly from on-chain metrics, adding a layer of transparency and verifiability to the claims. This begs the question: how does Polymarket achieve such high Polymarket accuracy , and what does it mean for users? Data-Driven Insights: Polymarket leverages real-time market data and user participation to generate probabilities for future events. Transparent Methodology: The platform operates on blockchain, ensuring transparency and auditability of its prediction markets. User-Generated Forecasts: Polymarket aggregates the wisdom of the crowd, where users bet on event outcomes, contributing to the overall accuracy. The Nuances of Web3 Forecasting : Is It Always This Accurate? While a 94% accuracy rate sounds incredibly promising, McCullough himself offers a crucial caveat. In an interview on Polymarket’s blog, The Oracle, he pointed out that the platform tends to slightly overestimate probabilities. This means that while Polymarket is generally good at predicting outcomes, the probabilities displayed might be a bit inflated. Furthermore, the study highlights that long-term markets can skew the overall Polymarket accuracy upwards. This is because these markets often include predictions that are inherently obvious. Think of it like this: betting on whether the sun will rise tomorrow is a very safe bet. Similarly, in the context of political predictions, a market assessing the likelihood of a relatively unknown figure becoming president might appear accurate simply because the outcome was always improbable. McCullough uses the example of a market focused on California Governor Gavin Newsom becoming president. The high accuracy in this market, as he suggests, might be misleading. The low probability of this event occurring makes it an “easy” prediction, boosting the overall Polymarket accuracy statistics but not necessarily reflecting the platform’s ability to predict more complex or uncertain events. Benefits of Prediction Platforms Like Polymarket Despite these nuances, platforms like Polymarket offer significant benefits, especially within the crypto and Web3 space: Informed Decision-Making: Web3 forecasting platforms provide valuable insights for traders and investors looking to make informed decisions based on market sentiment and predicted outcomes. Market Sentiment Gauge: Polymarket acts as a real-time gauge of market sentiment on various topics, from crypto prices to global events. Decentralized and Transparent: Built on Web3 principles, Polymarket offers a decentralized and transparent alternative to traditional prediction markets. Financial Incentives: Users are incentivized to make accurate crypto predictions through potential financial rewards, encouraging active participation and more accurate forecasts. Challenges and Limitations of Crypto Market Predictions It’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and limitations inherent in any prediction platform, including Polymarket: Challenge Description Black Swan Events Unforeseeable events can drastically alter market conditions and prediction outcomes, rendering even the most accurate models less effective. Market Manipulation While decentralized, prediction markets can still be susceptible to manipulation, although Polymarket’s structure aims to mitigate this. Data Interpretation Users need to understand how to interpret the probabilities and market data effectively to make informed decisions. Over-reliance on a single accuracy percentage can be misleading. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for prediction markets, especially in the crypto space, is still evolving, which could impact platform accessibility and usage. Actionable Insights: Using Polymarket for Smarter Crypto Decisions So, how can you leverage Polymarket and similar prediction platform s for smarter crypto decisions? Diversify Your Data Sources: Don’t rely solely on Polymarket for your crypto insights. Combine its predictions with other forms of analysis, including fundamental and technical analysis. Understand Market Nuances: Pay attention to the specific markets you are analyzing. Consider the complexity and predictability of the event being predicted. Look Beyond the Accuracy Number: Focus on the trends and market sentiment reflected in Polymarket’s data, rather than just the overall accuracy percentage. Start Small and Learn: If you’re new to prediction markets, begin with smaller bets and gradually increase your participation as you become more comfortable with the platform and its dynamics. Conclusion: The Future is Predictive, But Proceed with Caution Polymarket’s reported 94% accuracy is indeed a stunning figure, showcasing the potential of Web3 prediction platforms to offer valuable insights into future events. However, as with any predictive tool, it’s essential to understand its limitations and interpret the data with a critical and informed perspective. While Web3 forecasting is evolving rapidly, and platforms like Polymarket are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, remember that no prediction is foolproof. Use these tools to enhance your understanding of market sentiment and probabilities, but always combine them with your own research and due diligence in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

As of March 21, ETH price trades today at $1,985, with hopes of recovery as a whale buys $242 million worth of ether. Let’s explore Ethereum price prediction and if ETH’s value will bounce from here. Is Ethereum Price Bounce Likely as Whale Scoops $242M ETH? Although the sentiment surrounding Ethereum has been bearish, the recent 7% rally in price on Wednesday indicates that the outlook is changing. Considering that one whale accumulated 150 million ETH worth roughly $270 million . This move indicates that high networth investors or institutions are bullish on the second largest cryptocurrency in the world. Ethereum whale bought $242,000,000 $ETH . pic.twitter.com/gdokpgUO8D — Ted (@TedPillows) March 20, 2025 Such bold ETH accumulation from long-term investors often signals strength and is followed a bullish reversal . According to data from Santiment, the daily active addresses that peaked at 717K on January 25, slipped to 367K as of March 17, signaling lack of interest from investors. However, in the past four days this metric has spiked to 463K, noting a 26% uptick, indicating growing interest after Wednesday’s minor rally. ETH DAA Both the whale accumulation and comeback in Ethereum’s daily active addresses point to a renewed investor interest in ETH at current price levels. Hence, a bounce here is likely what’s next . Other Catalysts That Support ETH Price Rally Robert Mitchnick, head of digital assets at BlackRock, said the negativity around ETH is “overdone.” The world’s largest asset manager also noted how spot Ethereum ETFs are incomplete without staking . If institutional staking is approved, it could further catalyze capital inflow into ETH ETFs. Elaborating more on the capital flow shows that investors are bridging their funds back to Ethereum after exploring Binance’s BNB chain and Solana based on Debridge data. To be precise, $97M from BNB has flowed into ETH. Roughly $86M, $46M and $30M capital has rotated from Solana (SOL), Arbitrum (ARB) and Base chains to ETH. Ethereum Capital Inflow From SOL, BNB, ARB Overall, the outlook of Ethereum price and its ecosystem are looking bullish with both fundamentals and technical outlook supporting a recovery bounce.

Parker has a history of online fraud, hacking, and casino theft, and reportedly earned around $20 million by using extreme leverage on decentralized crypto platforms. This mysterious trader gained attention for executing massive leveraged positions—up to 50×—on decentralized exchanges such as Hyperliquid and GMX. According to ZachXBT’s latest report, Parker was traced through a blockchain transaction that led to a phone number tied to a UK resident named William Parker. Parker’s criminal record includes allegations of stealing nearly $1 million from two casinos in 2023 , for which he was arrested. Despite serving time, Parker allegedly continued illicit activities by launching phishing scams to collect funds. These funds were later funneled into high-risk trading strategies that allowed him to profit handsomely during volatile market conditions. At the heart of Parker’s success was his use of high leverage—particularly 50× trades. Leverage in trading means borrowing capital to amplify the potential return on investment. In Parker’s case, even a small price movement in his favor could produce significant profits. For instance, a 2% price swing with 50× leverage could double his original investment. In one striking example, Parker opened a $450 million short position on Bitcoin using 40× leverage and exited with a profit of nearly $9.5 million in just over a week, according to crypto legal expert Langerius. These trades occurred during a period of market turbulence fueled by headlines like the White House Crypto Summit and developments in U.S. Bitcoin reserves . The large size of his trades didn’t just benefit him—they reportedly pushed other market participants into forced liquidations. When highly leveraged positions turn against traders, their assets are sold off at a loss to cover borrowed funds. This cycle can create downward pressure on prices and impact overall market stability. Despite the extreme risks involved with 50× leverage, Parker seemed to manage his trades with precision. By timing market volatility, he made aggressive bets during rapid price swings, helping him to secure substantial profits. The case of William Parker raises larger concerns in the crypto industry around identity, accountability, and risk. While decentralized platforms like Hyperliquid offer transparency in showing public trades, they also allow individuals to remain anonymous, even when trading huge volumes. Hyperliquid themselves noted on social media that large trades cannot be faked in their system, unlike screenshots from centralized exchanges. Still, the fact that someone with a known criminal history was able to move such large amounts of money through decentralized systems has sparked fresh debate. Some fear this could invite regulatory crackdowns or erode trust in the crypto space. Others argue that blockchain’s transparency ultimately allowed Parker to be identified, reinforcing the value of open systems. What remains clear is that William Parker, through a combination of market savvy and questionable funds, has become one of the most talked-about figures in crypto trading. His story is a stark reminder of both the potential and the pitfalls of decentralized finance—where fortunes can be made fast, but often with a dark side. ZachXBT’s investigation , Hyperliquid’s transparency , and Parker’s high-leverage strategy have now become focal points in ongoing discussions about crypto regulation, ethics, and the limits of decentralization.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-21 09:37:26

According to data from CoinGecko, the killer-whale themed token was able to breakthrough the $5 threshold for the first time this year. At press time, the Solana ( SOL )-based coin has gone up nearly 215% in the past 24 hours of trading. The token is currently trading hands at $5.07. The last time it reached that level was in December 2024. Throughout the past month, the token has remained somewhat stagnant, fluctuating only around the $1 mark, never quite managing to reach above $2. The surge in price came shortly after Upbit , the largest South Korean crypto exchange by trading volume, announced that it will be listing ORCA on its platform starting from March 21 at 17:00 KST. According to the notice, the token will be available to trade with Bitcoin ( BTC ), Tether ( USDT ) and Korean won pairs.

Buy orders for ORCA will be restricted for five minutes after Upbit begins trading support. Meanwhile, all types of orders, with the exception of limit orders, will be restricted for one hour after trading support starts. In addition, sell order prices will be capped at a minimum of 10% less than the previous day’s closing price. Based on the notice, the previous day’s closing price for ORCA is capped at 2,349 Korean won or around $1.60, which is nearly 70% below the current price it has jumped to. ORCA is the native token of the decentralized exchange and automated market maker protocol of the same name. Orca is a project built on the Solana blockchain which provides users with tools to create tokens without needing to code. ORCA is used as a governance token for the protocol. Holders of the token are able to propose agendas and vote on decisions regarding the protocol. Earlier today, Upbit denied accusations that projects need to pay a brokerage fee if they wish to have their tokens listed on the platform. The South Korean exchange claimed that all listings go through an internal review process without asking for financial compensation.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/north-korean-hacker-group-lazarus-has-more-bitcoin-than-tesla-here-are-the-details/,"The Lazarus Group, a notorious North Korean state-backed hacker organization, currently owns more Bitcoin (BTC) than Tesla (TSLA), according to data from Arkham Intelligence. North Korea's Lazarus Group Surpasses Tesla in Bitcoin Assets This development comes as former US President Donald Trump pushes for America to become the global leader in cryptocurrency adoption. At press time, Lazarus controls 13,441 BTC worth $1.14 billion, surpassing Tesla’s holdings of 11,509 BTC by 16%. Elon Musk-led Tesla first acquired Bitcoin holdings four years ago and has maintained its position as one of the largest institutional BTC holders. Lazarus Group has been involved in several high-profile cyber heists, and its most recent attack targeted crypto exchange Bybit, where hackers dumped $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH). Reports indicate that the stolen funds have since been converted to Bitcoin, with 12,836 BTC distributed across 9,117 unique wallets, as confirmed by Bybit CEO Ben Zhou. The revelation that a North Korean hacking group holds more Bitcoin than one of America’s most influential tech companies comes amid Trump’s renewed pro-crypto stance. On Thursday, Trump reiterated his plan to make the United States “the undisputed Bitcoin superpower and the crypto capital of the world.” Meanwhile, the US government currently holds 198,109 BTC worth over $16 billion obtained through enforcement actions. Trump recently announced that these assets would be considered part of the country's strategic reserves, signaling a potential shift in how Bitcoin is viewed at the federal level. With the evolving geopolitical and institutional landscape, it remains to be seen whether Tesla or other major U.S. companies will respond to being outmaneuvered by a North Korean hacker syndicate in the Bitcoin market. *This is not investment advice.

The flagship coin was rejected at a falling logarithmic trend in the daily time frame signaling further bearish sentiment in the near term. Since March 10, Bitcoin price has been forming a bearish continuation pattern. Moreover, BTC price has already confirmed a macro reversal pattern after rebounding from a neckline of a double-top, which was coupled with a bearish divergence of the Relative Strength Index (RSI). In the near term, Bitcoin price will likely drop another 10 percent to retest the support level around $78k. If the Bitcoin buyers fail to defend the $78k support level, further selloff towards $74k will be imminent. The short-term bearish sentiment will be invalidated if Bitcoin price consistently closes above the daily logarithmic falling trend line. Bitcoin Whales Focused on Long-Term Growth According to on-chain data analysis, whale investors have been accumulating more Bitcoins in the past few days regardless of the short-term bearish outlook. As Coinpedia reported , BlackRock’s IBIT has led other spot BTC ETF issuers in renewed cash inflows during the past few days. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Today (21st March 2025): Bitcoin Volatility Hits 6-Month High! , On Thursday, the U.S. spot BTC ETF issuers recorded a net cash inflow of about $165 million, whereby the majority came from IBIT of about $172 million. Bitwise BITB recorded a net cash outflow of about $17 million. Nonetheless, the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are about to end the largest losing streak of five weeks if today’s flow ends positively. Worth noting that the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded a cumulative total net inflow of about $35.9 billion, thus currently holding total net assets worth around $94.4 billion. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In October 2024, Crypto.com launched a grant program to support developers in building AI agents. Coinbase also launched the CDP AI Builder Grants Program, offering five grants of $3,000 each to projects building AI bots utilizing Coinbase’s MPC Wallets. Perhaps such initiatives are exactly what’s needed to revive the AI agent narrative which has been one of the hardest-hit sectors in the current crypto market downturn—with the AI tokens’ market cap crashing from its $10 billion highs to around $4.4 billion at the time of writing. Earlier, crypto researcher Crypto Stream said that for liquidity to return to AI coins, three conditions must be met: large caps need to cool off, the interest in AI agents must continue, and no new flashy narrative should emerge. Programs like Virtuals Protocol’s VPN seem to be addressing the second factor by creating an environment that fosters continued interest in AI agents.

The ETFs have disappointed in 2025, with sluggish inflows largely driven by bitcoin’s weak price performance, which is down roughly 10%. While there has been a brief uptick over the past five days — bringing in some $700 million in net inflows — total net inflows since startup now stand at $36.1 billion, according to Farside data . There are two main drivers for the past month's exit: heightened volatility in the price of bitcoin and the unwinding of what's known as the basis trade. The bitcoin price has been particularly volatile this year, shooting up to a record $109,000 in January at the start of President Donald Trump's administration in anticipation of a crypto-friendly regulatory environment and then tumbling to as low as $76,000 at the beginning of March on concerns related to Trump's tariff-based trade policy. Retail investors tend to sell during periods of heightened volatility, reacting emotionally as they would with any risk asset. As for institutions, they are unwinding the basis — or cash-and-carry — trade, which is a strategy that involves taking a long position in the ETF while simultaneously shorting CME bitcoin futures. A short is a bet that the price will drop, and the position is delta neutral trade that capitalizes on the futures pricing trading at a premium to spot. A delta neutral trade offsets price movements in the underlying asset by balancing positions, minimizing directional risk and maintaining market neutrality. Currently, this arbitrage yields only around 2% , among the least since the ETFs were first approved. With U.S. Treasuries, among the safest investments available, offering higher yields, many investors are opting for the lower-risk alternative. ETF inflows and outflows often signal market turning points. When outflows become particularly aggressive, they tend to coincide with local bottoms in bitcoin’s price, especially when viewed on a 30-day moving average. This pattern was observed recently when bitcoin hit its low in March, as well as during similar pullbacks in August 2024 and April 2024.",Markets|Bitcoin|CME Futures|Bitcoin ETF|Institutions|retail investment,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-21 09:40:32

This regulatory shift could open the door for multiple altcoin ETFs to be approved together by the end of Q2 2025. This announcement follows the SEC’s growing pattern of easing restrictions around crypto regulation. By separating PoW assets from traditional securities laws, the Commission may have laid a clear path for the approval of ETFs based on coins such as Litecoin, Monero, and Kaspa . The decision states that mining activities do not involve offering or selling securities. It also says that participants in these activities don’t need to register with the Commission. This update aligns with earlier decisions where the SEC classified certain meme coins as non-securities, clearing a possible route for ETFs tied to those assets as well. While this seems like good news for the industry, not all voices within the SEC are in agreement. Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw spoke out against the ruling, warning that it contains loopholes and doesn't offer enough protection. Still, her comments are unlikely to slow down the SEC’s current momentum. The Commission also recently delayed decisions on ETF applications for tokens like Solana and XRP. However, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has already approved futures trading for these tokens, boosting their ETF chances. The SEC also dropped its lawsuit against Ripple, which had focused on whether XRP was a security. These moves indicate a trend of removing regulatory roadblocks . The upcoming confirmation of Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chair is another key piece in this puzzle. Atkins is expected to support a more crypto-friendly direction. With two other commissioners, Mark Uyeda and Hester Peirce, already in favor of clearer crypto classifications, the path toward ETF approvals may be smoother. Analysts believe the SEC is preparing for a large-scale approval of altcoin ETFs once Atkins takes office. His confirmation hearing is expected to happen soon, possibly aligning with the next ETF decision deadlines. Crenshaw, however, continues to warn against rushing ahead. She noted that while the ruling excludes PoW assets from being securities in general, it still allows for exceptions if certain conditions apply. In her view, the guidance lacks legal weight and may give investors a false sense of clarity. Despite her concerns, Crenshaw’s influence may be fading as the Commission's direction shifts. Unless someone challenges these interpretations in court, they could quickly become industry norms. Overall, the SEC’s actions suggest that crypto regulation in the U.S. is heading toward a more flexible and supportive approach. This could pave the way for greater adoption and institutional interest in the crypto space—especially through regulated financial products like ETFs.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ALTCOIN|TRADING|XRP|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-03-21 09:41:48

The crypto world may be shifting from an altcoin season to a stablecoin season. The supply of stablecoins increased to over $230B, making new highs almost weekly. The expansion is only partially due to supply inflows for Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC. Binance’s founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao noted that lately, there are more stablecoin launches than altcoin launches. Even more startups are picking a model with a synthetic or asset-backed stablecoin, hoping to build their own liquidity. I see more stablecoin startups than alts. 😂 https://t.co/fejuQixWqJ — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) March 21, 2025 The exact supply of both leading and minor stablecoins varies based on including the latest launches. The total valuation is estimated between $229.4B and $236B , of which over $200B is carried by USDT and USDC. Binance’s ecosystem also uses FDUSD, a centrally controlled stablecoin, which is used to inject liquidity into several leading pairs on the centralize exchange. Some of the smaller stablecoins react with rapid increases of their supply, benefitting from any crypto market recovery. | Source: TokenTerminal Stablecoins have split into three tiers – the market leaders USDT and USDC, large-scale stablecoins like DAI and USDe linked to DeFi protocols, and dozens of new assets linked to projects with still relatively low liquidity. A stablecoin season can further increase the usage of existing assets, and the attempts to create new stablecoins with multiple use cases. Is a stablecoin season coming? The crypto market is already overwhelmed by millions of tokens and altcoins, including memes. Most of those assets can easily erase 90% of their value within hours or even minutes. New projects have reoriented to creating various stablecoins, mostly by copying the models of larger projects. Based on Artemis data, there are already 42 minor stablecoin projects, which hold $6.4B in value. Smaller stablecoins have seen almost constant creation, with between 42 and nearly 300 small-scale assets, locking up to $6.4B in value. | Source: Artemis The wider list of stablecoin counts up to 300 assets , of which some have liquidity in the hundreds or thousands of dollars. Most of the stablecoin market is dollarized, though precious metals and other currencies like the Euro, GBP or RMB. The proliferation of new stablecoins has set up expectations of an eventual ‘stablecoin season’, attempting to offer versions of DeFi activities and possibly passive income. However, not all stablecoins are made equal. Currently, around $10.9B in value is locked in crypto over-collateralized coins, which pose a risk if the crypto market shifts to a lower range. Algorithmic stablecoins, the riskiest category, have a reported supply on Ethereum of only $800M . This report excludes Ethena’s USDe, which relies on algorithmic issues and burns. Due to the inherent risk of the crypto market, synthetic issuers only bring in a handful of projects, with a total value of $550M . The biggest fear for stablecoins is a repetition of the Terra (LUNA) situation, where each protocol used its own stablecoin to pump its asset, or inflated the supply based on an overvalued collateral. The other big problem with stablecoins is the fragmented liquidity. New stablecoins often build an isolated ecosystem, and it may be hard to trade out of the projects. Some stablecoins work as bonds, requiring the users to hold for years before receiving par value. Others only rely on a relatively illiquid decentralized pair, where traders can switch to another stablecoin. A stablecoin season may pose risk despite the nominal $1 price of the tokens. Stablecoin issuance is also a no guarantee on the usage of those assets, and their role in centralized or decentralized trading. Stablecoins expose crypto market to USD risk Stablecoins have essentially dollarized the crypto market, using the USD as the most intuitive unit of account. Recently, Chinese media mentioned the spillover effect, where US risk and debt could affect the crypto market. Chinese media called for a localization of the market, possibly using the RMB for stablecoins. RMB stablecoins have a reported supply of just $2.9M equivalent, showing limited printing similar to Euro-based stablecoins. USD-based stablecoins, especially TRON-based USDT, is one of the most widely used assets for the Asian market. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

42090160,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142160,1742550341,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Blockchain Transparency: Trump Era USAID Set for Crypto-Powered Overhaul,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/blockchain-transparency-usaid-overhaul/,"Get ready for a potential shake-up in how international aid is managed! The winds of change are blowing through Washington, D.C., and it seems even government agencies are catching the crypto bug. Reports suggest the Trump administration is considering a significant transformation for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and blockchain technology is slated to play a starring role. Let’s dive into what this could mean for the future of aid and blockchain transparency . Unveiling the Revamp: USAID to Become IHA with Blockchain at its Core According to a report by Wired, citing a State Department memo, USAID might be rebranded as the U.S. International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA) and integrated under the State Department’s umbrella. But this isn’t just a name change; it’s a strategic repositioning that includes a bold move towards adopting cutting-edge technology. The memo reportedly highlights the intention to incorporate blockchain technology into the agency’s procurement processes. Why is this significant, especially for those in the crypto space? For years, blockchain enthusiasts have touted the technology’s potential to bring unparalleled transparency, security, and efficiency to various sectors. Now, it appears the U.S. government is taking note, potentially ready to harness these benefits within its international aid operations. Imagine a world where aid distribution is not only faster but also completely auditable and traceable. This is the promise of USAID blockchain integration. Why Blockchain for Humanitarian Aid? The Transparency Imperative Why is blockchain being considered for an agency like USAID/IHA? The answer lies in the inherent advantages blockchain offers, particularly when it comes to transparency and accountability – critical factors in humanitarian aid. Let’s break down the key benefits: Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides a permanent and transparent record of all transactions. Every donation, procurement, and distribution can be tracked, making it significantly harder for funds to be misappropriated or lost in opaque processes. This is crucial for ensuring aid reaches its intended recipients and building public trust. Improved Traceability: With blockchain, it’s possible to trace the journey of aid from donor to recipient in real-time. This level of traceability can dramatically improve supply chain management, ensuring resources are delivered efficiently and effectively. Imagine tracking food supplies, medical equipment, or financial aid every step of the way. Increased Security: Blockchain’s cryptographic security makes it incredibly difficult to tamper with data. This is vital for protecting sensitive information related to aid operations and preventing fraud. Secure and verifiable transactions are at the heart of a robust aid system. Efficiency Gains: By streamlining processes and reducing intermediaries, blockchain can potentially cut down on administrative overhead and speed up aid delivery. Smart contracts, for example, could automate disbursement of funds based on pre-defined conditions, making aid distribution faster and more efficient. These benefits are not just theoretical. The potential for government blockchain applications in aid is immense, and this move by the Trump administration, if realized, could set a precedent for other nations to follow. Elon Musk and DOGE: A Glimpse into Blockchain’s Government Potential Interestingly, the report also mentions a connection to another prominent figure in the tech and crypto world: Elon Musk. Back in January, Bloomberg reported that Musk had proposed using blockchain technology within the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). While the acronym is a playful nod to the Dogecoin cryptocurrency, the underlying idea is serious: leveraging blockchain to improve government operations. This mention of Musk’s proposal highlights a broader trend – the growing recognition of blockchain’s potential beyond just cryptocurrencies. From supply chain management to voting systems, and now potentially humanitarian aid, governments worldwide are starting to explore how blockchain can enhance their services and improve efficiency. The idea of crypto adoption within government is no longer a fringe concept but a tangible possibility. Challenges and Considerations: Navigating the Road Ahead While the potential benefits of blockchain in USAID/IHA are compelling, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that come with implementing such a significant technological shift. Challenge Description Implementation Complexity Integrating blockchain into existing government systems can be complex and require significant technical expertise. Legacy systems might need to be adapted or replaced, and interoperability needs to be ensured. Regulatory Hurdles The regulatory landscape for blockchain and cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Governments need to navigate legal and compliance issues to ensure blockchain adoption aligns with existing regulations and policies. Scalability Concerns Public blockchains, while transparent, might face scalability challenges when dealing with the large volume of transactions associated with global aid operations. Private or consortium blockchains might be considered, but they come with their own trade-offs in terms of decentralization and transparency. Data Privacy and Security While blockchain enhances security, data privacy concerns need to be addressed, especially when dealing with sensitive personal information of aid recipients. Appropriate data protection measures and compliance with privacy regulations are crucial. Digital Literacy and Access For blockchain-based aid systems to be truly effective, both aid providers and recipients need to have the necessary digital literacy and access to technology. Bridging the digital divide is essential for inclusive and effective implementation. Overcoming these challenges will require careful planning, collaboration between government agencies and blockchain experts, and a phased approach to implementation. However, the potential rewards – a more transparent, efficient, and accountable aid system – are well worth the effort. The Future of Aid: Blockchain as a Transformative Force? The potential rebranding of USAID to IHA and the integration of blockchain technology signal a potentially transformative shift in how the U.S. approaches international humanitarian assistance. If successfully implemented, this initiative could: Set a new standard for transparency in aid: By showcasing the power of blockchain, the U.S. could inspire other nations and organizations to adopt similar technologies, leading to a global increase in aid transparency and accountability. Boost public trust in aid organizations: Increased transparency can help rebuild public trust in aid organizations, which has been eroded by concerns about corruption and inefficiency in the past. Drive further innovation in blockchain for social good: This high-profile application of blockchain in government could spur further innovation and investment in blockchain solutions for various social impact initiatives, beyond just humanitarian aid. The concept of blockchain government is moving closer to reality. The journey to fully realizing the potential of blockchain in humanitarian aid will undoubtedly be complex and iterative. However, the direction is clear: technology, particularly blockchain, is poised to play an increasingly important role in shaping a more transparent, efficient, and impactful future for international aid. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Transparent Aid The Trump administration’s reported plan to revamp USAID and integrate blockchain technology is a revolutionary move that could have far-reaching implications for the future of humanitarian aid. While challenges remain, the potential for enhanced transparency, traceability, and efficiency is undeniable. As the world grapples with increasing humanitarian crises, embracing innovative technologies like blockchain is not just an option, but perhaps a necessity. This initiative could mark a significant step towards a new era of transparent and accountable aid, powered by the transformative potential of blockchain.

While investors are wondering whether the expected altcoin rally will occur in 2025, a survey conducted by CoinGecko revealed that investors expect a rise in some altcoins in 2025. In CoinGecko’s survey conducted between February and March, 46.9% of respondents stated that they are optimistic and bullish about crypto AI tokens in 2025. Of these, 25% are completely bullish about crypto AI tokens in 2025, while 19.3% are slightly bullish. Approximately 29% of participants remained neutral on the rise, while 26.3% stated that they did not expect a rise. Yuqian Lim, crypto research analyst at CoinGecko, said: “Crypto participants expressed similarly consistent sentiments toward crypto AI token prices, with 44.3% of participants bullish and 26.4% bearish. This perhaps suggests that crypto participants do not differentiate between the investment or trading potential of crypto AI and the technology itself. Such market sentiments may reflect expectations that the time is ripe for crypto AI to move past the conceptual stage and mature as an industry.” What is the current sentiment on crypto x AI?

Bitcoin currently trades for $84k while Ethereum holds at $1,900, so investors seek tokens capable of capitalizing on this worldwide liquidity. Among the 4 crypto tokens to hold stand as top performers because of their robust liquidity qualities and stable trajectory. These assets have strong growth potential because market participants look for recovery. Top Crypto Tokens To Hold As Global Liquidity Soar Global liquidity refers to the total money supply and financial resources in the global economy. Global liquidity cycles show a fast-rising trend, which indicates a crucial economic transformation among developed nations. CrossBorderCapital data reveals a sudden rise which shows possible economic transformations set to affect financial market operations during 2025. Amid this let’s uncover these top 4 crypto tokens to watch for massive surges as the liquidity surges. Among the coins are BTC, SHIB, XRP, and TRX. GLOBAL LIQUIDITY IS PUMPING pic.twitter.com/cJtZna6JdK — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) March 19, 2025 Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin maintains a price point of $84,000 as it experiences faint downward movement during the last day. The price of BTC remains close to its support level after its previous-day increase following the recent FOMC meeting. The Bitcoin market has shown excellent performance this year after a temporary decline because worldwide liquidity continues to grow while keeping its status among the leading Crypto Tokens to Hold. The crypto analyst suggests BTC will keep its momentum if it maintains a position above the critical support level of $86,413. The support level at $86,413 could enable BTC to build momentum for new highs in its price. The upcoming target stands at $130,631.14 as it reinforces a bullish trend outlook. Shiba Inu (SHIB) The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price maintains its position above $0.000012 support but bulls try to restore upward price movement. The price of SHIB may experience a substantial increase as bullish pressure fortifies making it among the top crypto tokens to watch. Both the Shiba Inu burn approach, and the SHIB network and other meme tokens increase excitement about this token. The 1D analysis by crypto analysts indicates SHIB’s potential bullish breakout because the token is breaking free from the falling wedge pattern. (Ripple) XRP The XRP price demonstrated a 300% growth throughout the previous year which led it to become one of the most successful altcoin performers. The current value of XRP stands at $2.40, and its price has declined by 3% throughout the past day. The crypto market continues to monitor XRP as one of its leading crypto coins top watch. Active digital addresses on the XRP network have risen sharply to almost 627,000 during this period which stands as the most since April 2023. The growing XRP ecosystem participation has caused this surge in network activity resulting in higher prospects of upward price movements because market sentiment is strengthening. TRON (TRX) TRON (TRX) experienced a minimal price increase to reach the $0.2338 level in the market on March 21, 2025. TRON (TRX) price currently operates in a price range between $0.22 and $0.25. MACD lines demonstrate neutral market conditions because they display minimal separation from each other. If the bullish trend continues, the TRX price could rally up to $0.25 this week.

The clarity around Ripple’s legal status is easing concerns, allowing institutions to feel more confident about investing in XRP. With the SEC no longer actively litigating against Ripple, institutions are likely to increase their investments. Despite the positive news that the SEC has dropped its appeal in the Ripple case, XRP’s price didn’t explode as many might have expected. It didn’t skyrocket by 30-40% or break past $3. However, crypto expert Dark Defender believes XRP could skyrocket by over 12,000%, possibly reaching $280 in the next few years. This prediction is based on past trends, like the 2017 rally when XRP went from pennies to nearly $4. He sees similar patterns in the current market, suggesting another big price jump could be coming. Institutional Investments and Spot ETFs Attorney Fred Rispoli, on the Thinking Crypto podcast, said that the dropping of the appeal could lead to a more favorable environment for institutional investors. Additionally, the SEC might be more inclined to approve XRP spot ETFs now that the active litigation is no longer hanging over the case. This could be a pivotal moment for Ripple and its long-term business strategy, especially as institutional interest grows. Risk Averse Institutions and Programmatic Sales While institutions are generally risk-averse, the removal of uncertainty regarding Ripple’s legal standing could lead to increased institutional interest. The SEC’s decision to drop the appeal removes a significant layer of risk. However, institutions may still be hesitant until the final resolution is achieved. The appeal’s dismissal brings Ripple closer to the goal of fully clearing its name, but some risk remains until the final judgments are made clear. Waiting for Ripple’s Next Moves As Ripple moves past the appeal, the next step will be to see how they communicate with institutional partners. While the appeal’s dismissal is a major development, Ripple will likely continue to engage in negotiations and wait for official documentation before announcing partnerships or other major moves. The market will likely see XRP’s price respond positively in the coming weeks as these developments take place.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|REGULATION|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-21 09:58:24

Digital assets are scattered across multiple platforms, blockchain congestion slows trade execution, and centralized exchanges expose users to security vulnerabilities, including fraud and hacks. Yellow Network introduces a groundbreaking solution – a Layer-3 decentralized clearing network that leverages state channels to facilitate near-instant, scalable, and cost-efficient trading. What Are State Channels and How Does Yellow Network Use Them? State channels are a Layer-2 scaling mechanism that allows participants to execute transactions off-chain while recording only final balances on-chain. Imagine a bar tab: instead of paying for each drink individually, you tally everything and settle the total at the end of the night. Similarly, Yellow Network batches multiple trades off-chain and periodically settles them on-chain – reducing congestion and transaction costs while maintaining robust security. To trade within the Yellow Network, participants initiate a state channel by locking collateral into a smart contract. Transactions occur instantly and without gas fees. Once trading concludes, only the net balance is recorded on-chain, consolidating multiple trades into a single transaction. In case of disputes, smart contracts enforce settlements based on the most recent agreed trade state. How Yellow Network Transforms Trading By implementing state channels, Yellow Network enables: Ultra-fast transactions – comparable to high-frequency trading in traditional finance Significantly reduced fees – by minimizing on-chain operations Seamless cross-chain liquidity – eliminating fragmentation across networks Non-custodial security – ensuring users retain full control over their assets A Layer-3 Evolution for Decentralized Trading Yellow Network is more than just an innovation – it’s a paradigm shift in decentralized finance. As a Layer-3 solution, it harmonizes speed, security, and decentralization without forcing traders to compromise. By eliminating long-standing trade-offs, it brings institutional-grade liquidity and high-frequency trading capabilities to the decentralized world. For traders, this means faster execution, lower costs, and enhanced security. For brokers and exchanges, it provides an efficient way to aggregate liquidity across chains without fragmentation. The future of crypto trading isn’t just decentralized – it’s scalable, seamless, and lightning-fast.",Crypto News|Press Release|Yellow Network,EN,0,0,TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-03-21 09:59:06

The country’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has identified multiple crypto platforms operating illegally without proper registration. These exchanges have been offering services to South Korean investors—providing Korean-language websites, marketing, and customer support—without complying with local regulations. Now, authorities are looking into blocking access to these platforms and taking strict action within the year. Multiple Exchanges Face Sanctions South Korea takes crypto offenders very seriously and gets on their toes to regulate the crypto industry and prevent financial misconduct. According to local reports , the FIU is working with the Korea Communications Standards Commission to analyze investor damages and enforce stricter oversight. Exchanges that fail to register as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) under the Specific Financial Information Act are under intense scrutiny. The government is making it clear—if you want to operate in South Korea, you must follow the rules. KuCoin, BitMEX, CoinW, Bitunix, and KCEX are among the exchanges facing potential sanctions. Local reports suggest that authorities are already consulting with relevant organizations to take action. This comes right after the government rejected the idea of holding Bitcoin as a strategic reserve , citing its volatility and risks. At the same time, the Bank of Korea is moving ahead with its central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot, which is expected to last three months starting in April. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : China Crypto Regulation: Strategic Moves Against the Rise of US Dollar-Pegged Assets , Bithumb and Upbit Under Investigation It’s not just foreign exchanges under fire—local platforms are also facing investigations. Prosecutors recently raided Bithumb after suspicions that its former CEO, Kim Dae-sik, embezzled company funds to purchase an apartment. Bithumb denied any wrongdoing, stating that Kim had already taken a loan to repay the funds. Meanwhile, reports have surfaced that intermediaries were allegedly paid millions to list crypto projects on major South Korean exchanges like Bithumb and Upbit. Upbit responded by demanding transparency and asking for a list of projects involved in these alleged deals.

According to reports, there are pubs and entertainment venues that exclusively accept crypto payments. Here comes the future of crypto in popular businesses. The first case involves a bar in DC that was popular with Republican staffers. Apparently, it announced that it was closing and would be replaced by a bar that only takes crypto like Bitcoin as payment. Pubkey, a bar in Greenwich Village that describes itself as a “vibrant bitcoin community,” had taken over the lease of Hill Country . Hill Country is a popular Texas barbecue restaurant and music venue that recently announced it would close its doors in Penn Quarter after 14 years. To the folks that care, welp, it's Hill Country: https://t.co/xt12lYdY2W — PoPville (@PoPville) March 19, 2025 Pubkey’s move to Washington is a big deal in the history of crypto, even if it doesn’t replace the Republican bar. With the bar’s opening coming up soon, it looks like the crypto community is actually making progress in the nation’s capital. Lawmakers used to think that crypto enthusiasts were just a bunch of shady libertarians. Still, now that big names in crypto, like David Sacks and Elon Musk, backed Trump’s reelection, the crypto community has a lot of power in the Trump administration. In fact, now businesses can make crypto payments without debanking. Hill Country is to be replaced by Pubkey, a business that runs on crypto Hill Country was not just your normal bar. It is a bar with decor that screams “TEXAS” louder than anyone else’s. It has long been known as a great place for Republican workers to go out at night for live country music, a good smoked brisket, and reasonably priced well liquor. It’s also a spot where powerful GOP lawmakers might be seen having fun. For instance, in 2023, Rep. George Santos was seen singing “I Will Survive” at a karaoke bar. At the time, he was being investigated by the federal government and Congress for theft and lying about his background. Trump was the first president to use Bitcoin for transactions, which was seen as a sign of support for the crypto community. He used $998.70 worth of Bitcoin to buy smash burgers for everyone. Pubkey, which opened in 2022 near the Manhattan campus of New York University, has a very laid-back vibe. It’s a dive bar/podcast studio that’s buried underground and serves pub food created by a former employee of Eleven Madison Park. Anyone could hang out there as long as they paid with cryptocurrency. Democrats seen in a crypto business Pubkey owner Thomas Pacchia said that the company will open a location in Washington, DC, in the next few months. Even though he knew that Trump’s visit got bad press, Pacchia said that Democrats like Rep. Ritchie Torres and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand had also been to Pubkey and hoped that the new address would bring in people from both parties. He said that anyone who wants to talk about Bitcoin is welcome. In the last few years, more and more places to hang out that focus on crypto have opened up all over the country. Meanwhile, the global crypto market cap today is $2.85 Trillion, a 3.9% decline in the last 24 hours. Trump’s policies have hit all markets. When everything is hopefully settled, there will be more than enough reasons for the industry to rally. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The trader has made around $20 million in profit from leveraged trading, raising questions about their identity. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Get ‘Interesting’ As Price Retests $85,000 – Here Are The Levels To Watch Mysterious Hyperliquid Whale Not A Crypto Insider On Thursday, ZachXBT shared an investigation revealing the “Hyperliquid Whale” as a British hacker previously charged with multiple crimes. The trader’s identity has been a hot topic among crypto investors over the past few weeks. According to the X thread, the trader was identified as William Parker, known as Alistair Packover, before he changed his name. Parker was arrested and sentenced in Finland in 2024 for stealing nearly $1 million from two online casinos in 2023. Since January 2025, the trader has made millions by opening several highly leveraged positions on Hyperliquid and GMX but gained attention this month for two specific trades. Right before US President Donald Trump’s “Strategic Crypto Reserve” announcement on March 2, the whale opened a large Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) long position on 50X leverage using address 0xe4d3. Following this trade, the crypto community speculated that the whale could be an insider, with some users alleging that the trader was linked to the Trump family due to their timing. Meanwhile, others suggested that the mysterious whale was tied to the North Korean hacking group Lazarus. The trader later opened a BTC short position on 40X leverage using address 0xf3F4, profiting $19 million from the two positions. After the whale closed its short position earlier this week, the crypto sleuth revealed that the trader was allegedly involved in illicit activity. “It’s funny watching CT speculate on the ‘Hyperliquid whale’ when in reality it’s just a cybercriminal gambling with stolen funds,” he initially responded to the speculation. Connecting The On-Chain Dots In the thread, ZachXBT shared four key counterparties of the 0xf3f address, including 0xe4d3, which he had identified. He also noted that the cluster was tied to Roobet, Binance, Gamdom, ChangeNOW, Shuffle, Alphapo, BC Game, and Metawin accounts. Additionally, the 0xf3f signed a message on-chain with an X account under the username @qwatio, which has seemingly been purchased recently. After the crypto detective’s initial claims, the X user denied the cybercrime allegations and claimed the $20 million profits from the GMX and HL trades were clean and traceable on the blockchain. However, the on-chain investigator alleges that “he would have to control the related wallets in this cluster for the $20M number to be accurate.” Notably, an address in the cluster, 0x7ab, was found to have received funds from a phishing scam and an exploited casino game on Solana. Related Reading: SUI Ready For 15% Move Amid Key Level Retest – Breakout Or Breakdown Ahead? Then, ZachXBT tracked down a recent payment from 0xe4d3 and obtained a UK phone number that seemingly connects the trader and the name William Parker. I tracked down a recent payment from 0xe4d3 to an unnamed person who confirmed they had been paid by the HL trader. They provided a UK phone number used to communicate with them. Public record reveals the name William Parker is likely tied to this number. The crypto sleuth concluded that Parker, who was also convicted three times in the early 2010s for crimes related to fraud, hacking, and gambling, has now “gambled 6 figs into $20M using high leverage on-chain” for the past two months, and will likely continue to do so.

XRP ( XRP ) climbed 4% to $2.41 on Friday, March 21, as options traders focused on in-the-money calls, leading open interest. According to data from Deribit, options traders “are piling into the March 28 expiry, where ITM calls are leading open interest.” $XRP is holding steady at $2.48, up 6.38% today.

With the SEC out of the picture now, what do you think is next for XRP? pic.twitter.com/8x1cpv33vx — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) March 20, 2025 The rally followed Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse’s announcement that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would drop its appeal in the long-running lawsuit against the company. In an X post , Garlinghouse said that the SEC’s decision to drop its lawsuit appeal marks a turning point for XRP, noting though that the commission still had to vote on the matter, leaving some uncertainty.

Now, traders appear to be betting on further upside. Despite the initial surge, some caution remains. As crypto.news reported earlier, analysts point to key support at $2.2653, with a break below potentially signaling a trend reversal. However, technical indicators suggest further gains are possible. Market sentiment also shows mixed signals. Data from Coinglass indicates that the long/short ratio for XRP exceeds 1 on most derivatives exchanges, suggesting bullish positioning. But funding rates have turned negative, often a bearish sign. Earlier, Garlinghouse hinted at more developments ahead, mentioning the possibility of an XRP ETF by late 2025. In an interview with Bloomberg, Garlinghouse said that an XRP spot ETF approval is likely by the second half of 2025.

Ethereum (ETH) For the first time in over three weeks, Ethereum closes the past seven days in green with almost a 4% gain. This comes after the price bounced on the key support at $1,800 and briefly revisited $2,000. However, at the time of this post, the price fell under $2,000 as it entered a pullback. While this is normal after its recent bounce, it is critical for buyers to push ETH back above this key level if they hope to reverse the current downtrend. Looking ahead, Ethereum must do its best to avoid lower lows. Hopefully, bulls will manage to consolidate around current levels before attempting a breakout to recover the losses since December 2024. Chart by TradingView Ripple ( XRP ) XRP closes another week in green with a 4.5% price increase. This performance allowed the asset to reach nearly $2.6 before the current pullback. If this bullish momentum continues, then buyers could see XRP come close to the key resistance at $3. While the recent price action looks promising, on a macro level, XRP continues to be in a consolidation period characterized by a flat trend. For the price to enter a rally, the resistance at $3 has to be broken. Looking ahead, XRP appears to be building its confidence in breaking the key resistance. The true test will come once the price approaches $3. At that point, sellers could return. Chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) ADA continues to move sideways, with prices similar to last week. A look at the weekly chart shows that the asset barely moved, with volatility under 2%. This compression could eventually lead to a major breakout. The momentum indicators and volume remain somewhat bearish, but as long as the key support at $0.64 holds, buyers have a good shot at regaining control and pushing ADA back into an uptrend. The resistance is at $0.9. Looking ahead, Cardano is at a crossroads. The lack of volatility indicates indecision among market participants, but this is unlikely to last, and the price could soon pick a direction. Chart by TradingView Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin is one of the top performers this week, with a 9% price increase. This is impressive and allowed the asset to move above $600, which is currently acting as key support. If the rally continues, BNB will face resistance at $650 and $700. These levels have attracted sellers in the past, and this could be repeated unless buyers are able to overcome any selling pressure. Looking ahead, BNB is well-positioned to make higher highs in the days to come. Watch the key resistance levels for signs of weakness. If sellers return, this cryptocurrency could enter a pullback. Chart by TradingView Toncoin (TON) Toncoin surprised the market with an impressive 32% surge this week after its price found good support at $2.5. Buyers came in force there, and they managed to erase the losses from early March. However, the asset arrived at the $2.75 resistance, where sellers started to show up and managed to stop the current rally, at least for now. If TON hopes to continue its ascent, it will have to break above this level soon. Otherwise, bears could push it into a longer pullback. Looking ahead, Toncoin has a good opportunity to invalidate the downtrend that started in late 2024. This can be achieved if the price turns the resistance at $2.75 into a support in the future.

This move has attracted people, from everyday investors to large financial institutions and even presidents of various countries, such as the United States and Argentinian presidents. Meme coins were once thought of as playful and fun parodies since they were linked to internet jokes, but with the increasing eruption of coins linked to celebrities, viral trends, and even politicians, these coins are now very volatile and mere speculative assets. Let’s explore the wild world of meme coins and the risks associated with them. What are meme coins? Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency that grows based on community engagement, internet culture, and social media hype. They do not have any intrinsic value beyond these, unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin , which offer some form of value as a digital asset. They are often viewed as akin to casino chips instead of a regulated investment. They were initially created as parodies or jokes, but due to speculative interest, they gained traction, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) being a forerunner. There are others, such as Shiba Inu and Floki Inu, which have a huge community, but a vast majority of these meme coins do not have strong followings. Interestingly, Donald Trump created a $TRUMP token some days before he was inaugurated as president. This token was marketed as an expression for the meme coin and cryptocurrency community. However, like its counterparts, it increased by around 200% before it crashed below its offering price within days. This has been the rule, and there have been no exceptions, not even for tokes launched by presidents. The link between meme coins and fraud There are several criminal risks associated with meme coins. One instance occurred in October 2024, when the United States authorities charged top crypto companies and 18 individuals with several crimes against casual investors. It is worth noting that these frauds are usually dependent on key players in the cryptocurrency sector, often termed market makers. They artificially inflate prices and trading volumes via wash trades, creating fake transactions that suggest more buyer interest for the unsuspecting everyday investors. However, this isn’t the only issue; pump-and-dump schemes where prices are also artificially inflated before a major sell-off that leaves investors with losses, is another issue. Individuals considering investing in the cryptocurrency industry must know how these scams work to protect themselves. The future of meme coins With the increasing uncertainty of meme coins after the failed launch of $TRUMP and President Javier Milei promotion of Libra which tanked drastically, the native token of meme coins token Solana has been on a freeride down from its January all-time high. Many believe that the proliferation of meme coins at an alarming rate may result in huge consequences as these tokens largely detract from the fundamentals of cryptocurrency assets. Endnote Every investor must view meme coins with caution, just like entertainment and gambling instead of a portfolio investment. Meme coins are highly speculative in nature, and with their vulnerability to fraud and pump-and-dump schemes, it poses a huge risk to everyday investors, especially inexperienced ones.",Crypto News|Press Release|meme coins,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|DOGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-03-21 10:04:59
42090937,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142143,1742551533,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking X Account Hack at Watcher Guru: Crypto Security Under Threat!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/watcher-guru-x-account-hack/,"In a startling turn of events for the crypto community, popular crypto news platform Watcher Guru has reported a security breach of its official X (formerly Twitter) account. Despite having robust security measures in place, including two-factor authentication (2FA), the platform confirmed that its account was compromised. This incident immediately raises critical questions about the security landscape within the crypto space, especially for media outlets that are prime targets for malicious actors. Let’s dive into the details of this developing situation and understand the broader implications for crypto security and social media safety. What We Know About the Watcher Guru X Account Hack Watcher Guru, a well-known source for real-time updates and news within the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, alerted its followers and the wider crypto community about the hack. Here’s a breakdown of what has been officially reported: The Announcement: Watcher Guru publicly announced the hack through their alternative channels, confirming that their primary X account had been compromised. Security Measures in Place: In their statement, Watcher Guru emphasized that they had implemented significant security protocols, including two-factor authentication. This detail is particularly noteworthy because 2FA is widely considered a crucial security layer against unauthorized access. Ongoing Investigation: The platform is currently conducting a thorough investigation into the incident to determine the extent of the breach and how it occurred despite their existing security measures. Seeking X Support: Watcher Guru is actively working to contact X support to regain control of their hacked account and to understand the vulnerabilities that might have been exploited. This incident serves as a stark reminder that even with seemingly robust security measures, online platforms and accounts can still be vulnerable. For a crypto news platform like Watcher Guru, which disseminates information to a vast audience, the implications of such a breach can be significant, potentially impacting trust and information integrity within the crypto community. Why is Social Media Security Paramount for Crypto News Platforms? In the fast-paced and often volatile world of cryptocurrency, information is power. Crypto news platforms like Watcher Guru play a vital role in keeping investors, enthusiasts, and the general public informed about market trends, technological advancements, regulatory updates, and much more. Here’s why social media security is non-negotiable for these platforms: Direct Communication Channel: Social media, especially platforms like X, serve as direct communication channels between crypto news outlets and their audience. Hacks can disrupt this vital flow of information. Reputation and Trust: A security breach can severely damage the reputation of a crypto news platform . Trust is paramount in the media industry, and a hack can erode audience confidence. Misinformation and Scams: Compromised social media accounts can be used to spread misinformation, promote scams, or even manipulate market sentiment. Imagine the chaos if a hacked account of a major crypto news outlet falsely announced a major regulatory crackdown or a fake exchange collapse. Financial Implications: Beyond reputation, prolonged account inaccessibility can lead to loss of traffic, advertising revenue, and overall business disruption for a crypto news platform . Target for Malicious Actors: Due to their influence and reach, crypto news platforms are attractive targets for hackers who may have various motives, from causing disruption to financial gain through market manipulation or phishing scams targeting followers. The Watcher Guru X account hack underscores the critical need for enhanced security measures and constant vigilance in the digital age, particularly within the high-stakes crypto industry. Two-Factor Authentication: Is it Still Enough for Crypto Security? The fact that Watcher Guru had two-factor authentication enabled but still fell victim to a hack raises a crucial question: Is 2FA still sufficient for robust crypto security ? Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step, usually a code from a mobile device, in addition to a password. While 2FA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, it is not impenetrable. Here are some potential vulnerabilities and considerations: Challenge Description Implication for Crypto Security SIM Swapping: Attackers can trick mobile providers into transferring a target’s phone number to a SIM card they control. Bypasses SMS-based 2FA, giving hackers access to verification codes. Phishing Attacks: Sophisticated phishing campaigns can mimic legitimate login pages and trick users into entering their credentials and 2FA codes. Users may unknowingly provide their 2FA codes to attackers, rendering it ineffective. Malware and Keyloggers: Malware on a user’s device can intercept login credentials and even 2FA codes as they are entered. Compromises the security of the entire device and all accounts accessed from it. Vulnerabilities in 2FA Methods: Certain 2FA methods, like SMS-based codes, are inherently less secure than authenticator apps or hardware security keys. Attackers may target weaker 2FA methods to gain access. Account Takeover Attacks: Attackers might gain access through other vulnerabilities in the platform’s security infrastructure, bypassing user-level 2FA. Indicates broader security weaknesses beyond individual user accounts. While 2FA remains a vital security tool, it’s clear that it’s not a silver bullet. For crypto security to be truly effective, a multi-layered approach is essential, combining strong passwords, 2FA (preferably app-based or hardware keys), vigilant monitoring, and proactive security updates. Actionable Insights: Strengthening Your Crypto and Social Media Security The Watcher Guru incident serves as a wake-up call for everyone in the crypto space – from individuals to large platforms. Here are some actionable steps to bolster your crypto security and social media defenses: Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Employ complex passwords and avoid reusing them across different platforms. Consider using a password manager. Upgrade to App-Based 2FA: Switch from SMS-based 2FA to authenticator apps (like Google Authenticator, Authy) or hardware security keys (like YubiKey) for enhanced security. Beware of Phishing: Be extremely cautious of suspicious emails, messages, and links. Always verify the authenticity of login pages and communication requests. Regular Security Audits: For platforms and businesses, conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in systems and processes. Educate Your Team and Audience: Promote security awareness among your team and audience. Share best practices for online safety and crypto security . Monitor Account Activity: Regularly monitor your social media and crypto accounts for any unusual activity or unauthorized access attempts. Keep Software Updated: Ensure your operating systems, browsers, and security software are always up to date with the latest security patches. Consider Multi-Signature Wallets: For significant crypto holdings, explore the use of multi-signature wallets which require multiple private keys for transactions, adding an extra layer of security. The Evolving Landscape of Crypto Security Threats The digital realm is constantly evolving, and so are the tactics of cybercriminals. Crypto security is an ongoing arms race, requiring continuous adaptation and improvement. As the crypto industry matures and becomes more mainstream, it also attracts more sophisticated and persistent threat actors. We can expect to see: More Advanced Phishing Techniques: Phishing attacks will likely become even more sophisticated and harder to detect. Increased Exploitation of Zero-Day Vulnerabilities: Hackers will actively seek out and exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in software and platforms. AI-Powered Cyberattacks: The use of artificial intelligence by cybercriminals to automate and enhance their attacks is a growing concern. Regulatory Scrutiny and Compliance: Increased regulatory focus on the crypto industry will likely drive the need for stronger security standards and compliance measures. Staying ahead of these evolving threats requires a proactive and adaptable approach to crypto security . Individuals and organizations must remain vigilant, informed, and committed to implementing and updating their security practices. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Security The hack of Watcher Guru’s X account is more than just an isolated incident; it’s a stark warning about the ever-present and evolving threats in the crypto security landscape. It highlights that even with standard security measures like 2FA, vulnerabilities can exist, and determined attackers can find ways to exploit them. For crypto news platforms , which are crucial information disseminators, and for the entire crypto ecosystem, this incident underscores the absolute necessity of prioritizing and continuously enhancing security protocols. Vigilance, education, and proactive security measures are not just best practices – they are essential for survival in the increasingly complex and dangerous digital world of cryptocurrency.

Starting today, March 21, 2025, Binance has introduced a “Vote to Delist” feature, an initiative that would allow its community members to participate in deciding which tokens should be removed from the platform Notably, Binance users will be voting on cryptocurrencies included in Binance’s monitoring zone. Tokens listed in this category are at risk of delisting due to poor liquidity, inactivity, or other red flags. When writing there were a total of 27 cryptocurrencies in the Monitoring Zone. Some notable projects include JasmyCoin ( JASMY ) with a market cap of $636 million, Zcash ( ZEC ) at $502 million, and FTX Token (FTT) at $399 million. Some cryptocurrencies in Binance’s Monitoring Zone | Source: Binance Voting eligibility will require users to have a verified Binance account and maintain a minimum balance of 0.01 BNB throughout the voting period, which will last till March 27, 2025, 23:59 UTC.​ Eligible users can vote for up to five projects in the delisting pool, with one vote per project. Votes must be submitted under the official post on Binance Square Official to be considered valid.​ While the move aims to enhance listing governance and give the community “a greater voice”, according to Binance’s announcement, community votes will not be the sole factor in delisting decisions.

Binance has delisted tokens in the past for not meeting these standards, even some big names like Monero (XMR), Filecoin (FIL), and Internet Computer (ICP). The introduction of the delisting feature was accompanied by Binance’s announcement regarding the removal of five cryptocurrencies from its trading platform. The tokens include Aergo (AERGO), AirSwap (AST), BurgerCities (BURGER), COMBO (COMBO), and Linear Finance (LINA), which will be delisted at 11:00 AM on March 28, 2025 (UTC+8). All these altcoins dropped after the announcement, with BURGER taking the biggest hit, plunging 48.1% within two hours, while the others saw losses ranging from 5% to 35%. The development comes amid a broader market downturn, with major crypto assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Cardano ( ADA ) experiencing losses between 2% and 4%.

Of the three, USDtb — a stablecoin designed to contrast with Ethena's USDe — has had the fastest growth, adding over 1,000% in TVL in the last month. USDtb is backed by tokenized BlackRock money-market fund shares whereas USDe uses crypto-assets and perpetual futures strategies for crypto-driven yields. CoinDesk previously reported that Treasury-backed tokens reached a record $4.2 billion market cap in the first quarter, driven by growth in Ondo Finance's OUSG and USDY tokens, BlackRock and Securitize's BUIDL, Franklin Templeton's BENJI and Superstate's USTB. Treasury-backed tokens dominate, according to data aggregator RWA.xyz . The next highest category, tokenized commodities, comes in at $1.26 billion, with Paxos Gold leading with TVL of just over $500 million.

Tradingview data shows that the XRP/ETH ratio has climbed to 0.00121, which is the highest level since March 2020. With XRP being the second-largest altcoin, will these gains continue and push Ripple’s market cap past Ethereum’s current $237 billion market cap? Let’s explore. How Much Will XRP Price Be If Its Market Cap Equaled Ethereum’s XRP has a market cap of $138 billion which is nearly 50% the market cap of Ethereum. Ripple also has a circulating supply of 58.12 billion coins. If XRP price recorded a parabolic rally and its market cap equaled that of Ethereum while the circulating supply remained constant, Ripple would be worth $4.08. Additionally, Ethereum’s all-time high market cap was $571 billion posted in November 2021. In case of a bull market, where both Ethereum and XRP price rally , Ripple would have to reach $9.82 to equal ETH’s all-time high market cap. This means that in a bear market, XRP would have to reach $4.08 to flip Ethereum while in a bull market, Ripple would be worth nearly $10 to equal Ethereum’s record high market cap of $571 billion. However, it is important to note that XRP’s maximum supply is 100 billion tokens. In 2017, Ripple changed XRP tokenomics and placed 55 billion XRP in escrow. If Ripple released the entire supply of 100 billion tokens, XRP would be worth between $2.40 and $5.71 to equal Ethereum’s market cap. Bullish Catalysts That Would Drive XRP Price Rally It is possible for XRP to equal Ethereum’s market cap because of several catalysts that will support an uptrend. The first is rising institutional interest. The recently launched spot XRP futures by Bitnomial and the pending approval of spot XRP ETFs could drive massive gains toward the $4 to $10 price target. Former Fox reporter Eleanor Terrett has also confirmed that Trump’s pick for SEC Chair , Paul Atkins, will appear before the US banking committee for his nomination hearing. The XRP community anticipates that Atkin’s confirmation will see the SEC formally issue a statement confirming the end of Ripple’s case. High institutional demand and a formal end of this case are the main catalysts that will cause XRP price to equal Ethereum’s market cap. XRP/ETH Technical Analysis XRP/ETH has been rising since forming a golden cross in January this year. This ratio will continue to rise as Ripple draws institutional interest when demand for Ethereum has faded with more than two weeks of consistent outflows from ETH ETFs. XRP is attracting massive attention from both retail and institutional traders compared to Ethereum. If this progressed, the XRP/ETH ratio could increase to the 261.8% Fibonacci level of 0.00316. This will push it towards its all-time high of 0.00503. XRP/ETH: 1-Week Chart In conclusion, for XRP price to attain the same market as Ethereum, it will have to rally to between $4 and $10. However, this outlook is based on XRP continuing to outperform Ethereum in the coming years.

The EC claims the money can be used in a more productive way, providing the EU with cash to invest in strategic objectives. The bloc’s executive body announced it’s launching the newly adopted Savings and Investments Union ( SIU ) strategy this week . The initiative aims to enhance Europe’s financial system in order to translate savings into needed investments more effectively. Brussels wants to channel household savings into productive investments The Commission assures the SIU will create better financial opportunities for all, including broader access to capital markets for Europeans as well as better financing options for European companies. “This can foster citizens’ wealth while boosting EU economic growth and competitiveness,” it insisted. The funds that Brussels is interested in amount to €10 trillion ($10.8 trillion), which is what European households now keep in bank deposits. The latter are “safe and easy to access, but they usually earn less money than investments in capital markets,” a press release pointed out. “Currently, too few European citizens make a decent return on their hard-earned savings. At least not in a simple and cost-efficient way. In Europe, we have over 10 trillion euros sitting in low yield deposit accounts,” EU Commissioner for Financial Services Maria Luis Albuquerque told media on Wednesday. The hope is to entice Europeans to put their money to work in capital markets in pursuit of better returns compared to regular bank deposits. According to data shared in a Euronews report, households in member-states save €1.4 trillion annually, but around €300 billion of these savings end up in non-EU markets now. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen described the proposal as a double win. “Households will have more and safer opportunities to invest in capital markets and increase their wealth. At the same time, businesses will have easier access to capital to innovate, grow and create good jobs in Europe,” she stated. We are making investing in Europe easier. The Savings & Investments Union will boost growth and create good jobs. And it will give citizens more choice to make the best financial decisions for themselves. — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) March 19, 2025 EU needs up to €800 billion each year to remain competitive The European Union will need €750-800 billion in additional investments per year by 2030 to adequately address current challenges stemming from geopolitical, technological and climate changes, according to the Competitiveness Compass, another initiative of the Commission. Add to that number the growing defense needs . The estimate comes from a 400-page report presented by former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi last year. The document highlighted certain transformational imperatives and suggested concrete steps the EU needs to take to remain competitive on the global stage. “We have reached the point where, without action, we will have to either compromise our welfare, our environment or our freedom,” said Draghi, who also headed the European Central Bank until 2019. He urged for a swift EU response to prevent lagging behind competitors like China and the U.S. Much of the money should fund small and medium-sized companies The European Commission said a lot of the additional investment should go to small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) in the Union. These firms cannot rely on bank financing alone, it noted, insisting the SIU can effectively connect citizens’ savings with these businesses’ investment needs. “The EU is equipped with a talented workforce, innovative companies and a large pool of household savings,” Brussels’ executive arm emphasized. “More investments in capital markets support the real economy by enabling companies across Europe to grow and thrive. This can create better jobs with more competitive salaries,” it added. Capital should to become more accessible to European companies, the Commission believes. In this context, it intends to tackle barriers preventing banks, insurers and pension funds from investing in equity and reform securitization rules. Removing regulatory and supervisory barriers to cross-border business operations, asset management and distribution of funds is also on the agenda. The launch of the Savings and Investments Union indicates that EU officials have come to the realization that public funding alone would not be sufficient to satisfy all ambitions, hence the push to channel private money into capital markets. Critics have raised concerns, however, that private capital won’t meet Europe’s increased investment needs either and called for reviewing public finances.

Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped 10%, its worst first-quarter performance since 2020, and ether (ETH) has posted its weakest first quarter since inception. So far, bitcoin has been relatively steady in March. Markets remain in the latter stages of President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office, a period historically marked by uncertainty and volatility. This is expected to persist at least through the end of April. As quarter-end approaches, negative liquidity and position management could lead to increased volatility and whipsaw price action, according to the London Crypto Club , founders of a trading newsletter. Despite short-term weakness, the pair maintain a bullish outlook heading into the second quarter. A slightly more dovish tone from the Federal Reserve at its March meeting — even without actual rate cuts — combined with a weakening U.S. dollar, increased fiscal spending in the European Union and a U.S. economy that is slowing but not collapsing, are all factors they say will support a strong three months. Bitcoin began to sell off on Thursday following Trump's lack of a concrete update on a bitcoin strategic reserve or a tax-free crypto capital gains policy. “Market participants were hoping for a tax-free capital gains framework or a bitcoin national reserve accumulation plan,"" noted Blockhead Research Network (BRN). ""Instead, Trump reiterated his general support for the crypto industry, highlighting the role of stablecoins in maintaining the U.S. dollar’s dominance in global trade. While supportive in the long term, the lack of immediate policy commitments is a short-term bearish signal.” BRN sees digital assets struggling to sustain breakouts, with accumulation continuing at lower levels, particularly for altcoins. “Despite near-term weakness, we recommend staying heavily invested, as the market could react swiftly to the next positive development. Support levels are not far from current prices,” BRN told CoinDesk in an email. Stay alert!

Thus, participants can participate in the staking process without requiring the full 32 ETH to run a validator node. Furthermore, Rocket Pool introduces the concept of “rETH” tokens, which are issued to users who stake ETH in the Rocket Pool network. These rETH tokens represent users’ stake in the pool and can be traded or transferred independently of the underlying ETH, providing liquidity and flexibility to participants. Overall, Rocket Pool aims to democratize Ethereum staking and contribute to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by providing a secure, efficient, and accessible platform for staking participation. As DeFi continues to gain traction, Rocket Pool stands out as a pioneering project at the forefront of innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The US authorities have charged Joseph Strange (46) of Michigan, USA, with criminal infringement of a copyright and interstate transportation of stolen goods, according to a press release by the US Department of Justice ( DOJ ).

And, now in a report shared with CoinGape, MoonPay has revealed that it secured a $200 million revolving credit line from Galaxy on Thursday – implying its preparation for foreseen high liquidity demands. Amid renewed bullish momentum in the crypto markets with ETH reaching $2000, the deal with Galaxy Digital, will provide MoonPay with enhanced liquidity during events of higher volumes and higher transactions demands. Notably, in a X post, Keith A. Grossman, President of MoonPay revealed that “Since the U.S. presidential election last November, MoonPay has seen “incredible demand” for crypto.” “If you compare the four months prior to the election to the four months following the election, our average daily volumes have nearly doubled (+98%),” he said. With its first ever revolving credit line, it can now operate 24/7/365 within the framework of the traditional banking system that currently runs 9 – 5, Monday – Friday. MoonPay is proud to announce a new $200M revolving credit line from @GalaxyHQ to help fuel onboarding around the world! As @ivanhodl says, ""this revolving credit line from Galaxy provides us with the financial flexibility to meet the increased demand and continue delivering… pic.twitter.com/SUl0JTbiiZ — MoonPay (@moonpay) March 20, 2025 Why MoonPay secured a Credit Line A revolving credit facility actually differs from traditional loans by allowing a company to borrow, repay, and borrow again within a predetermined limit. And this credit line from Galaxy will provide options to Moonpay to approach it in times of higher liquidity needed to scale operations without the constraints of fixed repayment structures. By securing $200 million, MoonPay is positioning itself to handle increased transaction volumes, roll out new features, and enhance its compliance infrastructure amid evolving global regulations. The funds will also help mitigate volatility risks in the fast-moving crypto industry, ensuring the company remains resilient against market fluctuations. Notably, the revolving credit line allows the companies to access capital when needed, improving its ability to manage cash flow and respond to market dynamics more effectively. In this case, , moonpay would be able to secure funds from Galaxy instead of using its own balance sheet. Additionally, it told BrandTalk that it is securing the credit line for future events as it has ended 2024 cash-flow positive and profitable, achieving 112% YoY net revenue growth. Expanding Amidst a Crypto Resurgence Notably, the credit line comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market is experiencing a resurgence, driven by institutional adoption, favorable regulatory developments, and a growing appetite for digital assets among retail investors. Bitcoin price recently crossed the $80,000 mark and is expected to rally further. Ethereum is seeing strong inflows following the approval of spot ETFs in major markets. Ethereum (ETH) recently also surpassed the $2,000 mark, signaling renewed bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market. Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Global Head of Digital Assets, has also suggested that a potential recession could drive up Bitcoin’s value, contributing to a surge in meme coins by 67.68% over the past 24 hours. Positive sentiment is further bolstered by legal developments. For instance, XRP’s price has jumped over 8% after Ripple’s CEO announced that the SEC had dropped its case against the company. Thus, MoonPay’s latest funding move aligns with its aggressive push in the bullish market helping it to expand its ecosystem, which includes partnerships with major fintech firms, NFT platforms, and blockchain projects. The company has been enhancing its services to cater to both emerging and established markets, reinforcing its commitment to financial inclusion through crypto accessibility. Crypto Companies Racing to Secure Capital? MoonPay isn’t the only company reinforcing its financial position. Several other crypto firms have recently secured liquidity to meet market demands: CoreWeave obtained a $650 million credit facility to expand its cloud computing services for AI and crypto mining. Cipher Mining extended its Bitcoin-backed loan facility with Coinbase to $35 million. Coinbase reintroduced Bitcoin-backed lending services, allowing users to borrow against their BTC holdings. These moves highlight a broader industry trend: crypto firms are shoring up liquidity to prepare for higher trading activity and potential regulatory changes. Thus, the $200 million credit line not only fortifies MoonPay’s financial position but also sends a strong signal about the growing confidence in crypto-native financial services. As adoption rises and the market expands, MoonPay’s latest funding round positions it to lead the next phase of crypto payments evolution.

While artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming a cornerstone of business operations, blockchain technology struggles to gain a foothold. The data shows minimal adoption of blockchain technology in German companies. In 2023, only 3.2% of surveyed companies reported using blockchain, a figure that slightly decreased to 3.1% in 2024. While there was a slight uptick in companies planning to adopt blockchain, rising from 3.7% in 2023 to 4.1% in 2024, this modest increase does little to offset the overwhelming majority of businesses that consider the technology irrelevant. 72.6% of companies in 2024 declared blockchain “no topic,” a figure only marginally lower than the 74.5% recorded in 2023. Das #W3NOW Projekt, gefördert vom @BMWK , hatte das Ziel, die #Blockchain -Adoption in Deutschland zu erforschen. Im Zentrum stand die Frage, wie stark Blockchain-Technologien tatsächlich in der Wirtschaft genutzt werden?

In the service sector, 76% of companies found blockchain irrelevant in 2024, while in retail, the figure reached over 80%. Conversely, the financial services sector stands out as a key adopter, with 57% of blockchain-using companies implementing the technology (n=111). Digital identities also show promise, with 30% of blockchain users having implemented related solutions. In Germany, financial services lead blockchain use in 2024, with digital identities also showing promise. Source: W3NOW.DE 2023/2024 Report AI and Cloud Computing Adoption Rates Show Notable Growth in Germany In stark contrast to blockchain, the adoption of AI has seen explosive growth. The percentage of companies implementing AI doubled within a year, surging from 13.3% in 2023 to 27% in 2024. Similarly, the proportion of businesses planning to integrate AI rose dramatically from 9.2% to 18%. Perhaps most telling is the sharp decline in companies dismissing AI as irrelevant, dropping from 40.8% to 21.2%. Meanwhile, cloud computing remains the most pervasive technology, with 46.5% of companies utilizing it in 2023, far outpacing both blockchain and AI. The Complexities of Blockchain Adoption The survey findings also pointed to several factors hindering wider blockchain adoption. The complexity and perceived uncertainty of the technology, coupled with a risk-averse business culture, contribute to its slow uptake. Public perception, often tainted by associations with volatile cryptocurrencies, further complicates matters. The blockchain oracle problem – the inability of blockchains to access external data, the difficulty of authenticating data on the blockchain, and the lack of skilled workers are also significant hurdles. Despite these challenges, the survey identifies promising areas for blockchain application. The financial services sector, with its already established use of the technology, shows its maturity and potential. Digital identities, driven by the need for secure identity management, also offer a growth opportunity. The Hanseatic Blockchain Institute sees the need for targeted education and training, collaborative partnerships, and government support to accelerate blockchain adoption. In addition, the study calls for Germany and Europe to prioritize data sovereignty and to continue researching the long-term implications of the technology, especially in light of new EU regulations such as the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation. According to Moritz Schildt, chairman of the Hanseatic Blockchain Institute, technological innovation does not guarantee automatic adoption. He stated that “the advantages and potentials of a new technology do not spread automatically,” adding: “The replacement of proven processes with something new is not a given, and in many cases, with the emergence of new technical possibilities, it is not yet foreseeable when exactly and how exactly the new technology will be adopted, in which areas and for which tasks it will prove useful, and in what form a ‘mass adoption,’ i.e., widespread use, will develop.” The post Blockchain Stalls in Germany as AI Adoption Surges, Survey Reveals appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Adoption|AI|Germany,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-03-21 11:25:06

On March 21, blockchain security firm Cyvers flagged a suspicious Zoth transaction. The security firm said that the protocol’s deployer wallet was compromised and that the attacker withdrew over $8.4 million in crypto assets. The blockchain security firm said that within minutes, the stolen assets were converted into the DAI stablecoin and were transferred to a different address. Cyvers added the protocol’s website had been maintained in response to the incident. In a security notice, the platform confirmed that it had a security breach. The protocol said it’s working to resolve the problem as soon as possible. The Zoth team said it worked with its partners to “mitigate the impact” and fully resolve the situation. The platform promised to publish a detailed report once its investigation is completed. Since the hack, the attackers have moved the funds and swapped the assets into Ether ( ETH ), according to PeckShield. Hacker moves stolen funds. Source: Peckshield Related: SMS scammers posing as Binance have an even trickier way to fool victims Hack likely caused by admin privilege leak In a statement, the Cyvers team said the incident highlights vulnerabilities in smart contract protocols and the need for better security. Cyvers Alerts senior SOC lead Hakan Unal told Cointelegraph that a leak in admin privileges likely caused the hack. Unal said that about 30 minutes before the hack was detected, a Zoth contract was upgraded to a malicious version deployed by a suspicious address. “Unlike typical exploits, this method bypassed security mechanisms and gave full control over user funds instantly,” the security professional said. The security professional told Cointelegraph that this type of attack could be prevented by implementing multisig contract upgrades to prevent single-point failures, adding timelocks on upgrades to allow monitoring and placing real-time alerts for admin role changes. Unal added that better key management is also advised to prevent unauthorized access. While the attack could be prevented, Unal believes that this type of attack may continue to be a problem in decentralized finance (DeFi). The security professional told Cointelegraph that admin key compromises remain a “major risk” in the DeFi ecosystem. “Without decentralized upgrade mechanisms, attackers will continue targeting privileged roles to take over protocols,” Unal added.

However, BTC price has since slid toward $84,000, down 2% over the last 24 hours, raising questions about whether the asset could drop further over the next few days. BTC/USD daily chart.

Related: Here’s why Bitcoin price can’t go higher than $87.5K This has seen its Bull Score Index drop to levels last seen in 2023, signaling a possible “continuation of bearish market conditions,” according to CryptoQuant’s latest Weekly Crypto report . Key takeaways: Bitcoin’s Bull Score Index measures the percentage of several bullish metrics out of a total of ten key indicators. These are indicators that track Bitcoin’s network activity, investor profitability, demand, and market liquidity. The index ranges from 0 to 100, with higher values signaling a strong investment environment and lower values indicating bearish conditions. Historically, a score of 60 or more has always been associated with strong rallies, as seen during the 2021 bull market and again from late 2023 to early 2024. On the other hand, values below 40 have historically aligned with bear markets, such as the downturns seen during the 2022 and mid-2023 bear markets. Bitcoin: Bull Score Index. Source: CryptoQuant The chart above shows that the Bull Score Index is currently at 20, marking its lowest reading since January 2023. This “suggests a weak investment environment for Bitcoin, reducing the likelihood of a sustained rally in the near term,” CryptoQuant said, adding: “If the score remains below 40 for an extended period, it could signal the continuation of bearish market conditions, similar to previous bear market phases.” The report points out that a number of key metrics have turned red since mid-February 2025, “reflecting a deteriorating investment environment for Bitcoin.” Perhaps this is what informed CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju’s bearish sentiments when he said that the Bitcoin bull cycle is over. He added: “Expecting 6-12 months of bearish or sideways price action.” Bitcoin bear flag projects 28% more losses From a technical perspective, BTC price trades within a bearish continuation pattern that indicates a potential correction ahead despite the ongoing consolidation. Key points: BTC is trading within a bear flag pattern, indicating the possibility of continuing with the downward momentum if key support levels don’t hold. The bear flag developed after Bitcoin’s drop from $109,000 to a local low of $76,600 between Jan. 21 and March 11. The consolidation within the bear flag has BTC trading in an ascending parallel channel, with today’s drop testing critical support levels, including the lower boundary of the flag at $83,700.

The bear flag’s downside target, derived from the height of the previous drop, is approximately $60,000, representing a 28% decline from the current price. Popular analyst AlphaBTC says it “would be bad” if Bitcoin lost its 24-hour low at $83,630, which aligns with the flag’s support line.

The new DEX aims to displace Raydium, which currently dominates Solana’s memecoin trading activity. Starting on March 20, memecoins that successfully bootstrap liquidity, or “bond,” on Pump.fun can automatically migrate to PumpSwap. Previously, bonded tokens were funneled to Raydium, which benefited from the surge in memecoin trading over the past year. However, Pump.fun described the migration process as a “major point of friction” that slowed momentum and introduced unnecessary complexity for new traders. With PumpSwap, migrations now happen instantly and without fees, creating what Pump.fun calls the “most frictionless environment” for trading. The new DEX reportedly operates similarly to Raydium V4 and Uniswap V2, offering familiar functionality while providing a more streamlined experience for memecoin enthusiasts. Raydium Prepares to Launch Its Own Platform The PumpSwap debut comes just days after Raydium revealed its own plans to launch a competing memecoin launchpad called LaunchLab. The move signals a shift from collaboration to direct competition between the two platforms, marking a battle for dominance in Solana’s memecoin ecosystem. Alon, a Pump.fun co-founder, welcomed the rivalry, telling Cointelegraph that competition ultimately benefits users. “We welcome competition because users win at the end of the day,” Alon said. To gain an edge, PumpSwap plans to introduce a revenue-sharing model inspired by rival GoFundMeme, another emerging protocol. Soon, a portion of PumpSwap’s protocol revenue will be shared with memecoin creators, aligning their incentives with their communities and promoting higher-quality token launches. Solana Memecoin Frenzy Slows Despite the platform’s expansion, Pump.fun is navigating a cooler memecoin market . Successful token launches on Pump.fun have plunged by 80% from their January 2024 highs, following a string of memecoin-related scandals that eroded retail trader confidence. Pump.fun’s daily fee revenue has also fallen significantly—from over $4 million in January to around $1 million by mid-March, according to DeFiLlama. Nonetheless, memecoins have been instrumental in driving Solana’s DeFi growth . The chain’s total value locked (TVL) skyrocketed from $1.4 billion to over $9 billion in 2024, with Raydium’s daily volumes soaring from $245 million to more than $2 billion, highlighting the memecoin sector’s massive impact .

33767162,[object Object],1742556579,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Trump Plans USAID Blockchain Overhaul – Best Altcoins to Ride the Hype,https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-ride-hype-of-usaid-blockchain-tech/,"The Trump administration has proposed using blockchain tech to advance the US Agency for International Development (USAID), a US government agency that supports global developments, humanitarian assistance, and democratic values – and it’s casting a light on the best altcoins. The proposal comes after Trump and Elon Musk reduced USAID’s functions (including halted payments and staff cuts) under the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has pondered ways to leverage blockchain tech for a few months. USAID Blockchain Reform to Aid Delivery & Cut Corruption To modernize the aid delivery system, USAID would switch from paper-based aids and manual tracking to real-time, tamper-proof record of aid flows. Under the Secretary of State’s wing, blockchain tech could significantly reduce corruption owing to improved transparency. Another bonus is that it could speed up payment processes compared to traditional methods, though data-security risks and off-grid countries in dire need of assistance are concerns. International payment methods like SWIFT can often take up to five business days, whereas blockchain-based ones can be completed in minutes or even seconds. Additionally, the new administration plans to rebrand the USAID by swapping ‘Development’ with ‘Humanitarian Assistance.’ Blockchain tech is one of the USAID’s core pillars, signaling bullish times for the crypto sector. Now might be an opportune time to invest in the best altcoins , like $SOLX and $BTCBULL , while their price tags remain low. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – World’s First Solana L2 Tackles Blockchain Congestion $SOLX is the foundation of Solaxy, the first-ever Solana Layer-2 (L2) network currently in development to fix Solana’s woes. Despite its strong performance compared to other blockchain networks in recent years, Solana has encountered congestion problems, repeated network outages, and centralization pressure . This is where Solaxy steps in. As an L2 scaling solution, Solaxy aims to improve the network’s overall efficiency, mitigating network congestion, failed transactions, and scalability limitations, all without compromising security. The world’s first Solana L2 network, coupled with the development team building a cross-chain bridge to Ethereum, attracts eyes to the $SOLX presale. $SOLX is the entry point into the Solaxy ecosystem. Plus, you can stake the coin to enjoy 149% passive rewards. Considering all the above, it’s not surprising that the $SOLX presale snagged an impressive $5M just ten days after going live and has raised a hefty $27M in total. One $SOLX currently only costs $0.00167. We foresee its price hitting $0.032 once the L2 officially launches – a whopping 3,100% increase from its initial presale price of $0.001. $SOLX price goes up every time the presale hits a new milestone. When taking into account that the project shows no signs of slowing down, there’s no better time to hop in and buy $SOLX . 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Receive $BTC When the Crypto King Hits a New Target Positioned to thrive off Bitcoin’s success, $BTCBULL is possibly one of the most deservedly named top meme coins ; it’s one of the most bullish ones around (literally!). $BTCBULL holders will receive airdrops whenever $BTC breaks a new price level ($150K, $200K, and $250K). Distributions include either $BTC or $BTCBULL, depending on the target hit. The ecosystem’s built-in token burn mechanism further boosts its demand. With a strategic focus on supply and demand, a portion of $BTCBULL is burnt (removed from circulation) every time $BTC price increases by $50K to drive upward pressure. An additional incentive lies in its staking program. For extra gains, you can lock up your tokens to receive more $BTCBULL at a 109% APY. A sizable 10% of the total token supply (21B) is set aside for staking rewards, which also enables you to contribute to the project’s stability. $BTCBULL has already raised $3.8M on presale. You, too, can buck the trend by purchasing $BTCBULL for just $0.00242. Provided market conditions remain favorable, we predict it will spike by 244.8% to $0.00835 by the end of this year – all the more reason to buy one of the best new crypto now . 3. Vana ($VANA) – Assist AI Innovation by Turning Your Data Into Financial Assets Also making waves in the crypto industry as one of the best altcoins is $VANA, which has jumped in price by an eye-catching 10.77% since yesterday. Considering that its price has slightly decreased since early a.m. (GMT), now might be a good time to purchase the coin at a relatively low cost before it possibly pumps again. It’s already starting to show an upward trend. $VANA has much to offer for AI lovers. It’s the utility token in the Vana ecosystem, an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible Layer-1 network that enables you to transform your data into financial assets by aggregating datasets for AI model training. When considering that the AI market grew beyond $184B last year and is predicted to race past $826B in 2030, AI initiatives like these show no signs of slowing down – especially ones coupled with blockchain tech. To incentivize the provision of top-notch AI data, Vana rewards its users with $VANA tokens when they contribute their data to the ecosystem’s liquidity pools. Plus, all $VANA holders gain voting rights so you can have a say in the project’s future trajectory. You can buy $VANA and major exchanges like Binance and Bybit for approximately $7. Considering its price is currently eyeing another revival, now might be a prime time to buy. Trump’s USAID Plans Spark Optimism for the Best Altcoins The Trump administration’s plans to integrate blockchain tech into USAID, soon to be rebranded as the US Agency for International Humanitarian Assistance, represent not only a significant shift in modernizing aid delivery but also show what Web3 tech is really capable of accomplishing. This creates a bullish outlook for the entire crypto market, as evident from the growing demand for the best altcoins like $SOLX , $BTCBULL , and $VANA. Each of the coins mentioned above has unique utility that contributes to the blockchain technology’s development. $SOLX, for example, will enable faster and cheaper transactions, making Solana better suited for everyday use. $BTCBULL, on the other hand, could drive $BTC’s price action. By fostering an ecosystem based on shared success, it has the potential to increase overall market participation. However, this is not investment advice. You must always do your due diligence before committing your funds to any type of investment instrument.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-21 11:29:39

They project an increase to $3.85 in late 2025, driven by its ledger protocol gaining traction. At the same time, Solana (SOL) hovers around $124, 57% off January highs, while technicals suggest a potential crash to $30. In this setting, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a presale contender, with its presale fundraising now past $4.1 million as 6,300 investors position to see gains ahead of an expected 200% launch return. Ripple’s Ascent Faces Rocky Road A 1.62% haul on XRP suggests cautious optimism but its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) remains at $2.48, signalling lingering resistance. Bollinger Band divergence indicates rising volatility, with the next key threshold being $2.716. Although neutral on RSI and mixed on EMA, bullish momentum develops on green candles on hourly charts. Ripple’s institutional partnerships and cross-border payment innovations imbue the community with unshakeable confidence. But macroeconomic headwinds — from regulatory scrutiny to changing trade volumes — threaten to push back its all-time high reclamation. The Downward Trend of Solana Thickens Rejection at Solana’s 200-day SMA at $124 heightens fears of a protracted slump The lackluster CME futures launch, which has seen less than $12M volume, demonstrates declining institutional interest. On-chain activity falls off a cliff as transaction fees reach September 2024 lows Technical patterns now focus on $110 as the interim support, with a break below it potentially sending the market 75% down to $30 where 2023’s bear cycle last found a stop. Increasing U.S. recession risks and technology-aiding retail inertia also tarnish SOL’s short-term outlook. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Momentum Investors are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently in Phase 3 of a presale that costs $0.02. More than $4.1 million has already been raised, with the current round almost full before Phase 4’s entry price of $0.025. Latecomers risk losing out on 25% before the next price jump, and the listing target of $0.06 will give 200% ROI. Impressive post-launch estimates indicate a jump to $3.50—17,400% gain—cadging MUTrin in line for millionaire status by 2025. Mutuum Finance’s approach combines DeFi lending with mtTokens for interest-bearing deposit issuance and platform revenue generation. A buy-and-distribute mechanism distributes 15% of profits towards MUTM buybacks, infancy of sustainable demand. 40% is allocated for liquidity mining, 25% for staking rewards which will promote long-term holding. Because only 20 % of tokens are circulating after launch, the dynamics of scarcity might bring even higher gains when listings on exchanges begin. A Certik smart contract audit is key priority on Mutuum’s team schedule, ensuring protocol security ahead of full deployment. Next will be the sharing of results through the appropriate official channels fostering transparency. These initiatives are designed to build trust with its 6,300-strong holder base in conjunction with a $100,000 ongoing giveaway. A Watershed of Opportunity While XRP struggles with volatility and Solana prepares for further cuts, Mutuum Finance’s methodical approach to growth provides a more calculated approach. The blistering fill rate for Phase 3 highlights the increasing FOMO, which closes the entry windows more and more every day. The MUTM presale offers risk-reward alignment not common for investors, with low entry points and exponential upside. All eyes on those who have not entered Mutuum Finance’s presale yet.

Analysts reported that Shiba Inu recently reached 1.5 million holders while its Shibarium recorded 10 million blocks, an indicator that the SHIB ecosystem could attract new users.

It also showed a bullish outlook on the meme coin. Market observers said that the milestone might signify the unwavering belief of its community in the token. 10 Million Blocks For Shibarium Meanwhile, Shiba Inu’s Ethereum Layer 2 network, Shibarium also recorded a win after surpassing 10 million blocks with an estimated 10,010,974 blocks as of press time. Crypto analysts said that this achievement is proof of the network’s longevity and reliability, adding that it could entice more new users. Market observers noted that the network has experienced exponential growth in total addresses in the last few weeks as it now tallies almost 175 million. Shibarium’s growth is crucial in burning SHIB tokens and a major price control mechanism. Many investors are optimistic that diminishing supply and solid demand might send the token to surge. Shibarium played an essential role in burning around 713 million SHIB. Unmoved By The Crypto Downturn Many analysts say that milestones achieved by Shiba Inu and Shibarium offer a great deal of hope to investors, considering the ongoing downtrend in the cryptocurrency market. For instance, Shiba Inu tanked by about 68% in the last four months, dipping from a high of $0.00003343 in December 2024 to a low of $0.00001082 in March 2025. On the other hand, some analysts raised their concern about Shiba Inu underperforming the competition, noting that the token only increased by 98% following the US presidential election, while the Dogecoin skyrocketed by 200%.

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has dropped 3.84% in 24 hours to $2.38. In the latest update, the U.S. SEC has dropped its lawsuit against Ripple Labs. In other news, Ripple Labs has filed a trademark application for Ripple Custody, a secure crypto storage solution focusing on financial institutions. The regulated service lowers risks like private key loss and cyberattacks, offering dedicated infrastructure for managing XRP and other assets and enabling secure transmission, storage, and broader institutional crypto integration. Talking about the XRP price, it is currently down 3.84% to $2.38. If the bullish momentum continues, XRP could aim at its resistance level of $2.41. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, the XRP price will remain range-bound between its key support levels at $2.26 and $2.24. Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” by providing short-term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.39233090 -3.58% Market cap $ 139,133,447,517.49 Circulating Supply 58,158,111,605.00 Trading Volume $ 4,214,578,845.7994 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as Franklin Templeton has announced filing for an XRP ETF. Once launched, it is expected to be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Moreover, Ripple has received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer regulated crypto payments in the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC). The exchange inflow vs outflow graph from March 1st to March 11th shows 501k outflows in comparison to 482k inflows. This signals a spike in strong investor interest, which is a big thumbs up for XRP. XRP Exchange Inflow vs Outflow If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87.

He marks a critical support level, emphasizing that a dip into this zone would present a “fantastic opportunity” for long positions. However, he clarifies that if this setup does not materialize, he is content holding spot positions, anticipating XRP to reach double-digit prices in the future. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The analysis includes key levels, with a 100% retracement at approximately $1.77 and a projected target above $3.12. The chart also highlights a blue target zone, indicating the anticipated region for the initial breakout which extends as high as $3.4. CrediBull Crypto’s approach underscores the importance of patience in trading. Instead of entering impulsive long positions, he is waiting for price action to align with his plan. His chart indicates a defined invalidation level marked in red, where a deeper decline would challenge the bullish setup and help investors avoid further losses. This would also provide an opportunity to re-enter the market for future long positions. Confidence in Double-Digit XRP Prices CrediBull Crypto has consistently maintained an optimistic view of XRP’s long-term price potential. He previously predicted that the digital asset would outperform the rest of the market in the next few months. The analyst has also referred to the current setup as XRP’s “manifest destiny,” reinforcing his conviction that the asset will see significant gains. While he is prepared for short-term market fluctuations, his long-term outlook remains unchanged. While the analyst did not provide a specific target, he predicted in December that the asset could climb to $22 , providing a potential target for the upcoming double-digit price run. His latest post reflects this confidence, suggesting that even if the ideal entry point does not emerge, he expects XRP to appreciate substantially. He also mentions that traders fading the current push could help create the conditions for a favorable buying opportunity.

While spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds have made BTC more stable by turning it into an asset class that institutions can invest in, altcoins still face the same high. In a recent research report , analysts at a Singapore-based firm Signum Capital revealed that the shift signals a big transition from the market’s traditional four-year cycles tied to Bitcoin’s halving events. According to the analysts, the market now experiences “shorter bursts of outperformance and underperformance, driven by liquidity flows, investor positioning, and changing risk sentiment.” “While Bitcoin is experiencing increased price stability, altcoins remain as volatile as ever, still subject to reflexive cycles of euphoria and panic.” Signum Capital You might also like: A whale is being ‘hunted down’ for short positioning over 5,400 BTC with 40x leverage Analysts point to recent market movements as evidence of the shift, citing a significant downturn in August 2024 that impacted both stocks and cryptocurrencies. That drop followed the Bank of Japan’s unexpected rate hike , which analysts say sparked “widespread market volatility,” with the unwinding of the yen carry trade “putting downward pressure on equities and crypto alike.” “The idea of fixed four-year crypto cycles may no longer hold true. Instead, we are seeing shorter, more fragmented periods of outperformance, driven by macro shifts, regulatory changes, and fast-moving narratives.” Signum Capital Despite the volatility, experts emphasize the importance of staying informed and adaptable in today’s crypto environment, with analysts noting that rather than logging off during downturns, those who track emerging narratives “will be best positioned.” Earlier in March, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju predicted that in the next six to 12 months, Bitcoin will see “bearish or sideways price action.” To support his conclusion, Ju noted in another X post that “every on-chain metric signals a bear market,” adding that “with fresh liquidity drying up, new whales are selling Bitcoin at lower prices.” Read more: Bitcoin price on the verge of a breakout if this historical pattern repeats",News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|Bitcoin Halving,EN,0,0,BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-21 11:40:42

As national jurisdictions are changing their stance on crypto, led by Donald Trump’s pro-crypto agenda , India is starting to recalibrate as well. Although India had initially planned to release a consultation paper on crypto regulation after its G20 presidency in 2023, the government has yet to follow through. In a recent roundtable discussion, Ajay Seth, Secretary of India’s Department of Economic Affairs, stated , “We were ready with a discussion paper, but we now need to recalibrate it due to these changes.” The Indian government levies 30% tax on income from crypto and 1% tax deducted at source, implemented in 2022. This have deferred many retail and institutional traders, resulting in low trading volumes on crypto trading platforms. As a result, many crypto exchanges and market makers have exited the Indian market. For instance, WazirX, once India’s largest crypto trading platform, experienced a 90% drop in business following the implementation of a 30% tax on crypto income and a 1% tax deducted at source. This has led WazirX to relocate part of its operations to Dubai. However, with signs of a shift in crypto policies, crypto firms are eyeing a return to the Indian market, according to Bloomberg . On March 11, Coinbase registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit to launch its its retail trading platform. This follows registrations by competitors such as Binance, Bybit , and KuCoin.

Beyond U.S. and European Union, among recent notable examples are Hong Kong, Australia, and UAE. In February, Hong Kong introduced regulatory measures for tokenization and virtual asset exposure in authorized funds. It also approved the use of exchange-traded funds investing in digital currencies and proposed regulations for stablecoin issuers . In March, the Australian government also introduced a four-pronged approach to regulate digital assets, including governance standards, licensing for service providers, custody laws, and stablecoin regulations with minimum capital requirements.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 107,000 YouTube subscribers that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is breaking out of a months-long downtrend, suggesting Bitcoin may soon soar to the upside. The RSI is a momentum oscillator used to determine whether an asset is oversold or overbought. The RSI’s values range from zero to 100 with the level between 70 to 100 indicating that an asset is overbought while the zero to 30 level indicates that an asset is oversold. “What’s interesting about this entire period right now is that this has been a downtrend on the RSI, a daily downtrend dating back to really mid-November 2024. So breaking this downtrend is pretty pivotal, because it means that the RSI doesn’t want to be trending downwards anymore. And this is actually very likely a hidden sign of emerging strength in Bitcoin’s price action, because now the RSI wants to enter a new macro uptrend after downtrending for effectively some five months or so, and now we are seeing the RSI try to confirm this breakout and breach of the downtrend so that it can rally higher. And this comes on the heels of really just price action building a bullish divergence.” Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube He also says Bitcoin may soon break through resistance at $88,500. “We need to watch out for further continuation, which is going to be reclaiming $88,500 to get us back closer and closer to reclaiming this re-accumulation range [around $100,000]. And many people have been talking about this being a bear market, but it does look like it is a downside deviation period very similar to what we’ve seen back in the past.” Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube Bitcoin is trading at $83,998 at time of writing, down 2.3% in the last 24 hours.

While Trump’s participation made a big splash, many other important names were also present at the conference, including Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) founder Michael Saylor. Once again expressing his support for Bitcoin, Saylor made a $13 million prediction for the BTC price. Speaking at the Digital Asset Summit, Saylor said he believes Bitcoin will reach $13 million in 20 years. Saylor noted that the fixed supply of 21 million coins makes BTC a unique store of value, unlike traditional commodities like gold and oil, whose supply increases as technology advances. Stating that even gold, which is seen as a safe haven, has experienced hyperinflation several times, Saylor argued that Bitcoin is the only real asset at this point. Saylor is known for his calls to buy BTC as well as his support for Bitcoin. Arguing that BTC is the only real asset, Saylor said that Europe and the Euro will need Bitcoin. Michael Saylor made a splash with his post at a time when Europe was facing pressure from the US's cryptocurrency policies. “EUR will need BTC,” Saylor said.

After being removed from Binance’s “Vote to List” campaign, the crypto community is wondering whether the coin could make a comeback after a price tumble. While Pi Coin battles through a tough crypto market, the new altcoin JetBolt (JBOLT) is disrupting the crypto space with its presale that has already sold over 345 million tokens since its debut. JetBolt also offers zero-gas technology and other futuristic features that are creating buzz among crypto enthusiasts. Can Pi Coin make a rebound after a price fall? What’s the latest in analysts’ Pi Coin price predictions? and what’s the generating hype around JetBolt? Let’s dig in. Pi Coin Price Prediction: Can PI Recover From a Price Dip? Pi Coin is currently at the center of blockchain conversations after being excluded from the Binance “Vote to List” campaign. Binance explained Pi Coin is operating on its own blockchain and not on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and therefore, the platform decided to delist PI Coin. Despite the exclusion and recent price dip, some still speculate that Pi Coin could still bounce back. Pi Coin is encountering a major resistance of $1.20 with a key support of $1.14. Pi Coin’s recovery remains uncertain as PI’s price is now holding inside a symmetrical triangle pattern. According to the technical indicators, the coin is currently in a consolidation phase, a period of market indecision that could result in either a bullish or bearish breakout. Chart illustrating Pi Coin (PI)’s price declining in the last seven days, according to CoinGecko. While Pi Coin’s recovery remains uncertain, some analysts suggest the coin must reverse its current bearish trend. Most of Pi Coin’s moving averages indicate sell signals, suggesting strong selling pressure or bearish dominance in the market. Analysts also suggest that listing on major crypto exchanges may influence Pi Coin’s price movement and price predictions. Other factors that may help Pi Coin improve its price include a wider adoption, a further development of its ecosystem, and gaining whales’ interest. Meanwhile, factors such as market volatility and regulation risks could hinder Pi Coin’s recovery. JetBolt (JBOLT)’s Presale of Over 345 Million Tokens: What’s Driving the Whale Rush? A new altcoin is making a hot entry in the fast-paced world of blockchain: JetBolt (JBOLT) . JetBolt reached a new presale milestone again, selling over 345 million tokens since its rapid entrance onto the crypto market. JetBolt offers a variety of cutting-edge features that intrigue the crypto community and one of its main highlights is the much talked about zero-gas technology. JetBolt’s zero-gas technology completely removes the gas fees which are typically required on other blockchain platforms. With JetBolt, transactions are gas-free and frictionless, thanks to its deployment on the Skale Network. Another JetBolt highlight is the staking, and ability for holders to earn staking crypto rewards. JetBolt’s Web3 wallet integration, which has biometric and facial recognition, makes use even smoother. On top of JetBolt’s futuristic features is its incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) in its aggregation utility. Buyers can enjoy up to 25% in extra tokens by purchasing these via Alpha Box packages or through batch token discounts. With JetBolt’s zero-gas technology, smooth transaction process, and AI-news aggregation tool, there’s no doubt JetBolt attracts more attention in the broader market. Summary: Can Pi Coin Comeback After Price Tumbles by 31.9% in a Week? While recovering from a price dip remains uncertain for Pi Coin Price Predictions, analysts suggest the coin must gain ground in areas that could further help improve its price. These include getting listed on a major exchange platform and increasing its wider adoption. On the other hand, the new altcoin JetBolt (JBOLT) is garnering interest from crypto whales with its soaring presale momentum, selling over 345 million tokens already and zero-gas technology. Plus, with its added main features of Web3 wallet and AI-powered news aggregation tool, it’s no surprise that JetBolt’s presale continues to climb.

A popular analyst with over 130,000 followers on X suggested that the trend might have changed. From Good to Better Everything seems to be going Ripple’s way as of recently. After the US presidential elections, the entire landscape in the States changed for the better, and being situated there and sued by the local securities regulator for four years, Ripple was among the biggest beneficiaries. The native token’s name was even mentioned by the new US president to be included in the country’s strategic crypto reserve. Reports emerged that the same regulator that sued the company for selling an unregistered security in the form of XRP has now contemplated classifying it as a commodity. And to top it all off, just a few weeks after that, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse declared a victory in the aforementioned legal case against the SEC. All eyes are now on the potential approval of an XRP ETF , which could complete a stellar year for Ripple and its community. All of that sounds like good news, right? Well, XRP’s price indeed went on a spectacular run after the elections. However, it failed to breach its 2018 all-time high despite matching it in January and has since fallen by 30% in spite of all the positive developments mentioned above. This points to a classic ‘ sell-the-news ‘ moment for XRP, which rallied on the hype of regulatory changes and closure in the SEC case but failed to materialize on the actual changes and victory in the lawsuit. Is XRP About to Drop? Unlike the overall bullish sentiment and the multiple mind-blowing price predictions for XRP’s future, Ali Martinez outlined a highly controversial take that foresees a substantial crash for the asset. He believes the recent price pump-and-dump by XRP has created a head-and-shoulders pattern that could result in an immediate correction of up to 50%. If it materializes, the fourth-largest digital asset could plummet toward $1.25. $XRP wild ride!

BitMEX and KuCoin have been mentioned. Reports say the bans are aimed at foreign exchanges that are well-known to investors in the US. These include BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix, and KCEX. South Korea Financial Intelligence Unit launches enforcement action against unregistered foreign crypto exchanges in the country. BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix and KCEX are among those named. pic.twitter.com/SSpp9Ai5Jp — BO$$ (@Crypto_Boss_001) March 21, 2025 It was found that these exchanges had Korean-language websites. That’s not an issue. The issue is that the exchanges have been operating Korean-language websites without reporting or providing marketing and customer support activities targeting Korean investors. In South Korea, the Specified Financial Information Act says that crypto companies must report to the government as virtual asset service providers (VASPs). Because crypto companies are not following the rules, the government is also considering sanctions, like stopping access to the exchanges, as it starts to plan how to stop this. Actions will be implemented this year The country’s rules require businesses to report to the FIU when buying, storing, trading, or managing crypto. If companies don’t follow the rules, their business will be considered illegal and could face criminal and administrative punishments. In the story, a FIU official said that steps are being discussed to block access to the exchanges on the list. A government worker said that the finance watchdog is currently talking with the Korea Communications Standards Commission, which is in charge of the internet, about how to stop people from getting to the exchanges. An FIU official said, “We are organizing damage cases and related data to strengthen communication between authorities, and we expect to see tangible measures taken within this year.” Guaranteed that the Korean government would take action. This is why: In 2022, the FIU asked the Korea Communications Standards Commission to block access to 16 foreign exchanges that had not been reported. They also worked with Korean card companies to check and stop credit card services for buying virtual goods and making payments in Korea. Many foreign exchanges have left the Korean market and are no longer taking new members as a result. According to the FIU, there are now only 31 registered crypto-dealing firms in South Korea, more than 26% less than the 42 firms that existed in 2024. Some of the companies that were taken off the stock market are GDAC, ProBit, Huobi Korea, and Bitrade. Does South Korea value user protection more than fostering innovation? The government has to balance supporting innovators and keeping asset owners safe since more than 30% of South Koreans own crypto assets. The crypto industry comes with some risks. Therefore, officials are carefully examining how a volatile crypto market will affect things. They are also very strict with companies, including their own. Upbit, South Korea’s biggest bitcoin exchange, was also given a suspension notice for a possible Know Your Customer breach. It looks like Upbit has also asked South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit to cancel the business fines. This was before the Financial Services Commission said that universities and nonprofits would be able to accept cryptocurrency donations starting in the second half of 2025. Also, on March 20, police searched Bithumb because they thought that Kim Dae-sik, who used to be CEO of the company, had taken money to buy an apartment. When the exchange and its leader bought the apartment, the cops thought they may have broken some money laws. Bithumb told Kim that she already had the money to pay back the loan. Not to mention, many platforms had trouble with business and forgot to renew their registrations, which got them kicked off the country’s registry.

Notably, the ORCA price skyrocketed by a staggering 170%, hitting the highest point this year. Interestingly, the ORCA price today reached a yearly high of $5.1021 from a mere low of $1.56. This surprising uptrend is primarily driven by South Korean crypto exchange Upbit’s new trading support for ORCA. Let’s unveil the ORCA price’s recent uptick and Upbit’s significant contribution to the token’s bullish trend. ORCA Price Skyrockets After Upbit Announces Support In a surprising development, the South Korean crypto exchange Upbit, has announced trading support for ORCA, the native token of the Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX), Orca. On March 21, Upbit has confirmed the listing of Orca’s native token, ORCA, paired with KRW, BTC, and USDT on the Solana network, with trading set to begin on March 21 at 17:00 KST. This announcement has triggered a significant surge in the ORCA price, invoking a bullish sentiment. Upbit Lists ORCA: Trading Details Significantly, the ORCA price surge followed Upbit’s critical announcement. Upbit has officially declared its support for ORCA, with deposits and withdrawals set to go live within two hours of the announcement. Users will be able to start trading in another one hour. However, Upbit has implemented certain restrictions to ensure a stable market. For instance, Upbit will restrict buy orders for ORCA for the initial five minutes. All orders, except limit orders, will be restricted for one hour. In addition, sell order prices will be capped at 10% less than the previous day’s closing price. Though the ORCA price has been on a downtrend since December 6 when it hit a high of $8.70, the recent development has pushed the token to a bullish track. The ORCA token price touched the $5 mark for the first time in 2025. Recently, South Korea has taken the initiative to strengthen its regulations over the crypto space. South Korea’s FIU is investigating the operations of unregistered crypto exchanges like KuCoin and BitMEX. ORCA Price’s Future Trends: Expert Insights At press time, ORCA is valued at $4.21, marking a significant uptick of 166.19% in a day. In addition, the ORCA price has experienced notable hikes of 172% and 114% over the past week and month, respectively. This positive trend is further reflected in the staggering 4676% increase in trading volume, which currently stands at $355.7 million, indicating an optimistic investor sentiment. According to analysts’ ORCA price prediction, the token is expected to have a potential pullback as the RSI suggests that the token is currently overbought. For analyst gemxbt, $3.50 serves as the critical support level, while $4.50 acts as the crucial resistance level for the token price. Though ORCA has broken out of a period of consolidation, it is poised for potential corrections. Upbit’s ORCA listing comes following the South Korean regulator’s increasing scrutiny over the exchange for allegedly violating KYC rules. In response, Upbit operator Dunamu filed a lawsuit against the FIU to cancel the business suspension order.

While some well-established cryptocurrencies are trading at discounted prices, many experts suggest that newer, utility-driven projects present even greater upside potential. One token that continues to be discussed is Cardano (ADA), which is currently trading at a lower price after its recent correction. Some analysts believe ADA could recover to the $1–$1.50 range, making it a potential opportunity for those looking to accumulate at current levels. However, another emerging token is capturing even more attention—Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With a fast-growing presale, a structured DeFi model, and increasing investor demand, experts argue that MUTM may be the better alternative for those looking for substantial returns. Cardano’s Dip Presents an Opportunity Cardano has seen a significant decline in price, falling approximately 40% from its March highs. Currently, ADA is hovering near a key support level of $0.73, which previously acted as a strong resistance zone earlier in the year. Some analysts suggest that if Cardano holds this level and breaks out of its current range, it could rally toward $1–$1.50 in the coming months. However, bearish indicators such as declining trading volume and weakening technical signals have led some investors to seek alternative opportunities with higher upside potential. While ADA may still recover, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a stronger option for those looking for early-stage gains before the market fully turns bullish. Why Mutuum Finance Is Gaining More Attention Unlike speculative tokens that rely solely on hype, Mutuum Finance is built around a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, ensuring continuous demand for its token, MUTM. The project allows users to supply assets, earn passive income, and access liquidity without selling their holdings. This self-sustaining financial model positions it as one of the more stable yet high-growth opportunities in DeFi. Mutuum Finance’s presale has already raised over $4.1 million, with 50% of Phase 3 sold out. The token is currently priced at $0.02, but the next phase will bring a 25% price increase, making this one of the last chances to buy at a lower price. Investors who secure their positions now are guaranteed to see 3x returns at launch, as the listing price is set at $0.06. Beyond its strong presale momentum, Mutuum Finance’s post-launch strategy is what’s driving even more interest. Unlike many projects that list on exchanges with little to no real-world functionality, Mutuum’s team is set to launch a beta version of the lending platform alongside the token’s public listing. This means that as soon as MUTM becomes tradeable, it will already have a working DeFi ecosystem driving demand. With its structured utility and early adoption, some analysts predict MUTM will reach $0.18 as demand grows post-launch. Additionally, major exchange listings are expected, which will make MUTM more accessible to a wider investor base, further fueling demand and price appreciation. While Cardano remains an important player in the crypto space, its growth relies heavily on broader market trends and ecosystem developments. In contrast, Mutuum Finance’s lending model creates continuous demand, making it a more dynamic investment with a structured growth trajectory. As the bull market approaches, investors are focusing on assets with high upside potential and real-world use cases. With a successful presale, an upcoming platform launch, and strong exchange demand, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as one of the most promising tokens to buy before the market fully turns bullish. Investors who secure MUTM at its current presale price could be locking in one of the best opportunities before the next major rally begins.

The consolidation within the bear flag has the price trading in an ascending parallel channel, with today’s drop testing critical support levels, including the lower boundary of the flag at $2.68 trillion. A breakdown of this level could trigger another drop. The bear flag’s downside target, derived from the height of the previous drop, is approximately $2.23 trillion, representing a 32% decline from the current price.

The relief, however, could be short-lived, per some observers. The indicator in consideration is the ICE/BofA U.S. High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS), which measures the average yield difference (spread) between U.S. dollar-denominated high-yield corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury securities, adjusted for embedded optionality in the bonds. It's widely tracked as a credit risk barometer, with the widening spread representing growing investor concern about corporate defaults or economic weakness, often leading to investors lightening their exposure to riskier assets such as technology stocks and cryptocurrencies. The OAS, representing the premium investors demand for holding high-yielding bonds over the relatively safer Treasury notes, has dropped to 3.2% from the six-month high of 3.4% early this month. The decline in the spread supports a renewed upswing in bitcoin (BTC) and Nasdaq. The spread surged by 100 basis points in four weeks to mid-March as President Donald Trump's tariffs raised the recession spectre. During that time, both BTC and Nasdaq took a beating, with the cryptocurrency falling to lows under $80K. Temporary relief? Analysts expect the OAS spread to widen further in the coming weeks as the negative impact of Trump's tariffs becomes clear, according to Mint and Reuters. ""We think this is just getting started and will get worse before it gets better,"" Hans Mikkelsen, managing director of credit strategy at TD Securities, said in a recent client note. Applying technical analysis principles to the OAS chart suggests the same. The spread has moved past the three-year descending trendline, warranting high alert from risk asset investors.",Markets|Bitcoin|Nasdaq|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-21 12:10:34

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s value struggled throughout February, enduring significant downturns. On February 27, the cryptocurrency dropped steeply, falling below $78,000 for the first time in more than three months. Analysis of on-chain data suggests that the decrease was largely driven by sell-offs from “Bitcoin tourists”—newcomers to the trading scene. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC According to SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs faced $275.83 million in net outflows on Feb. 27, 2025, pushing the week’s total net outflows to $2.71 billion. Bitcoin price prediction March 2025 February was the reddest month for Bitcoin since June 2022, when the world’s largest cryptocurrency’s performance was -37.28 %. According to crypto data provider Santiment, Bitcoin whales and sharks have dumped ~6,813 coins since last week, which is the largest drop since last July. Will the BTC price recover in March 2025? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $89,000 and be pushed further, at least $95,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $72,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction March 2025 $72,000 $89,000 $95,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Bitcoin spot ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $95,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF demand might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $95,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, the future market potential for Bitcoin entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. We expect Bitcoin price to reach a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In recent weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-21 12:12:10

The plan proposes rebranding the agency as U.S. International Humanitarian Assistance and moving it directly under the authority of the Secretary of State, Wired said. It would leverage a blockchain to trace aid distributions and enforce payment models based on outcomes rather than inputs. “All distributions would also be secured and traced via blockchain technology to radically increase security, transparency, and traceability,” the memo reportedly reads, adding that such an approach would encourage innovation and efficiency. It’s unclear whether the blockchain would involve cryptocurrency or stablecoin usage, or simply act as a digital ledger. USAID has been under scrutiny from the Trump administration since the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk. DOGE has in the past proposed the use of blockchain technology to boost efficiency.

The post said billions of XRP were locked in escrow to support this so-called partnership. The post was deleted within minutes, but not before it spread across Telegram, Discord, and Facebook through Watcher’s automated bot system. Shortly after, Watcher Guru explained what happened in a detailed thread on X. “Our X account was hacked today,” the post said . They confirmed they had already flagged suspicious behavior two weeks earlier and had contacted X’s cybersecurity team. But no one from the company responded. Attacker used Telegram link that mimicked official X domain On March 5, Watcher Guru received a message on Telegram. The person sent them a working x.com link that pointed to one of their older posts. But the team noticed something was off. The link looked legit, but it was from an X Developer staging site. It had a weird token string at the end—something not seen in standard X links. Even though the link used X’s actual domain, the team suspected something shady was going on. So they reached out to @cstanley, who is X’s head of cybersecurity. But they never got a reply. Then on March 21, just after 2 AM UTC, the fake post hit their feed. The message was written in a way that matched their usual “JUST IN” style alerts. That triggered their auto-posting system, which pushed it to all their other social media channels instantly. The message got maximum reach before it was taken down. Watcher Guru deleted the post within minutes, logged all devices out of their account, and changed passwords. But by then, the fake SWIFT-XRP story had already gone viral. According to their thread, the hack didn’t involve any connected apps or used API tokens. “We had 2FA enabled, no connected apps, and none of our API tokens were used to post it,” the account stated. They still haven’t confirmed how the hacker got access. They also noticed something else. The attacker blocked @Ripple and @bgarlinghouse from the Watcher Guru X account. This move was probably made to delay any public denial from Brad Garlinghouse or the company. Fake post dropped less than two days after SEC dropped XRP appeal This breach came less than 48 hours after a major legal development for Ripple. On March 19, the SEC decided to end its appeal in its case against Ripple. That legal fight had been going on since December 2020. While the SEC is no longer appealing, Ripple is still pushing back on part of the ruling and the $125 million fine. Ripple’s legal team is now trying to overturn the part that says institutional XRP sales must be treated as securities. That section of the ruling from Judge Analisa Torres in August 2023 hasn’t changed. She said XRP is not a security when it’s traded on crypto exchanges, but sales to institutional investors still fall under securities laws. After the SEC pulled out of the case, XRP jumped 11%, hitting $2.52 on CoinGecko. Brad gave an interview to Bloomberg right after the news dropped. “The SEC has abandoned their appeal. That means we go from being the defendant to the plaintiff,” he said. Ripple’s not just closing the case and moving on. They’re going after the ruling that still classifies some of their XRP sales as securities. Brad said they aren’t accepting the fine either. “There was no investor harm, no money lost, so why are we even here?” he asked. Brad also said they’ve spent more than $150 million on this legal fight. “We’ve spent over $150 million defending this case, not just for us, but for the entire industry,” he told Bloomberg. He said Gary Gensler’s SEC was trying to push control over the crypto industry by filing lawsuits. “The SEC wanted to push its power over crypto through lawsuits. That’s over now,” he said. Ripple eyes XRP ETF and U.S. crypto stockpile under Trump Brad said the timing of the SEC’s decision isn’t a coincidence. He pointed to the new administration under Donald Trump and changes in the SEC’s leadership. According to him, that’s what triggered the retreat. “I think if you asked Paul Atkins and David Sacks, they’d agree this case never should have been brought,” he said. Paul Atkins is now set to face the Senate Banking Committee on March 27. That’s where he’ll go through confirmation to become the next SEC chairman. If confirmed, he’ll take over from Mark Uyeda, who’s been acting chair since January. Atkins already served on the SEC from 2002 to 2008. After that, he launched a consulting firm called Patomak Global Partners in Washington, D.C. On top of that, he’s been into Bitcoin since 2011. He knows how the SEC works, and he’s expected to pull back on enforcement and push to let more private companies go public. Brad’s looking ahead. He believes XRP will be added to the U.S. crypto stockpile and says an XRP ETF will launch this year. He also mentioned Trump’s latest crypto push during the Bloomberg interview. “President Trump posted something saying there should be other tokens, that there’s going to be a Bitcoin strategic reserve and then a crypto stockpile that would include things like XRP,” Brad said. That statement came just as the SEC dropped its appeal, Watcher Guru’s account got hacked, and XRP’s price jumped. All within two days. Everything lined up. The fake SWIFT-XRP post came right when XRP was trending from real legal news. The hacker knew exactly what they were doing. They used a fake link that mimicked X’s own system. They posted a believable message in Watcher Guru’s voice. They took advantage of auto-posting bots to spread the lie. They even blocked Ripple to slow down any denial. Watcher Guru has now removed all fake content, changed account settings, and locked everything down. But they’re still waiting to hear back from X. No one has confirmed the exact method of the breach, and the account was already protected by two-factor authentication. This is the second attack of its kind in weeks. The same thing reportedly happened to @tier10k. And now, with crypto politics heating up, don’t be surprised if this kind of attack becomes the norm. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?
