However, Hayes cautioned that while BTC may have bottomed, stock markets could face more pain ahead. BTC Bottomed At $77,000? Hayes Thinks So Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes recently took to X to declare that BTC may have likely bottomed at $77,000. The acclaimed crypto market commentator referred to the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) latest remarks signaling the end of quantitative tightening (QT). Hayes remarked: JAYPOW delivered, QT basically over Apr 1. The next thing we need to get bulled up for realz is either SLR exemption and or a restart of QE. Was BTC $77K the bottom, prob. But stonks prob have more pain left to fully convert Jay to team Trump so stay nimble and cashed up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Needs Weekly Close Above This Level To Confirm Market Bottom, Analyst Says For the uninitiated, QT is one of the Fed’s monetary policies aimed at reducing the money supply by selling off assets like government bonds or letting them mature without reinvesting. While this helps control inflation, it can also lead to higher interest rates and slower economic growth. The Fed began its most recent QT cycle nearly three years ago in June 2022 to combat high inflation resulting from COVID-era economic stimulus. Now that inflation appears to be easing, the Fed has little reason to continue QT. Yesterday, the Fed announced that from April 1 onwards, it will slow the pace of its balance sheet drawdown. Such a shift in monetary policy is likely to benefit risk-on assets like BTC and stocks. As stated in his X post, Hayes emphasized that the next potential bullish catalysts could be either a Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption or the start of quantitative easing (QE). To explain, the SLR exemption temporarily allowed banks to exclude certain assets, like US Treasuries and central bank reserves, from their leverage calculations to encourage lending and support financial markets during crises. Similarly, QE is a monetary policy through which the Fed increases the money supply in the economy, potentially benefiting high-risk assets like BTC. Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff Jirlin echoed Hayes’ sentiments, stating that an end to QT from April onwards would be “great for both crypto and equity markets.” Jirlin added that the current monetary policy is the tightest he has observed since 2010. Bitcoin Not Out Of The Woods Yet While market optimism has increased following the Fed’s recent comments, the premier cryptocurrency is not fully out of the woods yet. For instance, BTC recently broke down through a 12-year trend line against gold, raising fears of heightened economic uncertainty in the near term.

Martinez tells his 133,500 followers on the social media platform X that if XRP ( XRP ) falls below $2, it risks witnessing a deeper drawdown due to a lack of consolidation below the price level. “XRP testing the waters! Below $2, a gap with no significant support could pull it to $1.60.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on a chart citing on-chain data from blockchain analytics platform Glassnode, it appears that there’s an “air gap” between $2 and $1.60, indicating a weak foundation for XRP around that price zone. XRP is trading at $2.56 at time of writing. Next up is the layer-1 protocol Solana ( SOL ). According to Martinez, SOL is facing a “big test” at a resistance level a few percentage points above the current price. “$135 stands as the most important resistance.” Source: Ali Martinez/X The widely followed analyst further says that investors in the sixth-largest crypto asset by market cap are capitulating based on the altcoin’s net unrealized profit/loss metric (NUPL), an on-chain indicator that measures whether accumulators of a coin are in a state of profit or loss. Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on the trader’s chart, SOL’s NUPL is hovering below the zero line, indicating that investors are witnessing losses and in the midst of capitulation. Solana is trading at $132 at time of writing, down by around 55% from the all-time high price of $293 reached January 20th. Looking at the top memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Martinez says that the altcoin has recorded significant demand in a week. “Whale alert! Over 110 million Dogecoin bought up in a week. Big players are betting on a breakout.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Dogecoin is trading at $0.173 at time of writing.

According to people familiar with the matter, Tim Cook decided to overhaul leadership in the firm’s AI divisions after losing confidence that AI chief John Giannandrea was the right person to lead important product innovations. Vision Pro architect Mike Rockwell takes over Siri In a notable development, Cook has directed the creation of Siri, Apple’s virtual assistant, under Mike Rockwell, who had previously overseen work on Vision Pro. This decision is the latest sign that the tech needs to urgently remake its AI strategy, following criticism that the company is falling behind rivals. Rockwell will now report to Craig Federighi, the software chief, in a move that removes Siri from Giannandrea’s controls. The changes are expected to be made public to employees this week. Apple’s top brass, aka the “Top 100,” met at the company’s secretive annual offsite summit recently to debate the company’s future, and AI was at the center of those discussions. The move reflects the mounting pressure on the tech firm to provide AI-powered innovations that can rival those from industry leaders. Despite AI being a major marketing point of the iPhone 16, Apple’s AI has been widely criticized for being underwhelming. Then there’s the new Apple Intelligence platform, which will launch later than expected and, when it does, is unlikely to attract consumers’ attention. Siri’s long-anticipated improvements, including deeper integration with users’ data for more customized responses, have also repeatedly fallen behind schedule. Apple had hyped these new Siri features for months, trying to stimulate sales of the iPhone 16, but the technology still wasn’t ready. The company was even forced to announce additional delays earlier this month, causing internal frustration. The Apple executive Robby Walker, who led Siri, reportedly described the delays as “ugly” in a recent team meeting, saying there was widespread disappointment among staff. Apple’s trouble with AI coincides with a wider downturn in tech stocks; its shares have slid 14% this year. On Thursday, the company’s stock fell less than 1% to $214.62 in midday trading in New York. Why Apple is betting on Rockwell Rockwell, who serves as the vice president of Apple’s Vision Products Group (VPG), has been recognized as a problem solver and a proponent of groundbreaking technology. He was a key figure in the creation of the Vision Pro headset, which, while a technological marvel, has not yet found commercial success. He is Apple’s first such hire, and his appointment represents a shift in the company’s strategy toward AI. Rockwell, unlike Giannandrea, is not a former Google executive with long-standing knowledge of the AI research field; he has no background in heading up AI teams. However, Apple is increasingly presenting Vision Pro and other hardware innovations as “AI products,” indicating a strategy that emphasizes the part of AI that specifies hardware rather than simply innovations based on software. As Rockwell steps up to his new position, Paul Meade—previously leading Vision Pro’s hardware engineering—will take over management of the Vision Products Group going forward. Apple reshapes Siri leadership amid AI push Since its launch in 2011, Siri has suffered a long-running series of engineering and performance problems. After all, the digital assistant has had so many leaders throughout the years, from Scott Forstall, who headed its software, to Eddy Cue, who ran services, to Federighi and Giannandrea in 2018. Now, with Rockwell in charge and Federighi once again overseeing the division, Apple is looking for a fresh start. Giannandrea is still at Apple, but his focus is shifting away from Siri’s day-to-day operations. He’ll continue to lead research and other AI-focused efforts at Meta, including a robotics-centric team. However, the tech firm’s hesitance to lose Giannandrea indicates an intention to be consistent as it reorganizes its AI division. Apple has been preparing for this leadership transition for months. For example, he’s worked on using analytics to help develop what he’s built at Apple. Last year, the company hired a veteran who’d successfully executed complex development projects before—Kim Vorrath—to come help the Siri shop. More recently, a different Rockwell lieutenant, Aimee Nugent, was transferred to assess and assist the Siri group. Rockwell himself has been outspoken about Siri’s failings and called for a more personalized, intelligent assistant. Brad said that during the development of the Vision Pro, he had imagined Siri playing a central role in controlling the device, but those plans didn’t come to fruition at launch. With Apple Intelligence coming to the Vision Pro through a software update in April, Rockwell’s recent hands-on session with AI-powered technology could be decisive. As the tech firm seeks to reposition itself as a player in AI, the industry and investors will closely watch the success of his tenure. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The ETF would hold both PENGU and Pudgy Penguin nonfungible tokens (NFT), as well as other cryptocurrencies, such as SOL and ETH, that may be necessary to the purchase, sale or transfer of PENGU and the associated NFTs. Nashville, Tennessee-based Canary Capital filed an S-1 form with the SEC on March 20. This is the first proposed EFT that includes NFTs. The ETF will be structured as a trust that is expected to hold 80%-95% PENGU and 5%-15% NFTs. No custodian or exchange have been selected yet. First they released the NFT, then plushies and now an ETF There are 8,888 Pudgy Penguin NFTs that range in price on Open Seas from 9.86 ETH ($19,499 at the time of writing) to 9,000 ETH ($17.8 million), although all but three of the NFTs listed were selling for 500 ETH ($988,805) or less. According to the S-1, Canary Capital “will select which NFTs to purchase by considering factors such as price, relative rarity, perceived desirability of a particular NFTs traits and characteristics, and the overall collection value.” The Pudgy Penguins NFT collection was launched in July 2021 on Ethereum. In May 2023, Pudgy Penguins signed with the WME talent agency. Retailer Walmart (and later others) has carried a line of stuffed toys called plushies depicting the penguins since September. The PENGU token launched on Solana in December 2024 with an airdrop of 25.9% of the 88.89 billion tokens to NFT holders distributed according to the rarity of the holder’s NFTs, and other community members. It had an initial market cap of around $2.8 billion and traded on Binance , Bybit and OKX. Canary Capital has faith in altcoins and their ETFs Igloo, Canary Capital’s parent company, posted a statement on X, saying , in part, “We believe that Pudgy Penguins is the face of crypto, Representing innovation and the mass adoption of blockchain technology. Being included in this filing is a strong validation of that belief.” Canary Capital has been a pioneer in altcoin ETFs. It has filed documents with the SEC to create ETFs tracking Litecoin , Hedera , Solana , and XRP . PENGU “has very few identified use cases apart from a collector’s item, the S-1 noted. There is no guarantee that it will continue to gain in value, it added. The token opened at $0.00689 on March 20, hit a high for the day of $0.00732 at 4:00 p.m. GMT and sank to $0.00646 at the time of writing. Its all-time high of $0.0428 was reached on Jan.6, according to CoinGecko. It has a market cap of around $406 million and 24-hour trading volume of $161 million.

The announcement on the soon-to-be-defunct website stated that the company intends to shift its focus and explore new opportunities. The LG Art Lab platform will officially close on June 17, 2025. The enthusiasm surrounding non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has noticeably waned since its 2022 peak. Initially, NFTs were introduced as revolutionary assets in the digital art and collectibles space. However, the sector ran into challenges such as market oversaturation, declining value, and a decline in consumer interests over time, which led to reciprocal changes within the industry, including the closure of many NFT trading platforms. In January 2025, Quidd, an NFT marketplace under Animoca Brands, announced its closure. The platform ceased operations on January 3, 2025. MakersPlace , another digital art platform, also shut down its operations in early 2025 due to “ongoing market challenges” after six years of operation. Many NFT trading platforms were shut down as early as 2024. GameStop launched its NFT marketplace in July 2022, during the peak of NFT trading and decided to close down the platform in early 2024. The closure was influenced by declining trading volumes after the peak November 2022 period, company layoffs, and declining interest and demand for NFTs. LG Art Lab announces closure to its community Per an announcement made on the LG Art Lab’s website, users will be unable to make purchases on the platform starting on March 10. The company says the LG Art Lab team will automatically transfer users’ NFTs to their wallets by April 30 so that the pieces can be resold. The notice also states that collectors and artists can manually transfer their artworks from the NFT marketplace to their own wallets. “Please note that Ethereum minted NFTs can be resold in other platforms (e.g. Opensea),” the notice read. The notice did not cite any specific reason for the closure of the platform. Instead, it vaguely expressed the company’s intention to explore other business opportunities. “As the NFT space continues to evolve, we believe it is the right time to shift our focus and explore new opportunities,” it read. The platform will shut down completely on June 17, but customer support for Art Lab users will be available until July 18. “While this chapter is coming to an end, our passion for digital art and innovation remains strong, and we look forward to seeing how the NFT space continues to grow and evolve,” LG said. Rise of LG Art Lab Launched in September 2022, LG Art Lab was designed to integrate digital art into consumers’ living rooms. The platform allowed users to buy, sell, and display NFTs directly on their LG smart TVs. LG Art Lab debuted during the period when interest in NFTs was at an all-time high. The platform aimed to make digital art accessible to a larger audience. The platform operated on the Hedera blockchain and later expanded to Ethereum, offering a range of digital artworks. Prices of the NFTs offered by LG Art Lab varied significantly. Some pieces like the “Bloom” animation from Bryan Brinkman cost the equivalent of $59.82, while a piece from Amadon sold for almost $4,000. Users could complete transactions on LG Art Lab using LG Electronics’ cryptocurrency wallet app, Wallypto. This made the process of acquiring and displaying digital art easier. Art Lab was launched shortly after Samsung launched a similar NFT TV marketplace in partnership with Nifty Gateway. The Samsung NFT TV marketplace has outlasted the LG NFT marketplace as they are so far still operational. The NFT market has experienced fluctuations across the spectrum since its boom in the early 2020s, and many companies are recording investment losses. The Australian Open’s Artball program, which linked NFTs to specific plots on the tennis court, saw the value of its tokens plummet by up to 90% as the initiative lost momentum. The sector has experienced a general decline in interest, but some sectors, such as gaming and virtual real estate, continue to find value in NFTs.

Phase 3 is currently priced at $0.02, with the project just a step away from the next price increase, coupled with a lot of excitement for its upcoming exchange listing. While several DeFi cryptocurrencies like XRP focus on cross-border payments and others like Polygon develop layer-2 scaling solutions, MUtuum Finance (MUTM) built a disruptive new mechanism that combines decentralized lending mechanics with a self-sustaining buy pressure system. Analysts monitoring the token’s trajectory contend that it could upend market expectations, with utility-driven demand propelling it past established competitors. Presale Momentum Accelerating Investors scrambling to secure entry into the final run of Phase 3 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale before the $0.025 rise. Phase 4 price kicks in soon and has brought third phase capacity within striking distance. Those who participate now will see their token value appreciate by 25% with the next stage launch, and buying the projected launch price of $0.06 now translates into a 200% gain for early buyers. Initial listings from listings have forecast of breaching into $3.50 in the months after going live — 17,400% increase from the current phase. Such growth potential is largely a result of Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) structured tokenomics, integrating platform revenue into strategic buybacks, establishing cyclical demand to the platform that stabilizes and enhances the token’s market value. As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts attention, comparisons to XRP and Polygon fade. As XRP struggles with regulatory greyness and Polygon with saturation of scalability, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is delivering real financial utility through its overcollateralized lending platform. Borrowers gain liquidity by collateralizing their assets and locking them in the pool by overcollateralizing their loan value while lenders earn dynamic variable interest rates applied to pool utilization. This creates a balance that entices players of all risk profiles from risk-averse to yield-seeking investors, and will cultivate an environment in which the token demand grows with the user adoption. The Tokenomics Driving Long-term Demand At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s charms is the buy-and-distribute business model that redistributes a share of platform fees back to the open markets when tokens are bought back from them. These tokens are then distributed to whoever staked the token, which incentivizes long term holding and reduces sell pressure. At the same time, users become able to deposit assets like ETH or DAI into our system to create mtTokens—yield-generating representations of their deposits which are transferable. These not only improve liquidity but also bring Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into the larger DeFi ecosystem, allowing for greater usage beyond just native platforms. As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ramps up towards exchange listing, the engineering team has smart contract audit initiated with industry leader Certik, a major achievement set to further cement investor confidence. The results will be reported through official channels when finalized, in accordance with the project’s commitment to transparency. Further solidifying the ecosystem’s stability and interoperability, the team also plans to introduce an overcollateralized stablecoin after launch. As Phase 3 allocations deplete, the opportunity to get MUTM at presale prices is closing in on both advantage and value. Those who get in on the ground floor set themselves up not just for near-term profits, but potentially exponential earnings as the platform’s user base grows. With a plan of crypto that diffuses away from speculative tokens to real-world utility and sustainable mechanics., Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a front-runner and ready to leapfrog the competition of both speculative tokens and Legacy Platforms. Seizing the Opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is born away from the true hype-driven cycles that seem to have plagued much of the crypto market. Combined with its presale, structured token burns, and rewards structures this one looks set for a lightning-fast rise. There is a level of immediate demand in something like MUTM that is very hard, if not impossible, to replicate, which is exactly why MUTM may represent the very rare intersection of innovation and immediacy that an investor looking for an asset rooted in functionality, rather than frenzy, would want to own. Get tokens now—before Phase 3 closes and prices rise.

The allegations were made by Wu Blockchain, a crypto news platform, when it shared a scoop on X (formerly Twitter) claiming that several projects paid huge intermediary fees to have their tokens listed on two of South Korea’s leading crypto exchanges, Upbit and Bithumb. According to Wu Blockchain, the fees were approximately $2 million and $10 million, respectively, and they were orchestrated by intermediaries related to Upbit’s shareholders and market makers. Some of the projects informed Wu Blockchain that they provided an intermediary fee ranging from 3% to 5% of the total token amount, before getting listed on Upbit successfully. The news platform also reported that this wasn’t the case with all the seven projects they reached out to. According to them, three of the projects reported that they didn’t pay any intermediary fee before they got listed. SCOOP: Several projects told WuBlockchain that they paid huge intermediary fees to have their tokens listed on South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Upbit and Bithumb. The fees were approximately US$10 million and US$2 million respectively. The intermediaries are… pic.twitter.com/PODtooUaYd — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 20, 2025 Upbit’s response and message to users In response to these allegations, Upbit denied the allegations in a press release addressed to its users, stating, “Upbit does not allow the involvement of external agencies to assist or intermediate trading support, and all procedures are conducted directly by Upbit employees.” The exchange also mentioned that it evaluates projects through a strict internal review process based on its trading support procedures and that it does not proceed with trading support under any financial compensation conditions. The exchange urged users and projects to avoid companies or individuals that approach them for intermediary fees, claiming that they are illegal brokers and unrelated to Upbit. The exchange also requested that Wu Blockchain share with them the list of digital assets listed on their platform that paid such intermediary fees as well as concrete evidence and supporting materials backing up the claim as they are setting up an investigation into the matter. Upbit also asked users to report cases of intermediary interference in its press statement. In response to the request, Wu Blockchain mentioned that it couldn’t disclose that information as it has to protect its source. Upbit’s battles with regulators Upbit recently had a run-in with South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which accused the platform of KYC violations numbering thousands. The regulator also discovered that Upbit facilitated transactions with unregistered foreign service providers, which violates South Korea’s specific Financial Information Act. All these violations led to the regulators sanctioning the platform on February 25, 2025, placing a ban on the platform’s ability to onboard new users. New users on the platform won’t be able to deposit or perform withdrawals from March 7 until June 6. The parent company of Upbit, Dunamu, has appealed the move and is working on overturning the decision. In a move that signified that the company may be actively working to be on the right side of the law, the platform announced earlier today that it will be revealing six companies suspected of engaging in Ponzi fraud via the platform and will be limiting the withdrawal of asset to the companies in accordance the Enforcement Decree of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act of South Korea. In its concluding post on X, Wu Blockchain urged the South Korean regulators to look into the matter, especially regarding the market markers. Given Upbit’s current progress, if these intermediary fee and market marker allegations turn out to be true, it will be a major setback for the platform. This would bring back more scrutiny on the platform which may be seeing itself pay out millions of dollars in fines due to previous violations. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Among the latest entrants, Arctic Pablo Coin shines as the Best meme coin to buy thanks to its innovative features and high-potential presale opportunities. Meanwhile, established meme coins like Sudeng and Toshi continue to make notable strides in the market, drawing increased investor interest. This article explores the latest developments surrounding these three coins, with a particular emphasis on Arctic Pablo Coin’s cutting-edge approach and the excitement surrounding its presale phase. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Mechanism: Enhancing Scarcity and Value Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) distinguishes itself through a strategic deflationary mechanism designed to enhance token scarcity and, consequently, value. During its presale, any unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation every week. Additionally, tokens remaining after the presale’s conclusion are also burned, fostering a deflationary environment that benefits investors by potentially increasing the value of their holdings over time. These token burn transactions are meticulously recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and trust within the community. This strategic mechanism further reinforces why Arctic Pablo Coin shines as the Best meme coin to buy as its controlled supply and growing demand create a strong investment case. With each burning event reducing the circulating supply, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as a promising asset in the competitive meme coin market. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: Seize the Opportunity at Nippy Nook The meme coin presale has reached an exhilarating milestone known as Nippy Nook, marking the 15th phase of its journey. Currently, APC is available for $0.000079 per token. Early investors have the potential to experience a remarkable return on investment (ROI) exceeding 10,027.85% as the price progresses from Nippy Nook to the anticipated launch price of $0.008. To illustrate, an investment of $100 today would secure approximately 1,265,686 APC tokens, which could grow to a value of $10,125.49 upon listing at $0.008. The presale has already raised over $1.95 million, reflecting strong community support and investor confidence. As Arctic Pablo Coin advances through its presale phases, the token price is set to increase, making the current phase an opportune moment for potential investors to join at a favorable entry point. Sudeng Coin: A Rising Contender in the Meme Coin Market Sudeng Coin (HIPPO) has been steadily gaining traction in the cryptocurrency market, drawing increased investor interest. Currently trading at approximately USD 0.004172, HIPPO boasts a 24-hour trading volume of $29,887,001, reflecting strong market activity. This consistent engagement highlights the growing confidence in Sudeng Coin’s potential. As meme coins continue to capture the attention of crypto enthusiasts, HIPPO stands out as a promising contender. With its active trading volume and expanding community, Sudeng Coin could present lucrative opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the ever-evolving meme coin world. Toshi Coin: A Growing Meme Coin Opportunity Toshi Coin (TOSHI) is currently trading at approximately USD 0.0003784, maintaining its position as a notable player in the meme coin sector. Despite limited recent updates, the token continues to attract interest from investors seeking high-growth opportunities in the crypto space. With meme coins gaining mainstream traction, Toshi Coin’s market presence and potential for price surges make it an intriguing option. As the broader cryptocurrency market evolves, TOSHI could benefit from increased adoption and speculative trading. Investors keeping an eye on emerging meme coins may find Toshi Coin to be a promising asset in their portfolio. Final Words: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Meme Coin Charge In the ever-evolving realm of meme coins, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) stands out with its innovative deflationary mechanism and the exciting opportunity presented by its presale phase, Nippy Nook. With a current price of $0.000079 and the potential for substantial returns, Arctic Pablo Coin is positioning itself as the best meme coin to buy for those seeking promising investment avenues. While Sudeng and Toshi continue to make their mark, the unique features and strategic approach of Arctic Pablo Coin make it a compelling choice for investors looking to capitalize on the dynamic cryptocurrency market.

This breakout brings renewed optimism, as analysts believe a stronghold above this level could trigger a rally toward higher prices. However, if ETH fails to maintain support above $2,000, a significant drop could follow, leading to further market instability. Related Reading: On-Chain Data Signals Key Test For Solana At $135 Level – Insights Macroeconomic uncertainty and trade war fears have continued to shake the crypto market, with Ethereum being one of the most affected assets. The recent price action reflects investor caution, as global financial conditions remain unpredictable. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that ETH is trading at a critical level that will determine its long-term direction in the coming weeks. Bulls must sustain momentum to solidify a bullish structure, while bears are watching for signs of weakness to drive prices lower. With ETH at a pivotal juncture, the next few trading sessions could be decisive for its trajectory. Ethereum at a Crossroads: Breakout or Breakdown? Ethereum has lost over 57% of its value since mid-December, with bulls struggling to reclaim higher prices as selling pressure dominates the market. Despite occasional relief rallies, ETH has remained under key resistance levels, leaving investors uncertain about its next move. Speculation about a potential recovery and a continuation of the downtrend are colliding, as price action shows no clear direction. The $2,000 level has become the ultimate test for Ethereum. Bulls must defend this price with conviction to sustain any meaningful recovery. Losing this support could lead to a sharp decline, pushing ETH into deeper bearish territory. Jelle stated in his analysis that either ETH is about to put in a massive reclaim or it’s about to jump off a cliff. The $2,000 level is the key limit that will determine Ethereum’s next move. If bulls can maintain strength above this mark, a push toward $2,300 and beyond could follow. However, failure to hold $2,000 would signal further downside, with the next major support sitting around $1,750. Ethereum’s fate hangs in the balance, and the coming days will be crucial in deciding whether it regains bullish momentum or continues its descent. Related Reading: XRP Bulls Face A Big Test – Metrics Show $2.40 As The Most Critical Resistance Level Ethereum Battles to Hold $2,000: Key Levels to Watch Ethereum is currently trading at $1,980 after days of struggling below the crucial $2,000 mark. Bulls managed to briefly push the price above this level, but sustaining it is now the real challenge. Holding above $2,000 is critical for Ethereum’s recovery, as it would signal strength and open the door for a rally toward the $2,200 mark. The $2,200 level is the most important resistance for ETH to reclaim in order to confirm a bullish reversal. A successful break and consolidation above this point would indicate that bulls are regaining control, potentially leading to a move toward higher targets. However, if Ethereum fails to hold above $2,000, selling pressure could increase, leading to a deeper correction. A drop below this level could trigger a sharp decline, pushing ETH toward the $1,800 support zone. If this support fails, the next major liquidity level would be around $1,750, where buyers might step in to prevent further downside.

According to its website, Manifest, which is “coming soon,” will be backed by home equity investments (HEIs) and offer a tokenized ETF , $USH (U.S. Housing). Lopez added that Manifest is revolutionizing tokenization by using ETF-style diversification to U.S. real estate and structuring it into a smart contract available on transparent public blockchains. Unlike traditional ETFs available on a legacy exchange, $USH utilizes blockchain technology to boost liquidity, programmability, and global accessibility, providing a groundbreaking approach to acquiring real estate exposure. Manifest’s $USH offers a blockchain-powered alternative to traditional real estate ETFs Manifest Founder and CEO Nathaniel Sokoll-Ward said the announcement is crucial for ETF investors because they will soon have the option to invest in diversified U.S. real estate that is not tied to real estate investment trusts (REITs) or direct ownership. He added that instead of using a product like the Vanguard Real Estate ETF, which has assets predominantly made up of real estate rental businesses, investors will have “the option to gain capital-efficient, direct exposure to the dominant real estate asset class in the country: owner-occupied single-family residential real estate equity.” Manifest’s $USH marks a major advancement beyond traditional real estate ETFs. According to Sokoll-Ward, $USH integrates blockchain technology to improve liquidity, capital efficiency, and tax benefits. Unlike publicly traded REIT ETFs, which face stock market volatility, centralized management, limited trading hours, and high fees, $USH operates entirely on-chain and is backed by Home Equity Investments. He added that this structure “eliminates intermediaries, reduces fees, increases transparency and ensures that all assets are fully collateralized by real estate equity.” VanEck Ventures, which co-led Manifest’s $2.5 million pre-seed funding round with Lattice Fund, was launched by the fund giant last October. The $30 million early-stage fund marked VanEck’s expansion into venture capital and was created to invest in “visionary founders operating at the intersection of fintech, digital assets and artificial intelligence.” Tokenized real estate set for growth as blockchain reshapes the market According to Lopez, tokenized financial products like $USH represent the next evolution in asset management, introducing 24/7 liquidity, seamless global settlement, enhanced accessibility, and direct programmability. These features have driven growth in DeFi and stablecoins in recent years, areas where traditional ETFs fall short. Developers can now access these assets and build products that enable margin against them, a previously unavailable capability. As per Statista , real estate tokenization will likely emerge as a key segment in the broader tokenized asset market, accounting for around one-third of the total tokenized assets in the global market by 2030. This is a sign of the growing acceptance of blockchain technology in real estate, as it allows fractional ownership and better liquidity. About 12% of real estate companies reported using asset tokenization in 2023, reflecting an increasing trend in digital modes of investment. Conventional real estate investments are frequently plagued by liquidity constraints as such property transactions are slow and costly. Market liquidity was highlighted as a top challenge by 60% of respondents in a 2024 European real estate industry experts survey. Manifest’s $USH is an example of a blockchain-based ETF that leverages tokenization to become tradable 24/7, bring transaction costs down by reducing counterparty risk and improve accessibility through tokenized ownership.

42073358,https://coingape.com/?p=245157,1742521523,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Canary Capital Files for Pengu ETF With US SEC, PENGU Price To Soar?",https://coingape.com/canary-capital-files-for-pengu-etf-with-us-sec-pengu-price-to-soar/,"Canary Capital has submitted a registration filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the launch of the first-ever Pengu exchange-traded fund (ETF). This move adds to the growing list of crypto asset managers seeking regulatory approval for digital asset-based ETFs. According to the filing published on Thursday, the proposed ETF will invest in the PENGU token, which is the official token of the Pudgy Penguins NFT project, as well as in Pudgy Penguins NFTs themselves. The filing also states that the ETF will hold other digital assets, including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), to support trading and transfers. Canary Capital Files for Pengu ETF In the registration statement , the ETF is defined as an investment trust that invests in digital assets such as PENGU tokens and Pudgy Penguins NFTs, among others. Regarding these holdings, Canary Capital emphasized that these ones are critical for monitoring the token and the NFT assets. If launched, the ETF will allow investors to track the price of PENGU and other NFTs in its portfolio without owning or hosting them as physical assets. The trust may also contain other assets in the form of digital media for the buying and selling besides conversion and redemption of the fund. “Other non-security digital assets owned by the trust include SOL and ETH that may be necessary or incidental,” the filing added. The Pudgy Penguins project released the Ethereum-linked PENGU token in December. The project has been popular in the crypto sphere as a collection of NFT and social networking. Although PENGU was first developed on Ethereum, there is a growing sentiment that it can be regarded as a Solana meme coin since most of its trading activity transpire in Solana platforms. PENGU Market Reaction and Price Movement Following the ETF announcement, the PENGU token saw a sharp 10% price increase during early trading. It broke above previous resistance levels and moved past the Ichimoku cloud, indicating a possible shift in momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for PENGU moved from 44.86 to 62 shortly after the news, indicating increased buying activity. The RSI remains below the overbought level of 70, suggesting that further gains are still possible. Many of the analysts are now focusing on the $0.0093 as the next level of resistance backed by the Robinhood listing last week. A breakout above that level means the token will be trading above the $0.010 mark, the first time in a month. However, if the momentum disappears, the token may fall back to $ 0.0062 support area. Growing List of Crypto ETF Applications Canary Capital is not the only firm pursuing ETF approval for non-traditional digital assets. In recent months, several asset managers have submitted filings for altcoin ETFs , including ones focused on Dogecoin (DOGE), Sui, Hedera, and BONK. These filings followed the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs by the SEC in 2024. Despite the recent trend, the SEC has delayed decisions on many of these applications, especially those involving meme coins and smaller tokens. Some market participants have raised questions about whether ETFs for meme coins and NFTs will meet regulatory standards. “The likelihood of approval for these funds remains unclear due to high volatility and limited trading history,” a statement from the filing added. Mixed Reactions From the Crypto Community On Pengu ETF The ETF proposal has sparked different responses from traders and analysts online. Some have raised doubts about investor demand for a fund tied to a meme coin and NFT project that is less than six months old. Social media commentator @beast_ico wrote, “We don’t need ETFs for ghost chains, much less sub 6 month old memecoins.” Others noted that despite the ETF news, the price reaction was short-lived, and sustained momentum may depend on broader market trends. Industry observer Alex Krüger commented, “New ETFs for crypto assets have become an irrelevant joke,” citing weak asset inflows into recently launched funds.

The Trump appointee shared a video where he listed the agency’s discoveries and those that have been discontinued. In the footage Hegseth posted on his official X page, he announced his decision to sign a memo directing the termination of over $580 million in DOD contracts. Hegseth said this would only affect the brands that do not align with the priorities of “this president or the department.” “In other words, they are not a good use of taxpayer dollars,” he said, pointing out that taxpayers fund the department and are owed transparency and the right to know their money is being used well. Another round of @DOGE findings here at the Department of Defense. pic.twitter.com/PSrHn8Zjlq — Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (@SecDef) March 20, 2025 Hegseth shared programs DOGE has terminated Hegseth began the list with an HR software effort he said was supposed to take a year and cost $36 million. Unfortunately, it has gone for years and gulped up to $280 million without doing what it was supposed to. “We’re not doing that anymore,” he said before moving on to reveal they also ended another batch of DOD grants worth $360 million. Next, he talked about cutting about $11 million from the navy budget and $9 from a university budget geared towards approaching “equitable AI and machine learning models.” “I need lethal machine learning models, not equitable machine models,” he said. After that, Hegseth revealed that as part of their effort to curb wasteful spending on external consulting services, they canceled $30 million in contracts with Gartner and McKinsey. Hegseth said that brings the total amount of cuts up to $800 million. He added this was only possible because the DOD partnered with DOGE as part of its efforts to ensure taxpayer funds are going to the warfighters who actually need them. “They’re working hard,” Hegseth praised DOGE before adding that the DOD appreciates the nobility of its task to cut excessive spending and is also working hard with them to make it happen. As the video ended, the Defense Secretary said no more time would be wasted and promptly signed the documents making the cuts permanent. In the comment section of the post, rather than appreciative comments from a public who recognizes the importance of what DOGE and the DOD are doing, the majority of the replies were scathing. DOD accused of going too far to eliminate DEI from the armed forces In the past couple of days, there has been much backlash from US citizens, especially members of the African American community, who feel they are being targeted by efforts disguised as cost-cutting attempts. Recently, the DOD, following President Trump’s executive order to eliminate DEI from the armed services, has flagged tens of thousands of images, posts, and content for removal. Some of the posts that have now been removed include references to Black military heroes like the Tuskegee Airmen, Medal of Honor recipients and other notable figures such as Jackie Robinson, as part of what is being called a “Digital Content Refresh” to comply with the directive. The content that was targeted involved those related to race, ethnicity, and observances like Black History Month, and it has led to the deletion of photos and posts about Black soldiers, women, and minorities, something that has triggered a mass outcry within the African American community. Jackie Robinson’s page has since been restored to its original URL on the Department of Defense website — and no longer says ‘DEI.’ pic.twitter.com/MQ5csI4XVB — Pop Base (@PopBase) March 19, 2025 On X, formerly Twitter, many have ranted and raved, calling out the DOD for only getting rid of pictures of colored servicemen while leaving images of only the white ones up and also renaming bases after Confederate generals. They worry this undermines the recognition of the contributions these men made to the war while they lived. Hegseth, who was appointed in January 2025, is in support of the war against DEI. He has declared “DEI is dead,” and argued that such programs erode camaraderie and threaten military mission execution. People now link his leadership at the DOD with the erasure of Black soldier history, and many have been seen criticizing or questioning the moves under his X posts.

Top Cryptos Under $1 To Watch in 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/price-surge-coming-soon-top-cryptos-under-1-to-watch-in-2025/,"The idea of buying a cryptocurrency under $1 and seeing it soar has always been appealing. With small initial capital, the potential for high gains remains a strong draw. Many well-known coins, like Dogecoin, started cheap and later delivered massive returns. Choosing wisely today could mean spotting tomorrow’s biggest performers. As 2025 approaches, several promising cryptos under $1 stand out. These digital assets combine strong fundamentals with innovative use cases that could drive their value higher. This list highlights the best options, including BlockDAG, Polygon (MATIC), TRON (TRX), Algorand (ALGO), Kaspa (KAS), and Dogecoin (DOGE). While their prices remain low, their potential remains high. BlockDAG Speed & Scalability Leading to $204.5M Presale BlockDAG is redefining blockchain efficiency with its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure. This design enables multiple blocks to be processed simultaneously, ensuring faster transactions and better scalability. BlockDAG’s infrastructure makes it a prime choice for decentralized applications (dApps) and Web3 developers needing speed and security. Unlike many low-cost cryptos that rely on hype, BlockDAG has demonstrated real progress. Its presale has already raised $204.5 million, providing strong community backing. Priced at $0.0248 per BDAG in Batch 27, it has surged 2,380% from its initial launch. With over 18.8 billion BDAG coins sold and $6.5 million in miner sales, BlockDAG is preparing for major exchange listings, with 10 top-tier platforms already in focus. The ongoing affiliate program also offers a 5% cashback in USDT, adding further value to early supporters. Polygon: The $491M Layer-2 Powerhouse Fueling Ethereum’s Future Polygon (MATIC) continues to be a powerhouse in the crypto space, thanks to its ability to enhance Ethereum’s scalability. As a Layer-2 solution, it provides faster, more cost-effective transactions, helping solve Ethereum’s congestion issues. With an expanding network of dApps and strong institutional partnerships, Polygon remains a favorite among developers. Currently priced at $0.2521, Polygon holds a market cap of approximately $491 million, reinforcing its standing in the industry. Its advancements in zero-knowledge (ZK) technology and Ethereum compatibility further position it for long-term success. As Ethereum-based projects grow, Polygon’s role as a scaling solution could significantly increase its value. TRON: The $20.87B Blockchain Powering Digital Content TRON (TRX) has established itself as a major force in decentralized applications, particularly in entertainment and content-sharing platforms. With its fast processing speeds and minimal transaction fees, TRON continues to see widespread adoption in gaming, streaming, and social media services. At $0.2451, TRON boasts a market cap of about $20.87 billion, demonstrating its dominance in the blockchain space. The network’s focus on digital content monetization ensures its relevance, while its ongoing development and partnerships make it a stable yet promising choice among cryptos. ALGO: The Green Blockchain With Real Use Cases Algorand (ALGO) is a standout due to its environmentally friendly proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, reducing energy consumption compared to traditional blockchains. The project has made strides in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), providing a secure and scalable infrastructure. Currently priced at $0.2488, Algorand has a market cap of $35.96 billion, highlighting its strong presence in the industry. By bridging traditional finance with decentralized solutions, Algorand continues to attract institutional partnerships. Additionally, its commitment to carbon-negative initiatives aligns with the rising demand for sustainable blockchain networks. Kaspa (KAS) is Redefining Transaction Speed Kaspa (KAS) is carving its niche by focusing on ultra-fast transactions. Its blocked structure allows multiple blocks to be created simultaneously, significantly improving scalability. This innovation enables the network to handle high transaction volumes efficiently without congestion. Priced at $0.0750 with a market cap of $2.89 billion, Kaspa presents a unique opportunity for those looking to invest in speed-optimized blockchain technology. Its expanding developer community and refined architecture position it as a key player in the future of high-performance blockchains. The Meme Coin DOGE Endures Dogecoin (DOGE) may have started as a joke, but its market relevance remains strong. As one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies, DOGE has built a loyal community and gained widespread acceptance as a payment option. Now trading at $0.2023 with a market cap of $29.68 billion, Dogecoin’s appeal extends beyond memes. Its continued integration into payment systems and community-driven growth ensure its lasting presence in the crypto space. Which Crypto Has the Best Potential? The best cryptos under $1 offer a unique mix of affordability and growth potential. While SHIB faces speculative challenges and Hedera must clear resistance before a true breakout, BlockDAG is emerging as the strongest contender. With its $204.5 million presale, 18.8 billion coins sold, and rapid expansion, BlockDAG is proving its staying power. Analysts believe its price could reach $1 by 2025, presenting a 3,932% ROI for early buyers. As it continues to attract attention and build out its ecosystem, those looking for high-growth potential should consider BDAG before the next price jump. For those who want to seize an opportunity before the next surge, BDAG’s presale remains open—but not for long.

As the top meme coin fluctuates near the support and resistance levels, market analysts have predicted the higher and lower possibilities. Both the technical analysis and historical data suggest how the prices could reverse higher or further consolidate in days to come. Dogecoin Price Faces Critical Test: Will Support Hold or Break? Dogecoin price is facing strong resistance at $0.176, with a Bearish Tweezer candlestick pattern forming on the daily chart. According to Trader Alan, this pattern is a strong reversal signal, suggesting that selling pressure is increasing. The resistance level has already seen a false breakout, where Dogecoin price briefly moved above $0.176 but failed to hold. This failure indicates weak bullish momentum and a possible downward move. The analyst suggests that if the price moves lower, Dogecoin price could retest the $0.143 support level. If selling pressure intensifies, the meme coin may trade within a range between $0.143 and $0.176. A break below this support could trigger further declines, pushing the top meme coin to a deeper correction phase. However, if buyers step in and defend the $0.143 level, Dogecoin price may continue consolidating within this range. Analyst states that for a bullish breakout to occur, DOGE must establish higher lows and build momentum near the $0.176 resistance level. A sustained move above this resistance could invalidate the bearish outlook, leading to an upward trend. Source: X Analyst Predict Possible 16% Breakout Analyst Ali Martinez has identified an ascending triangle pattern on Dogecoin price charts, indicating the potential for a breakout. This bullish pattern forms when higher lows develop while the price repeatedly tests a horizontal resistance level. In this case, the key range for a breakout is between $0.16 and $0.18. Martinez suggests that if DOGE price closes outside this range, either upward or downward, a 16% price move could follow. A breakout above $0.18 could lead to further bullish momentum, while a breakdown below $0.16 may result in a sharp decline. Source: X Trendline at $0.14269 Could Influence Meme Coin Rally Moreover, analyst DOGE Capital noted that Dogecoin price is following a historical pattern observed in past market cycles. The analyst points to a repeating structure where DOGE accumulates within a triangular wedge before breaking out. The key support level to watch is around $0.14269, which has previously acted as a launchpad for the meme coin rally. DOGE Capital’s analysis suggests that when DOGE price retests this historical trendline, it tends to rebound and initiate a strong upward move. If this pattern repeats, DOGE could see another bullish breakout in the coming weeks. Source: X Meanwhile, following the Fed’s FOMC meeting, the meme coin has shown strong upward momentum. Analysts have identified key price targets at $0.38, $0.48, and $0.60, citing bullish market conditions and increased trading volume as driving factors.

Indeed, buying ADA at its 200DMA has proven to be a great short-term trading strategy in recent weeks. After testing its 200DMA in early February, the Cardano price rallied 50% in 10 days. Meanwhile, after falling back to the 200DMA in late February, the Cardano price rallied as much as 80% in early March. Could history be about to repeat itself? Well, traders would be wise to realize that the situation in the crypto market right now is very different than it was a few weeks ago. Trump’s announcement that Cardano would be included in a strategic US crypto reserve in early March was the catalyst for that stunning rally. However, ADA didn’t make it into the digital asset stockpile, and the government has announced no plans to include it in the stockpile in the future. Meanwhile, after a lot of hype that Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson would meet with key officials in the Trump administration in February, he was eventually snubbed and not even invited to the administration’s crypto event earlier this month. Last at $0.72, the Cardano price is down about 40% from its earlier monthly highs, justified amid the pricing out of all this hype. Cardano has been suffering amid a broader malaise in the crypto market as macro conditions turn for the worse. The Fed threw the bulls a bone earlier this week when they slowed the rate of their quantitative tightening . BREAKING: FED SAYS QT ENDS APRIL 1ST. MONEY PRINTER IS COMING BACK. MASSIVELY BULLISH FOR BITCOIN! pic.twitter.com/b4MHNfwc9l — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) March 19, 2025 But the outlook for the US economy remains murky, with risks to growth and inflation remaining sticky rising. A further deterioration of the macro backdrop could easily be the trigger for a renewed crypto market drop in the weeks ahead, and Cardano could easily lose its 200DMA. How Low Could Cardano Go? Just as the convincing break above the 200DMA in early November signified the start of a powerful bullish trend, a convincing break below the 200DMA in the coming weeks could signal the start of a new bearish trend. Its entirely feasible that the Cardano price might soon retest its February lows in the $0.55 area, and potentially even support in the form of the mid-2024 highs in the $0.40s. Would it be a good idea to buy Cardano at these levels? Well, it depends on the risk appetite of the investor. Cardano could do very very well in the years ahead. Its blockchain has a lot of potential for real world adoption, especially as it pivots towards becoming the go-to Bitcoin DeFi chain. However, this is highly speculative. In its many years of existence, Cardano has failed to garner anything close to the real world adoption seen by rivals like Bitcoin , Ethereum and Solana . That being said, deteriorating macro conditions aside, risks are titled towards major cryptos seeing a lot of growth before Trump’s term is finished. The US President has specifically marked out crypto as an industry that he wants to support, as he reiterated in remarks today. BREAKING: THE FULL TRUMP SPEECH: pic.twitter.com/tfyVzLQhqt — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) March 20, 2025 Growth in the broader industry would be expected to “lift all boats”, meaning Cardano could do very well over the next few years. Buying it on the dip is thus probably not a bad idea. That said, cryptos with a better track record of adoption like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana are probably safer bets with arguably just as much upside potential.

Gox crypto exchange and co-founded Ripple has shared new details about his ambitious space station company Vast, which he hopes will help expand the human race into a multi-planetary species. In a March 20 interview with Bloomberg, Jed McCaleb confirmed that Vast is on track to launch Haven-1 — a commercial space station still under construction — into orbit by May 2026. If McCaleb’s startup succeeds, it will be better positioned to win a lucrative contract from the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration to replace the International Space Station. Contracts are expected to be handed out in mid-2026. If Vast fails or loses the NASA contract to a competitor, McCaleb could see $1 billion wiped from his net worth and the commercial future of his space station firm would be in doubt, according to the report. “There are not that many folks who are willing to dedicate the amount of resources and time and risk tolerance that I am,” McCaleb told Bloomberg. Vast’s founder, board chair and tech fellow Jed McCaleb. Source: Vast McCaleb is known to be a “deliberate risk-taker” with hyperrational tendencies, according to long-time friend and former business partner Sam Yagan, who added: “He’s maybe slightly eccentric in his willingness to take what you and I would see as a lot of risks.” McCaleb’s aspiration to put humans on other planets draws similarities to multibillionaire and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. “It’s super important that people take this leap from where we are today to this potential world where there’s a lot of people living off the Earth,” said McCaleb, who founded Vast in 2021. Vast is building its spacecraft with components developed by SpaceX, such as a docking adapter to connect SpaceX’s Dragon capsule to Vast’s station and an in-space internet system that will provide WiFi on the station via Starlink. Key specifications Vast’s Haven-1 model. Source: Vast McCaleb’s firm has also booked SpaceX flights to send its hardware into orbit and deliver crew to its station, and SpaceX has agreed to carry astronauts for Vast as long as NASA gives its go-ahead. Vast’s close ties to SpaceX stem partly from it hiring key personnel who previously worked there, including Max Haot, who now serves as Vast’s CEO and president. Vast is competing with the likes of Axiom Space, Voyager Space Holdings, Lockheed Martin and the Jeff Bezos-founded Blue Origin to win the next major NASA contract. McCaleb also wants to create ‘artificial gravity’ Part of Vast’s long-term plans is to create artificial gravity replicating Earth-like conditions by accelerating or rotating the spacecraft, as many ISS workers who have spent lengthy periods in space have reported organ damage. The ISS also uses a technology that recycles wastewater into potable water and carbon dioxide into breathable oxygen. Haven-1 won’t feature this due to its short-term crew visits, but Vast plans to incorporate it into its future model, Haven-2, by 2028, which will be designed for longer-term stays. Both McCaleb and Haot say they’re willing to board flights themselves.

After McCaleb’s first success with the internet file-sharing service eDonkey in the 2000s, his next notable achievement was founding Mt. Gox in 2010. His time at Mt. Gox was short-lived, with McCaleb selling a majority stake in 2011. Mt. Gox went on to become the world’s largest Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange until 2014 when a $400 million hack sent the company into bankruptcy. Several months later, McCaleb began his next venture — creating the XRP ( XRP ) crypto token on the Ripple protocol in 2012. McCaleb owned 9% of the XRP tokens from the onset but sold the majority of them after 2013 when he left Ripple following disagreements with the company’s other founders. He has netted billions of dollars from those XRP sales and Ripple equity between 2014 and 2022. McCaleb also founded the Stellar network in 2014 — a fork of the Ripple protocol — along with the Stellar ( XLM ) crypto token, which now boasts an $8.7 billion market cap, CoinGecko data shows.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP’s surge past $2.50, BNB’s bullish momentum, and Qubetics’ presale and partnership success are fueling excitement in the crypto market. Table of Contents Qubetics: Transforming asset tokenization XRP breaks $2.50 after SEC lawsuit dismissal announcement BNB gears up for a bullish breakout Why Qubetics, XRP, and BNB are worth watching The cryptocurrency market is witnessing exciting developments, with Qubetics, XRP, and BNB standing out as major players. Qubetics is transforming tokenized assets, securing massive investments in its crypto presale and forming key partnerships to enhance liquidity and security. XRP surged past $2.50 after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the dismissal of the SEC lawsuit, boosting investor confidence. Meanwhile, BNB shows strong bullish indicators, hinting at a potential breakout rally. Qubetics: Transforming asset tokenization Qubetics is leading tokenized investments by offering a marketplace that fractionalizes real-world and digital assets, making them accessible to investors worldwide. From real estate and commodities to equities and intellectual property, the platform aims to unlock new opportunities for diversification and wealth creation. Qubetics’ crypto presale: A massive opportunity for early investors Qubetics’ crypto presale has been nothing short of a massive success, raising $15.2 million with over 501 million TICS tokens sold. Unlike traditional ICOs, Qubetics uses a unique 7-day presale stage system, ensuring a 10% price increase every Sunday at 12 AM. Currently, TICS is priced at $0.1181, but analysts predict it will reach $1 by the end of the presale, offering early investors a potential 746% ROI. However, the real gains may come post-launch. With the mainnet set to launch in Q2 2025, price forecasts suggest TICS could surge to $10 or even $15. This makes Qubetics one of the trending crypto presales for potentially high, long-term rewards. Strategic partnerships: Strengthening Qubetics’ ecosystem To ensure a secure and efficient blockchain experience, Qubetics has formed high-profile partnerships that enhance its liquidity, security, and usability. CertiK security audit: Qubetics is undergoing a comprehensive audit by CertiK, one of the most trusted blockchain security firms. This assessment will strengthen network security, smart contract reliability, and user trust, ensuring Qubetics is a secure and attack-resistant ecosystem. SWFT Blockchain collaboration: Qubetics has partnered with SWFT Blockchain to develop a state-of-the-art wallet, simplifying blockchain transactions and setting a new standard for secure asset management. Qubetics x 1inch: Qubetics is proud to announce its integration with the 1inch Network, a leading DeFi aggregator that connects users to hundreds of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for optimized trades, unmatched liquidity, and the best possible rates. This strategic partnership positions the Qubetics Wallet at the forefront of decentralized trading offerings. With these strategic partnerships, Qubetics is positioning itself as a secure, scalable, and transformative blockchain ecosystem, making it a top contender in the crypto space.

Following the announcement, XRP surged 14% to surpass $2.50, with analysts expecting further gains. Whales have taken notice — wallets holding at least one million XRP have increased their holdings by 6.5% in the past two months, accumulating 46.4 billion XRP worth $114 billion at current prices. Additionally, XRP network activity has surged, with unique wallet interactions increasing sixfold in March. With regulatory uncertainty behind it and growing institutional adoption, XRP is set for continued bullish momentum. BNB gears up for a bullish breakout BNB’s price action suggests an impending breakout, as the crypto has rebounded from recent lows with strong momentum. Previously, BNB attempted a trendline breakout, but resistance at $640 (the 61.80% Fibonacci level) caused a temporary dip to $605. However, the broader market recovery has sparked a V-shaped reversal, with BNB forming four consecutive bullish candles, signaling renewed upside momentum. Key indicators supporting a bullish rally include: MACD and signal lines are close to a positive crossover, reinforcing buying strength. The stochastic RSI lines rebounded from the oversold region, initiating a fresh, bullish cycle. If BNB breaks past the $640 resistance, it could trigger an extended rally, making it one of the top altcoins to watch in the coming weeks. Why Qubetics, XRP, and BNB are worth watching Qubetics stands out with its $15.2m presale, upcoming mainnet launch, and strong partnerships. Meanwhile, XRP and BNB continue showing signs of strength. Keeping an eye on these projects as the crypto market heats up could lead to significant gains in 2025 and beyond.

With Solana ETFs and Kaspa’s 11% Breakout, It Might Be—Here’s Why!",https://thecoinrise.com/is-qubetics-the-top-crypto-presale-of-2025-with-solana-etfs-and-kaspas-11-breakout-it-might-be-heres-why/,"Which blockchain projects are leading the next wave of innovation? Some cryptocurrencies fade into obscurity, while others continue to break new ground. Solana’s first-ever futures ETFs in the U.S. have signaled an institutional shift. Kaspa’s network efficiency has fueled double-digit gains, drawing serious attention. But neither has solved a major issue that plagues global finance: seamless, cost-effective cross-border transactions. Qubetics ($TICS) the top crypto presale is changing that. Designed for real-world usability, Qubetics is redefining how digital assets move across economies. Unlike its predecessors, this multi-chain non-custodial wallet offers businesses and individuals an advanced transactional ecosystem, solving the inefficiencies that traditional financial systems and legacy blockchains have struggled with for years. Qubetics: The Future of Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics isn’t just a blockchain initiative—it’s reshaping the future of digital finance. With a cross-border transaction at its core, Qubetics enables seamless global transactions without reliance on third parties. High fees, slow settlements, and complex onboarding have kept digital assets from reaching mainstream commerce, but Qubetics is eliminating these barriers. International trade, freelance payments, and remittances all suffer from inefficient banking rails. A business selling goods across borders faces steep conversion fees and unpredictable settlement times. With Qubetics, transactions happen in real time, cutting costs and eliminating middlemen. Similarly, a professional receiving payments from abroad no longer waits days for clearance—Qubetics provides instant liquidity one of the top crypto presale. More than 23,400 token holders have already recognized its potential, securing over 501 million $TICS tokens in its crypto presale . Currently in its 26th stage, the presale has raised over $15.2 million, with $TICS priced at $0.1181. Early participants stand to gain a 746% ROI at $1, 4,130% ROI at $5, and 12,591% ROI at $15, making Qubetics one of the top crypto projects to invest in right now. Solana: Institutional Adoption Accelerates Solana’s network efficiency and developer activity have positioned it as a top-tier blockchain. With Volatility Shares launching the first-ever Solana futures ETFs in the U.S., institutions now have a new gateway to gain exposure without directly holding SOL. The introduction of these ETFs—Solana ETF (SOLZ) and the leveraged 2X Solana ETF (SOLT)—is a major milestone. Unlike traditional crypto trading, ETFs provide regulated, mainstream access to digital assets, driving liquidity and adoption. Since the announcement, Solana’s price has surged above $130, gaining 6% in just 24 hours, reflecting growing confidence. The Expanding Ecosystem Solana’s ultra-fast transactions and low fees continue to attract developers, leading to new DeFi and NFT innovations. Whether it’s on-chain gaming or decentralized finance applications, Solana remains a formidable player in blockchain scalability. Kaspa: The Scalable Proof-of-Work Blockchain Kaspa has gained traction as a high-speed proof-of-work blockchain with rapid transaction finality. Unlike Bitcoin, which struggles with scalability, Kaspa’s GhostDAG protocol allows simultaneous block confirmations, improving efficiency without sacrificing security. Kaspa’s resilience in the market has been evident. Recently, its price surged 11%, demonstrating solid recovery momentum. Currently, it trades at $0.077583, marking a 3.65% increase in the past 24 hours, outperforming the general market’s 2.45% rise. Why Kaspa Stands Out Kaspa’s structure enables high transaction throughput, making it a viable alternative for industries requiring real-time confirmations. This unique architecture keeps network congestion minimal, ensuring smooth operations even during peak usage. The Takeaway: Which Project Has the Strongest Future? Each of these projects addresses different facets of blockchain innovation. Solana is accelerating institutional adoption, Kaspa is redefining PoW scalability, and Qubetics is solving real-world financial inefficiencies. For those looking at high-potential opportunities, Qubetics’ presale remains a standout, with its cross-border transaction solutions proving critical for the evolving digital economy. Qubetics is also pioneering AI-driven smart contracts, reducing settlement times and eliminating inefficiencies in financial transactions. With regulatory-friendly automation and a scalable infrastructure, it is positioning itself as the top crypto presale , offering businesses and individuals a seamless way to engage with blockchain without technical barriers.

Atai, which is developing mental health treatments using psychedelics like DMT and MDMA, has become the latest public company to announce plans to buy Bitcoin. It plans to buy $5 million of Bitcoin ( BTC ), its founder and chair Christian Angermayer wrote in a March 20 Substack post. “Drug development is a cash-hungry, long-term venture,” he said. “The necessary steps to achieve regulatory approval can easily take more than a decade.” TechCrunch reported in January that, according to multiple data sets, the number of startups shutting down rose in 2024 compared to 2023 as firms failed to receive more funding to keep running. Angermayer said the approval process is essential for drug development, but it exposes firms to financial risks while sticky inflation and high interest rates have caused the current “biotech winter.” Source: Christian Angermayer He added that the current industry approach is to put cash reserves in near-zero-yield accounts, as “preserving capital was more important than earning a return on their cash balance.” “This context sets the stage for considering unconventional treasury moves — like adding Bitcoin to the treasury — to address the twin threats of inflation and low-yielding reserves, and in general to optimize and maximize shareholder value.” Atai will join at least five other public medical companies that have bought Bitcoin in recent months with the aim of boosting shareholder returns. Biotech firm Quantum BioPharma said on March 20 that it had now spent $3.5 million in total to buy BTC and other cryptocurrencies after an initial $1 million investment in December. Medical device maker Semler Scientific said last month that since it started in May, it had spent a total of $280.4 million buying 3,192 BTC. Hoth Therapeutics , Acurx Pharmaceuticals and Enlivex Therapeutics said in separate statements on Nov. 20 that each of them would buy $1 million in Bitcoin. Related: Michael Saylor’s Strategy plans to offer 5M shares to buy more Bitcoin Atai’s Angermayer said his firm’s Bitcoin buy would primarily be as a long-term inflation hedge but also a short-term diversification play. He added that Bitcoin is likely to have short-term price fluctuations, so the Berlin-based firm is holding mostly US dollars, short-term securities, and stocks for its desired run rate into 2027. Atai’s $5 million put would mean it is able to buy just over 59 BTC at its current price of around $84,300 and make it the world’s 52nd largest holder among public firms, according to Bitbo data . Bitcoin has struggled to keep afloat amid a wider market rout due to US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and fears of a US recession, which Trump hasn’t ruled out. Atai’s share price rose early in March 20 trading to a peak of $1.47 but tapered off to close the day down 1.44% at $1.37, according to Google Finance. Its stock has sunk nearly 93% from its mid-2021 public debut peak but is up 3% so far this year.

The announcement came in a video posted on social media platform X, where Garlinghouse noted the regulatory agency’s decision to end its pursuit of further litigation. Besides this interesting development, another major financial development has taken center stage in the crypto market in the past 24 hours; the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting. Fed Keeps Interest Rates Steady Amid Uncertainty The outcome of the latest Fed meeting can be divided into six key decisions. First, the Federal Reserve opted to maintain interest rates at their current level, keeping the borrowing rate in a range between 4.25% and 4.5% for the second consecutive meeting. This decision is part of a continued pause in the Fed’s tightening cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: 6 Key Events To Watch Out For In Crypto This Week Secondly, the Fed noted that uncertainty surrounding the economy has increased, and third, the Fed’s updated projections were the shift in expectations for rate cuts in 2025. The median forecast suggests 50 basis points of cuts for the year, but a growing number of Fed officials are less convinced that rate reductions will be necessary. In December, only one official anticipated no rate cuts in 2025. However, there’s now a more divided outlook, and that number has now risen to four, as noted in a post on social media platform X by analysts at The Kobeissi Letter. Beyond interest rates, the Fed revised its economic growth projections downward for 2025, suggesting that policymakers see slower expansion ahead. This adjustment comes alongside an increase in the Fed’s inflation forecast for the same period, reflecting concerns about price pressures persisting longer than previously anticipated. With inflation remaining a key focus, the central bank is treading carefully as it evaluates the right time to pivot toward a looser monetary stance. Fourthly, the Fed announced that it would slow the pace of its balance sheet runoff beginning in April. This is alongside a sharp reduction in the Fed’s 2025 growth projections and a markup in their 2025 inflation forecast. Implications For Crypto Markets And Digital Assets For the crypto industry, the Fed’s decision to hold rates steady and its mixed messaging on future cuts introduce a dynamic situation to Bitcoin and others. The fact that the Fed is still concerned about inflation and economic uncertainty shows that the path to more accommodative policies regarding the crypto industry may not be as smooth.

However, if the Fed stays hesitant to cut rates and economic growth slows as projected, digital assets may face headwinds later in the year, which may slow down the predicted growth by crypto analysts.

Ethereum rallied from the low $1,900s on Wednesday to nearly $2,100 and was last just below $2,000. The Fed slowed the pace of its quantitative tightening (QT) program on Wednesday, a strong signal to the market that a new liquidity wave is on the horizon, if not here just yet. BREAKING: FED SAYS QT ENDS APRIL 1ST. MONEY PRINTER IS COMING BACK. MASSIVELY BULLISH FOR BITCOIN! pic.twitter.com/b4MHNfwc9l — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) March 19, 2025 Liquidity in the financial system is the life blood for altcoins like Ethereum . And a lack of it since 2022 amid the Fed’s aggressive monetary tightening approach and quantitative tightening has hobbled growth in the altcoin market. While Bitcoin has been carried by narratives like the hugely successful 2024 ETF launch and its growing acceptance as “digital gold”, most major altcoins have struggled to keep pace. The lack of liquidity in the US financial system has meant that alt-coin seasons, like that in early 2024 and in wake of Trump’s election victory have disappointed. Indeed, a darkening of the macro backdrop as risks to US economic growth rise and inflation threatens to rebound has weighed heavily on the market in recent weeks. But the prospect of the end of QT and, eventually, the start of a new liquidity wave, could substantially lift the mood in the market. Could Ethereum soon rally back to record highs? Where Next for the Ethereum Price? While it has rallied a solid 13% from earlier monthly lows and snapped a short-term downtrend, Ethereum is yet to break back above its 21DMA. This is a level that has offered stiff resistance going pretty much all the way back to the start of 2025. That suggests price risks still remain titled to the downside in the short-term. Moreover, a more nuanced analysis of the macro backdrop also suggests risks remain tilted to the downside. Yes, the Fed is slowing QT and that means we are one big step closer to a new wave of liquidity. But a lot needs to happen first before that new wave of liquidity comes. Indeed, QE liquidity waves have always in the past followed some sort of crisis/market turmoil. And that might be exactly what we get in 2025 – the US economy is at risk of tilting into recession amid Trump’s trade wars and D.O.G.E austerity and the US government needs to refinance a massive $9 trillion of its debt. Things need to get a lot worse first before the Fed pulls the trigger on a new wave of money printing. That suggests that Ethereum potentially has a other further to drop in 2025, before QE sends it to the moon in 2026. That’s looking very far ahead. Savvy traders focused on the market’s short-term outlook should closely watch upcoming US economic data releases and trade war news. As well failing to reclaim its 21DMA, Ethereum has also so far failed to reclaim the long-term support-turned-resistance $2,100 level. Risks remain tilted towards a retest of mid-2023 lows around $1,500 before QE, and general crypto industry growth thanks to regulatory support from the Trump administration sends us to new all time highs in the coming years.

In a market filled with hype-driven projects, only a few bring real innovation to the table. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is one of those rare gems, introducing a deflationary mechanism that permanently removes unsold tokens, increasing scarcity and potential value. Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies like Comedian and AI Companions continue to generate excitement with strong trading volumes and investor interest. As the crypto market surges with new developments, Arctic Pablo Coin is leading the way with its presale success. This article will cover the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin, Comedian, and AI Companions, with a special focus on Arctic Pablo Coin’s token burn strategy and presale potential. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Game-Changing Token Burn Strategy A fundamental challenge for many meme coins is controlling supply. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) tackles this head-on with an aggressive token burn mechanism, ensuring a deflationary environment that strengthens its long-term value. Arctic Pablo Coin is in the Best New Meme Coins to Join Now. Unlike projects that simply hold unsold tokens, Arctic Pablo Coin permanently removes them from circulation every week during the presale. This reduction in supply enhances scarcity, potentially driving up value as demand increases. Additionally, any tokens left unsold after the presale will also be burned, ensuring that only actively purchased tokens remain in the ecosystem. These transactions are recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), offering full transparency and accountability. With supply shrinking each week, early adopters stand to benefit the most as fewer tokens remain available. This strategy not only protects investor interest but also builds long-term sustainability for the project. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: The Nippy Nook Stage is Here—Don’t Miss Out! Momentum is building fast for meme coin presale, which has now entered its 15th phase—Nippy Nook. With each phase, the price has steadily increased, rewarding early investors. At the current presale price of just $0.000079, those who seize the opportunity now could potentially see an ROI of over 10,027.85%, with the launch price set at $0.008. A $1,000 investment today would yield approximately 12,656,860 APCs. At the launch price of $0.008, that investment could grow to a staggering $101,254.88. With over $1.95 million already raised, Arctic Pablo Coin is gaining massive traction, and as it moves through different phases, the price will only go up. As new locations unlock, the entry price rises—securing APC at its current rate is a rare opportunity. The Arctic Pablo Coin presale is quickly approaching its final stages, and investors are rushing to grab their share before the price hikes again. Will you be part of this exclusive opportunity before it’s too late? Comedian’s Market Performance: A Strong Trading Volume Signals Interest As the meme coin market continues to expand, Comedian is attracting significant attention with its active trading. Currently priced at $0.0553, Comedian has achieved an impressive 24-hour trading volume of $21,378,383.15. This level of activity indicates strong investor confidence and liquidity, essential factors in sustaining long-term growth. Comedian’s rise demonstrates how niche-themed cryptocurrencies can capture the market’s imagination, further reinforcing the potential of meme-based projects. AI Companions Sees Stable Growth in the Crypto Market Artificial intelligence remains a hot trend, and AI Companions is leveraging that interest with its solid market presence. Priced at $0.2198, AI Companions has achieved a 24-hour trading volume of $3.89 million, signaling steady engagement from investors. With AI-driven projects gaining momentum, AI Companions continues to attract attention from those looking for the next breakthrough technology-backed crypto asset. Final thoughts: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Meme Coin Revolution The cryptocurrency market is witnessing exciting developments, with Comedian and AI Companions making waves in their respective categories. However, the spotlight remains on Arctic Pablo Coin, thanks to its game-changing token burn mechanism and skyrocketing presale performance. With the Nippy Nook phase in full swing and prices set to rise, this could be one of the most strategic entry points for those looking to invest in the next big meme coin sensation.

Despite a neutral 'Crypto Fear & Greed' index, Ethereum's Telegram and search interest remain low, indicating weak demand and user growth. Capital outflows from digital asset investment products are at record highs, with ETH ETFs seeing consistent net outflows, though Grayscale's mini trust shows modest growth. Given the poor Q1 performance and challenging technical setup, I see no compelling reason to be long ETH despite its low expense ratio. As the market quickly closes in on the end of the first quarter of the year, it has been a rough start to 2025 for Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) to say the least. Down nearly 40% year to date, ETH's recent performance is actually even worse when going back to mid-December: Data by YCharts On December 16th, ETH came within $45 of $4k per coin. In less than three months, ETH's price had fallen by more than 57% percent from the peak in December. Is there any reason for Ethereum holders to exhibit optimism? In this Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ( ETH ) article, we'll look at market sentiment, capital flows in the market, and the technical setup for ETH that I'm currently seeing. Market Sentiment For those who want a more fundamental update to Ethereum's network usage, I'd invite readers to check out my iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (NASDAQ: ETHA ) article from early-March. In that piece, I went over the network usage and fee metrics for the blockchain through February. Very little has changed in that regard through the first few weeks of March. Despite the lack of growth in network fees, market sentiment more broadly appears to be improving: Crypto Fear and Greed Index (TrendSpider) At a 49 reading in the 'Crypto Fear & Greed' index on March 20th, market sentiment is showing a swift spike out of bearish territory and puts the overall market sentiment at 'neutral.' For Ethereum specifically, indications are much less rosy: IntoTheBlock Telegram Sentiment - derived from machine learning connotation analysis of Telegram messages by token - is showing very little interest in Ethereum through Telegram going back to December. This could certainly be more indicative of declining Telegram usage than anything else, as Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) Telegram Sentiment trends look fairly similar to the chart above. That said, search interest from the general public also shows declining interest over time: Ethereum Search Interest (Google Trends) Worldwide search data for 'Ethereum' shows broad declines in 'interest over time' over the last five years. The index reading for this search interest data has been under 20 since Ethereum's price peak in December. This does not seem indicative of what would be expected with robust demand and user growth. To be sure, it has been capital flows rather than utility truly driving this market for a while. US ETF Supply & Capital Flows Through March 14th 2025, digital asset investment products have seen the worst five week outflow streak on record: CoinShares After another $1.7 billion came out of cryptocurrency investment products last week, the month to date net flow is negative by nearly $2.7 billion and the total net flow over the last five weeks is negative by $6.4 billion. The asset class is dangerously close to negative net flows year to date, and one more week like the one we had through March 14th would do the trick. The early indications through Wednesday do indeed look a bit better. Data tracked by Farside Investors shows nearly $500 million in BTC ETF demand. Ethereum has not been so lucky: Net Flows BTC ETFs ETH ETFs 17 Mar 2025 $274.6 -$7.3 18 Mar 2025 $209.1 -$52.8 19 Mar 2025 $11.8 -$11.7 3 Day Sum $495.5 -$71.8 Source: Farside Investors, $ in millions Ethereum ETFs have seen net outflow each of the first three days during the week of March 17th. The Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust has seen $17 million in single week outflow through March 19th. However, the overall trend in ETH supply held through the fund remains positive: ETH Coin Supply Trend (TheBlock) At 462.6k ETH-USD held through the fund, Grayscale's mini trust has grown ETH token supply by 1.7% year to date. From an expense ratio standpoint, ETH is the standout in the market with an annual fee of just 15 basis points. The Block The fund is also top four regarding the share of spot ETF volume. ETH has actually seen this grow in recent weeks with share of volume eclipsing 10% every session since March 12th. That said, ETH share of spot ETF volume is still well off highs from late last year. At that time, the fund often had a share of volume in excess of 20%. Additional Considerations As we approach the end of March, we can look at the Q2 seasonality implications for Ethereum. April has historically been the best month for ETH based purely on mean change: ETH Seasonality (TrendSpider) Going back to 2016, Ethereum's mean change in April is 26% and the coin has made a positive return 75% of the time. Though we shouldn't gloss over the fact that Q1 should have been a terrific quarter for ETH based on past seasonality trends as well - and the actual performance between January and March turned out to be quite horrible. My interpretation of Ethereum's technical setup is indecisive: ETH-USD Weekly (TrendSpider) On one hand, we can see the coin hanging on to the 300-week moving average for dear life. On the other hand, I see $2,100 per coin serving as support on weekly closes going back to late 2023. That level was breached on a close the week of March 3rd, failed a back test the week of March 10th, and is currently still under that key level as of article submission on March 20th. I, personally, would not entertain taking a stab at that trade from the long side until we see the coin take back $2,100 on a weekly close. It's entirely possible that the breakdown the week of March 3rd is a fake out and the 300-week MA will indeed hold as support. But at this point, that would just be a guess and not one that I'm going to make today. Closing Summary You could talk me into the merits of a technical bounce for ETH, given how aggressive the selloff has been over the last three months. I find it particularly interesting that investment capital flow for the asset is now quite competitive with that of Bitcoin's year to date. But bear in mind, this is largely coming with net outflows over the last several weeks, and Bitcoin has simply been hit harder in this regard than Ethereum has. The year-to-date investment flows could easily flip to negative if the week of March 17th mirrors what we have been seeing over the last month. While sentiment figures have indeed improved when observed through the 'Crypto Fear & Greed' index, I think the lack of interest in Ethereum through platforms like Telegram and Google Search are fairly troubling. In a way, we have the market we deserve in crypto right now. Usage and user interest are not what have been generally driving coin price action. Rather, capital flows from speculators who expect to sell to someone else at a higher price continue to drive gains (and losses). For tax-advantaged exposure to ETH, traders can do a lot worse than the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF at a 0.15% expense ratio. But at this point, I still don't see a compelling reason to be long ETH based on any fundamental trends. Furthermore, I think the technical setup has challenges. Even though Q1 was a really bad quarter for ETH, it can always get worse!",ETH-USD|ETH,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-21 02:54:44

With increasing adoption and community-driven hype, DOGE remains a strong contender in the crypto market. However, its large supply and reliance on speculative interest make such a surge challenging. Meanwhile, emerging projects with lower market caps and strong fundamentals are gaining attention as potential alternatives. Lightchain AI has already raised over $17.9 million at a presale price of $0.007 , positioning itself as a high-growth AI-powered blockchain asset. As investors seek opportunities beyond traditional meme coins, newer tokens with innovative use cases may reach key price milestones before DOGE. This article explores whether Dogecoin can hit $2 or if another crypto will achieve it first. Dogecoin’s Bullish Momentum and Community Support One of the strongest aspects of Dogecoin (DOGE) is its very active community and the continued growth in the market, which leads to sudden rises. In these few years, DOGE has been able to maintain the upswings during bull trends notwithstanding the fact that that is frequently based on attracting people from social media platforms, celebrities or getting a place on the major exchanges list. Thus, its supporters can effectively increase trading volume and as a result, it is one of the most lasting meme coins in the market. Nevertheless, it is the major issue of the large circulation S1of DOGE that the price spikes result in that challenges the issue of long-term growth. Positive attitudes can remain in the case when $2 would be expected with the help of an inflow of money, whole market support and, therefore, the need for broader market momentum. It is uncertain whether its tribe-inspired vigor is strong enough to lift DOGE to uncharted territories or if investors will choose coins with better fundamentals and lower market capitalization. Could Lightchain AI Overtake DOGE in the Race to $2? Lightchain AI is rapidly emerging as a strong competitor in the crypto market, raising the question of whether it could reach $2 before Dogecoin (DOGE). While DOGE has an established community and historical price surges, its large supply makes substantial price increases challenging. In contrast, Lightchain AI’s AI-powered blockchain model is attracting investors looking for innovation and real-world utility. With growing adoption and increasing interest in AI-driven cryptocurrencies, Lightchain AI has the potential to see faster price appreciation due to its lower market cap and strong fundamentals. Unlike DOGE, which relies heavily on social media-driven hype, Lightchain AI offers practical applications that could sustain long-term growth. As investors explore alternatives beyond meme coins, Lightchain AI’s momentum could position it as a leading candidate to hit $2 before Dogecoin. Which Will Reach $2 First, DOGE or Lightchain AI? The race to $2 between Dogecoin (DOGE) and Lightchain AI presents two very different investment narratives. DOGE, backed by a strong community and historical price surges, relies heavily on market sentiment and social media-driven hype. However, its large circulating supply makes a rapid move to $2 difficult without significant institutional backing. On the other hand, Lightchain AI, an emerging AI-powered blockchain project, is gaining traction due to its real-world utility and growing adoption. With increasing interest in AI-integrated cryptocurrencies, Lightchain AI’s lower market cap gives it the potential for faster price appreciation compared to DOGE. While Dogecoin remains a popular choice among retail investors, Lightchain AI’s innovative approach and strong fundamentals may give it a competitive edge in reaching the $2 milestone first. The coming months will determine which asset prevails. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-21 03:00:00

Per the South Korean media outlets Jeju Sori and Newsis , the a branch of the Jeju District Court, on the island province of Jeju, rejected an appeal from the teacher – unnamed and aged in their 30s. South Korean Teacher Jailed for Two Years The court ordered the teacher to serve two years in jail, after hearing they had stolen 80 million won ($54,500) and spent most of the money on unnamed cryptoassets. The headquarters of the Jeju Provincial Police agency in Jeju, South Korea. (Source: Yonhap News TV/Screenshot) The court heard that the teacher “embezzled” the money from students and their parents, as well as “fraudulently selling second-hand goods” in an “online scam” worth approximately 7 million won ($4,770). The court dismissed the defendant’s appeal, noting that the judge in the teacher’s previous trial had already “taken the defendant’s remorse into account.” The teacher’s legal team had also argued that the defendant had “paid back” part of the money stolen from the students. But the appellate court said there was “no reason to take this into consideration in sentencing,” as the original court verdict, in November last year, had already done so.

The court heard that the defendant worked as a teacher at a high school in Jeju, where they began stealing money in March last year. The prosecution explained that the teacher had discovered that some of their students had “financial problems.” The teacher then deceived the students by saying that they would resolve these problems, taking funds from students and their parents alike.

The court further heard that the teacher also borrowed about $4,000 from “acquaintances and other people.” The teacher also failed to pay back these loans, the prosecution added. The court also heard that the teacher spent “most of the proceeds of their crimes” on crypto investments. Crypto-related crimes have dominated news headlines in Jeju this year .

This comes just weeks after President Trump teamed up with Elon Musk to cut government agencies, which led to thousands of USAID job losses and the elimination of most foreign aid contracts. According to Politico , Trump wants to shrink USAID and focus it on global health, food security, disaster response, and countering China. The proposal argues that current development programs are “inefficient and fragmented,” spread too thin across too many sectors and countries, which leads to poor results. Trump To Rebuild Under His Image Trump’s plan aims to focus on areas crucial to U.S. interests, like promoting peace, stability, and economic opportunities that benefit American businesses. It also targets global threats, such as pandemics. The proposal suggests that all aid programs should have clear end dates and be closely measured for success. After significantly reducing the 60-year-old agency, Trump aims to rebuild it under his image. Agency To Leverage Blockchain Tech According to a memo circulating among State Department staff and reviewed by WIRED, the Trump administration plans to rename the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as US International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA), and to bring it directly under the secretary of state. The document states that as part of its reorganization, the agency will “leverage blockchain technology” as part of its procurement process. The agency will use blockchain technology to improve security, transparency, and traceability in its aid distribution. However, it’s unclear whether this will involve cryptocurrency, stablecoins, or simply using blockchain to track aid. The memo comes as USAID staff are uncertain about the agency’s future. USAID was a major target of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk. After President Trump’s inauguration, the State Department placed all USAID staff on administrative leave, cut the workforce, and halted some payments to global partners, including those providing lifesaving aid. Is It Unnecessary? According to Linda Raftree, a consultant helping humanitarian groups adopt new tech, few blockchain projects have succeeded in the sector because the technology is often unnecessary. “It feels like a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist,” she says, noting that in most cases, existing tools could do the job just as well. Besides, Giulio Coppi from Access Now says blockchain offers no clear advantages over other tools like payment systems, and its promotion as a “tech solution” has shown little real impact. Critics Argue Over Flexibility However, Blockchain technology has seen some success in the humanitarian sector, such as the UNHCR’s pilot project providing stablecoins to Ukrainians and trials by the Kenya Red Cross. While blockchain can make money transfers faster and easier, it also introduces new burdens for small NGOs. The proposed adoption of blockchain at USAID aims to tie funding to results, but some employees argue this approach may not be flexible enough in disaster or conflict zones. Critics, like Linda Raftree, feel this push supports claims of corruption within USAID, even though the agency already pays based on completed work.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|REGULATION|ASIA|DOGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-21 03:24:40

The impersonation scam involves the fraudsters sending out messages through text and encrypted messaging platforms by impersonating a Binance representative, telling users of a crypto account breach and instructing them to set up a new wallet, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) said in a March 21 statement. The text messages look real at first glance because they appear in the same legitimate text message thread as Binance communications. Australia’s federal police say they have found at least 130 people who have been targeted by this scam so far. Source: Australian federal police “The messages allegedly contained fake verification codes and were often ‘spoofed,' meaning they appeared in a legitimate existing message thread from the well-known cryptocurrency exchange,” the AFP said. “A support phone number was also sent, but when the targets called it, they were instructed to protect their accounts by transferring their cryptocurrency to a ‘trust wallet,' which was controlled by the scammer and allowed the assets to be stolen.” Online text messaging services allow messages to be sent from a Sender ID, such as a company name, rather than a phone number and can be exploited to spoof text messages, according to a March 1, 2019 report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Once a phone receives the sham communication, it’s reportedly grouped based on the Sender ID, appearing in the same thread as other messages with the same ID. The AFP says it conducted an email and text blitz to warn the 130 people they identified who might have been exposed to this scam. AFP Commander Cybercrime Operations Graeme Marshall said once the funds are transferred to the thief’s wallet , they are quickly transferred through a network of wallets, making seizure or recovery difficult. The attack mimics another string of scam messages reported by X users on March 14 , where fraudulent emails spoofing Coinbase and Gemini attempted to trick users into setting up a new wallet using pre-generated recovery phrases controlled by scammers. Related: Australia’s ‘Barefoot Investor’ takes on crypto scammers stealing his likeness The police said red flags for this type of scam include unsolicited contact from someone claiming to be from Binance about an account breach, pressure to act quickly and prompts for a seed phrase . Binance Chief Security Officer Jimmy Su said in the AFP statement scammers often impersonate trusted platforms , exploiting certain telecom loopholes to manipulate sender names and phone numbers. Su says Binance has a tool to confirm official Binance channels, and if in doubt, “stop and verify through official sources,” such as the contact information on the official website. Source: Binance Australia In December last year, the Australian government announced plans for an SMS Sender ID Register and an enforceable industry standard to crack down on similar scams, which have impacted Australian airline Qantas and tech giant Apple in the past. Under the standard, telecom companies must determine whether messages sent under a brand name correspond with the legitimate registered sender and submit and provide their legitimate Sender IDs for the register. The register is set to launch in late 2025, with a pilot SMS Sender ID Register operating as a stopgap in the meantime, according to Australia’s minister for communications, Michelle Rowland. In August last year, the AFP revealed that a total of 382 million Australian dollars ($269 million) had been lost by Australians to investment scams during the previous 12 months, with around 47% of them being crypto-related.

This hearing is happening in Washington, and if confirmed, Atkins would replace Mark Uyeda, who’s been holding the seat in an acting capacity since January. Atkins previously served as an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008. After his time at the agency, he founded Patomak Global Partners, a consulting firm based in Washington, D.C. His return to the SEC comes at a time when the agency is already in the middle of major changes, many of which affect the crypto industry. If confirmed, Atkins is expected to pull back enforcement actions and make it easier for private companies to go public. Senate to review crypto-related nominees alongside Atkins The confirmation hearing won’t just be about Atkins. The Senate panel is also reviewing Jonathan Gould, a partner at Jones Day, who is being nominated to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Gould previously worked as chief counsel and senior deputy comptroller at the OCC before joining the law firm. The committee will also consider Luke Pettit, who has been nominated to be the assistant secretary for financial institutions at the U.S. Treasury Department. The focus is mainly on Atkins because of the SEC’s new direction, especially when it comes to crypto. Acting chair Uyeda has already rolled out a number of changes this year while Atkins waits for confirmation. Since January, the SEC has dropped more than 10 crypto-enforcement cases, including ones involving Kraken, Gemini, Robinhood, and TRON. The agency has also ended litigation tied to climate-reporting rules and allowed companies to easily block shareholder proposals they don’t like. Another big update came this week when the SEC stopped pursuing its appeal in the lawsuit against Ripple. The case has dragged on for four years and three months, according to Brad Garlinghouse, the company’s CEO. He said on Wednesday during the Digital Assets Summit in New York, “It’s been almost four years and about three months since the SEC originally sued us, certainly a painful journey in lots of ways.” He added, “I really deeply believed that we were going to be on the right side of the law and on the right side of history.” Garlinghouse didn’t hold back. He told the crowd, “The system just feels broken. That we had to fight this fight for the industry and you had an SEC attacking the industry, particularly the Ripple case. There were no victims, there was no investor loss. They were just not acting in good faith.” After the announcement, XRP spiked 10%, bringing the price to $2.49. This is the latest in a string of enforcement rollbacks by the SEC in 2025. None of the companies involved—Kraken, Gemini, Robinhood, or TRON—had to pay penalties in the dropped cases. Also on Thursday, the SEC publicly confirmed that Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining does not fall under U.S. securities laws. That applies to activity on networks like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance issued a formal clarification saying that PoW mining doesn’t meet the Howey Test, meaning it’s not considered an investment contract and doesn’t require registration under the Securities Act. The clarification only applies to public blockchain networks and only to mining-related activities. The commission stated that individuals and mining pools don’t need to register any transactions connected to mining. This move gives miners legal clarity for the first time and removes the fear of being hit with securities violations just for operating rigs. This news came after the SEC confirmed that memecoins do not count as securities. That stance, combined with the dismissal of crypto-related enforcement cases and the latest confirmation on PoW mining, signals a full 180 on how the SEC is handling crypto under Uyeda—and potentially under Atkins, too. If the Senate confirms Atkins, he’s expected to continue this path. That includes cutting back enforcement, making IPO approvals faster, and writing clear rules for crypto instead of just suing companies. Every action this year points to a lighter, rule-based approach, not the old strategy of regulation through lawsuits. With Atkins’ background in financial consulting, his time at the SEC and the fact that he’s been a Bitcoin investor since 2011, he’s seen as someone who understands how the agency works from the inside. But this time, his job won’t be to keep it running. It’ll be to change it—and fast. The Senate hearing on March 27 will determine whether that plan moves forward.

It’s built on blockchain technology, offering a decentralized alternative to TradFi (traditional financial) services. From lending and borrowing to DEXs (decentralized exchanges) and yield farming, DeFi aims to democratize finance, making it more accessible, efficient and transparent. In this guest post, we’ll explore what DeFi is, the key innovations driving its growth, the challenges it faces and what the future holds for the DeFi ecosystem. What is DeFi DeFi refers to a set of financial services built on blockchain platforms, particularly Ethereum , which operate without the need for traditional intermediaries like banks, brokers or payment processors. These services are powered by smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code and are accessible to anyone with an internet connection. DeFi includes applications such as the following. Lending and borrowing platforms – Where users can earn interest by lending their cryptocurrency and borrowing at competitive rates DEXs – Where users can trade cryptocurrencies directly without the need for intermediaries Stablecoins – Cryptocurrencies that are pegged to stable assets like the US Dollar, providing stability in the volatile world of crypto Yield farming – T he process of earning rewards by providing liquidity to DEXs or other platforms. Unlike traditional finance, DeFi platforms are open to everyone, eliminating the need for intermediaries, which reduces costs and increases access to financial services for millions of people worldwide. The key innovations behind DeFi Several key innovations are driving the growth of DeFi and are likely to define its future. 1. Smart contracts Smart contracts are the backbone of DeFi. These contracts automatically execute, enforce or verify the terms of a contract when predefined conditions are met, removing the need for a trusted intermediary. They allow financial agreements to be executed with complete transparency and security, without relying on banks or financial institutions. Smart contracts have enabled the rise of decentralized lending, borrowing and automated market-making. 2. Liquidity pools Liquidity pools are essential to the functioning of decentralized exchanges. They allow users to collect their tokens into a pool and earn a share of the trading fees in return. This decentralized method of creating liquidity has greatly improved the accessibility and functionality of DEXs, ensuring that users can trade assets without waiting for buyers or sellers. 3. DAOs (Decentralized autonomous organizations) DAOs are governance structures that enable the decentralized management of DeFi protocols. Through DAOs, token holders can vote on important decisions, including protocol upgrades, fee structures and treasury management. This innovative approach ensures that decisions are made collectively and transparently – in line with the interests of the community. 4. Stablecoins Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to a stable asset, such as the US Dollar or gold, to maintain a stable value. They address one of the main concerns about cryptocurrencies – their volatility. By using stablecoins, users can store value, make transactions, and interact with DeFi protocols while avoiding the price fluctuations of typical cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The challenges faced by DeFi While DeFi has immense potential, it’s not without its challenges. Here are some key obstacles it faces. 1. Security risks DeFi protocols are primarily driven by smart contracts, and while these contracts are designed to be secure, vulnerabilities can still be exploited. High-profile hacks and bugs in code have resulted in the loss of millions of dollars in user funds. This makes the space risky, especially for newcomers who may not fully understand the technical nuances. 2. Regulatory uncertainty Since DeFi operates outside traditional financial institutions, it faces regulatory challenges. Governments around the world are still grappling with how to regulate DeFi activities, such as lending, borrowing and trading, especially given the cross-border nature of the ecosystem. The regulatory environment will likely evolve, and how regulators approach DeFi could have a significant impact on its future growth. 3. Scalability issues Currently, many DeFi applications run on the Ethereum blockchain, which, while highly secure, is often criticized for being slow and expensive, especially during periods of high demand. While Ethereum 2.0 aims to address these issues by shifting to a PoS (proof-of-stake) consensus mechanism, scalability remains a critical challenge that will need to be addressed for DeFi to achieve widespread adoption. The future of DeFi The future of DeFi is incredibly promising, and several key developments are likely to shape its evolution. 1. Interoperability between blockchains One of the biggest limitations of DeFi today is that most applications are confined to the Ethereum blockchain. However, interoperability between blockchains is improving, allowing DeFi protocols to expand across multiple networks, such as Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain and Avalanche. This will enable DeFi to grow in terms of both accessibility and liquidity. 2. Layer-two solutions To address scalability issues, layer-two solutions such as Optimism, Arbitrum and Polygon are already helping to scale DeFi by providing faster and cheaper transactions while still relying on the security of the Ethereum network. As these solutions mature, we can expect DeFi applications to become more efficient, leading to greater adoption. 3. Institutional participation As DeFi continues to grow, we can expect more institutional players to enter the space. Institutional investors, hedge funds and traditional financial institutions are already exploring DeFi as an alternative investment and lending vehicle. This could bring a wave of new capital into the space, further accelerating growth. 4. Improved security protocols As the DeFi space matures, security will become even more critical. Developers and security experts will work on improving the security of smart contracts and creating more robust auditing and monitoring tools to prevent hacks and fraud. Increased collaboration with cybersecurity firms will be essential for building trust in DeFi. Conclusion The rise of DeFi has opened up new possibilities for users to take control of their financial assets without relying on centralized intermediaries. With innovations like smart contracts, liquidity pools and stablecoins, DeFi is poised to revolutionize traditional financial systems. However, challenges such as security risks, regulatory uncertainty and scalability issues remain, and these must be addressed for DeFi to reach its full potential. The future of DeFi looks bright, with greater interoperability, institutional participation and improved security protocols on the horizon. As the space continues to evolve, the potential for DeFi to democratize finance and create a more inclusive financial ecosystem is immense. It’s an exciting time to be involved in the world of DeFi, and its impact on the financial sector will only continue to grow.

As of recent market data, Pi has lost more than 18% in the last 24 hours, raising concerns among investors. If PI fails to maintain its $0.95 support level, further declines could push the coin to as low as $0.87. On the other hand, a shift in sentiment could see it rise back to $1.34 and beyond, but bulls face a difficult challenge to regain momentum. Why is Pi Coin Falling? Several factors have contributed to Pi Coin’s sharp decline in value, and the situation has left investors scrambling for answers. Binance and Coinbase Listing Failures A factor behind Pi’s downfall is the delay in listing the coin on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Both platforms previously teased the possibility of listing PI, sparking speculation and optimism among investors. However, the failure of these listings to materialize has dampened sentiment, leading to a drop in demand for Pi Coin. The lack of official exchange listings has left many to question the coin’s future and viability in the broader market. Decreasing Supply and Deflationary Pressures Although Pi Network has not formally announced a coin burn, the supply of Pi is steadily shrinking. Several mechanisms have contributed to this decrease: Transaction Fees : Pi’s transaction fees are burned permanently, with over 528,671 PI tokens burned by early March at a rate of 3,000–4,000 tokens daily. While this may sound beneficial from a supply reduction perspective, the deflationary pressure has not been enough to offset the broader market sentiment surrounding the coin. Unverified Accounts : Tokens held by users who missed the Know Your Customer (KYC) deadline have been burned, further reducing the coin’s total supply. As of now, the circulating supply stands at approximately 6.8 billion PI tokens. These measures aim to address fake and abandoned accounts, but they have also intensified the perception of a decreasing supply. Investor Sentiment: FUD or a Genuine Concern? The drop in Pi Coin’s value has sparked widespread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the market. Sentiment has worsened by 80% within a single day, with some users even claiming “manipulation” and “panic” selling. Trading volume has decreased by 37%, signaling a reduction in market activity.",Short News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-21 03:46:11

This marks a 2.7% increase in the past week, slowly recovering from previous losses. While the broader market remains cautious, investors appear to now be closely monitoring whether BTC can sustain its upward trend or if further corrections are on the horizon.

Bitcoin Bullish Indicators Emerges Amid the ongoing Bitcoin price movement, CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan has provided insights into the current market structure. In a recent post titled “Past Bull Cycle vs. Current Market”, Dan examined the similarities between previous market cycles and the present conditions. He highlighted that while bear market phases often feel like prolonged downturns, they also present key accumulation opportunities. Dan explained that in past market cycles, significant stop-loss movements signaled major sell-offs, leading to prolonged bearish sentiment. However, in the current cycle, such massive liquidations have not occurred, and Bitcoin’s recent drop remains within the standard 30% correction range. He noted that while some fear the onset of a bear market, broader macroeconomic trends suggest that the bull cycle is still intact. “과거 상승사이클과 현재 시장” 암호화폐 시장의 하락사이클에서는 첫번째 지표처럼 엄청난 크기의 손절의 움직임이 여러번 나옵니다. 누가봐도 하락사이클로 인식이 되고 시장이 망했다는 생각이 들 정도가 됩니다. 그리고 그 최악의 구간은 약 1년간 지속됩니다. 하지만 그 최악의 구간에서… pic.twitter.com/eQvd7yA2rn — Crypto Dan (@DanCoinInvestor) March 20, 2025 The analyst further pointed out that short-term uncertainties, such as geopolitical tensions and trade disputes, may be influencing market sentiment. However, once these factors subside, the market could see a strong rally. The analyst noted: Uncertainty in the market is an unavoidable element that will always accompany the investment landscape. Therefore, we analyze and respond to the market while managing risk. Exchange Outflows Indicate Re-Accumulation Another CryptoQuant analyst, CryptoOnCain, provided additional insight by highlighting Bitcoin’s highest exchange outflow on a 90-day moving average since January 2023. This data suggests that Bitcoin is being withdrawn from exchanges at a rapid pace, a sign that investors could be accumulating BTC rather than preparing to sell. Historically, such significant outflows have preceded bullish moves, as reduced exchange supply tends to create upward pressure on price.

If this trend continues, it could indicate a shift toward stronger market confidence in BTC’s long-term potential.

42078795,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=697160,1742529635,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42078795.jpeg,Wall Street shifts focus overseas amid heightened Trump uncertainty,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-street-shifts-focus-overseas-trump/,"Wall Street investors are moving out of the U.S. fast in 2025, pouring money into international markets after Donald Trump’s latest trade and foreign policy chaos shook up investor confidence. U.S. markets are falling across the board while funds chase returns in countries most investors have stopped paying attention to. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) is up more than 7% this year, and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA), which tracks developed markets outside North America, has jumped over 11%. At the same time, all three major U.S. indexes are down. The Nasdaq Composite has fallen into correction territory. The S&P 500 briefly dropped into correction, too. The Russell 2000, which covers smaller U.S. companies, is almost in a bear market with a drop nearing 20% from its recent high. Investors started backing away from U.S. stocks as Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies bounced between threats and backpedals. That shook confidence in both consumers and businesses. The market saw it clearly. Big firms started warning clients that the U.S. was no longer the safest play. Citigroup, Bank of America, HSBC, and BCA pull back on U.S. bets Citigroup cut its U.S. stock rating from overweight to neutral earlier this month. Dirk Willer, one of their strategists, told clients, “The news flow from the U.S. economy is likely to undershoot the [rest of the world] in coming months, and at least tactically, U.S. exceptionalism is therefore unlikely to roar back.” That’s straight from their client note. Michael Hartnett at Bank of America had already warned in January that U.S. strength was topping out. He pointed to falling fiscal stimulus and a fading edge over other markets. HSBC and BCA Research also lowered their views on the U.S. around the same time. Nobody’s calling it safe anymore. Jeremy Folsom, an analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, broke it down in a research note this week. “While U.S. stocks have performed well in recent history, investors who remain concentrated within just a single market may leave their portfolios vulnerable to country-specific risks, such as shifts in political regimes and other idiosyncratic factors,” he wrote. Jeremy added, “We have encouraged investors to remain invested in developed market (DM) equities, given the attractive valuations, and emerging market (EM) equities, for potential growth. We believe that both can help to provide diversification to portfolios.” Germany rallies as Trump threatens NATO, and China jumps on defense boost Investors aren’t just running from the U.S. They’re finding reasons to go long in places like Germany and China. Germany’s DAX index is up more than 15% in 2025. That came after the German government approved new spending on infrastructure and defense. Why? Because Trump signaled that he might pull back U.S. support for NATO. According to NBC News, the Trump administration is considering stepping away from NATO command, a role the U.S. has held since Eisenhower. That kind of move has major consequences, and investors are watching every headline. With Germany approving more military and public spending, investors think the country could finally break out of its long slump. Germany just barely avoided recession in 2023 and 2024. The country’s move to spend more has started lifting market sentiment. The STOXX Europe 600, which tracks European stocks more broadly, is also up about 9% this year, mostly thanks to the rally in Germany. Trevor Yates at Global X said this will likely reach more parts of the economy. “I think it’ll have kind of a trickle-down effect on the rest of the economy and then different sectors as well. It will affect consumers, I think, down the line as well, just given how much pressure they’ve been over the past couple years.” Trevor also said Global X is telling investors to look at group-based strategies like ETFs because “the whole economy should see these benefits.” Over in China, stocks are soaring even faster. The iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) has gained around 21% in 2025. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI) is up more than 22%. Investors are coming back after Beijing approved a 7.2% increase in defense spending to “firmly safeguard” national security. The rally also got a push from rising interest in DeepSeek, which helped bring investors back to Chinese tech and innovation. The possible return of Trump tariffs has added fuel to these global markets. Investors don’t think the tariffs are just a bluff this time. They’re starting to act like real policy. That means the trade system could be changing fast. And Wall Street is not waiting around to find out how bad it gets. Analysts warn of deeper realignment if U.S. economy stumbles Katie Stockton at Fairlead Strategies said international stocks could keep outperforming the U.S. this year. “We do think that international markets have the potential to do better than the U.S. for much of this year,” Katie said. “That doesn’t mean they’re buys right here and now, but perhaps somewhere, people might want to build some relative exposure into the next downdraft and develop global Europe versus US.” Dario Perkins at TS Lombard wrote a note titled “Is the U.S. now uninvestable.” That’s the tone right now. Dario wrote, “Three months ago, investors were convinced that Trump 2.0 would make a bad situation in Europe and China even worse. Instead, Trump has become a catalyst for big policy changes.” He said both Germany and China had already responded and more countries would follow. “It is still early days, and there may be setbacks, but these policy shifts could mark the start of a major realignment in international trade and a genuine rebalancing of global demand.” But he ended with a warning: “Make no mistake – a US recession would bring down the entire world.” That’s where things stand. Trump’s policies are causing global money to move. Countries that used to get ignored are now pulling in capital. This isn’t some short-term strategy. It’s the result of economic data, policy moves, and hard numbers. No one’s calling the U.S. uninvestable yet, but they’re clearly not betting on it anymore. And if Trump keeps pushing on trade and defense, expect the money to keep flowing out. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The SEC has decided not to pursue further legal action, confirming that Ripple is no longer under threat from the regulatory body. This decision has had an immediate impact on XRP’s price, which surged following the announcement. The legal saga, which began with the SEC’s claim that Ripple violated securities laws by selling XRP, has been a major point of contention in the cryptocurrency space. Despite a series of favorable rulings for Ripple, the SEC continued to appeal in January 2024, even after the resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. The ongoing legal challenges frustrated Ripple and its supporters, especially since the court had already ruled in Ripple’s favor, declaring that XRP is not a security. Where Is The Official SEC Statement? While Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC seems to have come to an end, some are still waiting for the official word from the SEC itself. A user raised a valid point, questioning why there hasn’t been an official statement yet from the SEC about dropping the appeal against Ripple. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett responded, explaining that the SEC still needs to formally approve the withdrawal of its appeal. Once the Commission gives the green light, they can expect a press release similar to the one issued earlier this year when the SEC dismissed its lawsuit against Coinbase. https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1902806790254817454 Terrett added that the SEC typically addresses matters of litigation and enforcement during their closed meetings. The dismissal of the Ripple case will likely be discussed at one of these meetings, which is scheduled for next Thursday.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|SPONSORED|XRP|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-21 04:01:52
