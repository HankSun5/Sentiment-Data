However, Hayes cautioned that while BTC may have bottomed, stock markets could face more pain ahead. BTC Bottomed At $77,000? Hayes Thinks So Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes recently took to X to declare that BTC may have likely bottomed at $77,000. The acclaimed crypto market commentator referred to the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) latest remarks signaling the end of quantitative tightening (QT). Hayes remarked: JAYPOW delivered, QT basically over Apr 1. The next thing we need to get bulled up for realz is either SLR exemption and or a restart of QE. Was BTC $77K the bottom, prob. But stonks prob have more pain left to fully convert Jay to team Trump so stay nimble and cashed up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Needs Weekly Close Above This Level To Confirm Market Bottom, Analyst Says For the uninitiated, QT is one of the Fed’s monetary policies aimed at reducing the money supply by selling off assets like government bonds or letting them mature without reinvesting. While this helps control inflation, it can also lead to higher interest rates and slower economic growth. The Fed began its most recent QT cycle nearly three years ago in June 2022 to combat high inflation resulting from COVID-era economic stimulus. Now that inflation appears to be easing, the Fed has little reason to continue QT. Yesterday, the Fed announced that from April 1 onwards, it will slow the pace of its balance sheet drawdown. Such a shift in monetary policy is likely to benefit risk-on assets like BTC and stocks. As stated in his X post, Hayes emphasized that the next potential bullish catalysts could be either a Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption or the start of quantitative easing (QE). To explain, the SLR exemption temporarily allowed banks to exclude certain assets, like US Treasuries and central bank reserves, from their leverage calculations to encourage lending and support financial markets during crises. Similarly, QE is a monetary policy through which the Fed increases the money supply in the economy, potentially benefiting high-risk assets like BTC. Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff Jirlin echoed Hayes’ sentiments, stating that an end to QT from April onwards would be “great for both crypto and equity markets.” Jirlin added that the current monetary policy is the tightest he has observed since 2010. Bitcoin Not Out Of The Woods Yet While market optimism has increased following the Fed’s recent comments, the premier cryptocurrency is not fully out of the woods yet. For instance, BTC recently broke down through a 12-year trend line against gold, raising fears of heightened economic uncertainty in the near term.

Martinez tells his 133,500 followers on the social media platform X that if XRP ( XRP ) falls below $2, it risks witnessing a deeper drawdown due to a lack of consolidation below the price level. “XRP testing the waters! Below $2, a gap with no significant support could pull it to $1.60.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on a chart citing on-chain data from blockchain analytics platform Glassnode, it appears that there’s an “air gap” between $2 and $1.60, indicating a weak foundation for XRP around that price zone. XRP is trading at $2.56 at time of writing. Next up is the layer-1 protocol Solana ( SOL ). According to Martinez, SOL is facing a “big test” at a resistance level a few percentage points above the current price. “$135 stands as the most important resistance.” Source: Ali Martinez/X The widely followed analyst further says that investors in the sixth-largest crypto asset by market cap are capitulating based on the altcoin’s net unrealized profit/loss metric (NUPL), an on-chain indicator that measures whether accumulators of a coin are in a state of profit or loss. Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on the trader’s chart, SOL’s NUPL is hovering below the zero line, indicating that investors are witnessing losses and in the midst of capitulation. Solana is trading at $132 at time of writing, down by around 55% from the all-time high price of $293 reached January 20th. Looking at the top memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Martinez says that the altcoin has recorded significant demand in a week. “Whale alert! Over 110 million Dogecoin bought up in a week. Big players are betting on a breakout.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Dogecoin is trading at $0.173 at time of writing.

According to people familiar with the matter, Tim Cook decided to overhaul leadership in the firm’s AI divisions after losing confidence that AI chief John Giannandrea was the right person to lead important product innovations. Vision Pro architect Mike Rockwell takes over Siri In a notable development, Cook has directed the creation of Siri, Apple’s virtual assistant, under Mike Rockwell, who had previously overseen work on Vision Pro. This decision is the latest sign that the tech needs to urgently remake its AI strategy, following criticism that the company is falling behind rivals. Rockwell will now report to Craig Federighi, the software chief, in a move that removes Siri from Giannandrea’s controls. The changes are expected to be made public to employees this week. Apple’s top brass, aka the “Top 100,” met at the company’s secretive annual offsite summit recently to debate the company’s future, and AI was at the center of those discussions. The move reflects the mounting pressure on the tech firm to provide AI-powered innovations that can rival those from industry leaders. Despite AI being a major marketing point of the iPhone 16, Apple’s AI has been widely criticized for being underwhelming. Then there’s the new Apple Intelligence platform, which will launch later than expected and, when it does, is unlikely to attract consumers’ attention. Siri’s long-anticipated improvements, including deeper integration with users’ data for more customized responses, have also repeatedly fallen behind schedule. Apple had hyped these new Siri features for months, trying to stimulate sales of the iPhone 16, but the technology still wasn’t ready. The company was even forced to announce additional delays earlier this month, causing internal frustration. The Apple executive Robby Walker, who led Siri, reportedly described the delays as “ugly” in a recent team meeting, saying there was widespread disappointment among staff. Apple’s trouble with AI coincides with a wider downturn in tech stocks; its shares have slid 14% this year. On Thursday, the company’s stock fell less than 1% to $214.62 in midday trading in New York. Why Apple is betting on Rockwell Rockwell, who serves as the vice president of Apple’s Vision Products Group (VPG), has been recognized as a problem solver and a proponent of groundbreaking technology. He was a key figure in the creation of the Vision Pro headset, which, while a technological marvel, has not yet found commercial success. He is Apple’s first such hire, and his appointment represents a shift in the company’s strategy toward AI. Rockwell, unlike Giannandrea, is not a former Google executive with long-standing knowledge of the AI research field; he has no background in heading up AI teams. However, Apple is increasingly presenting Vision Pro and other hardware innovations as “AI products,” indicating a strategy that emphasizes the part of AI that specifies hardware rather than simply innovations based on software. As Rockwell steps up to his new position, Paul Meade—previously leading Vision Pro’s hardware engineering—will take over management of the Vision Products Group going forward. Apple reshapes Siri leadership amid AI push Since its launch in 2011, Siri has suffered a long-running series of engineering and performance problems. After all, the digital assistant has had so many leaders throughout the years, from Scott Forstall, who headed its software, to Eddy Cue, who ran services, to Federighi and Giannandrea in 2018. Now, with Rockwell in charge and Federighi once again overseeing the division, Apple is looking for a fresh start. Giannandrea is still at Apple, but his focus is shifting away from Siri’s day-to-day operations. He’ll continue to lead research and other AI-focused efforts at Meta, including a robotics-centric team. However, the tech firm’s hesitance to lose Giannandrea indicates an intention to be consistent as it reorganizes its AI division. Apple has been preparing for this leadership transition for months. For example, he’s worked on using analytics to help develop what he’s built at Apple. Last year, the company hired a veteran who’d successfully executed complex development projects before—Kim Vorrath—to come help the Siri shop. More recently, a different Rockwell lieutenant, Aimee Nugent, was transferred to assess and assist the Siri group. Rockwell himself has been outspoken about Siri’s failings and called for a more personalized, intelligent assistant. Brad said that during the development of the Vision Pro, he had imagined Siri playing a central role in controlling the device, but those plans didn’t come to fruition at launch. With Apple Intelligence coming to the Vision Pro through a software update in April, Rockwell’s recent hands-on session with AI-powered technology could be decisive. As the tech firm seeks to reposition itself as a player in AI, the industry and investors will closely watch the success of his tenure. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The ETF would hold both PENGU and Pudgy Penguin nonfungible tokens (NFT), as well as other cryptocurrencies, such as SOL and ETH, that may be necessary to the purchase, sale or transfer of PENGU and the associated NFTs. Nashville, Tennessee-based Canary Capital filed an S-1 form with the SEC on March 20. This is the first proposed EFT that includes NFTs. The ETF will be structured as a trust that is expected to hold 80%-95% PENGU and 5%-15% NFTs. No custodian or exchange have been selected yet. First they released the NFT, then plushies and now an ETF There are 8,888 Pudgy Penguin NFTs that range in price on Open Seas from 9.86 ETH ($19,499 at the time of writing) to 9,000 ETH ($17.8 million), although all but three of the NFTs listed were selling for 500 ETH ($988,805) or less. According to the S-1, Canary Capital “will select which NFTs to purchase by considering factors such as price, relative rarity, perceived desirability of a particular NFTs traits and characteristics, and the overall collection value.” The Pudgy Penguins NFT collection was launched in July 2021 on Ethereum. In May 2023, Pudgy Penguins signed with the WME talent agency. Retailer Walmart (and later others) has carried a line of stuffed toys called plushies depicting the penguins since September. The PENGU token launched on Solana in December 2024 with an airdrop of 25.9% of the 88.89 billion tokens to NFT holders distributed according to the rarity of the holder’s NFTs, and other community members. It had an initial market cap of around $2.8 billion and traded on Binance , Bybit and OKX. Canary Capital has faith in altcoins and their ETFs Igloo, Canary Capital’s parent company, posted a statement on X, saying , in part, “We believe that Pudgy Penguins is the face of crypto, Representing innovation and the mass adoption of blockchain technology. Being included in this filing is a strong validation of that belief.” Canary Capital has been a pioneer in altcoin ETFs. It has filed documents with the SEC to create ETFs tracking Litecoin , Hedera , Solana , and XRP . PENGU “has very few identified use cases apart from a collector’s item, the S-1 noted. There is no guarantee that it will continue to gain in value, it added. The token opened at $0.00689 on March 20, hit a high for the day of $0.00732 at 4:00 p.m. GMT and sank to $0.00646 at the time of writing. Its all-time high of $0.0428 was reached on Jan.6, according to CoinGecko. It has a market cap of around $406 million and 24-hour trading volume of $161 million.

The announcement on the soon-to-be-defunct website stated that the company intends to shift its focus and explore new opportunities. The LG Art Lab platform will officially close on June 17, 2025. The enthusiasm surrounding non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has noticeably waned since its 2022 peak. Initially, NFTs were introduced as revolutionary assets in the digital art and collectibles space. However, the sector ran into challenges such as market oversaturation, declining value, and a decline in consumer interests over time, which led to reciprocal changes within the industry, including the closure of many NFT trading platforms. In January 2025, Quidd, an NFT marketplace under Animoca Brands, announced its closure. The platform ceased operations on January 3, 2025. MakersPlace , another digital art platform, also shut down its operations in early 2025 due to “ongoing market challenges” after six years of operation. Many NFT trading platforms were shut down as early as 2024. GameStop launched its NFT marketplace in July 2022, during the peak of NFT trading and decided to close down the platform in early 2024. The closure was influenced by declining trading volumes after the peak November 2022 period, company layoffs, and declining interest and demand for NFTs. LG Art Lab announces closure to its community Per an announcement made on the LG Art Lab’s website, users will be unable to make purchases on the platform starting on March 10. The company says the LG Art Lab team will automatically transfer users’ NFTs to their wallets by April 30 so that the pieces can be resold. The notice also states that collectors and artists can manually transfer their artworks from the NFT marketplace to their own wallets. “Please note that Ethereum minted NFTs can be resold in other platforms (e.g. Opensea),” the notice read. The notice did not cite any specific reason for the closure of the platform. Instead, it vaguely expressed the company’s intention to explore other business opportunities. “As the NFT space continues to evolve, we believe it is the right time to shift our focus and explore new opportunities,” it read. The platform will shut down completely on June 17, but customer support for Art Lab users will be available until July 18. “While this chapter is coming to an end, our passion for digital art and innovation remains strong, and we look forward to seeing how the NFT space continues to grow and evolve,” LG said. Rise of LG Art Lab Launched in September 2022, LG Art Lab was designed to integrate digital art into consumers’ living rooms. The platform allowed users to buy, sell, and display NFTs directly on their LG smart TVs. LG Art Lab debuted during the period when interest in NFTs was at an all-time high. The platform aimed to make digital art accessible to a larger audience. The platform operated on the Hedera blockchain and later expanded to Ethereum, offering a range of digital artworks. Prices of the NFTs offered by LG Art Lab varied significantly. Some pieces like the “Bloom” animation from Bryan Brinkman cost the equivalent of $59.82, while a piece from Amadon sold for almost $4,000. Users could complete transactions on LG Art Lab using LG Electronics’ cryptocurrency wallet app, Wallypto. This made the process of acquiring and displaying digital art easier. Art Lab was launched shortly after Samsung launched a similar NFT TV marketplace in partnership with Nifty Gateway. The Samsung NFT TV marketplace has outlasted the LG NFT marketplace as they are so far still operational. The NFT market has experienced fluctuations across the spectrum since its boom in the early 2020s, and many companies are recording investment losses. The Australian Open’s Artball program, which linked NFTs to specific plots on the tennis court, saw the value of its tokens plummet by up to 90% as the initiative lost momentum. The sector has experienced a general decline in interest, but some sectors, such as gaming and virtual real estate, continue to find value in NFTs.

Phase 3 is currently priced at $0.02, with the project just a step away from the next price increase, coupled with a lot of excitement for its upcoming exchange listing. While several DeFi cryptocurrencies like XRP focus on cross-border payments and others like Polygon develop layer-2 scaling solutions, MUtuum Finance (MUTM) built a disruptive new mechanism that combines decentralized lending mechanics with a self-sustaining buy pressure system. Analysts monitoring the token’s trajectory contend that it could upend market expectations, with utility-driven demand propelling it past established competitors. Presale Momentum Accelerating Investors scrambling to secure entry into the final run of Phase 3 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale before the $0.025 rise. Phase 4 price kicks in soon and has brought third phase capacity within striking distance. Those who participate now will see their token value appreciate by 25% with the next stage launch, and buying the projected launch price of $0.06 now translates into a 200% gain for early buyers. Initial listings from listings have forecast of breaching into $3.50 in the months after going live — 17,400% increase from the current phase. Such growth potential is largely a result of Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) structured tokenomics, integrating platform revenue into strategic buybacks, establishing cyclical demand to the platform that stabilizes and enhances the token’s market value. As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts attention, comparisons to XRP and Polygon fade. As XRP struggles with regulatory greyness and Polygon with saturation of scalability, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is delivering real financial utility through its overcollateralized lending platform. Borrowers gain liquidity by collateralizing their assets and locking them in the pool by overcollateralizing their loan value while lenders earn dynamic variable interest rates applied to pool utilization. This creates a balance that entices players of all risk profiles from risk-averse to yield-seeking investors, and will cultivate an environment in which the token demand grows with the user adoption. The Tokenomics Driving Long-term Demand At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s charms is the buy-and-distribute business model that redistributes a share of platform fees back to the open markets when tokens are bought back from them. These tokens are then distributed to whoever staked the token, which incentivizes long term holding and reduces sell pressure. At the same time, users become able to deposit assets like ETH or DAI into our system to create mtTokens—yield-generating representations of their deposits which are transferable. These not only improve liquidity but also bring Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into the larger DeFi ecosystem, allowing for greater usage beyond just native platforms. As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ramps up towards exchange listing, the engineering team has smart contract audit initiated with industry leader Certik, a major achievement set to further cement investor confidence. The results will be reported through official channels when finalized, in accordance with the project’s commitment to transparency. Further solidifying the ecosystem’s stability and interoperability, the team also plans to introduce an overcollateralized stablecoin after launch. As Phase 3 allocations deplete, the opportunity to get MUTM at presale prices is closing in on both advantage and value. Those who get in on the ground floor set themselves up not just for near-term profits, but potentially exponential earnings as the platform’s user base grows. With a plan of crypto that diffuses away from speculative tokens to real-world utility and sustainable mechanics., Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a front-runner and ready to leapfrog the competition of both speculative tokens and Legacy Platforms. Seizing the Opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is born away from the true hype-driven cycles that seem to have plagued much of the crypto market. Combined with its presale, structured token burns, and rewards structures this one looks set for a lightning-fast rise. There is a level of immediate demand in something like MUTM that is very hard, if not impossible, to replicate, which is exactly why MUTM may represent the very rare intersection of innovation and immediacy that an investor looking for an asset rooted in functionality, rather than frenzy, would want to own. Get tokens now—before Phase 3 closes and prices rise.

The allegations were made by Wu Blockchain, a crypto news platform, when it shared a scoop on X (formerly Twitter) claiming that several projects paid huge intermediary fees to have their tokens listed on two of South Korea’s leading crypto exchanges, Upbit and Bithumb. According to Wu Blockchain, the fees were approximately $2 million and $10 million, respectively, and they were orchestrated by intermediaries related to Upbit’s shareholders and market makers. Some of the projects informed Wu Blockchain that they provided an intermediary fee ranging from 3% to 5% of the total token amount, before getting listed on Upbit successfully. The news platform also reported that this wasn’t the case with all the seven projects they reached out to. According to them, three of the projects reported that they didn’t pay any intermediary fee before they got listed. SCOOP: Several projects told WuBlockchain that they paid huge intermediary fees to have their tokens listed on South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Upbit and Bithumb. The fees were approximately US$10 million and US$2 million respectively. The intermediaries are… pic.twitter.com/PODtooUaYd — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 20, 2025 Upbit’s response and message to users In response to these allegations, Upbit denied the allegations in a press release addressed to its users, stating, “Upbit does not allow the involvement of external agencies to assist or intermediate trading support, and all procedures are conducted directly by Upbit employees.” The exchange also mentioned that it evaluates projects through a strict internal review process based on its trading support procedures and that it does not proceed with trading support under any financial compensation conditions. The exchange urged users and projects to avoid companies or individuals that approach them for intermediary fees, claiming that they are illegal brokers and unrelated to Upbit. The exchange also requested that Wu Blockchain share with them the list of digital assets listed on their platform that paid such intermediary fees as well as concrete evidence and supporting materials backing up the claim as they are setting up an investigation into the matter. Upbit also asked users to report cases of intermediary interference in its press statement. In response to the request, Wu Blockchain mentioned that it couldn’t disclose that information as it has to protect its source. Upbit’s battles with regulators Upbit recently had a run-in with South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which accused the platform of KYC violations numbering thousands. The regulator also discovered that Upbit facilitated transactions with unregistered foreign service providers, which violates South Korea’s specific Financial Information Act. All these violations led to the regulators sanctioning the platform on February 25, 2025, placing a ban on the platform’s ability to onboard new users. New users on the platform won’t be able to deposit or perform withdrawals from March 7 until June 6. The parent company of Upbit, Dunamu, has appealed the move and is working on overturning the decision. In a move that signified that the company may be actively working to be on the right side of the law, the platform announced earlier today that it will be revealing six companies suspected of engaging in Ponzi fraud via the platform and will be limiting the withdrawal of asset to the companies in accordance the Enforcement Decree of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act of South Korea. In its concluding post on X, Wu Blockchain urged the South Korean regulators to look into the matter, especially regarding the market markers. Given Upbit’s current progress, if these intermediary fee and market marker allegations turn out to be true, it will be a major setback for the platform. This would bring back more scrutiny on the platform which may be seeing itself pay out millions of dollars in fines due to previous violations. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Among the latest entrants, Arctic Pablo Coin shines as the Best meme coin to buy thanks to its innovative features and high-potential presale opportunities. Meanwhile, established meme coins like Sudeng and Toshi continue to make notable strides in the market, drawing increased investor interest. This article explores the latest developments surrounding these three coins, with a particular emphasis on Arctic Pablo Coin’s cutting-edge approach and the excitement surrounding its presale phase. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Mechanism: Enhancing Scarcity and Value Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) distinguishes itself through a strategic deflationary mechanism designed to enhance token scarcity and, consequently, value. During its presale, any unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation every week. Additionally, tokens remaining after the presale’s conclusion are also burned, fostering a deflationary environment that benefits investors by potentially increasing the value of their holdings over time. These token burn transactions are meticulously recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and trust within the community. This strategic mechanism further reinforces why Arctic Pablo Coin shines as the Best meme coin to buy as its controlled supply and growing demand create a strong investment case. With each burning event reducing the circulating supply, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as a promising asset in the competitive meme coin market. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: Seize the Opportunity at Nippy Nook The meme coin presale has reached an exhilarating milestone known as Nippy Nook, marking the 15th phase of its journey. Currently, APC is available for $0.000079 per token. Early investors have the potential to experience a remarkable return on investment (ROI) exceeding 10,027.85% as the price progresses from Nippy Nook to the anticipated launch price of $0.008. To illustrate, an investment of $100 today would secure approximately 1,265,686 APC tokens, which could grow to a value of $10,125.49 upon listing at $0.008. The presale has already raised over $1.95 million, reflecting strong community support and investor confidence. As Arctic Pablo Coin advances through its presale phases, the token price is set to increase, making the current phase an opportune moment for potential investors to join at a favorable entry point. Sudeng Coin: A Rising Contender in the Meme Coin Market Sudeng Coin (HIPPO) has been steadily gaining traction in the cryptocurrency market, drawing increased investor interest. Currently trading at approximately USD 0.004172, HIPPO boasts a 24-hour trading volume of $29,887,001, reflecting strong market activity. This consistent engagement highlights the growing confidence in Sudeng Coin’s potential. As meme coins continue to capture the attention of crypto enthusiasts, HIPPO stands out as a promising contender. With its active trading volume and expanding community, Sudeng Coin could present lucrative opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the ever-evolving meme coin world. Toshi Coin: A Growing Meme Coin Opportunity Toshi Coin (TOSHI) is currently trading at approximately USD 0.0003784, maintaining its position as a notable player in the meme coin sector. Despite limited recent updates, the token continues to attract interest from investors seeking high-growth opportunities in the crypto space. With meme coins gaining mainstream traction, Toshi Coin’s market presence and potential for price surges make it an intriguing option. As the broader cryptocurrency market evolves, TOSHI could benefit from increased adoption and speculative trading. Investors keeping an eye on emerging meme coins may find Toshi Coin to be a promising asset in their portfolio. Final Words: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Meme Coin Charge In the ever-evolving realm of meme coins, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) stands out with its innovative deflationary mechanism and the exciting opportunity presented by its presale phase, Nippy Nook. With a current price of $0.000079 and the potential for substantial returns, Arctic Pablo Coin is positioning itself as the best meme coin to buy for those seeking promising investment avenues. While Sudeng and Toshi continue to make their mark, the unique features and strategic approach of Arctic Pablo Coin make it a compelling choice for investors looking to capitalize on the dynamic cryptocurrency market.

This breakout brings renewed optimism, as analysts believe a stronghold above this level could trigger a rally toward higher prices. However, if ETH fails to maintain support above $2,000, a significant drop could follow, leading to further market instability. Related Reading: On-Chain Data Signals Key Test For Solana At $135 Level – Insights Macroeconomic uncertainty and trade war fears have continued to shake the crypto market, with Ethereum being one of the most affected assets. The recent price action reflects investor caution, as global financial conditions remain unpredictable. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that ETH is trading at a critical level that will determine its long-term direction in the coming weeks. Bulls must sustain momentum to solidify a bullish structure, while bears are watching for signs of weakness to drive prices lower. With ETH at a pivotal juncture, the next few trading sessions could be decisive for its trajectory. Ethereum at a Crossroads: Breakout or Breakdown? Ethereum has lost over 57% of its value since mid-December, with bulls struggling to reclaim higher prices as selling pressure dominates the market. Despite occasional relief rallies, ETH has remained under key resistance levels, leaving investors uncertain about its next move. Speculation about a potential recovery and a continuation of the downtrend are colliding, as price action shows no clear direction. The $2,000 level has become the ultimate test for Ethereum. Bulls must defend this price with conviction to sustain any meaningful recovery. Losing this support could lead to a sharp decline, pushing ETH into deeper bearish territory. Jelle stated in his analysis that either ETH is about to put in a massive reclaim or it’s about to jump off a cliff. The $2,000 level is the key limit that will determine Ethereum’s next move. If bulls can maintain strength above this mark, a push toward $2,300 and beyond could follow. However, failure to hold $2,000 would signal further downside, with the next major support sitting around $1,750. Ethereum’s fate hangs in the balance, and the coming days will be crucial in deciding whether it regains bullish momentum or continues its descent. Related Reading: XRP Bulls Face A Big Test – Metrics Show $2.40 As The Most Critical Resistance Level Ethereum Battles to Hold $2,000: Key Levels to Watch Ethereum is currently trading at $1,980 after days of struggling below the crucial $2,000 mark. Bulls managed to briefly push the price above this level, but sustaining it is now the real challenge. Holding above $2,000 is critical for Ethereum’s recovery, as it would signal strength and open the door for a rally toward the $2,200 mark. The $2,200 level is the most important resistance for ETH to reclaim in order to confirm a bullish reversal. A successful break and consolidation above this point would indicate that bulls are regaining control, potentially leading to a move toward higher targets. However, if Ethereum fails to hold above $2,000, selling pressure could increase, leading to a deeper correction. A drop below this level could trigger a sharp decline, pushing ETH toward the $1,800 support zone. If this support fails, the next major liquidity level would be around $1,750, where buyers might step in to prevent further downside.

According to its website, Manifest, which is “coming soon,” will be backed by home equity investments (HEIs) and offer a tokenized ETF , $USH (U.S. Housing). Lopez added that Manifest is revolutionizing tokenization by using ETF-style diversification to U.S. real estate and structuring it into a smart contract available on transparent public blockchains. Unlike traditional ETFs available on a legacy exchange, $USH utilizes blockchain technology to boost liquidity, programmability, and global accessibility, providing a groundbreaking approach to acquiring real estate exposure. Manifest’s $USH offers a blockchain-powered alternative to traditional real estate ETFs Manifest Founder and CEO Nathaniel Sokoll-Ward said the announcement is crucial for ETF investors because they will soon have the option to invest in diversified U.S. real estate that is not tied to real estate investment trusts (REITs) or direct ownership. He added that instead of using a product like the Vanguard Real Estate ETF, which has assets predominantly made up of real estate rental businesses, investors will have “the option to gain capital-efficient, direct exposure to the dominant real estate asset class in the country: owner-occupied single-family residential real estate equity.” Manifest’s $USH marks a major advancement beyond traditional real estate ETFs. According to Sokoll-Ward, $USH integrates blockchain technology to improve liquidity, capital efficiency, and tax benefits. Unlike publicly traded REIT ETFs, which face stock market volatility, centralized management, limited trading hours, and high fees, $USH operates entirely on-chain and is backed by Home Equity Investments. He added that this structure “eliminates intermediaries, reduces fees, increases transparency and ensures that all assets are fully collateralized by real estate equity.” VanEck Ventures, which co-led Manifest’s $2.5 million pre-seed funding round with Lattice Fund, was launched by the fund giant last October. The $30 million early-stage fund marked VanEck’s expansion into venture capital and was created to invest in “visionary founders operating at the intersection of fintech, digital assets and artificial intelligence.” Tokenized real estate set for growth as blockchain reshapes the market According to Lopez, tokenized financial products like $USH represent the next evolution in asset management, introducing 24/7 liquidity, seamless global settlement, enhanced accessibility, and direct programmability. These features have driven growth in DeFi and stablecoins in recent years, areas where traditional ETFs fall short. Developers can now access these assets and build products that enable margin against them, a previously unavailable capability. As per Statista , real estate tokenization will likely emerge as a key segment in the broader tokenized asset market, accounting for around one-third of the total tokenized assets in the global market by 2030. This is a sign of the growing acceptance of blockchain technology in real estate, as it allows fractional ownership and better liquidity. About 12% of real estate companies reported using asset tokenization in 2023, reflecting an increasing trend in digital modes of investment. Conventional real estate investments are frequently plagued by liquidity constraints as such property transactions are slow and costly. Market liquidity was highlighted as a top challenge by 60% of respondents in a 2024 European real estate industry experts survey. Manifest’s $USH is an example of a blockchain-based ETF that leverages tokenization to become tradable 24/7, bring transaction costs down by reducing counterparty risk and improve accessibility through tokenized ownership.

42073358,https://coingape.com/?p=245157,1742521523,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Canary Capital Files for Pengu ETF With US SEC, PENGU Price To Soar?",https://coingape.com/canary-capital-files-for-pengu-etf-with-us-sec-pengu-price-to-soar/,"Canary Capital has submitted a registration filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the launch of the first-ever Pengu exchange-traded fund (ETF). This move adds to the growing list of crypto asset managers seeking regulatory approval for digital asset-based ETFs. According to the filing published on Thursday, the proposed ETF will invest in the PENGU token, which is the official token of the Pudgy Penguins NFT project, as well as in Pudgy Penguins NFTs themselves. The filing also states that the ETF will hold other digital assets, including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), to support trading and transfers. Canary Capital Files for Pengu ETF In the registration statement , the ETF is defined as an investment trust that invests in digital assets such as PENGU tokens and Pudgy Penguins NFTs, among others. Regarding these holdings, Canary Capital emphasized that these ones are critical for monitoring the token and the NFT assets. If launched, the ETF will allow investors to track the price of PENGU and other NFTs in its portfolio without owning or hosting them as physical assets. The trust may also contain other assets in the form of digital media for the buying and selling besides conversion and redemption of the fund. “Other non-security digital assets owned by the trust include SOL and ETH that may be necessary or incidental,” the filing added. The Pudgy Penguins project released the Ethereum-linked PENGU token in December. The project has been popular in the crypto sphere as a collection of NFT and social networking. Although PENGU was first developed on Ethereum, there is a growing sentiment that it can be regarded as a Solana meme coin since most of its trading activity transpire in Solana platforms. PENGU Market Reaction and Price Movement Following the ETF announcement, the PENGU token saw a sharp 10% price increase during early trading. It broke above previous resistance levels and moved past the Ichimoku cloud, indicating a possible shift in momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for PENGU moved from 44.86 to 62 shortly after the news, indicating increased buying activity. The RSI remains below the overbought level of 70, suggesting that further gains are still possible. Many of the analysts are now focusing on the $0.0093 as the next level of resistance backed by the Robinhood listing last week. A breakout above that level means the token will be trading above the $0.010 mark, the first time in a month. However, if the momentum disappears, the token may fall back to $ 0.0062 support area. Growing List of Crypto ETF Applications Canary Capital is not the only firm pursuing ETF approval for non-traditional digital assets. In recent months, several asset managers have submitted filings for altcoin ETFs , including ones focused on Dogecoin (DOGE), Sui, Hedera, and BONK. These filings followed the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs by the SEC in 2024. Despite the recent trend, the SEC has delayed decisions on many of these applications, especially those involving meme coins and smaller tokens. Some market participants have raised questions about whether ETFs for meme coins and NFTs will meet regulatory standards. “The likelihood of approval for these funds remains unclear due to high volatility and limited trading history,” a statement from the filing added. Mixed Reactions From the Crypto Community On Pengu ETF The ETF proposal has sparked different responses from traders and analysts online. Some have raised doubts about investor demand for a fund tied to a meme coin and NFT project that is less than six months old. Social media commentator @beast_ico wrote, “We don’t need ETFs for ghost chains, much less sub 6 month old memecoins.” Others noted that despite the ETF news, the price reaction was short-lived, and sustained momentum may depend on broader market trends. Industry observer Alex Krüger commented, “New ETFs for crypto assets have become an irrelevant joke,” citing weak asset inflows into recently launched funds.

The Trump appointee shared a video where he listed the agency’s discoveries and those that have been discontinued. In the footage Hegseth posted on his official X page, he announced his decision to sign a memo directing the termination of over $580 million in DOD contracts. Hegseth said this would only affect the brands that do not align with the priorities of “this president or the department.” “In other words, they are not a good use of taxpayer dollars,” he said, pointing out that taxpayers fund the department and are owed transparency and the right to know their money is being used well. Another round of @DOGE findings here at the Department of Defense. pic.twitter.com/PSrHn8Zjlq — Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (@SecDef) March 20, 2025 Hegseth shared programs DOGE has terminated Hegseth began the list with an HR software effort he said was supposed to take a year and cost $36 million. Unfortunately, it has gone for years and gulped up to $280 million without doing what it was supposed to. “We’re not doing that anymore,” he said before moving on to reveal they also ended another batch of DOD grants worth $360 million. Next, he talked about cutting about $11 million from the navy budget and $9 from a university budget geared towards approaching “equitable AI and machine learning models.” “I need lethal machine learning models, not equitable machine models,” he said. After that, Hegseth revealed that as part of their effort to curb wasteful spending on external consulting services, they canceled $30 million in contracts with Gartner and McKinsey. Hegseth said that brings the total amount of cuts up to $800 million. He added this was only possible because the DOD partnered with DOGE as part of its efforts to ensure taxpayer funds are going to the warfighters who actually need them. “They’re working hard,” Hegseth praised DOGE before adding that the DOD appreciates the nobility of its task to cut excessive spending and is also working hard with them to make it happen. As the video ended, the Defense Secretary said no more time would be wasted and promptly signed the documents making the cuts permanent. In the comment section of the post, rather than appreciative comments from a public who recognizes the importance of what DOGE and the DOD are doing, the majority of the replies were scathing. DOD accused of going too far to eliminate DEI from the armed forces In the past couple of days, there has been much backlash from US citizens, especially members of the African American community, who feel they are being targeted by efforts disguised as cost-cutting attempts. Recently, the DOD, following President Trump’s executive order to eliminate DEI from the armed services, has flagged tens of thousands of images, posts, and content for removal. Some of the posts that have now been removed include references to Black military heroes like the Tuskegee Airmen, Medal of Honor recipients and other notable figures such as Jackie Robinson, as part of what is being called a “Digital Content Refresh” to comply with the directive. The content that was targeted involved those related to race, ethnicity, and observances like Black History Month, and it has led to the deletion of photos and posts about Black soldiers, women, and minorities, something that has triggered a mass outcry within the African American community. Jackie Robinson’s page has since been restored to its original URL on the Department of Defense website — and no longer says ‘DEI.’ pic.twitter.com/MQ5csI4XVB — Pop Base (@PopBase) March 19, 2025 On X, formerly Twitter, many have ranted and raved, calling out the DOD for only getting rid of pictures of colored servicemen while leaving images of only the white ones up and also renaming bases after Confederate generals. They worry this undermines the recognition of the contributions these men made to the war while they lived. Hegseth, who was appointed in January 2025, is in support of the war against DEI. He has declared “DEI is dead,” and argued that such programs erode camaraderie and threaten military mission execution. People now link his leadership at the DOD with the erasure of Black soldier history, and many have been seen criticizing or questioning the moves under his X posts.

Top Cryptos Under $1 To Watch in 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/price-surge-coming-soon-top-cryptos-under-1-to-watch-in-2025/,"The idea of buying a cryptocurrency under $1 and seeing it soar has always been appealing. With small initial capital, the potential for high gains remains a strong draw. Many well-known coins, like Dogecoin, started cheap and later delivered massive returns. Choosing wisely today could mean spotting tomorrow’s biggest performers. As 2025 approaches, several promising cryptos under $1 stand out. These digital assets combine strong fundamentals with innovative use cases that could drive their value higher. This list highlights the best options, including BlockDAG, Polygon (MATIC), TRON (TRX), Algorand (ALGO), Kaspa (KAS), and Dogecoin (DOGE). While their prices remain low, their potential remains high. BlockDAG Speed & Scalability Leading to $204.5M Presale BlockDAG is redefining blockchain efficiency with its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure. This design enables multiple blocks to be processed simultaneously, ensuring faster transactions and better scalability. BlockDAG’s infrastructure makes it a prime choice for decentralized applications (dApps) and Web3 developers needing speed and security. Unlike many low-cost cryptos that rely on hype, BlockDAG has demonstrated real progress. Its presale has already raised $204.5 million, providing strong community backing. Priced at $0.0248 per BDAG in Batch 27, it has surged 2,380% from its initial launch. With over 18.8 billion BDAG coins sold and $6.5 million in miner sales, BlockDAG is preparing for major exchange listings, with 10 top-tier platforms already in focus. The ongoing affiliate program also offers a 5% cashback in USDT, adding further value to early supporters. Polygon: The $491M Layer-2 Powerhouse Fueling Ethereum’s Future Polygon (MATIC) continues to be a powerhouse in the crypto space, thanks to its ability to enhance Ethereum’s scalability. As a Layer-2 solution, it provides faster, more cost-effective transactions, helping solve Ethereum’s congestion issues. With an expanding network of dApps and strong institutional partnerships, Polygon remains a favorite among developers. Currently priced at $0.2521, Polygon holds a market cap of approximately $491 million, reinforcing its standing in the industry. Its advancements in zero-knowledge (ZK) technology and Ethereum compatibility further position it for long-term success. As Ethereum-based projects grow, Polygon’s role as a scaling solution could significantly increase its value. TRON: The $20.87B Blockchain Powering Digital Content TRON (TRX) has established itself as a major force in decentralized applications, particularly in entertainment and content-sharing platforms. With its fast processing speeds and minimal transaction fees, TRON continues to see widespread adoption in gaming, streaming, and social media services. At $0.2451, TRON boasts a market cap of about $20.87 billion, demonstrating its dominance in the blockchain space. The network’s focus on digital content monetization ensures its relevance, while its ongoing development and partnerships make it a stable yet promising choice among cryptos. ALGO: The Green Blockchain With Real Use Cases Algorand (ALGO) is a standout due to its environmentally friendly proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, reducing energy consumption compared to traditional blockchains. The project has made strides in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), providing a secure and scalable infrastructure. Currently priced at $0.2488, Algorand has a market cap of $35.96 billion, highlighting its strong presence in the industry. By bridging traditional finance with decentralized solutions, Algorand continues to attract institutional partnerships. Additionally, its commitment to carbon-negative initiatives aligns with the rising demand for sustainable blockchain networks. Kaspa (KAS) is Redefining Transaction Speed Kaspa (KAS) is carving its niche by focusing on ultra-fast transactions. Its blocked structure allows multiple blocks to be created simultaneously, significantly improving scalability. This innovation enables the network to handle high transaction volumes efficiently without congestion. Priced at $0.0750 with a market cap of $2.89 billion, Kaspa presents a unique opportunity for those looking to invest in speed-optimized blockchain technology. Its expanding developer community and refined architecture position it as a key player in the future of high-performance blockchains. The Meme Coin DOGE Endures Dogecoin (DOGE) may have started as a joke, but its market relevance remains strong. As one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies, DOGE has built a loyal community and gained widespread acceptance as a payment option. Now trading at $0.2023 with a market cap of $29.68 billion, Dogecoin’s appeal extends beyond memes. Its continued integration into payment systems and community-driven growth ensure its lasting presence in the crypto space. Which Crypto Has the Best Potential? The best cryptos under $1 offer a unique mix of affordability and growth potential. While SHIB faces speculative challenges and Hedera must clear resistance before a true breakout, BlockDAG is emerging as the strongest contender. With its $204.5 million presale, 18.8 billion coins sold, and rapid expansion, BlockDAG is proving its staying power. Analysts believe its price could reach $1 by 2025, presenting a 3,932% ROI for early buyers. As it continues to attract attention and build out its ecosystem, those looking for high-growth potential should consider BDAG before the next price jump. For those who want to seize an opportunity before the next surge, BDAG’s presale remains open—but not for long.

As the top meme coin fluctuates near the support and resistance levels, market analysts have predicted the higher and lower possibilities. Both the technical analysis and historical data suggest how the prices could reverse higher or further consolidate in days to come. Dogecoin Price Faces Critical Test: Will Support Hold or Break? Dogecoin price is facing strong resistance at $0.176, with a Bearish Tweezer candlestick pattern forming on the daily chart. According to Trader Alan, this pattern is a strong reversal signal, suggesting that selling pressure is increasing. The resistance level has already seen a false breakout, where Dogecoin price briefly moved above $0.176 but failed to hold. This failure indicates weak bullish momentum and a possible downward move. The analyst suggests that if the price moves lower, Dogecoin price could retest the $0.143 support level. If selling pressure intensifies, the meme coin may trade within a range between $0.143 and $0.176. A break below this support could trigger further declines, pushing the top meme coin to a deeper correction phase. However, if buyers step in and defend the $0.143 level, Dogecoin price may continue consolidating within this range. Analyst states that for a bullish breakout to occur, DOGE must establish higher lows and build momentum near the $0.176 resistance level. A sustained move above this resistance could invalidate the bearish outlook, leading to an upward trend. Source: X Analyst Predict Possible 16% Breakout Analyst Ali Martinez has identified an ascending triangle pattern on Dogecoin price charts, indicating the potential for a breakout. This bullish pattern forms when higher lows develop while the price repeatedly tests a horizontal resistance level. In this case, the key range for a breakout is between $0.16 and $0.18. Martinez suggests that if DOGE price closes outside this range, either upward or downward, a 16% price move could follow. A breakout above $0.18 could lead to further bullish momentum, while a breakdown below $0.16 may result in a sharp decline. Source: X Trendline at $0.14269 Could Influence Meme Coin Rally Moreover, analyst DOGE Capital noted that Dogecoin price is following a historical pattern observed in past market cycles. The analyst points to a repeating structure where DOGE accumulates within a triangular wedge before breaking out. The key support level to watch is around $0.14269, which has previously acted as a launchpad for the meme coin rally. DOGE Capital’s analysis suggests that when DOGE price retests this historical trendline, it tends to rebound and initiate a strong upward move. If this pattern repeats, DOGE could see another bullish breakout in the coming weeks. Source: X Meanwhile, following the Fed’s FOMC meeting, the meme coin has shown strong upward momentum. Analysts have identified key price targets at $0.38, $0.48, and $0.60, citing bullish market conditions and increased trading volume as driving factors.

Indeed, buying ADA at its 200DMA has proven to be a great short-term trading strategy in recent weeks. After testing its 200DMA in early February, the Cardano price rallied 50% in 10 days. Meanwhile, after falling back to the 200DMA in late February, the Cardano price rallied as much as 80% in early March. Could history be about to repeat itself? Well, traders would be wise to realize that the situation in the crypto market right now is very different than it was a few weeks ago. Trump’s announcement that Cardano would be included in a strategic US crypto reserve in early March was the catalyst for that stunning rally. However, ADA didn’t make it into the digital asset stockpile, and the government has announced no plans to include it in the stockpile in the future. Meanwhile, after a lot of hype that Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson would meet with key officials in the Trump administration in February, he was eventually snubbed and not even invited to the administration’s crypto event earlier this month. Last at $0.72, the Cardano price is down about 40% from its earlier monthly highs, justified amid the pricing out of all this hype. Cardano has been suffering amid a broader malaise in the crypto market as macro conditions turn for the worse. The Fed threw the bulls a bone earlier this week when they slowed the rate of their quantitative tightening . BREAKING: FED SAYS QT ENDS APRIL 1ST. MONEY PRINTER IS COMING BACK. MASSIVELY BULLISH FOR BITCOIN! pic.twitter.com/b4MHNfwc9l — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) March 19, 2025 But the outlook for the US economy remains murky, with risks to growth and inflation remaining sticky rising. A further deterioration of the macro backdrop could easily be the trigger for a renewed crypto market drop in the weeks ahead, and Cardano could easily lose its 200DMA. How Low Could Cardano Go? Just as the convincing break above the 200DMA in early November signified the start of a powerful bullish trend, a convincing break below the 200DMA in the coming weeks could signal the start of a new bearish trend. Its entirely feasible that the Cardano price might soon retest its February lows in the $0.55 area, and potentially even support in the form of the mid-2024 highs in the $0.40s. Would it be a good idea to buy Cardano at these levels? Well, it depends on the risk appetite of the investor. Cardano could do very very well in the years ahead. Its blockchain has a lot of potential for real world adoption, especially as it pivots towards becoming the go-to Bitcoin DeFi chain. However, this is highly speculative. In its many years of existence, Cardano has failed to garner anything close to the real world adoption seen by rivals like Bitcoin , Ethereum and Solana . That being said, deteriorating macro conditions aside, risks are titled towards major cryptos seeing a lot of growth before Trump’s term is finished. The US President has specifically marked out crypto as an industry that he wants to support, as he reiterated in remarks today. BREAKING: THE FULL TRUMP SPEECH: pic.twitter.com/tfyVzLQhqt — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) March 20, 2025 Growth in the broader industry would be expected to “lift all boats”, meaning Cardano could do very well over the next few years. Buying it on the dip is thus probably not a bad idea. That said, cryptos with a better track record of adoption like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana are probably safer bets with arguably just as much upside potential.

Gox crypto exchange and co-founded Ripple has shared new details about his ambitious space station company Vast, which he hopes will help expand the human race into a multi-planetary species. In a March 20 interview with Bloomberg, Jed McCaleb confirmed that Vast is on track to launch Haven-1 — a commercial space station still under construction — into orbit by May 2026. If McCaleb’s startup succeeds, it will be better positioned to win a lucrative contract from the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration to replace the International Space Station. Contracts are expected to be handed out in mid-2026. If Vast fails or loses the NASA contract to a competitor, McCaleb could see $1 billion wiped from his net worth and the commercial future of his space station firm would be in doubt, according to the report. “There are not that many folks who are willing to dedicate the amount of resources and time and risk tolerance that I am,” McCaleb told Bloomberg. Vast’s founder, board chair and tech fellow Jed McCaleb. Source: Vast McCaleb is known to be a “deliberate risk-taker” with hyperrational tendencies, according to long-time friend and former business partner Sam Yagan, who added: “He’s maybe slightly eccentric in his willingness to take what you and I would see as a lot of risks.” McCaleb’s aspiration to put humans on other planets draws similarities to multibillionaire and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. “It’s super important that people take this leap from where we are today to this potential world where there’s a lot of people living off the Earth,” said McCaleb, who founded Vast in 2021. Vast is building its spacecraft with components developed by SpaceX, such as a docking adapter to connect SpaceX’s Dragon capsule to Vast’s station and an in-space internet system that will provide WiFi on the station via Starlink. Key specifications Vast’s Haven-1 model. Source: Vast McCaleb’s firm has also booked SpaceX flights to send its hardware into orbit and deliver crew to its station, and SpaceX has agreed to carry astronauts for Vast as long as NASA gives its go-ahead. Vast’s close ties to SpaceX stem partly from it hiring key personnel who previously worked there, including Max Haot, who now serves as Vast’s CEO and president. Vast is competing with the likes of Axiom Space, Voyager Space Holdings, Lockheed Martin and the Jeff Bezos-founded Blue Origin to win the next major NASA contract. McCaleb also wants to create ‘artificial gravity’ Part of Vast’s long-term plans is to create artificial gravity replicating Earth-like conditions by accelerating or rotating the spacecraft, as many ISS workers who have spent lengthy periods in space have reported organ damage. The ISS also uses a technology that recycles wastewater into potable water and carbon dioxide into breathable oxygen. Haven-1 won’t feature this due to its short-term crew visits, but Vast plans to incorporate it into its future model, Haven-2, by 2028, which will be designed for longer-term stays. Both McCaleb and Haot say they’re willing to board flights themselves.

After McCaleb’s first success with the internet file-sharing service eDonkey in the 2000s, his next notable achievement was founding Mt. Gox in 2010. His time at Mt. Gox was short-lived, with McCaleb selling a majority stake in 2011. Mt. Gox went on to become the world’s largest Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange until 2014 when a $400 million hack sent the company into bankruptcy. Several months later, McCaleb began his next venture — creating the XRP ( XRP ) crypto token on the Ripple protocol in 2012. McCaleb owned 9% of the XRP tokens from the onset but sold the majority of them after 2013 when he left Ripple following disagreements with the company’s other founders. He has netted billions of dollars from those XRP sales and Ripple equity between 2014 and 2022. McCaleb also founded the Stellar network in 2014 — a fork of the Ripple protocol — along with the Stellar ( XLM ) crypto token, which now boasts an $8.7 billion market cap, CoinGecko data shows.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP’s surge past $2.50, BNB’s bullish momentum, and Qubetics’ presale and partnership success are fueling excitement in the crypto market. Table of Contents Qubetics: Transforming asset tokenization XRP breaks $2.50 after SEC lawsuit dismissal announcement BNB gears up for a bullish breakout Why Qubetics, XRP, and BNB are worth watching The cryptocurrency market is witnessing exciting developments, with Qubetics, XRP, and BNB standing out as major players. Qubetics is transforming tokenized assets, securing massive investments in its crypto presale and forming key partnerships to enhance liquidity and security. XRP surged past $2.50 after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the dismissal of the SEC lawsuit, boosting investor confidence. Meanwhile, BNB shows strong bullish indicators, hinting at a potential breakout rally. Qubetics: Transforming asset tokenization Qubetics is leading tokenized investments by offering a marketplace that fractionalizes real-world and digital assets, making them accessible to investors worldwide. From real estate and commodities to equities and intellectual property, the platform aims to unlock new opportunities for diversification and wealth creation. Qubetics’ crypto presale: A massive opportunity for early investors Qubetics’ crypto presale has been nothing short of a massive success, raising $15.2 million with over 501 million TICS tokens sold. Unlike traditional ICOs, Qubetics uses a unique 7-day presale stage system, ensuring a 10% price increase every Sunday at 12 AM. Currently, TICS is priced at $0.1181, but analysts predict it will reach $1 by the end of the presale, offering early investors a potential 746% ROI. However, the real gains may come post-launch. With the mainnet set to launch in Q2 2025, price forecasts suggest TICS could surge to $10 or even $15. This makes Qubetics one of the trending crypto presales for potentially high, long-term rewards. Strategic partnerships: Strengthening Qubetics’ ecosystem To ensure a secure and efficient blockchain experience, Qubetics has formed high-profile partnerships that enhance its liquidity, security, and usability. CertiK security audit: Qubetics is undergoing a comprehensive audit by CertiK, one of the most trusted blockchain security firms. This assessment will strengthen network security, smart contract reliability, and user trust, ensuring Qubetics is a secure and attack-resistant ecosystem. SWFT Blockchain collaboration: Qubetics has partnered with SWFT Blockchain to develop a state-of-the-art wallet, simplifying blockchain transactions and setting a new standard for secure asset management. Qubetics x 1inch: Qubetics is proud to announce its integration with the 1inch Network, a leading DeFi aggregator that connects users to hundreds of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for optimized trades, unmatched liquidity, and the best possible rates. This strategic partnership positions the Qubetics Wallet at the forefront of decentralized trading offerings. With these strategic partnerships, Qubetics is positioning itself as a secure, scalable, and transformative blockchain ecosystem, making it a top contender in the crypto space.

Following the announcement, XRP surged 14% to surpass $2.50, with analysts expecting further gains. Whales have taken notice — wallets holding at least one million XRP have increased their holdings by 6.5% in the past two months, accumulating 46.4 billion XRP worth $114 billion at current prices. Additionally, XRP network activity has surged, with unique wallet interactions increasing sixfold in March. With regulatory uncertainty behind it and growing institutional adoption, XRP is set for continued bullish momentum. BNB gears up for a bullish breakout BNB’s price action suggests an impending breakout, as the crypto has rebounded from recent lows with strong momentum. Previously, BNB attempted a trendline breakout, but resistance at $640 (the 61.80% Fibonacci level) caused a temporary dip to $605. However, the broader market recovery has sparked a V-shaped reversal, with BNB forming four consecutive bullish candles, signaling renewed upside momentum. Key indicators supporting a bullish rally include: MACD and signal lines are close to a positive crossover, reinforcing buying strength. The stochastic RSI lines rebounded from the oversold region, initiating a fresh, bullish cycle. If BNB breaks past the $640 resistance, it could trigger an extended rally, making it one of the top altcoins to watch in the coming weeks. Why Qubetics, XRP, and BNB are worth watching Qubetics stands out with its $15.2m presale, upcoming mainnet launch, and strong partnerships. Meanwhile, XRP and BNB continue showing signs of strength. Keeping an eye on these projects as the crypto market heats up could lead to significant gains in 2025 and beyond.

With Solana ETFs and Kaspa’s 11% Breakout, It Might Be—Here’s Why!",https://thecoinrise.com/is-qubetics-the-top-crypto-presale-of-2025-with-solana-etfs-and-kaspas-11-breakout-it-might-be-heres-why/,"Which blockchain projects are leading the next wave of innovation? Some cryptocurrencies fade into obscurity, while others continue to break new ground. Solana’s first-ever futures ETFs in the U.S. have signaled an institutional shift. Kaspa’s network efficiency has fueled double-digit gains, drawing serious attention. But neither has solved a major issue that plagues global finance: seamless, cost-effective cross-border transactions. Qubetics ($TICS) the top crypto presale is changing that. Designed for real-world usability, Qubetics is redefining how digital assets move across economies. Unlike its predecessors, this multi-chain non-custodial wallet offers businesses and individuals an advanced transactional ecosystem, solving the inefficiencies that traditional financial systems and legacy blockchains have struggled with for years. Qubetics: The Future of Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics isn’t just a blockchain initiative—it’s reshaping the future of digital finance. With a cross-border transaction at its core, Qubetics enables seamless global transactions without reliance on third parties. High fees, slow settlements, and complex onboarding have kept digital assets from reaching mainstream commerce, but Qubetics is eliminating these barriers. International trade, freelance payments, and remittances all suffer from inefficient banking rails. A business selling goods across borders faces steep conversion fees and unpredictable settlement times. With Qubetics, transactions happen in real time, cutting costs and eliminating middlemen. Similarly, a professional receiving payments from abroad no longer waits days for clearance—Qubetics provides instant liquidity one of the top crypto presale. More than 23,400 token holders have already recognized its potential, securing over 501 million $TICS tokens in its crypto presale . Currently in its 26th stage, the presale has raised over $15.2 million, with $TICS priced at $0.1181. Early participants stand to gain a 746% ROI at $1, 4,130% ROI at $5, and 12,591% ROI at $15, making Qubetics one of the top crypto projects to invest in right now. Solana: Institutional Adoption Accelerates Solana’s network efficiency and developer activity have positioned it as a top-tier blockchain. With Volatility Shares launching the first-ever Solana futures ETFs in the U.S., institutions now have a new gateway to gain exposure without directly holding SOL. The introduction of these ETFs—Solana ETF (SOLZ) and the leveraged 2X Solana ETF (SOLT)—is a major milestone. Unlike traditional crypto trading, ETFs provide regulated, mainstream access to digital assets, driving liquidity and adoption. Since the announcement, Solana’s price has surged above $130, gaining 6% in just 24 hours, reflecting growing confidence. The Expanding Ecosystem Solana’s ultra-fast transactions and low fees continue to attract developers, leading to new DeFi and NFT innovations. Whether it’s on-chain gaming or decentralized finance applications, Solana remains a formidable player in blockchain scalability. Kaspa: The Scalable Proof-of-Work Blockchain Kaspa has gained traction as a high-speed proof-of-work blockchain with rapid transaction finality. Unlike Bitcoin, which struggles with scalability, Kaspa’s GhostDAG protocol allows simultaneous block confirmations, improving efficiency without sacrificing security. Kaspa’s resilience in the market has been evident. Recently, its price surged 11%, demonstrating solid recovery momentum. Currently, it trades at $0.077583, marking a 3.65% increase in the past 24 hours, outperforming the general market’s 2.45% rise. Why Kaspa Stands Out Kaspa’s structure enables high transaction throughput, making it a viable alternative for industries requiring real-time confirmations. This unique architecture keeps network congestion minimal, ensuring smooth operations even during peak usage. The Takeaway: Which Project Has the Strongest Future? Each of these projects addresses different facets of blockchain innovation. Solana is accelerating institutional adoption, Kaspa is redefining PoW scalability, and Qubetics is solving real-world financial inefficiencies. For those looking at high-potential opportunities, Qubetics’ presale remains a standout, with its cross-border transaction solutions proving critical for the evolving digital economy. Qubetics is also pioneering AI-driven smart contracts, reducing settlement times and eliminating inefficiencies in financial transactions. With regulatory-friendly automation and a scalable infrastructure, it is positioning itself as the top crypto presale , offering businesses and individuals a seamless way to engage with blockchain without technical barriers.

Atai, which is developing mental health treatments using psychedelics like DMT and MDMA, has become the latest public company to announce plans to buy Bitcoin. It plans to buy $5 million of Bitcoin ( BTC ), its founder and chair Christian Angermayer wrote in a March 20 Substack post. “Drug development is a cash-hungry, long-term venture,” he said. “The necessary steps to achieve regulatory approval can easily take more than a decade.” TechCrunch reported in January that, according to multiple data sets, the number of startups shutting down rose in 2024 compared to 2023 as firms failed to receive more funding to keep running. Angermayer said the approval process is essential for drug development, but it exposes firms to financial risks while sticky inflation and high interest rates have caused the current “biotech winter.” Source: Christian Angermayer He added that the current industry approach is to put cash reserves in near-zero-yield accounts, as “preserving capital was more important than earning a return on their cash balance.” “This context sets the stage for considering unconventional treasury moves — like adding Bitcoin to the treasury — to address the twin threats of inflation and low-yielding reserves, and in general to optimize and maximize shareholder value.” Atai will join at least five other public medical companies that have bought Bitcoin in recent months with the aim of boosting shareholder returns. Biotech firm Quantum BioPharma said on March 20 that it had now spent $3.5 million in total to buy BTC and other cryptocurrencies after an initial $1 million investment in December. Medical device maker Semler Scientific said last month that since it started in May, it had spent a total of $280.4 million buying 3,192 BTC. Hoth Therapeutics , Acurx Pharmaceuticals and Enlivex Therapeutics said in separate statements on Nov. 20 that each of them would buy $1 million in Bitcoin. Related: Michael Saylor’s Strategy plans to offer 5M shares to buy more Bitcoin Atai’s Angermayer said his firm’s Bitcoin buy would primarily be as a long-term inflation hedge but also a short-term diversification play. He added that Bitcoin is likely to have short-term price fluctuations, so the Berlin-based firm is holding mostly US dollars, short-term securities, and stocks for its desired run rate into 2027. Atai’s $5 million put would mean it is able to buy just over 59 BTC at its current price of around $84,300 and make it the world’s 52nd largest holder among public firms, according to Bitbo data . Bitcoin has struggled to keep afloat amid a wider market rout due to US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and fears of a US recession, which Trump hasn’t ruled out. Atai’s share price rose early in March 20 trading to a peak of $1.47 but tapered off to close the day down 1.44% at $1.37, according to Google Finance. Its stock has sunk nearly 93% from its mid-2021 public debut peak but is up 3% so far this year.

The announcement came in a video posted on social media platform X, where Garlinghouse noted the regulatory agency’s decision to end its pursuit of further litigation. Besides this interesting development, another major financial development has taken center stage in the crypto market in the past 24 hours; the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting. Fed Keeps Interest Rates Steady Amid Uncertainty The outcome of the latest Fed meeting can be divided into six key decisions. First, the Federal Reserve opted to maintain interest rates at their current level, keeping the borrowing rate in a range between 4.25% and 4.5% for the second consecutive meeting. This decision is part of a continued pause in the Fed’s tightening cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: 6 Key Events To Watch Out For In Crypto This Week Secondly, the Fed noted that uncertainty surrounding the economy has increased, and third, the Fed’s updated projections were the shift in expectations for rate cuts in 2025. The median forecast suggests 50 basis points of cuts for the year, but a growing number of Fed officials are less convinced that rate reductions will be necessary. In December, only one official anticipated no rate cuts in 2025. However, there’s now a more divided outlook, and that number has now risen to four, as noted in a post on social media platform X by analysts at The Kobeissi Letter. Beyond interest rates, the Fed revised its economic growth projections downward for 2025, suggesting that policymakers see slower expansion ahead. This adjustment comes alongside an increase in the Fed’s inflation forecast for the same period, reflecting concerns about price pressures persisting longer than previously anticipated. With inflation remaining a key focus, the central bank is treading carefully as it evaluates the right time to pivot toward a looser monetary stance. Fourthly, the Fed announced that it would slow the pace of its balance sheet runoff beginning in April. This is alongside a sharp reduction in the Fed’s 2025 growth projections and a markup in their 2025 inflation forecast. Implications For Crypto Markets And Digital Assets For the crypto industry, the Fed’s decision to hold rates steady and its mixed messaging on future cuts introduce a dynamic situation to Bitcoin and others. The fact that the Fed is still concerned about inflation and economic uncertainty shows that the path to more accommodative policies regarding the crypto industry may not be as smooth.

However, if the Fed stays hesitant to cut rates and economic growth slows as projected, digital assets may face headwinds later in the year, which may slow down the predicted growth by crypto analysts.

Ethereum rallied from the low $1,900s on Wednesday to nearly $2,100 and was last just below $2,000. The Fed slowed the pace of its quantitative tightening (QT) program on Wednesday, a strong signal to the market that a new liquidity wave is on the horizon, if not here just yet. BREAKING: FED SAYS QT ENDS APRIL 1ST. MONEY PRINTER IS COMING BACK. MASSIVELY BULLISH FOR BITCOIN! pic.twitter.com/b4MHNfwc9l — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) March 19, 2025 Liquidity in the financial system is the life blood for altcoins like Ethereum . And a lack of it since 2022 amid the Fed’s aggressive monetary tightening approach and quantitative tightening has hobbled growth in the altcoin market. While Bitcoin has been carried by narratives like the hugely successful 2024 ETF launch and its growing acceptance as “digital gold”, most major altcoins have struggled to keep pace. The lack of liquidity in the US financial system has meant that alt-coin seasons, like that in early 2024 and in wake of Trump’s election victory have disappointed. Indeed, a darkening of the macro backdrop as risks to US economic growth rise and inflation threatens to rebound has weighed heavily on the market in recent weeks. But the prospect of the end of QT and, eventually, the start of a new liquidity wave, could substantially lift the mood in the market. Could Ethereum soon rally back to record highs? Where Next for the Ethereum Price? While it has rallied a solid 13% from earlier monthly lows and snapped a short-term downtrend, Ethereum is yet to break back above its 21DMA. This is a level that has offered stiff resistance going pretty much all the way back to the start of 2025. That suggests price risks still remain titled to the downside in the short-term. Moreover, a more nuanced analysis of the macro backdrop also suggests risks remain tilted to the downside. Yes, the Fed is slowing QT and that means we are one big step closer to a new wave of liquidity. But a lot needs to happen first before that new wave of liquidity comes. Indeed, QE liquidity waves have always in the past followed some sort of crisis/market turmoil. And that might be exactly what we get in 2025 – the US economy is at risk of tilting into recession amid Trump’s trade wars and D.O.G.E austerity and the US government needs to refinance a massive $9 trillion of its debt. Things need to get a lot worse first before the Fed pulls the trigger on a new wave of money printing. That suggests that Ethereum potentially has a other further to drop in 2025, before QE sends it to the moon in 2026. That’s looking very far ahead. Savvy traders focused on the market’s short-term outlook should closely watch upcoming US economic data releases and trade war news. As well failing to reclaim its 21DMA, Ethereum has also so far failed to reclaim the long-term support-turned-resistance $2,100 level. Risks remain tilted towards a retest of mid-2023 lows around $1,500 before QE, and general crypto industry growth thanks to regulatory support from the Trump administration sends us to new all time highs in the coming years.

In a market filled with hype-driven projects, only a few bring real innovation to the table. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is one of those rare gems, introducing a deflationary mechanism that permanently removes unsold tokens, increasing scarcity and potential value. Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies like Comedian and AI Companions continue to generate excitement with strong trading volumes and investor interest. As the crypto market surges with new developments, Arctic Pablo Coin is leading the way with its presale success. This article will cover the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin, Comedian, and AI Companions, with a special focus on Arctic Pablo Coin’s token burn strategy and presale potential. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Game-Changing Token Burn Strategy A fundamental challenge for many meme coins is controlling supply. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) tackles this head-on with an aggressive token burn mechanism, ensuring a deflationary environment that strengthens its long-term value. Arctic Pablo Coin is in the Best New Meme Coins to Join Now. Unlike projects that simply hold unsold tokens, Arctic Pablo Coin permanently removes them from circulation every week during the presale. This reduction in supply enhances scarcity, potentially driving up value as demand increases. Additionally, any tokens left unsold after the presale will also be burned, ensuring that only actively purchased tokens remain in the ecosystem. These transactions are recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), offering full transparency and accountability. With supply shrinking each week, early adopters stand to benefit the most as fewer tokens remain available. This strategy not only protects investor interest but also builds long-term sustainability for the project. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: The Nippy Nook Stage is Here—Don’t Miss Out! Momentum is building fast for meme coin presale, which has now entered its 15th phase—Nippy Nook. With each phase, the price has steadily increased, rewarding early investors. At the current presale price of just $0.000079, those who seize the opportunity now could potentially see an ROI of over 10,027.85%, with the launch price set at $0.008. A $1,000 investment today would yield approximately 12,656,860 APCs. At the launch price of $0.008, that investment could grow to a staggering $101,254.88. With over $1.95 million already raised, Arctic Pablo Coin is gaining massive traction, and as it moves through different phases, the price will only go up. As new locations unlock, the entry price rises—securing APC at its current rate is a rare opportunity. The Arctic Pablo Coin presale is quickly approaching its final stages, and investors are rushing to grab their share before the price hikes again. Will you be part of this exclusive opportunity before it’s too late? Comedian’s Market Performance: A Strong Trading Volume Signals Interest As the meme coin market continues to expand, Comedian is attracting significant attention with its active trading. Currently priced at $0.0553, Comedian has achieved an impressive 24-hour trading volume of $21,378,383.15. This level of activity indicates strong investor confidence and liquidity, essential factors in sustaining long-term growth. Comedian’s rise demonstrates how niche-themed cryptocurrencies can capture the market’s imagination, further reinforcing the potential of meme-based projects. AI Companions Sees Stable Growth in the Crypto Market Artificial intelligence remains a hot trend, and AI Companions is leveraging that interest with its solid market presence. Priced at $0.2198, AI Companions has achieved a 24-hour trading volume of $3.89 million, signaling steady engagement from investors. With AI-driven projects gaining momentum, AI Companions continues to attract attention from those looking for the next breakthrough technology-backed crypto asset. Final thoughts: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Meme Coin Revolution The cryptocurrency market is witnessing exciting developments, with Comedian and AI Companions making waves in their respective categories. However, the spotlight remains on Arctic Pablo Coin, thanks to its game-changing token burn mechanism and skyrocketing presale performance. With the Nippy Nook phase in full swing and prices set to rise, this could be one of the most strategic entry points for those looking to invest in the next big meme coin sensation.

Despite a neutral 'Crypto Fear & Greed' index, Ethereum's Telegram and search interest remain low, indicating weak demand and user growth. Capital outflows from digital asset investment products are at record highs, with ETH ETFs seeing consistent net outflows, though Grayscale's mini trust shows modest growth. Given the poor Q1 performance and challenging technical setup, I see no compelling reason to be long ETH despite its low expense ratio. As the market quickly closes in on the end of the first quarter of the year, it has been a rough start to 2025 for Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) to say the least. Down nearly 40% year to date, ETH's recent performance is actually even worse when going back to mid-December: Data by YCharts On December 16th, ETH came within $45 of $4k per coin. In less than three months, ETH's price had fallen by more than 57% percent from the peak in December. Is there any reason for Ethereum holders to exhibit optimism? In this Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ( ETH ) article, we'll look at market sentiment, capital flows in the market, and the technical setup for ETH that I'm currently seeing. Market Sentiment For those who want a more fundamental update to Ethereum's network usage, I'd invite readers to check out my iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (NASDAQ: ETHA ) article from early-March. In that piece, I went over the network usage and fee metrics for the blockchain through February. Very little has changed in that regard through the first few weeks of March. Despite the lack of growth in network fees, market sentiment more broadly appears to be improving: Crypto Fear and Greed Index (TrendSpider) At a 49 reading in the 'Crypto Fear & Greed' index on March 20th, market sentiment is showing a swift spike out of bearish territory and puts the overall market sentiment at 'neutral.' For Ethereum specifically, indications are much less rosy: IntoTheBlock Telegram Sentiment - derived from machine learning connotation analysis of Telegram messages by token - is showing very little interest in Ethereum through Telegram going back to December. This could certainly be more indicative of declining Telegram usage than anything else, as Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) Telegram Sentiment trends look fairly similar to the chart above. That said, search interest from the general public also shows declining interest over time: Ethereum Search Interest (Google Trends) Worldwide search data for 'Ethereum' shows broad declines in 'interest over time' over the last five years. The index reading for this search interest data has been under 20 since Ethereum's price peak in December. This does not seem indicative of what would be expected with robust demand and user growth. To be sure, it has been capital flows rather than utility truly driving this market for a while. US ETF Supply & Capital Flows Through March 14th 2025, digital asset investment products have seen the worst five week outflow streak on record: CoinShares After another $1.7 billion came out of cryptocurrency investment products last week, the month to date net flow is negative by nearly $2.7 billion and the total net flow over the last five weeks is negative by $6.4 billion. The asset class is dangerously close to negative net flows year to date, and one more week like the one we had through March 14th would do the trick. The early indications through Wednesday do indeed look a bit better. Data tracked by Farside Investors shows nearly $500 million in BTC ETF demand. Ethereum has not been so lucky: Net Flows BTC ETFs ETH ETFs 17 Mar 2025 $274.6 -$7.3 18 Mar 2025 $209.1 -$52.8 19 Mar 2025 $11.8 -$11.7 3 Day Sum $495.5 -$71.8 Source: Farside Investors, $ in millions Ethereum ETFs have seen net outflow each of the first three days during the week of March 17th. The Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust has seen $17 million in single week outflow through March 19th. However, the overall trend in ETH supply held through the fund remains positive: ETH Coin Supply Trend (TheBlock) At 462.6k ETH-USD held through the fund, Grayscale's mini trust has grown ETH token supply by 1.7% year to date. From an expense ratio standpoint, ETH is the standout in the market with an annual fee of just 15 basis points. The Block The fund is also top four regarding the share of spot ETF volume. ETH has actually seen this grow in recent weeks with share of volume eclipsing 10% every session since March 12th. That said, ETH share of spot ETF volume is still well off highs from late last year. At that time, the fund often had a share of volume in excess of 20%. Additional Considerations As we approach the end of March, we can look at the Q2 seasonality implications for Ethereum. April has historically been the best month for ETH based purely on mean change: ETH Seasonality (TrendSpider) Going back to 2016, Ethereum's mean change in April is 26% and the coin has made a positive return 75% of the time. Though we shouldn't gloss over the fact that Q1 should have been a terrific quarter for ETH based on past seasonality trends as well - and the actual performance between January and March turned out to be quite horrible. My interpretation of Ethereum's technical setup is indecisive: ETH-USD Weekly (TrendSpider) On one hand, we can see the coin hanging on to the 300-week moving average for dear life. On the other hand, I see $2,100 per coin serving as support on weekly closes going back to late 2023. That level was breached on a close the week of March 3rd, failed a back test the week of March 10th, and is currently still under that key level as of article submission on March 20th. I, personally, would not entertain taking a stab at that trade from the long side until we see the coin take back $2,100 on a weekly close. It's entirely possible that the breakdown the week of March 3rd is a fake out and the 300-week MA will indeed hold as support. But at this point, that would just be a guess and not one that I'm going to make today. Closing Summary You could talk me into the merits of a technical bounce for ETH, given how aggressive the selloff has been over the last three months. I find it particularly interesting that investment capital flow for the asset is now quite competitive with that of Bitcoin's year to date. But bear in mind, this is largely coming with net outflows over the last several weeks, and Bitcoin has simply been hit harder in this regard than Ethereum has. The year-to-date investment flows could easily flip to negative if the week of March 17th mirrors what we have been seeing over the last month. While sentiment figures have indeed improved when observed through the 'Crypto Fear & Greed' index, I think the lack of interest in Ethereum through platforms like Telegram and Google Search are fairly troubling. In a way, we have the market we deserve in crypto right now. Usage and user interest are not what have been generally driving coin price action. Rather, capital flows from speculators who expect to sell to someone else at a higher price continue to drive gains (and losses). For tax-advantaged exposure to ETH, traders can do a lot worse than the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF at a 0.15% expense ratio. But at this point, I still don't see a compelling reason to be long ETH based on any fundamental trends. Furthermore, I think the technical setup has challenges. Even though Q1 was a really bad quarter for ETH, it can always get worse!",ETH-USD|ETH,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-21 02:54:44

With increasing adoption and community-driven hype, DOGE remains a strong contender in the crypto market. However, its large supply and reliance on speculative interest make such a surge challenging. Meanwhile, emerging projects with lower market caps and strong fundamentals are gaining attention as potential alternatives. Lightchain AI has already raised over $17.9 million at a presale price of $0.007 , positioning itself as a high-growth AI-powered blockchain asset. As investors seek opportunities beyond traditional meme coins, newer tokens with innovative use cases may reach key price milestones before DOGE. This article explores whether Dogecoin can hit $2 or if another crypto will achieve it first. Dogecoin’s Bullish Momentum and Community Support One of the strongest aspects of Dogecoin (DOGE) is its very active community and the continued growth in the market, which leads to sudden rises. In these few years, DOGE has been able to maintain the upswings during bull trends notwithstanding the fact that that is frequently based on attracting people from social media platforms, celebrities or getting a place on the major exchanges list. Thus, its supporters can effectively increase trading volume and as a result, it is one of the most lasting meme coins in the market. Nevertheless, it is the major issue of the large circulation S1of DOGE that the price spikes result in that challenges the issue of long-term growth. Positive attitudes can remain in the case when $2 would be expected with the help of an inflow of money, whole market support and, therefore, the need for broader market momentum. It is uncertain whether its tribe-inspired vigor is strong enough to lift DOGE to uncharted territories or if investors will choose coins with better fundamentals and lower market capitalization. Could Lightchain AI Overtake DOGE in the Race to $2? Lightchain AI is rapidly emerging as a strong competitor in the crypto market, raising the question of whether it could reach $2 before Dogecoin (DOGE). While DOGE has an established community and historical price surges, its large supply makes substantial price increases challenging. In contrast, Lightchain AI’s AI-powered blockchain model is attracting investors looking for innovation and real-world utility. With growing adoption and increasing interest in AI-driven cryptocurrencies, Lightchain AI has the potential to see faster price appreciation due to its lower market cap and strong fundamentals. Unlike DOGE, which relies heavily on social media-driven hype, Lightchain AI offers practical applications that could sustain long-term growth. As investors explore alternatives beyond meme coins, Lightchain AI’s momentum could position it as a leading candidate to hit $2 before Dogecoin. Which Will Reach $2 First, DOGE or Lightchain AI? The race to $2 between Dogecoin (DOGE) and Lightchain AI presents two very different investment narratives. DOGE, backed by a strong community and historical price surges, relies heavily on market sentiment and social media-driven hype. However, its large circulating supply makes a rapid move to $2 difficult without significant institutional backing. On the other hand, Lightchain AI, an emerging AI-powered blockchain project, is gaining traction due to its real-world utility and growing adoption. With increasing interest in AI-integrated cryptocurrencies, Lightchain AI’s lower market cap gives it the potential for faster price appreciation compared to DOGE. While Dogecoin remains a popular choice among retail investors, Lightchain AI’s innovative approach and strong fundamentals may give it a competitive edge in reaching the $2 milestone first. The coming months will determine which asset prevails. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-21 03:00:00

Per the South Korean media outlets Jeju Sori and Newsis , the a branch of the Jeju District Court, on the island province of Jeju, rejected an appeal from the teacher – unnamed and aged in their 30s. South Korean Teacher Jailed for Two Years The court ordered the teacher to serve two years in jail, after hearing they had stolen 80 million won ($54,500) and spent most of the money on unnamed cryptoassets. The headquarters of the Jeju Provincial Police agency in Jeju, South Korea. (Source: Yonhap News TV/Screenshot) The court heard that the teacher “embezzled” the money from students and their parents, as well as “fraudulently selling second-hand goods” in an “online scam” worth approximately 7 million won ($4,770). The court dismissed the defendant’s appeal, noting that the judge in the teacher’s previous trial had already “taken the defendant’s remorse into account.” The teacher’s legal team had also argued that the defendant had “paid back” part of the money stolen from the students. But the appellate court said there was “no reason to take this into consideration in sentencing,” as the original court verdict, in November last year, had already done so.

The court heard that the defendant worked as a teacher at a high school in Jeju, where they began stealing money in March last year. The prosecution explained that the teacher had discovered that some of their students had “financial problems.” The teacher then deceived the students by saying that they would resolve these problems, taking funds from students and their parents alike.

The court further heard that the teacher also borrowed about $4,000 from “acquaintances and other people.” The teacher also failed to pay back these loans, the prosecution added. The court also heard that the teacher spent “most of the proceeds of their crimes” on crypto investments. Crypto-related crimes have dominated news headlines in Jeju this year .

This comes just weeks after President Trump teamed up with Elon Musk to cut government agencies, which led to thousands of USAID job losses and the elimination of most foreign aid contracts. According to Politico , Trump wants to shrink USAID and focus it on global health, food security, disaster response, and countering China. The proposal argues that current development programs are “inefficient and fragmented,” spread too thin across too many sectors and countries, which leads to poor results. Trump To Rebuild Under His Image Trump’s plan aims to focus on areas crucial to U.S. interests, like promoting peace, stability, and economic opportunities that benefit American businesses. It also targets global threats, such as pandemics. The proposal suggests that all aid programs should have clear end dates and be closely measured for success. After significantly reducing the 60-year-old agency, Trump aims to rebuild it under his image. Agency To Leverage Blockchain Tech According to a memo circulating among State Department staff and reviewed by WIRED, the Trump administration plans to rename the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as US International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA), and to bring it directly under the secretary of state. The document states that as part of its reorganization, the agency will “leverage blockchain technology” as part of its procurement process. The agency will use blockchain technology to improve security, transparency, and traceability in its aid distribution. However, it’s unclear whether this will involve cryptocurrency, stablecoins, or simply using blockchain to track aid. The memo comes as USAID staff are uncertain about the agency’s future. USAID was a major target of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk. After President Trump’s inauguration, the State Department placed all USAID staff on administrative leave, cut the workforce, and halted some payments to global partners, including those providing lifesaving aid. Is It Unnecessary? According to Linda Raftree, a consultant helping humanitarian groups adopt new tech, few blockchain projects have succeeded in the sector because the technology is often unnecessary. “It feels like a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist,” she says, noting that in most cases, existing tools could do the job just as well. Besides, Giulio Coppi from Access Now says blockchain offers no clear advantages over other tools like payment systems, and its promotion as a “tech solution” has shown little real impact. Critics Argue Over Flexibility However, Blockchain technology has seen some success in the humanitarian sector, such as the UNHCR’s pilot project providing stablecoins to Ukrainians and trials by the Kenya Red Cross. While blockchain can make money transfers faster and easier, it also introduces new burdens for small NGOs. The proposed adoption of blockchain at USAID aims to tie funding to results, but some employees argue this approach may not be flexible enough in disaster or conflict zones. Critics, like Linda Raftree, feel this push supports claims of corruption within USAID, even though the agency already pays based on completed work.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|REGULATION|ASIA|DOGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-21 03:24:40

The impersonation scam involves the fraudsters sending out messages through text and encrypted messaging platforms by impersonating a Binance representative, telling users of a crypto account breach and instructing them to set up a new wallet, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) said in a March 21 statement. The text messages look real at first glance because they appear in the same legitimate text message thread as Binance communications. Australia’s federal police say they have found at least 130 people who have been targeted by this scam so far. Source: Australian federal police “The messages allegedly contained fake verification codes and were often ‘spoofed,' meaning they appeared in a legitimate existing message thread from the well-known cryptocurrency exchange,” the AFP said. “A support phone number was also sent, but when the targets called it, they were instructed to protect their accounts by transferring their cryptocurrency to a ‘trust wallet,' which was controlled by the scammer and allowed the assets to be stolen.” Online text messaging services allow messages to be sent from a Sender ID, such as a company name, rather than a phone number and can be exploited to spoof text messages, according to a March 1, 2019 report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Once a phone receives the sham communication, it’s reportedly grouped based on the Sender ID, appearing in the same thread as other messages with the same ID. The AFP says it conducted an email and text blitz to warn the 130 people they identified who might have been exposed to this scam. AFP Commander Cybercrime Operations Graeme Marshall said once the funds are transferred to the thief’s wallet , they are quickly transferred through a network of wallets, making seizure or recovery difficult. The attack mimics another string of scam messages reported by X users on March 14 , where fraudulent emails spoofing Coinbase and Gemini attempted to trick users into setting up a new wallet using pre-generated recovery phrases controlled by scammers. Related: Australia’s ‘Barefoot Investor’ takes on crypto scammers stealing his likeness The police said red flags for this type of scam include unsolicited contact from someone claiming to be from Binance about an account breach, pressure to act quickly and prompts for a seed phrase . Binance Chief Security Officer Jimmy Su said in the AFP statement scammers often impersonate trusted platforms , exploiting certain telecom loopholes to manipulate sender names and phone numbers. Su says Binance has a tool to confirm official Binance channels, and if in doubt, “stop and verify through official sources,” such as the contact information on the official website. Source: Binance Australia In December last year, the Australian government announced plans for an SMS Sender ID Register and an enforceable industry standard to crack down on similar scams, which have impacted Australian airline Qantas and tech giant Apple in the past. Under the standard, telecom companies must determine whether messages sent under a brand name correspond with the legitimate registered sender and submit and provide their legitimate Sender IDs for the register. The register is set to launch in late 2025, with a pilot SMS Sender ID Register operating as a stopgap in the meantime, according to Australia’s minister for communications, Michelle Rowland. In August last year, the AFP revealed that a total of 382 million Australian dollars ($269 million) had been lost by Australians to investment scams during the previous 12 months, with around 47% of them being crypto-related.

This hearing is happening in Washington, and if confirmed, Atkins would replace Mark Uyeda, who’s been holding the seat in an acting capacity since January. Atkins previously served as an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008. After his time at the agency, he founded Patomak Global Partners, a consulting firm based in Washington, D.C. His return to the SEC comes at a time when the agency is already in the middle of major changes, many of which affect the crypto industry. If confirmed, Atkins is expected to pull back enforcement actions and make it easier for private companies to go public. Senate to review crypto-related nominees alongside Atkins The confirmation hearing won’t just be about Atkins. The Senate panel is also reviewing Jonathan Gould, a partner at Jones Day, who is being nominated to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Gould previously worked as chief counsel and senior deputy comptroller at the OCC before joining the law firm. The committee will also consider Luke Pettit, who has been nominated to be the assistant secretary for financial institutions at the U.S. Treasury Department. The focus is mainly on Atkins because of the SEC’s new direction, especially when it comes to crypto. Acting chair Uyeda has already rolled out a number of changes this year while Atkins waits for confirmation. Since January, the SEC has dropped more than 10 crypto-enforcement cases, including ones involving Kraken, Gemini, Robinhood, and TRON. The agency has also ended litigation tied to climate-reporting rules and allowed companies to easily block shareholder proposals they don’t like. Another big update came this week when the SEC stopped pursuing its appeal in the lawsuit against Ripple. The case has dragged on for four years and three months, according to Brad Garlinghouse, the company’s CEO. He said on Wednesday during the Digital Assets Summit in New York, “It’s been almost four years and about three months since the SEC originally sued us, certainly a painful journey in lots of ways.” He added, “I really deeply believed that we were going to be on the right side of the law and on the right side of history.” Garlinghouse didn’t hold back. He told the crowd, “The system just feels broken. That we had to fight this fight for the industry and you had an SEC attacking the industry, particularly the Ripple case. There were no victims, there was no investor loss. They were just not acting in good faith.” After the announcement, XRP spiked 10%, bringing the price to $2.49. This is the latest in a string of enforcement rollbacks by the SEC in 2025. None of the companies involved—Kraken, Gemini, Robinhood, or TRON—had to pay penalties in the dropped cases. Also on Thursday, the SEC publicly confirmed that Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining does not fall under U.S. securities laws. That applies to activity on networks like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance issued a formal clarification saying that PoW mining doesn’t meet the Howey Test, meaning it’s not considered an investment contract and doesn’t require registration under the Securities Act. The clarification only applies to public blockchain networks and only to mining-related activities. The commission stated that individuals and mining pools don’t need to register any transactions connected to mining. This move gives miners legal clarity for the first time and removes the fear of being hit with securities violations just for operating rigs. This news came after the SEC confirmed that memecoins do not count as securities. That stance, combined with the dismissal of crypto-related enforcement cases and the latest confirmation on PoW mining, signals a full 180 on how the SEC is handling crypto under Uyeda—and potentially under Atkins, too. If the Senate confirms Atkins, he’s expected to continue this path. That includes cutting back enforcement, making IPO approvals faster, and writing clear rules for crypto instead of just suing companies. Every action this year points to a lighter, rule-based approach, not the old strategy of regulation through lawsuits. With Atkins’ background in financial consulting, his time at the SEC and the fact that he’s been a Bitcoin investor since 2011, he’s seen as someone who understands how the agency works from the inside. But this time, his job won’t be to keep it running. It’ll be to change it—and fast. The Senate hearing on March 27 will determine whether that plan moves forward.

It’s built on blockchain technology, offering a decentralized alternative to TradFi (traditional financial) services. From lending and borrowing to DEXs (decentralized exchanges) and yield farming, DeFi aims to democratize finance, making it more accessible, efficient and transparent. In this guest post, we’ll explore what DeFi is, the key innovations driving its growth, the challenges it faces and what the future holds for the DeFi ecosystem. What is DeFi DeFi refers to a set of financial services built on blockchain platforms, particularly Ethereum , which operate without the need for traditional intermediaries like banks, brokers or payment processors. These services are powered by smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code and are accessible to anyone with an internet connection. DeFi includes applications such as the following. Lending and borrowing platforms – Where users can earn interest by lending their cryptocurrency and borrowing at competitive rates DEXs – Where users can trade cryptocurrencies directly without the need for intermediaries Stablecoins – Cryptocurrencies that are pegged to stable assets like the US Dollar, providing stability in the volatile world of crypto Yield farming – T he process of earning rewards by providing liquidity to DEXs or other platforms. Unlike traditional finance, DeFi platforms are open to everyone, eliminating the need for intermediaries, which reduces costs and increases access to financial services for millions of people worldwide. The key innovations behind DeFi Several key innovations are driving the growth of DeFi and are likely to define its future. 1. Smart contracts Smart contracts are the backbone of DeFi. These contracts automatically execute, enforce or verify the terms of a contract when predefined conditions are met, removing the need for a trusted intermediary. They allow financial agreements to be executed with complete transparency and security, without relying on banks or financial institutions. Smart contracts have enabled the rise of decentralized lending, borrowing and automated market-making. 2. Liquidity pools Liquidity pools are essential to the functioning of decentralized exchanges. They allow users to collect their tokens into a pool and earn a share of the trading fees in return. This decentralized method of creating liquidity has greatly improved the accessibility and functionality of DEXs, ensuring that users can trade assets without waiting for buyers or sellers. 3. DAOs (Decentralized autonomous organizations) DAOs are governance structures that enable the decentralized management of DeFi protocols. Through DAOs, token holders can vote on important decisions, including protocol upgrades, fee structures and treasury management. This innovative approach ensures that decisions are made collectively and transparently – in line with the interests of the community. 4. Stablecoins Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to a stable asset, such as the US Dollar or gold, to maintain a stable value. They address one of the main concerns about cryptocurrencies – their volatility. By using stablecoins, users can store value, make transactions, and interact with DeFi protocols while avoiding the price fluctuations of typical cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The challenges faced by DeFi While DeFi has immense potential, it’s not without its challenges. Here are some key obstacles it faces. 1. Security risks DeFi protocols are primarily driven by smart contracts, and while these contracts are designed to be secure, vulnerabilities can still be exploited. High-profile hacks and bugs in code have resulted in the loss of millions of dollars in user funds. This makes the space risky, especially for newcomers who may not fully understand the technical nuances. 2. Regulatory uncertainty Since DeFi operates outside traditional financial institutions, it faces regulatory challenges. Governments around the world are still grappling with how to regulate DeFi activities, such as lending, borrowing and trading, especially given the cross-border nature of the ecosystem. The regulatory environment will likely evolve, and how regulators approach DeFi could have a significant impact on its future growth. 3. Scalability issues Currently, many DeFi applications run on the Ethereum blockchain, which, while highly secure, is often criticized for being slow and expensive, especially during periods of high demand. While Ethereum 2.0 aims to address these issues by shifting to a PoS (proof-of-stake) consensus mechanism, scalability remains a critical challenge that will need to be addressed for DeFi to achieve widespread adoption. The future of DeFi The future of DeFi is incredibly promising, and several key developments are likely to shape its evolution. 1. Interoperability between blockchains One of the biggest limitations of DeFi today is that most applications are confined to the Ethereum blockchain. However, interoperability between blockchains is improving, allowing DeFi protocols to expand across multiple networks, such as Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain and Avalanche. This will enable DeFi to grow in terms of both accessibility and liquidity. 2. Layer-two solutions To address scalability issues, layer-two solutions such as Optimism, Arbitrum and Polygon are already helping to scale DeFi by providing faster and cheaper transactions while still relying on the security of the Ethereum network. As these solutions mature, we can expect DeFi applications to become more efficient, leading to greater adoption. 3. Institutional participation As DeFi continues to grow, we can expect more institutional players to enter the space. Institutional investors, hedge funds and traditional financial institutions are already exploring DeFi as an alternative investment and lending vehicle. This could bring a wave of new capital into the space, further accelerating growth. 4. Improved security protocols As the DeFi space matures, security will become even more critical. Developers and security experts will work on improving the security of smart contracts and creating more robust auditing and monitoring tools to prevent hacks and fraud. Increased collaboration with cybersecurity firms will be essential for building trust in DeFi. Conclusion The rise of DeFi has opened up new possibilities for users to take control of their financial assets without relying on centralized intermediaries. With innovations like smart contracts, liquidity pools and stablecoins, DeFi is poised to revolutionize traditional financial systems. However, challenges such as security risks, regulatory uncertainty and scalability issues remain, and these must be addressed for DeFi to reach its full potential. The future of DeFi looks bright, with greater interoperability, institutional participation and improved security protocols on the horizon. As the space continues to evolve, the potential for DeFi to democratize finance and create a more inclusive financial ecosystem is immense. It’s an exciting time to be involved in the world of DeFi, and its impact on the financial sector will only continue to grow.

As of recent market data, Pi has lost more than 18% in the last 24 hours, raising concerns among investors. If PI fails to maintain its $0.95 support level, further declines could push the coin to as low as $0.87. On the other hand, a shift in sentiment could see it rise back to $1.34 and beyond, but bulls face a difficult challenge to regain momentum. Why is Pi Coin Falling? Several factors have contributed to Pi Coin’s sharp decline in value, and the situation has left investors scrambling for answers. Binance and Coinbase Listing Failures A factor behind Pi’s downfall is the delay in listing the coin on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Both platforms previously teased the possibility of listing PI, sparking speculation and optimism among investors. However, the failure of these listings to materialize has dampened sentiment, leading to a drop in demand for Pi Coin. The lack of official exchange listings has left many to question the coin’s future and viability in the broader market. Decreasing Supply and Deflationary Pressures Although Pi Network has not formally announced a coin burn, the supply of Pi is steadily shrinking. Several mechanisms have contributed to this decrease: Transaction Fees : Pi’s transaction fees are burned permanently, with over 528,671 PI tokens burned by early March at a rate of 3,000–4,000 tokens daily. While this may sound beneficial from a supply reduction perspective, the deflationary pressure has not been enough to offset the broader market sentiment surrounding the coin. Unverified Accounts : Tokens held by users who missed the Know Your Customer (KYC) deadline have been burned, further reducing the coin’s total supply. As of now, the circulating supply stands at approximately 6.8 billion PI tokens. These measures aim to address fake and abandoned accounts, but they have also intensified the perception of a decreasing supply. Investor Sentiment: FUD or a Genuine Concern? The drop in Pi Coin’s value has sparked widespread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the market. Sentiment has worsened by 80% within a single day, with some users even claiming “manipulation” and “panic” selling. Trading volume has decreased by 37%, signaling a reduction in market activity.",Short News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-21 03:46:11

This marks a 2.7% increase in the past week, slowly recovering from previous losses. While the broader market remains cautious, investors appear to now be closely monitoring whether BTC can sustain its upward trend or if further corrections are on the horizon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Transfer Count Lowest Since 2023—Is This Bearish? Bitcoin Bullish Indicators Emerges Amid the ongoing Bitcoin price movement, CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan has provided insights into the current market structure. In a recent post titled “Past Bull Cycle vs. Current Market”, Dan examined the similarities between previous market cycles and the present conditions. He highlighted that while bear market phases often feel like prolonged downturns, they also present key accumulation opportunities. Dan explained that in past market cycles, significant stop-loss movements signaled major sell-offs, leading to prolonged bearish sentiment. However, in the current cycle, such massive liquidations have not occurred, and Bitcoin’s recent drop remains within the standard 30% correction range. He noted that while some fear the onset of a bear market, broader macroeconomic trends suggest that the bull cycle is still intact. “과거 상승사이클과 현재 시장” 암호화폐 시장의 하락사이클에서는 첫번째 지표처럼 엄청난 크기의 손절의 움직임이 여러번 나옵니다. 누가봐도 하락사이클로 인식이 되고 시장이 망했다는 생각이 들 정도가 됩니다. 그리고 그 최악의 구간은 약 1년간 지속됩니다. 하지만 그 최악의 구간에서… pic.twitter.com/eQvd7yA2rn — Crypto Dan (@DanCoinInvestor) March 20, 2025 The analyst further pointed out that short-term uncertainties, such as geopolitical tensions and trade disputes, may be influencing market sentiment. However, once these factors subside, the market could see a strong rally. The analyst noted: Uncertainty in the market is an unavoidable element that will always accompany the investment landscape. Therefore, we analyze and respond to the market while managing risk. Exchange Outflows Indicate Re-Accumulation Another CryptoQuant analyst, CryptoOnCain, provided additional insight by highlighting Bitcoin’s highest exchange outflow on a 90-day moving average since January 2023. This data suggests that Bitcoin is being withdrawn from exchanges at a rapid pace, a sign that investors could be accumulating BTC rather than preparing to sell. Historically, such significant outflows have preceded bullish moves, as reduced exchange supply tends to create upward pressure on price. Related Reading: The Fed Blinked — The Bitcoin Bull Run Return Is Now Inevitable The analyst noted that a similar pattern was observed in early 2023 when Bitcoin hit its lowest price in that cycle before rallying. If this trend continues, it could indicate a shift toward stronger market confidence in BTC’s long-term potential.

U.S. markets are falling across the board while funds chase returns in countries most investors have stopped paying attention to. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) is up more than 7% this year, and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA), which tracks developed markets outside North America, has jumped over 11%. At the same time, all three major U.S. indexes are down. The Nasdaq Composite has fallen into correction territory. The S&P 500 briefly dropped into correction, too. The Russell 2000, which covers smaller U.S. companies, is almost in a bear market with a drop nearing 20% from its recent high. Investors started backing away from U.S. stocks as Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies bounced between threats and backpedals. That shook confidence in both consumers and businesses. The market saw it clearly. Big firms started warning clients that the U.S. was no longer the safest play. Citigroup, Bank of America, HSBC, and BCA pull back on U.S. bets Citigroup cut its U.S. stock rating from overweight to neutral earlier this month. Dirk Willer, one of their strategists, told clients, “The news flow from the U.S. economy is likely to undershoot the [rest of the world] in coming months, and at least tactically, U.S. exceptionalism is therefore unlikely to roar back.” That’s straight from their client note. Michael Hartnett at Bank of America had already warned in January that U.S. strength was topping out. He pointed to falling fiscal stimulus and a fading edge over other markets. HSBC and BCA Research also lowered their views on the U.S. around the same time. Nobody’s calling it safe anymore. Jeremy Folsom, an analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, broke it down in a research note this week. “While U.S. stocks have performed well in recent history, investors who remain concentrated within just a single market may leave their portfolios vulnerable to country-specific risks, such as shifts in political regimes and other idiosyncratic factors,” he wrote. Jeremy added, “We have encouraged investors to remain invested in developed market (DM) equities, given the attractive valuations, and emerging market (EM) equities, for potential growth. We believe that both can help to provide diversification to portfolios.” Germany rallies as Trump threatens NATO, and China jumps on defense boost Investors aren’t just running from the U.S. They’re finding reasons to go long in places like Germany and China. Germany’s DAX index is up more than 15% in 2025. That came after the German government approved new spending on infrastructure and defense. Why? Because Trump signaled that he might pull back U.S. support for NATO. According to NBC News, the Trump administration is considering stepping away from NATO command, a role the U.S. has held since Eisenhower. That kind of move has major consequences, and investors are watching every headline. With Germany approving more military and public spending, investors think the country could finally break out of its long slump. Germany just barely avoided recession in 2023 and 2024. The country’s move to spend more has started lifting market sentiment. The STOXX Europe 600, which tracks European stocks more broadly, is also up about 9% this year, mostly thanks to the rally in Germany. Trevor Yates at Global X said this will likely reach more parts of the economy. “I think it’ll have kind of a trickle-down effect on the rest of the economy and then different sectors as well. It will affect consumers, I think, down the line as well, just given how much pressure they’ve been over the past couple years.” Trevor also said Global X is telling investors to look at group-based strategies like ETFs because “the whole economy should see these benefits.” Over in China, stocks are soaring even faster. The iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) has gained around 21% in 2025. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI) is up more than 22%. Investors are coming back after Beijing approved a 7.2% increase in defense spending to “firmly safeguard” national security. The rally also got a push from rising interest in DeepSeek, which helped bring investors back to Chinese tech and innovation. The possible return of Trump tariffs has added fuel to these global markets. Investors don’t think the tariffs are just a bluff this time. They’re starting to act like real policy. That means the trade system could be changing fast. And Wall Street is not waiting around to find out how bad it gets. Analysts warn of deeper realignment if U.S. economy stumbles Katie Stockton at Fairlead Strategies said international stocks could keep outperforming the U.S. this year. “We do think that international markets have the potential to do better than the U.S. for much of this year,” Katie said. “That doesn’t mean they’re buys right here and now, but perhaps somewhere, people might want to build some relative exposure into the next downdraft and develop global Europe versus US.” Dario Perkins at TS Lombard wrote a note titled “Is the U.S. now uninvestable.” That’s the tone right now. Dario wrote, “Three months ago, investors were convinced that Trump 2.0 would make a bad situation in Europe and China even worse. Instead, Trump has become a catalyst for big policy changes.” He said both Germany and China had already responded and more countries would follow. “It is still early days, and there may be setbacks, but these policy shifts could mark the start of a major realignment in international trade and a genuine rebalancing of global demand.” But he ended with a warning: “Make no mistake – a US recession would bring down the entire world.” That’s where things stand. Trump’s policies are causing global money to move. Countries that used to get ignored are now pulling in capital. This isn’t some short-term strategy. It’s the result of economic data, policy moves, and hard numbers. No one’s calling the U.S. uninvestable yet, but they’re clearly not betting on it anymore. And if Trump keeps pushing on trade and defense, expect the money to keep flowing out. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The SEC has decided not to pursue further legal action, confirming that Ripple is no longer under threat from the regulatory body. This decision has had an immediate impact on XRP’s price, which surged following the announcement. The legal saga, which began with the SEC’s claim that Ripple violated securities laws by selling XRP, has been a major point of contention in the cryptocurrency space. Despite a series of favorable rulings for Ripple, the SEC continued to appeal in January 2024, even after the resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. The ongoing legal challenges frustrated Ripple and its supporters, especially since the court had already ruled in Ripple’s favor, declaring that XRP is not a security. Where Is The Official SEC Statement? While Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC seems to have come to an end, some are still waiting for the official word from the SEC itself. A user raised a valid point, questioning why there hasn’t been an official statement yet from the SEC about dropping the appeal against Ripple. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett responded, explaining that the SEC still needs to formally approve the withdrawal of its appeal. Once the Commission gives the green light, they can expect a press release similar to the one issued earlier this year when the SEC dismissed its lawsuit against Coinbase. https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1902806790254817454 Terrett added that the SEC typically addresses matters of litigation and enforcement during their closed meetings.

Paul Atkins, a known supporter of digital assets, is set to appear before the Senate Banking Committee on March 27 for his confirmation hearing. If approved, he could take over as SEC Chair as early as April. His nomination signals a big shift from the tough enforcement approach seen under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. A New Era for Crypto Regulation? Eleanor Terrett reports that Donald Trump’s SEC Chair nominee, Paul Atkins, is set to face the Senate Banking Committee for his nomination hearing next Thursday. Alongside him, Jonathan Gould, Trump’s pick for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), will also have his hearing. However, Atkins is no stranger to the SEC—he’s served as a commissioner before and has spent years advising on financial compliance. Unlike past regulators, he believes in a more balanced approach to crypto oversight, focusing on growth rather than aggressive crackdowns. The SEC’s Softened Approach Since stepping in on January 20, Interim Chair Mark Uyeda has made big moves that have given the crypto industry some breathing room. A crypto task force, led by Republican SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, was formed last month to address key regulatory issues, including defining which crypto assets qualify as securities. Several lawsuits against major platforms—like Coinbase, Uniswap, Robinhood Crypto, OpenSea, and Kraken—have been dropped. And just this week, the SEC finally closed its long-running case against Ripple, removing one of the biggest regulatory threats to XRP. Meanwhile, the agency is also reviewing over 60 spot crypto ETF proposals, signaling potential shifts in its approach to crypto regulation. Trump’s Crypto Push Atkins isn’t the only sign of change. President Trump has been pushing a more crypto-friendly agenda, recently signing an executive order to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Some experts believe this reserve could soon expand to include altcoins like XRP, signaling broader government acceptance of digital assets. Warnings from Experts Not everyone is on board with the SEC’s restructuring. According to a Bloomberg report , legal and academic experts are raising alarms over the SEC’s restructuring, warning that major staff and leadership cuts could weaken investor protection and market stability. A group of top academics, including Joel Seligman, compared the situation to the period before the 2008 financial crisis when weak oversight led to market failures. They fear that if the SEC loses its grip to enforce regulations, bad actors in the financial markets could take advantage, putting investors at greater risk.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-21 05:08:45

The exchange wants clear rules that distinguish digital assets from traditional securities and is urging Congress to take the lead in defining regulatory boundaries. The Call for Clearer Rules It’s a new day for crypto in America: White House Crypto Summit Overwhelming bipartisan support in the House and Senate to repeal the DeFi broker rule Big steps by the bank regulators to end Operation Choke Point 2.0 Bipartisan stablecoin framework bill advanced out… — Faryar Shirzad (@faryarshirzad) March 20, 2025 SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce recently asked for industry input on crypto regulations, and Coinbase responded with a detailed roadmap. The exchange argues that the SEC’s current approach creates uncertainty, making it difficult for businesses and investors to navigate the space. According to Coinbase’s chief policy officer, Faryar Shirzad, a well-structured and transparent framework will provide certainty for developers, clear guidelines for industry players, and strong protections for investors. Shirzad praised Ripple for securing a huge legal victory against the SEC. He congratulated CEO Brad Garlinghouse and legal head Stuart Alderoty for standing their ground. He pointed out that the SEC dropping its appeal confirms a key legal point—crypto tokens themselves aren’t investment contracts. Shirzad slammed Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler for misleading the public on this for years, saying Ripple’s fight has finally cleared things up. Now, he says it’s time for Congress to step in and create proper rules for crypto. He credited Ripple for pushing the law forward and helping bring clarity to the industry. Separating Crypto from Traditional Securities In his blog post he addressed one of the key issues of SEC’s classification theory and how digital assets are classified. It believes that cryptocurrencies that don’t represent ownership in a business should be treated as commodities, not securities. This distinction is crucial because it would allow financial markets to integrate blockchain-based assets more smoothly, improving liquidity and efficiency. Plus, Coinbase is pushing back against the SEC’s stance that secondary market sales of digital commodities should be considered securities transactions. It argues that once an asset is in circulation, its trades should not fall under securities laws, making it easier for crypto assets to move freely in the market. Congress Should Take the Lead Coinbase also believes that broader crypto regulations shouldn’t be left solely to the SEC. Instead, it’s calling on Congress to set the foundation for how digital assets are governed. The exchange argues that lawmakers, not regulators, should define the boundaries and resolve existing uncertainties in the industry.

McCullough studied Polymarket's historical data and removed markets with probabilities above 90% or below 10% after outcomes were already known but not yet settled, to keep the analysis accurate, according to a Dune dashboard summary. Polymarket slightly but consistently overestimates event probabilities across most ranges, potentially due to biases like acquiescence bias, herd mentality, low liquidity, and participant preference for high-risk bets, McCullough's research found. Longer-term markets, ones that ask bettors to consider an event far-out, look more accurate because they include many outcomes that are clearly unlikely, making predictions easier, McCullough explained in an interview with Polymarket's The Oracle blog . McCullough gives the example of Gavin Newsom becoming president (a question with $54 million in volume) during the last election to show that longer-term Polymarket markets often include obviously predictable outcomes, like Newsom clearly not winning, which boosts the platform’s accuracy numbers for these long-term predictions. In contrast, head-to-head sports markets, which have fewer extreme outcomes such as long-shot presidential candidates, and a more balanced distribution, present a clearer representation of predictive accuracy, McCullough found, showing notable improvements in accuracy as events unfold and revealing periodic accuracy spikes. Sports is a growing sector for Polymarket, with nearly $4.5 billion in collective volume wagered on the outcomes of the NBA, MLB, Champions League, and Premier League finals, according to data portal Polymarket Analytics. McCullough's findings about the accuracy of Polymarket are likely to be of interest in Ottawa, where Polymarket shows that new Liberal Party of Canada leader Mark Carney now has a significant lead over his Conservative rival Pierre Poilievre, even more than what poll aggregators are showing .",Markets|Polymarket,EN,0,0,MARKET|RESEARCH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-21 05:26:14

Since March 11, Dogecoin price has rebounded over 15 percent to trade at about $0.1721. Dogecoin price has depicted a high correlation with Bitcoin price, thus likely to rebound in the near future. Moreover, the crypto market is bound to significantly benefit from the easing yields in the U.S. bond market amid the ongoing bull rally for gold. Dogecoin Price Expectations From a technical analysis standpoint, Dogecoin price has been forming a macro rising trend, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. After a notable decline since the second inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, Dogecoin price has been retesting the lower border of a rising channel in the past two weeks. In the daily time frame, Dogecoin price has been forming an ascending triangle, after being trapped in a parallel falling trend. As a result, a consistent close above the resistant level around $0.178 will result in a 15-20 percent spike in the coming days to retest the upper border of the falling logarithmic trend. However, a consistent close below 16 cents could trigger further sell-off towards the next target of about 14 cents. Fundamental Outlook Dogecoin has grown to a vibrant memecoin ecosystem backed by institutional investors participating in mining processes and global merchants accepting it for payments. As of this writing, the Dogecoin network has about 6.2 million on-chain holders. According to on-chain data analysis, the Dogecoin network has recorded a significant spike in whale activities during the last week. In the past week, Dogecoin investors with an account balance of between 1 million and 10 million added around 110 million coins to currently hold about 10.44 billion.

At the Digital Asset Summit, Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin reiterated the central role of Layer-2 networks, emphasizing their importance in enhancing scalability and supporting next-generation applications. Meanwhile, major ETF issuers, including BlackRock and Bitwise, are pushing for regulatory approval to allow staking within Ethereum ETFs, a move that could improve investor returns and attract additional capital. However, these developments come amid growing concerns from investors. While Layer-2 adoption has reduced transaction fees, it has also led to a decline in Ethereum’s base-layer revenues, raising questions about its long-term sustainability. Similarly, Ethereum ETFs have experienced continued outflows, reflecting broader uncertainty in the market. As the ecosystem adapts to these shifts, Ethereum faces both new opportunities and economic challenges that will shape its future trajectory. The Push for Staking in Ethereum ETFs Gains Momentum as NYSE Arca Files Rule Change Proposal The landscape for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States is evolving rapidly, with a growing push to allow staking—a key feature that could enhance investment returns. On Thursday, this movement gained significant traction as NYSE Arca submitted a proposed rule change that, if approved, would permit Bitwise’s spot Ethereum ETF to engage in staking and earn yield. At the same time, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, voiced strong support for the inclusion of staking in Ethereum ETFs, stating that such a move could unlock additional demand and fundamentally change how investors interact with these products. Under the leadership of former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, the notion of staking within ETFs seemed like a nonstarter. The SEC had taken a hard stance on crypto staking, citing concerns over securities laws and potential risks to investors. When Ethereum ETFs were approved and launched in July 2024, they did so without staking capabilities, limiting their ability to generate additional yield for investors. BlackRock, Fidelity, and other issuers secured regulatory approval but had to forgo staking—a mechanism that allows Ethereum holders to participate in securing the blockchain network while earning passive rewards. However, the regulatory climate is shifting. With a more crypto-friendly government now in place, optimism is growing that Ethereum ETFs could soon be granted permission to stake their holdings. If approved, the rule change would mark a major milestone in the evolution of crypto investment products, allowing ETFs to generate revenue beyond just price appreciation. Staking has long been a central component of Ethereum’s ecosystem since the network transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake (PoS) in 2022. The PoS mechanism allows investors to lock up their ETH in the network to help validate transactions, and in return, they receive rewards in the form of additional ETH. For traditional investors, this represents a significant opportunity. Currently, the average staking yield for Ethereum hovers between 3-5% annually—an attractive incentive that could make spot Ethereum ETFs more appealing, particularly in comparison to their Bitcoin counterparts, which lack staking capabilities. The push to incorporate staking into ETFs aligns with growing institutional interest in Ethereum as a yield-generating asset. “There are a lot of fairly complex challenges that have to be figured out, but if that can get figured out, then it’s going to be sort of a step change upward in terms of what we see the activity around those products is,” Mitchnick added. NYSE Arca’s recent filing is not the only proposal in favor of staking-enabled ETFs. Grayscale, 21Shares, and Fidelity have already submitted similar proposals, indicating strong demand from multiple issuers. If the SEC greenlights these rule changes, Ethereum ETFs would become more competitive with traditional yield-bearing assets such as dividend-paying stocks, corporate bonds, and real estate investment trusts (REITs). This could potentially draw more institutional capital into Ethereum, further legitimizing its role in the broader financial market. Despite the excitement, Ethereum ETFs still lag significantly behind Bitcoin ETFs in terms of market demand. BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF holds approximately $2.3 billion in assets under management (AUM), compared to nearly $48 billion in AUM for the firm’s Bitcoin ETF. Regulatory Hurdles and Potential Roadblocks While momentum is building, significant regulatory hurdles remain. The SEC has historically been cautious about staking, often associating it with securities-related risks. The agency has taken enforcement actions against crypto firms engaged in staking services, citing concerns over investor protection and opaque financial structures. For Ethereum ETFs to be granted staking privileges, ETF issuers will likely need to provide detailed disclosures about how staking rewards will be managed, how risks will be mitigated, and how investor funds will be safeguarded. Additionally, the SEC may seek assurances that staking within ETFs does not lead to unintentional classification of ETH as a security. The debate over whether Ethereum should be classified as a commodity or a security has persisted for years, and any regulatory misclassification could have wide-ranging implications for the industry. Joe Lubin Champions Layer-2 Scaling as Ethereum Faces Investor Skepticism In related news, Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin took center stage at the Digital Asset Summit, reinforcing the pivotal role of Layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions in Ethereum’s long-term vision. Speaking in an interview, Lubin stressed that the Ethereum network is uniquely positioned to remain the dominant force in blockchain infrastructure, thanks to its extensive security guarantees and mature ecosystem. Lubin further highlighted another emerging Layer-2 solution, MegaETH, which he believes will contribute to Ethereum’s scalability and efficiency. His remarks shed light on Ethereum’s strategy of fostering Layer-2 development rather than competing with newer Layer-1 chains, many of which have struggled to gain the same level of trust and adoption. However, while Ethereum’s leadership continues to bet on Layer-2 expansion, some investors remain skeptical about its long-term implications—particularly in relation to Ethereum’s economic model and the sustainability of its revenue streams. Ethereum’s Layer-2 networks, which include rollups and sidechains, have seen an explosive rise in adoption. According to L2Beat , there are now more than 140 unique Ethereum scaling solutions, with over 60 rollup networks in operation. These scaling solutions reduce congestion on the Ethereum mainnet by processing transactions off-chain while still settling security proofs back to Ethereum’s Layer-1. However, investors and analysts have raised concerns that Layer-2 networks could be undermining Ethereum’s core economic value rather than enhancing it. Critics argue that these solutions divert transaction fees away from Ethereum’s mainnet, reducing its revenue and potentially weakening its security model. A stark example of this came with the Dencun upgrade, implemented in March 2024, which drastically lowered gas fees for Layer-2 transactions. While this improved usability for Ethereum users, it had an unexpected downside—Ethereum’s base layer revenue collapsed by 99% by September 2024. Ethereum’s gas fees, once a significant source of validator revenue, have plummeted by 95% since Dencun’s implementation. This has raised concerns that Ethereum’s long-term economic sustainability may depend on alternative revenue models, such as maximal extractable value (MEV) or Ethereum ETFs incorporating staking yields. Ethereum Price Struggles The Ethereum network’s economic shift has coincided with significant price volatility in Ether (ETH), with the cryptocurrency experiencing a prolonged downtrend in 2025. Since peaking earlier in the year, ETH’s price dropped to $1,759 on March 11, reflecting broader market concerns and a risk-off sentiment among institutional investors. Analysts warn that Ethereum’s price trajectory remains uncertain, with some forecasting a continued decline in 2025 unless new bullish catalysts emerge.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-21 05:30:00

Their analyses, while conducted on different timeframes, both highlight breakouts from constrictive patterns that have prevented any major swings over the last few weeks. Dogecoin Could Surge 16% (1-Hour Chart) Ali Martinez presented a one-hour Dogecoin chart on X that shows the token trading within a narrowing range defined by a symmetrical triangle. According to Martinez, DOGE initially saw a steep decline—approximately 16.46%—from around $0.18, dropping just above $0.14 before recovering and forming progressively higher lows. The upper limit of the triangle rests near $0.18, while the lower support line extends upward from the vicinity of $0.144. Martinez points to the $0.16–$0.18 corridor as a key area that has contained Dogecoin’s price action. He remarks that a clear and convincing hourly close above this zone might release the buying pressure that has been consolidating over the past ten days. Citing symmetrical triangle theory, Martinez estimates that such a breakout could spark a 16% upswing from the breakout point. “Dogecoin will break out! A close outside $0.16-$0.18 could trigger a 16% price move,” Martinez wrote via X. Related Reading: Dogecoin Shark & Whale Population Rises—Price Turnaround Incoming? Falling Wedge Breakout (1-Day Chart) CW, on the other hand, shared a daily Dogecoin chart illustrating what he interprets as a falling wedge formation stretching back to December 2024, when DOGE briefly climbed to around $0.48 before reversing course into a prolonged downtrend. In a falling wedge, the price typically forms lower highs and lower lows, converging toward a narrowing apex. CW notes that Dogecoin has finally crossed above the wedge’s downward-sloping resistance line yesterday, an event widely viewed as a bullish reversal signal once the breakout is confirmed by subsequent candles holding above that line. Related Reading: Dogecoin At Make-Or-Break Point After Multi-Year Trendline Test CW’s analysis relies heavily on Fibonacci retracements drawn from DOGE’s most recent major upswing. He identifies crucial Fibonacci levels at $0.2027 (the 0.236 retracement), $0.2564 (the 0.382 retracement), $0.2999 (the 0.5 retracement), $0.3433 (the 0.618 retracement), $0.40513 (the 0.786 retracement), and $0.4839 (the 1.0 retracement). These levels often serve as potential price floors or ceilings in either bullish or bearish market environments. CW believes that now that the token has escaped its descending wedge, it could climb through these retracement levels in succession, provided the broader market remains supportive. Ultimately, he sets his sights on the 1.618 Fibonacci extension at $0.71. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.17.

The announcement , made on Mar. 20 in a press release, indicates DTCC’s growing engagement with blockchain-based financial solutions. ERC-3643, also known as the T-REX protocol, is an open-source smart contract standard designed for issuing and managing permissioned tokens. It ensures that only authorized users, even on public blockchains, can hold these assets by using a decentralized identity framework. More than 40 tokens have been developed and managed using the standard, which has been used to tokenize $28 billion worth of assets across more than 180 jurisdictions. ERC-3643 will be integrated into DTCC’s ComposerXTM platform, which includes ComposerX Factory, a tokenization engine for managing financial data. This integration aims to improve risk management, security, and compliance in digital asset markets while reducing operational costs and complexity.

It has been testing blockchain applications, such as tokenized private asset tokenization on an Avalanche ( AVAX ) subnet and tokenized U.S. Treasury Bill settlements on the Canton Network. The support from DTCC indicates that American regulators are becoming more receptive to blockchain-based finance. In a related development, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has also been exploring blockchain applications. To discuss the launch of its pilot program for digital asset markets, it announced on Feb. 7 that it would host a CEO Forum with prominent industry leaders such as Circle ( USDC ), Coinbase, Crypto.com, MoonPay, and Ripple ( XRP ). Stablecoins and other tokenized non-cash collateral are to be tested as part of the initiative.

42082060,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=697168,1742535504,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42082060.jpeg,XRP and Mt. Gox’s Jed McCaleb is using his crypto fortune to fund a $1B space station,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jed-mccaleb-crypto-fortune-1b-space-station/,"Jed McCaleb, the same guy who created XRP and started Mt. Gox, is now paying out of pocket to get a private space station into orbit. The company building it is called Vast. Jed is the only person paying for the whole thing. No investors. No partners. Just him. The project could get him a huge NASA contract in 2026. That deal would be worth billions. If it doesn’t happen, Jed says he’s totally fine with losing a billion. As of December 2024, he controlled $3.3 billion through two private foundations he fully funded himself. “It’s super important that people take this leap from where we are today to this potential world where there’s a lot of people living off the Earth,” Jed said from Vast’s headquarters in Long Beach, California. “There’s not that many folks that are willing to dedicate the amount of resources and time and risk tolerance that I am.” Jed is 50 years old. He grew up on a farm in Arkansas. He dropped out of the University of California at Berkeley. He’s never worked in aerospace. He made all his money by getting into new tech early and getting out before the government showed up. Vast was founded in 2021. Jed hired Max Haot in 2023 to run the company as CEO. Max is now leading the team that’s building a prototype station called Haven-1. Jed comes down from San Francisco once a week. He still owns the company fully. Max drives a Cybertruck. Jed drives a Model 3. Vast works with SpaceX to launch Haven-1 by 2026 Vast is working with SpaceX to send its hardware into space. The company already booked SpaceX launches for its modules and for astronaut crew missions. SpaceX agreed to carry astronauts on behalf of Vast as long as NASA gives approval. Vast is also using SpaceX parts to build its station. That includes a docking adapter for the Dragon capsule and a Wi-Fi system that will work in space using Starlink. NASA plans to retire the International Space Station by the end of 2030. Elon Musk has said that timeline should move faster. Vast wants to be ready before it’s gone. If they can get Haven-1 up first, and if it works, they could win NASA’s contract to keep astronauts in orbit. That would mean a steady stream of money. Vast is building Haven-1 right now. The station will be about 33 feet tall and 14.5 feet wide. It’ll fit inside a Falcon 9 rocket. It’ll hold four people. Inside, it’ll have about 1,600 cubic feet of space. That’s twice the space in a regular RV. It will have separate sleeping areas, wood paneling, a big window, and a table for the crew to eat together. Construction started in January. The original launch date was set for August this year. That was delayed. Now they’re aiming for May 2026. They’ve already tested a prototype of the module to make sure it can hold pressure. The team is now working on power, propulsion, and everything else needed to support a live crew. Haven-1 won’t have the same life-support systems as the ISS. There will be no recycling of water or air. The station is designed for short stays. Max said, “Right now we are not a space station company. We are an aspiring space station company.” If the first mission works, Vast will send another module called Haven-2 in 2028. That’s supposed to be the start of a larger space base. It would grow into something big enough to fully replace the ISS. Haven-2 will eventually include recycling systems for water and oxygen. But that won’t happen right away. For the first few years, they don’t plan to have anyone live up there permanently. Max met Jed in 2022 while looking for investors for Launcher, his rocket startup. Launcher had raised $30 million. They had built a rocket engine and two satellites. Both of those satellites failed after they made it into space. Jed offered to buy the company instead of just investing. He told Max to take the role of president. Later, Max became CEO. He first said no, but then agreed after realizing Launcher couldn’t get the funding it needed. The terms of that deal were never shared. Jed’s crypto billions came from XRP, Ripple, and Mt. Gox Before building a space company, Jed was already rich from crypto. He launched Mt. Gox in 2010. It was one of the first Bitcoin exchanges. He sold most of it in 2011. In 2014, Mt. Gox crashed. It went bankrupt. Over $400 million worth of coins were lost. That made it the biggest crypto failure in history until FTX collapsed in 2023. Jed still had a small stake when it crashed. He said he lost money too. He wasn’t fined or charged. He moved on to XRP. He co-created the Ripple protocol. He also held 9% of all XRP when it launched. He had disagreements with his co-founders and left Ripple in 2013. But he kept his XRP and sold it slowly over the next decade. From 2014 to 2022, he made about $3.2 billion by selling XRP and Ripple shares. That’s according to XRPScan, which tracks transactions on the XRP Ledger. Nic Carter, founding partner at Castle Island Ventures, said, “He’s one of the top 10 most important crypto founders, even though nobody really knows him. The other ones are these pretty flamboyant, loud, extravagant people.” Jed doesn’t talk much. He works with the same people he always has. He still works with Sam Yagan, who started a file-sharing company with him more than 20 years ago. Sam called Jed a “deliberate risk-taker.” He said: “He’s hyperrational about these things. But he’s maybe slightly eccentric in his willingness to take what you and I would see as a lot of risks.” Jed’s first startup was eDonkey. It launched in 2000. It let users share music and movies online for free. The company made millions off ads. Then it got shut down in 2006 after Jed agreed to pay $30 million to the music industry to avoid lawsuits. He now splits his time between his house in Costa Rica and another one in Berkeley. He flies his own plane. Vast needs NASA’s contract to survive long term Vast wants to build more than just one station. They’re also working on artificial gravity. That would mean spinning modules that create a gravity-like effect using centrifugal force. The goal is to make space more livable long-term. Living in microgravity has caused health problems for astronauts, including weakened bones and muscles. But all of that is far away. Right now, they’re focused on getting Haven-1 into space. Vast has grown from fewer than 200 people to 740 in the last year. Their Long Beach facility runs 24 hours a day. Some teams are building the space station. Others are expanding the headquarters. Competitors like Axiom Space, Blue Origin, and Voyager Space are all building their own space stations too. But Jed is spending his own money. That gives Vast an edge. “Vast is the only one that’s coming up with a solution that is primarily self-funded and ready to go,” said Chad Anderson, managing partner at Space Capital. He has no stake in Vast but is invested in SpaceX. Even though they’re close to SpaceX, Jed said he doesn’t know Elon Musk well. “I’ve met him a couple of times—he probably wouldn’t remember me,” he said. Both Jed and Elon dropped out of school. Both started software companies in the early 2000s. Both invested in OpenAI. There’s already been one lawsuit against Vast. A former employee said they tried to cut corners. But it hasn’t stopped the project. The company hasn’t had major public scandals. Jed isn’t running around trying to take over government policy. He’s at home with his wife and three kids. Then he flies down to Long Beach once a week to see what’s going on. If Vast wins the NASA contract in 2026, the government will buy time on its stations. That deal is the only path to steady revenue. Without that, the company probably can’t survive. “It’s a matter of existence for us to win that competition,” Max said. Vast already booked more flights with SpaceX for future missions. Both Jed and Max said they’re willing to go to space themselves. “As a kid, I spent a lot of time outside exploring, looking up at the sky to see how amazing it is,” Jed said. The next two years will decide everything. Haven-1 is still being built. NASA is still reviewing. The contract decision is expected mid-2026. Until then, Jed’s still betting $1 billion that crypto money can build a space station. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump once again reaffirmed his commitment to crypto adoption in his recent speech at the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit. Additionally, Trump-linked executives at Renatus Tactical Acquisition Corp I are planning a $179 million SPAC deal to acquire a US-based crypto or blockchain firm. However, the Trump administration’s crypto-friendly policies have sparked mixed reactions, with some critics warning of potential centralization risks. Eric Trump Joins Metaplanet as Adviser Metaplanet, a Bitcoin-stacking firm based in Japan, appointed Eric Trump , the son of US President Donald Trump, to its newly formed strategic board of advisers. The company announced the decision on March 21, and believes that Trump's business expertise and commitment to Bitcoin adoption are key assets in its mission to become a global leader in the Bitcoin economy. Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich pointed out Trump's contributions, and stated that his experience in finance, real estate, and brand development, along with his strong ties to the Bitcoin community, will be instrumental in accelerating the company’s growth as a major Bitcoin Treasury Company. The appointment is part of Metaplanet’s broader strategy to assemble a board of influential people who are dedicated to advancing Bitcoin adoption worldwide. By bringing in high-profile business leaders and advocates, the firm plans to solidify its position in the digital asset space and expand its influence in global markets. Metaplanet share price (Source: Google Finance ) The news had an immediate impact on Metaplanet’s stock, which surged 17.8% to 4,730 Japanese yen ($31.74) in the first 80 minutes of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, according to Google Finance data . Investors seemed to respond very positively to the announcement, which signals that people have some confidence in the firm’s strategic direction and its growing Bitcoin reserves. Metaplanet currently holds about 3,050 Bitcoin, which is valued at approximately $4.1 billion. This makes it the 12th largest corporate Bitcoin holder, according to data from BitBo’s BitcoinTreasuries.NET . The company has been actively expanding its Bitcoin reserves through various financial instruments since its initial purchase on April 23 of 2024. With a clear focus on strengthening its Bitcoin position, Metaplanet mow plans to also align itself with industry leaders and advocates who share its vision for the future of Bitcoin. Donald Trump Speaks at Digital Asset Summit President Donald Trump is also still very focused on strengthening his administration’s ties with the cryptocurrency industry. In a pre-recorded address at the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit on March 20, Trump once again reaffirmed his commitment to making the United States the “crypto capital of the world.” He praised some of recent regulatory changes and placed a lot of emphasis on the role of blockchain pioneers when it comes to transforming the banking and payment system while enhancing privacy, security, and economic prosperity. He also talked about the importance of dollar-backed stablecoins in maintaining the dominance of the US dollar in global finance. Donald Trump’s video message at the Digital Asset Summit Since taking office, Trump signed multiple executive orders in support of digital assets, including the establishment of the Working Group on Digital Assets and a Bitcoin strategic reserve. His administration’s proactive stance was also demonstrated through the first-ever White House Crypto Summit on March 7, where key industry executives convened to talk about the future of cryptocurrency regulations. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reinforced the government’s focus on stablecoin regulations, and presented them as a means of sustaining the US dollar’s status as the global reserve currency. Bo Hines, who is executive director of the Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, confirmed that a stablecoin bill will likely be presented to Trump within the next two months. Despite the administration’s enthusiasm, the White House Crypto Summit received mixed reactions from the crypto community. Institutional investors largely welcomed the event as a historic milestone, while retail investors and Bitcoin supporters were more skeptical. Critics accused the gathering of catering to industry lobbyists promoting state-backed digital assets rather than fostering true decentralization. Bitcoin maximalist Justin Bechler labeled the summit as a “gathering of rent-seeking lobbyists pushing state-approved surveillance tokens.” The market response was also unfavorable, with Bitcoin dropping by more than 7% in the days after the summit and the announcement of the Bitcoin strategic reserve order. While Trump’s administration is taking concrete steps toward integrating digital assets into the financial system, there is still division in the crypto community over the long-term implications of these policies. For now, the industry can only wait for more developments that could shape the future of cryptocurrency adoption in the United States. Trump-Linked Firm Eyes Crypto Deals Meanwhile, three executives from Trump Media & Technology Group are leading a new company that may buy a US-based crypto or blockchain firm, due to the Trump administration’s strong support for the sector. Renatus Tactical Acquisition Corp I, a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) based in the Cayman Islands, is seeking to raise $179 million through public and private offerings, according to a regulatory filing on March 14, which was first reported by Forbes . Renatus Tactical plans to raise $178.94 million Eric Swider, the CEO of Renatus Tactical, is a director at Trump Media and previously served as the CEO of Digital World Acquisition Corp., the SPAC that facilitated Trump Media’s public listing. Alexander Cano, the operating chief of Renatus Tactical, was formerly the president of Digital World, while Devin Nunes, the CEO and chair of Trump Media, also serves as the chair of Renatus Tactical. While the company did not share any specific acquisition targets, it is exploring businesses related to data security and technology applications in both military and civilian sectors. Although it could acquire businesses globally, the SPAC intends to focus on high-potential companies based in the United States. Renatus Tactical pointed to the Trump administration’s recent moves to integrate digital assets into the US financial system, including an executive order issued in early March to establish a Bitcoin reserve and a crypto stockpile, as well as a January directive to form a working group to draft cryptocurrency regulations. The company acknowledged that its close ties to Trump Media could pose some challenges, as some businesses and service providers may be reluctant to engage because of its affiliation with the president. This issue already affected major corporations kike Tesla, whose stock fell by more than 40% this year due to backlash over CEO Elon Musk’s role as the White House cost-cutting czar. The controversy surrounding Musk’s position led to protests, including burned Tesla vehicles and vandalized dealerships across the United States. Donald Trump net worth (Source: Forbes ) Donald Trump maintains a majority stake in Trump Media, which operates the social media platform Truth Social. His net worth has been estimated at $4.8 billion by Forbes and over $6.5 billion by Bloomberg , with his 114.75 million shares in Trump Media accounting for a big portion of his wealth.

The volatility has shaken investor confidence, triggering millions of dollars in liquidations across both long and short positions. For the past few days, the overall cryptocurrency market has witnessed a price surge followed by a drop. This pattern has been ongoing for the last couple of weeks, leaving investors and traders confused. Current Price Momentum ADA is currently trading near $0.72 and has recorded a 2% price drop in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume declined by 25%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels With notable price fluctuations in recent days, ADA appears to be forming a symmetrical triangle pattern on the four-hour timeframe. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price momentum, if the asset breaks out of the pattern and closes a four-hour candle above the $0.74 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 13% to reach $0.83 in the near future. Besides this short-term price prediction, if the asset breaks down from the pattern and falls below $0.70, it could decline to the crucial support level of $0.65 in the coming days. Based on expert analysis, a potential breakout or breakdown will determine the price direction in the coming days.

The initial euphoria around the mainnet launch seems to be fading fast as the PI cryptocurrency extends its weekly losses to more than 43%. As a result, the altcoin has dropped out of the top 20 crypto list, from the 11th spot last week. Pi Network Euphoria Is Fading Quickly The euphoria surrounding Pi Coin seems to be fading quickly amid the consistent delays in Binance listing plans, which has been a major hit on the market sentiment. Another major common grievance among Pi Coin investors is the lack of a clear roadmap for the Open Mainnet launch. While other crypto projects have offered transparent timelines, Pi Network’s future plans are ambiguous. This has led to growing discussions about whether Pi is a scam. Clarifying it, Dr Altcoin , who’s been closely associated with the project said: Clearly, there is a lack of communication and transparency from the Pi Core Team, which can lead some to misconstrue the Pi Network as a scam. However, I have been involved with the project for many years and have not found sufficient evidence to label it as such. The analyst further stated that the Pi Core team needs to step up efforts in terms of effectively communicating with the Pi community and not leave gaps in the process. Where Is Pi Coin Price Heading Next? The Pi Coin price has been on a vertical fall over the past week, breaking under crucial support levels of $1.4, $1.2, and $1.0. This major correction comes ahead of the Pi token unlocking event this week. While token unlock has been a major concern for investors, a large number of Pioneers from the Pi Network community have also been locking their PI holdings off lately. For now, the next support for Pi Coin price stands at $0.82. Crypto market analyst Kripto Bilgi stated that the sentiment around this altcoin is very weak while predicting a fall to $0.30. Besides, a Pi price prediction also hints at a bearish phase ahead for the asset.

42082236,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142127,1742535967,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Fear Grips Crypto Market: Fear & Greed Index Plummets to 31 – Investor Alert!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-fear-3/,"Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts! The market mood has taken a noticeable turn. Just when we were settling into a neutral stance, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has dramatically shifted, signaling a wave of fear sweeping through the cryptocurrency landscape. Let’s dive into what this means for you and your crypto investments. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does It Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a crucial tool provided by Alternative.me, is designed to gauge market emotions. Think of it as a sentiment thermometer for the crypto world. It swings between 0 and 100, with 0 representing “Extreme Fear” and 100 indicating “Extreme Greed”. This index isn’t just some arbitrary number; it’s a composite score derived from several key market indicators, giving us a holistic view of the prevailing market sentiment . Here’s a breakdown of what fuels this index: Volatility (25%): Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 and 90 days. Unstable markets often breed fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares the current market momentum and volume to the last 30 and 90-day averages. Strong buying momentum can suggest greed, while weak momentum can indicate fear. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment trends on social media platforms, primarily focusing on crypto-related hashtags and engagement rates to understand the public mood. Surveys (15%): Conducts periodic crypto surveys to directly gauge investor sentiment and expectations. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s dominance in the overall crypto market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal a flight to safety during fearful times. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries to understand general public interest and curiosity. Sudden Plunge into the ‘Fear Zone’: What Triggered the Shift? As of March 21st, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stands at 31, a significant 18-point drop from the previous day. This sharp decline has pushed the index from the “Neutral” zone (previously hovering around 49) firmly into the “Fear” zone. But what’s behind this sudden shift in market sentiment ? Several factors could be contributing to this increased fear : Broader Economic Uncertainty: Global economic headwinds, including inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions, often spill over into the crypto markets, making investors risk-averse. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased regulatory discussions and actions around cryptocurrencies can create uncertainty and fear of potential clampdowns. Market Corrections: After periods of growth, market corrections are natural. These pullbacks can trigger fear, especially among newer investors who haven’t experienced market cycles. Negative News Flow: Any negative news, be it exchange hacks, project failures, or unfavorable macroeconomic data, can quickly amplify fear in the crypto market. Navigating the ‘Fear Zone’: What Does it Mean for Crypto Investors? Entering the ‘Fear’ zone isn’t necessarily a doomsday scenario. In fact, it can present both challenges and opportunities for crypto investors. Let’s break it down: Challenges: Emotional Decision Making: Fear can lead to impulsive selling, often at market lows. This is a classic pitfall in investing. Increased Volatility: Periods of fear often coincide with heightened crypto volatility . Price swings can be more dramatic and unpredictable. Potential for Further Downturn: Fear can be self-fulfilling. If enough investors panic and sell, it can indeed drive prices lower. Opportunities: Buying Opportunity?: Savvy investors often see ‘fear’ as a potential buying opportunity. As Warren Buffett famously said, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” Lower prices can mean a chance to accumulate assets at a discount. Cooling Off Period: After periods of exuberance (greed), a ‘fear’ phase can be a healthy market correction, setting the stage for more sustainable growth in the long run. Focus on Fundamentals: During fearful times, it’s crucial to revisit your investment thesis, focus on the fundamentals of the projects you believe in, and avoid being swayed by short-term market noise. Actionable Insights: How to Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in Your Strategy The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t a crystal ball, but it’s a valuable tool to add to your crypto investment toolkit. Here’s how you can use it effectively: Gauge Market Sentiment: Use it as a general indicator of overall market sentiment . Is the market feeling greedy or fearful? This can help you understand the prevailing mood. Contrarian Investing: Consider a contrarian approach. When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’, it might be a signal to cautiously explore buying opportunities. Conversely, ‘Extreme Greed’ might suggest caution and potential profit-taking. Risk Management: Be more cautious during ‘Fear’ periods. Reduce leverage, manage your portfolio risk, and avoid making rash decisions. Combine with Other Analysis: Don’t rely solely on the Fear & Greed Index. Use it in conjunction with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and news monitoring for a more comprehensive view. The Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Fearful Markets Bitcoin dominance , one of the components of the index, deserves special attention during periods of fear. Historically, when fear rises in the crypto market, investors tend to flock to Bitcoin as a perceived safer haven compared to altcoins. This often leads to an increase in Bitcoin’s dominance. Monitoring Bitcoin dominance alongside the Fear & Greed Index can provide further insights into the type of fear driving the market – is it a general crypto market pullback, or a specific altcoin-related concern? Is Crypto Volatility Exacerbating Fear? Yes, undoubtedly! Crypto volatility is a double-edged sword. While it presents opportunities for high gains, it also amplifies fear during downturns. The inherent crypto volatility means that price drops can be sharp and sudden, triggering stop-loss orders and further fueling panic selling. Understanding and managing your risk tolerance in the face of crypto volatility is paramount, especially when the Fear & Greed Index is signaling heightened anxiety.

According to Metaplanet, establishing the new board and Eric’s appointment will strengthen the company’s position in the larger Bitcoin economy. The firm expects Trump’s background in business, finance, and real estate to fuel the company’s growth further. Metaplanet’s Representative Director, Simon Gerovich even showed support for Trump’s appointment, claiming the business leader will be a valuable asset in advancing the company’s vision. Metaplanet plans to add more influential leaders to its Strategic Board of Advisors In its press release, Metaplanet asserted it would add more high-profile figures and thought leaders worldwide to its new board to drive Bitcoin adoption. Eric Trump is now the only known member of the board; however, the firm is soon to make other appointments. Eric Trump’s appointment, nevertheless, is expected to enhance the company’s hold in the Bitcoin market. Simon Grevich even commented, “We are honoured to welcome Eric Trump as our first board member of our Strategic Board of Advisors and look forward to welcoming him to our annual meeting.” He added that Trump’s business experience and love for the Bitcoin community will play a critical role in accelerating the firm’s vision of becoming one of the world’s leading Bitcoin Treasury Companies. Metaplanet bought 150 BTC on March 18, working towards its 21,000 BTC acquisition target by 2026 Metaplanet has also been actively purchasing Bitcoin in the past few days. On March 18, the Japanese firm bought about 150 Bitcoins for about 1.88 billion yen or $83,671 per Bitcoin. However, after the BTC purchase, its stock slid slightly by 0.5% on the day. Nonetheless, its shares picked up on March 21. For the first 80 minutes of the trading day on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the staking firm’s shares jumped 17.8% to 4,730 Japanese yen, roughly $31.74. Moreover, on March 5, the company purchased 497 BTC, and its stock price rose by almost 20% consecutively. Not to mention, the firm’s BTC yield from Jan. 1 to March 18 for the ongoing quarter was 60.8%, a smaller change from the previous quarter, which saw a yield of 310%. So far, the company has issued more than 44 million common shares of company stock to buy Bitcoin, earning the name “Asia’s MicroStrategy” for its similar buying approach to Michael Saylor’s Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy. As per the latest data from Bitcoin Treasuries, Metaplanet currently holds 3,200 BTC, acquired at an average cost of $83,107 per coin. While this has led to a modest 1.8% profit, the firm remains vulnerable to Bitcoin price fluctuations. The firm faced potential losses multiple times in March 2025, when Bitcoin’s price fell below its acquisition cost. In fact, last week, Bitcoin dipped as low as $76,555—its lowest price since November 2024—putting downward pressure on Metaplanet’s portfolio. Nonetheless, the market has seen a slight recovery since. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $84,413, reflecting a 1.5% fall over the past 24 hours. This offers a narrow margin of safety for Metaplanet’s holdings but underlines the ongoing volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Of the 2,632 respondents surveyed by CoinGecko between February and March, 25% were “fully bullish,” and 19.3% indicated they were “somewhat bullish” for crypto AI tokens in 2025. Around 29% of respondents were neutral on the subject, while a combined 26.3% were either somewhat bearish or bearish. Responses on crypto AI product sentiment. Source: CoinGecko The survey response was similar when it came to crypto AI products, which comes as the “use cases combining crypto with AI have improved and are seeing more widespread adoption,” said CoinGecko’s crypto research analyst Yuqian Lim. “This perhaps shows that crypto participants are not differentiating between crypto AI’s investing or trading potential and the technology itself,” said Lim. “Such market sentiments might in turn reflect expectations that now is the time for crypto AI to move beyond the conceptual stage and mature as a sector.” CoinGecko’s cryptocurrency tracker shows that the top artificial intelligence coins by market capitalization are around $23.6 billion, led by Near Protocol ( NEAR ), Internet Computer (I CP ) and Bittensor ( TAO ). There’s also a separate group of AI agent coins, such as Artificial Super Intelligence ( FET ), Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), ai16z (AI16z) and others, which command a market cap of $4.5 billion. CoinGecko surveyed 2,632 participants between Feb. 20 and March 10 and grouped participants whether they were long-term crypto investors or short-term traders. It also asked participants to categorize themselves on whether they saw themselves as early or late adopters and laggards of crypto AI. It found that some of the earliest adopters — known as “innovators” — had a higher share of bearishness compared to some of the later adopters. “Laggards” were the most bearish, in line with expectations.

Farrar expects to see further experimentation with crypto AI tokens, as they allow retail investors to speculate on smaller market cap ideas that largely aren’t as accessible in the stock market. “Things tend to start off like this in the open-source world; you see a ton of tinkering, and then perhaps we’ll see something really big come of it.” Crypto AI verticals that Farrar’s firm has a close eye on include decentralized GPU provider protocols, decentralized data providers, payment infrastructure for AI agents leveraging blockchain tech and crypto trading bots. “There’s also an opportunity for crypto to be used as a video to authenticate content as AI-generated or human-generated,” Farrar added.

Historically, bullish rallies tend to begin when the score surpasses 60, while extended periods below 40 signal bear market conditions.

Ether on exchanges falls to near-decade low,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-supply-decline-crypto-exchanges-price-prediction-analysts?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Ether’s supply on crypto exchanges has dropped to its lowest level since November 2015, leading some analysts to predict a major price rally despite recent bearish sentiment. “Ethereum's holders have now brought the available supply on exchanges down to 8.97M, the lowest amount in nearly 10 years (November, 2015),” crypto analytics platform Santiment said in a March 20 X post. Ether’s supply on crypto exchanges has reached its lowest point since November 2015. Source: Santiment Santiment said ETH had been rapidly leaving crypto exchanges, with balances now 16.4% lower than at the end of January. This suggests that investors are moving their ETH into cold storage wallets for long-term holding, potentially holding more conviction that Ether’s ( ETH ) price will rise in the future. A significant decline in ETH supply across crypto exchanges can signal a potential price surge soon, commonly known as a “supply shock.” However, a surge will only happen if demand remains strong or increases to outpace the reduced supply. It was recently seen in Bitcoin ( BTC ). On Jan. 13, Bitcoin reserves on all crypto exchanges dropped to 2.35 million BTC , hitting a nearly seven-year low that was last seen in June 2018. Just a week later, Bitcoin surged to a new high of $109,000 amid the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. Some crypto traders and analysts anticipate a similar scenario for Ether. Crypto trader Crypto General told their 230,800 X followers that it is “Just a question of time before the big supply shock.” Crypto commentator Ted said in a March 19 X post that with ETH supply on crypto exchanges decreasing by the day, “buyers will soon compete, leading to bidding wars.” Related: ‘Successful’ ETH ETF less perfect without staking — BlackRock Meanwhile, crypto trader Naber said in an X post on the same day that the largest ETH accumulation is taking place, and it may lead to Ether reaching the $8,000 to $10,000 price range. Even at the lower end of $8,000, Ether would be up 64% from its all-time high of $4,878, reached in November 2021. While the supply decline is giving crypto traders hope for ETH, other signals have recently cast a bearish shadow over the asset. Its performance against Bitcoin has been at its lowest in five years. Daan Crypto Trades said in a March 19 X post that it is “unlikely to see this anywhere near its highs anytime soon.” Ether is down 26% over the past 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap Ether is currently trading at $1,971, down 26% over the past month according to CoinMarketCap data. Meanwhile, spot Ether ETFs have had 12 straight days of outflows totaling $370.6 million, according to Farside data. “This has been one brutal downtrend,” Daan Crypto Trades added.

Technical indicators suggest that SHIB is on the verge of a significant breakthrough or breakdown in price movement and will decide if it bounces back or declines further. Analysts suggest that the crypto is struggling to regain its previous momentum throughout the market. Market analysts place a lot of emphasis on the meme coin’s capability to cross the resistance barrier at $0.00001190. If the SHIB price breaks this level and continues receiving buyers, the target could be $0.00001220 or higher. The bullish target could further be boosted by an RSI above 60, a MACD golden cross, or both. Without initially crossing this resistance price point, SHIB could drop into bearish territory, retesting $0.00001140. If these levels don’t hold SHIB until the next bearish target of $0.00001080, sentiment will only worsen. The vague ambiguity connected to SHIB has made several investors reevaluate their stakes. Some long-term holders remain optimistic, awaiting possible ecosystem changes and an overall market recovery. Meanwhile, others are moving towards more substantive tokens beyond the meme-driven gimmick. Such a shift in investor behavior brings about a massive exodus from SHIB into emerging projects with genuine utility and growth prospects. Investors Are Moving Toward Rexas Finance With Rexas Finance (RXS) luring investors interested in escaping further down the meme coin rabbit hole, Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to struggle at resistance levels. RXS, unlike meme coins, has structures around its economics, a well-defined roadmap, and multi-layered real-world applications. Utility tokens are gaining increasingly over SHIB and similar speculative assets, and the trend shows no sign of stopping. The presale performance of Rexas Finance is one of the primary reasons for its massive appeal. The token presale is currently at $0.200 after selling more than 456.423 million tokens and raising above $47.285 million. Anticipation is building ahead of the token’s scheduled listing on major exchanges on June 19, 2025, at $0.25. With over 91.28% of the presale completed, SHIB holders, who have been desperately trying to see gains, are set to witness a successful launch. Unlike meme coins dependent on hype, RXS adoption goes beyond price speculation. It has been created with sustainability in mind. Rexas Finance is built around a financial ecosystem composed of smart contracts, DeFi apps, and ecosystem partners. This degree of functionality forces rational investors to shift from speculative meme tokens to Rexas Finance—investing in packs with tangible value. To meet the highest security standards, the token is audited by CertiK, which allows investors to put their funds into RXS confidently. The increased supply of verified and branded tokens positions RXS as a favorable choice, strengthening it against the high-risk, low-utility meme coins. The sheer demand for trustworthy and verified tokens gives Rexas Finance another notable edge. Is SHIB Starting to Fade Away? The current market situation indicates that Shiba Inu is dealing with substantial technical resistance and a change in investor interest and sentiment. Investors who are purely interested in meme trends are also losing interest. Despite still being supported by a community, the long-term sustainability of SHIB looks bleak as new projects such as Rexas Finance seem to be catching more attention. One of the primary worries for SHIB holders is the severely inflated supply. With more than 589 trillion tokens circulating, witnessing significant price appreciation remains a pipe dream. Unlike low-supply tokens, which can be appreciated exponentially based on demand, SHIB needs a colossal market cap increase to show decent price movement. This severely limits the scope for investors willing to take risky bets to get adequate returns on SHIB when plenty of better alternatives exist. The fact that investors accept and opt for RXS and other high-utility SHIB alternatives shows that the market matures. The market’s focus seems to have evolved from meme-centered speculation to sound financial projects. In the long term, there may be potential for SHIB to witness short-term spikes, but the trend is fairly straightforward—tokens with real-world applications will take over the next phase of the crypto market. Final Thoughts: Should You Stay or Go? For those who still own SHIB, the decision comes down to risk tolerance and long-term market views. If SHIB can break critical resistance levels and maintain buying pressure, it could still have some upside potential. Regardless, it is becoming increasingly difficult to justify leaving capital tied to a highly speculative asset, especially with the growing competition from utility-driven tokens. On the contrary, Rexas Finance displays stronger growth signals than expected before the official exchange listing. The ongoing presale success and the structured development approach make it a starkly more favorable option for long-term gain seekers. Early investors in RXS could be in for a substantial return on investment, provided primary exchange listings set for June come through. In conclusion, innovation is the driving force behind the market’s development. The crypto space has seen meme coins have their time, and moving forward, the next phase will likely stem from actual projects that guarantee utility, security, and sustainable growth. For many investors, this means shifting focus from speculative assets like SHIB and looking closer at Rexas Finance.

At press time, Lazarus held 13,441 BTC worth $1.14 billion, according to data source Arkham Intelligence . That's 16% more than Tesla's bitcoin stash of 11,509 BTC. Last month, Lazarus Group struck crypto exchange Bybit, draining $1.4 billion in ether (ETH) from the platform. Recently, some of the stolen funds have been converted into bitcoin, with 12,836 BTC distributed across 9,117 unique wallets, as Bybit's CEO Ben Zhou confirmed . Tesla acquired its bitcoin stash four years ago and has been HODLing ever since, making it the world's fourth-largest publicly listed company in terms of BTC holdings. The striking contrast between Tesla and Lazarus Group emerged even as President Donald Trump's positive stance on cryptocurrency has sparked calls for accelerated BTC adoption among corporations and sovereign nations worldwide. On Thursday, Trump reaffirmed his commitment to making the U.S. the ""undisputed Bitcoin superpower and the crypto capital of the world."" Against this backdrop, it will be interesting to see if Tesla and other U.S. corporations respond to being overshadowed by a North Korean hacker. Meanwhile, the U.S. government holds 198,109 BTC worth over $16 billion, representing coins seized in enforcement actions. Trump recently announced the same as the strategic reserve. .",Markets|Bitcoin|Tesla|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|EXCHANGE|ARKM|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-21 06:11:33

It comes ahead of a federal election slated to be held on or before May 17, which current polling shows is shaping up to a dead heat between Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s Labor and the opposing Coalition led by Peter Dutton. The Treasury Department said in a March 21 statement that crypto exchanges, custody services and some brokerage firms that trade or store crypto will come under the new laws. The regime imposes similar compliance requirements as other financial services in the country, such as following rules safeguarding customer assets, obtaining an Australian Financial Services Licence and meeting minimum capital requirements. Australia’s Treasury says its new crypto regulations have four priorities. Source: Australian Department of the Treasury In August 2022, the government initiated a series of industry consultations to draft a crypto regulatory framework . “Our legislative reforms will extend existing financial services laws to key digital asset platforms, but not to all of the digital asset ecosystem,” the Treasury said in its statement. Small-scale and startup platforms that don’t meet specific size thresholds will be exempt, along with firms that develop blockchain-related software or create digital assets that aren’t financial products. Payment stablecoins will be treated as a type of stored-value facility under the Government’s Payments Licensing Reforms; however, some stablecoins and wrapped tokens will be exempt. “Dealing or secondary market trading in these products will be not treated as a dealing activity, and platforms where they are traded will not be treated as operating a market simply because of that trading activity,” the Treasury said. As part of its crypto agenda, Albanese’s government has also promised to work with Australia’s four largest banks to better understand the extent and nature of de-banking. There will also be a review into a central bank digital currency and an Enhanced Regulatory Sandbox in 2025, allowing businesses to test new financial products without needing a license. Related: May election could open floodgates to institutional crypto: OKX Australia CEO Albanese’s government intends to release a draft of the legislation for public consultation. However, a change of government could be on the horizon with a looming federal election, a date for which is yet to be called. Dutton’s center-right Coalition had earlier promised to prioritize crypto regulation if it wins the election. The latest YouGov poll published on March 20 shows the Coalition and Labor neck in neck for a two-party preferred vote. The Coalition leads for topline voting intention, while Albanese continues to lead as preferred prime minister. Source: YouGov Caroline Bowler, the CEO of local crypto exchange BTC Markets, said in a statement shared with Cointelegraph that the areas of reform are sensible and would keep Australia competitive with global peers. However, she thinks there “will be additional detail required, on capital adequacy and custody requirements.” “We need to ensure that these requirements aren’t overly burdensome for business investment in Australia,” Bowler said. Kraken Australia’s managing director, Jonathon Miller, said there is an “urgent need for bespoke crypto legislation” to address the existing confusion and uncertainty in the country’s industry. “We believe that by establishing a clear crypto regulatory framework and mitigating problems like debanking, government can remove the barriers hampering growth in the Australian economy,” he said.

Synthetix Network price analysis revealed a strong bearish market scenario. The SNX/USD value dropped to $0.869 in the last 24 hours. Technical indicators give a negative signal; at the same time, the price charts also depict relatively bearish market conditions. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as we shall explore in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $6.07 by 2030. Why is SNX down? The cryptocurrency market is under bearish pressure, and SNX faces the same sentiment. However, it is discouraging that SNX has been following a bearish price curve after December 8, 2024, over the larger picture. The SNX price dropped to $0.869 losing 0.50% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $1.61 for the current year. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach $5 by 2029. Will SNX reach $6? According to SNX price prediction, SNX will reach the $6 level by the fourth quarter of 2030. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $6.97, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $6.97 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

Synthetix historic price sentiment SNX price history Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price has declined to the $0.89 range.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,SNX|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-21 07:07:25

Despite years of hype around cryptocurrencies, most shoppers still automatically grab their credit cards when standing at the register. The cashier’s bewildered look when you mention Bitcoin says it all. SpacePay is tackling this problem head-on with a solution that might actually work in the real world. They’ve created a payment platform with a surprisingly low 0.5% transaction fee, compatibility with over 325 crypto wallets, and an instant settlement system that protects merchants from price swings. No wonder they’ve pulled in nearly $1 million during their presale, with $SPY tokens currently going for $0.003153. Bridging the Gap Between Crypto and Everyday Commerce Most shop owners definitely don’t have time to learn complicated new systems. They need something that works with what they already have, according to retail experts familiar with payment technologies. That’s where SpacePay gets it right. Instead of forcing merchants to trash their existing setup, their system works with standard Android payment terminals through a simple software update. It’s like giving your old smartphone a superpower upgrade. For customers, it’s refreshingly simple too. Scan a QR code with your crypto wallet app, tap confirm, and you’re done. No awkward waiting, no complex wallet addresses to type in, no technical mumbo-jumbo. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1898473072790810829 Slashing Transaction Fees for Merchants Credit card processors have been gouging small businesses for years. Those 2.5% to 3.5% fees might not sound like much until you run the numbers. Consider a neighborhood bookstore generating $40,000 in monthly revenue. Under conventional payment processors, they’re losing about $1,200 each month to transaction fees. By implementing SpacePay’s 0.5% structure, their monthly fee burden shrinks to just $200 – keeping an additional $1,000 in their business every month. SpacePay pulls this off by cutting out all those middlemen in traditional payment networks. When you swipe a credit card, your payment bounces between five or six different companies before reaching the merchant days later. With blockchain technology, SpacePay creates a more direct path without sacrificing security. Visit SpacePay Presale Protection from Crypto’s Wild Price Swings The biggest obstacle preventing widespread adoption of cryptocurrency payments remains price volatility. No restaurant owner wants to accept Bitcoin for a $100 meal only to find it’s worth $80 by closing time. SpacePay’s solution is brilliantly easy. When someone pays with crypto, the merchant gets exactly what they charged in their local currency – instantly. If you sell a $150 designer t-shirt that’s exactly what lands in your bank account, whether Bitcoin crashes or moons five minutes later. They pull this off with some clever tech that locks in the exchange rate during the transaction. If the market goes crazy during those few seconds, SpacePay absorbs the difference. Merchants just see reliable payments hitting their account without the roller coaster ride. This removes the biggest fear factor for businesses, according to retail consultants. They don’t need to worry about crypto prices or understand blockchain – they just get paid what they’re owed. The Technology Behind Seamless Crypto Transactions Behind SpacePay’s user-friendly exterior lurks some seriously clever engineering. Most payment systems check things one at a time – like standing in a single security line at the airport. SpacePay runs multiple security checks simultaneously – like having several security gates operating in parallel. While your traditional payment processor is still checking your account balance, SpacePay has already verified your wallet, confirmed the merchant’s details, and locked in the exchange rate. The speed comes from what tech people call “parallel processing,” but you don’t need to understand the jargon to appreciate the results. Payments complete in seconds instead of minutes, with security that’s actually stronger than traditional systems. Every transaction gets recorded on the blockchain, creating an unchangeable record that even the craftiest fraudsters can’t tamper with. Think of it as having a high-tech security camera watching over every penny, but better. How to Participate in the SpacePay Ecosystem Getting involved with SpacePay is refreshingly easy, even if you’re not a crypto expert. Their $SPY token is currently priced at $0.003153, though this will likely increase as the presale moves forward. Head over to SpacePay’s official website and connect whatever crypto wallet you normally use – MetaMask and WalletConnect are popular choices. The platform accepts various cryptocurrencies including ETH, BNB, MATIC, USDT, USDC, AVAX, and BASE. For those without cryptocurrency holdings, traditional bank card payments are also fully supported. After connecting your wallet, just pick how many tokens you want and follow the prompts to complete your purchase. Remember to keep a bit extra in your wallet to cover network fees.

Enter Rexas Finance (RXS), a new kid on the block that’s catching eyes as a possible XRP rival. Its fresh approach and growth potential are turning heads. But why are investors jumping ship from XRP to RXS? Let’s dive deeper to find out. Why Ripple Investors Are Switching to XRP Rival, Rexas Finance (RXS) 1. Tapping Into a $121 Trillion Market with RWA Tokenization A major factor driving XRP investors to switch to Rexas Finance is its fresh take on turning real-world assets into tokens. It’s often hard to buy and sell traditional assets like property, artwork raw materials, and ideas. Rexas Finance is shaking things up by putting these assets on the blockchain as tokens. This makes them easy to trade, get hold of, and move around the world. The global commodities market is worth about $121 trillion, and Rexas Finance aims to be the entry point to this untapped potential. While XRP deals with payment solutions, RXS gives investors partial ownership of valuable real-world assets. This opens up investment chances and creates a more open financial system. 2. Explosive Presale Performance and Growth Potential of the XRP Rival XRP investors seeking high ROI opportunities are flocking to Rexas Finance’s presale, which has been nothing short of impressive. Current Presale Stage : Stage 12 Current Price: 1 RXS = $0.20 Launch Price: $0.25 Tokens Sold: 454,446,358 RXS Funds Raised: $46.88 million More than 90.91% of presale RXS tokens have already been bought, and the RWA token is in high demand. Investors are hurrying to buy their tokens before the price goes up at launch. Market experts think RXS could hit $23 by Q3 2025 making it one of the best early-stage cryptocurrencies to invest in. Rexas Finance Tokenomics 3. Security and Transparency: CertiK Audit Verified Security concerns have historically influenced decisions regarding crypto investments, particularly due to the legal ambiguities related to Ripple. Rexas Finance offers investors reassurance through its CertiK audit confirmation. CertiK, a prominent blockchain security company, has meticulously examined RXS smart contracts, guaranteeing they are secure and devoid of weaknesses. It is also a plus that Rexas Finance operates on Ethereum, a reliable blockchain, as one of the best ERC-20 tokens to invest in . This degree of transparency and security plays a crucial role in Ripple investors’ choice to transition to the XRP rival. 3. Multi-Chain Integration and DeFi Opportunities Unlike XRP, which largely operates within its own ecosystem, Rexas Finance is designed for multi-chain integration. This means it can seamlessly interact with various blockchain networks, enabling greater flexibility, interoperability, and expansion into decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. RXS holders will be able to: Participate in DeFi staking and yield farming Use RXS tokens for governance decisions Trade tokenized assets across multiple blockchain networks This multi-chain architecture ensures long-term viability and mass adoption for the XRP rival, something the Ripple token has struggled with beyond the financial industry. Final Thoughts: Is RXS- XRP Rival the Future for Ripple Investors? With its innovative approach to RWA tokenization, multi-chain compatibility, and strong security framework, Rexas Finance is emerging as a serious competitor in the crypto market. The combination of massive market potential, explosive presale growth, and real-world asset accessibility makes RXS a compelling XRP rival for investors seeking higher returns and long-term sustainability. As XRP holders jump ship, Rexas Finance (RXS) is rapidly gaining traction. With its robust ecosystem and the ability to unlock a $121 trillion market, it’s no surprise that investors are making the switch. Will RXS be the next big thing in crypto? Time will tell, but the signs are pointing toward a promising future.

Gox & Ripple Co-Founder Jed McCaleb Aims to Replace ISS with Haven-1 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News From Crypto to Space! Jed McCaleb, known for founding Mt. Gox and co-creating Ripple, is now aiming for the stars—literally. His latest venture, Vast, is building a commercial space station called Haven-1, which is expected to launch by May 2026. If everything goes as planned, McCaleb could secure a multi-billion-dollar contract from NASA to help replace the aging International Space Station (ISS). But if things go south, he could lose a staggering $1 billion, putting the future of his space dreams in trouble. Just in: @JedMcCaleb , co-founder of #MtGox and #Ripple , plans to launch Vast’s ""Haven-1"" space station into orbit and secure a NASA contract by 2026. #CoinPedia #CryptoNews #Blockchain #CryptoMarket — Coinpedia (@CoinpediaNews) March 21, 2025 Haven-1: The First Step Vast is developing Haven-1, a 33-foot-long space station set to launch with SpaceX in 2026. It will hold four people and offer basic amenities, but unlike the International Space Station (ISS), it won’t recycle water or air, making it suitable only for short stays. NASA plans to retire the ISS by 2030, and Vast wants to be ready to take its place. The SpaceX Partnership McCaleb has always been known as a bold risk-taker, willing to go all-in on ambitious projects. According to his long-time friend and former business partner Sam Yagan, McCaleb is “slightly eccentric” in his willingness to take massive risks. His vision aligns with that of elon musk elon musk Elon Musk Is the Co-founder of Tesla, an investor and entrepreneur. He was born on the 28th of June,1971, and is based in Pretoria, South Africa. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, earning a bachelor's degree in Arts and physics, and the Wharton School, earning a bachelor's degree in science, and economics. In 2003 Musk founded Tesla, an electric vehicle and clean energy company. Elon Musk is a crypto enthusiast, he has a complex relationship with cryptocurrency. He purchased $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency. Musk was honored with Axel Springer Award, an award given to innovative people, who build new markets, change markets, and contribute to society.

Moreover, Vast has already secured multiple SpaceX launches for Haven-1 and future modules. SpaceX will also provide parts like the docking adapter and Wi-Fi system. If Haven-1 proves successful, Vast plans to launch Haven-2 by 2028, leading to a larger space base with life-support systems. Jed made billions from crypto, first launching Mt. Gox in 2010, which later collapsed in 2014. He then co-founded Ripple and held 9% of XRP, selling his stake over the years for around $3.2 billion. Despite his wealth, Jed has stayed out of the spotlight and prefers taking big risks quietly. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News Today, 21st March : Pi Network, Trump News, Sensex Today, Bitcoin Price , The Race for NASA’s Contract Vast is competing with companies like Blue Origin and Axiom Space.

Jed and Vast’s CEO, Max Haot, are even open to going to space themselves. The next two years will determine if McCaleb’s space gamble pays off—or if it becomes just another bold but failed experiment. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

42085496,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142130,1742541038,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Meteora MET Token Proposals Unveiled: A Major Shift in DeFi Governance?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/meteora-met-token-proposals/,"Exciting developments are brewing in the Solana DeFi ecosystem! Meteora, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on Solana, has just dropped two significant governance proposals concerning its native MET token. For those deeply invested in the world of crypto and decentralized finance, these proposals signal a potential shift in how MET tokens are distributed and utilized within the Meteora ecosystem. Let’s dive into the details of these crucial proposals and understand what they mean for liquidity providers, the team, and the future of Meteora. Understanding the Meteora MET Token Proposals Meteora’s announcement on X has sparked considerable interest within the Solana community. The core of the buzz revolves around two distinct yet interconnected proposals, both aimed at refining the crypto token allocation strategy for the MET token. These proposals are not just minor tweaks; they represent a potential recalibration of the tokenomics that could have a lasting impact on the platform’s growth and community engagement. Proposal 1: Boosting Liquidity Provider (LP) Rewards – Currently, liquidity providers on Meteora are allocated 10% of the total MET token supply. This proposal suggests increasing this allocation to 15%. Proposal 2: Team Allocation Adjustment – The second proposal focuses on the team’s allocation, suggesting a 20% share of the MET supply. These proposals are now published online for community review and discussion, paving the way for a governance vote that will ultimately decide their fate. But what exactly are the motivations behind these proposed changes, and what are the potential implications? Why Increase MET Allocation for Liquidity Providers? Liquidity is the lifeblood of any DEX. A healthy pool of liquidity ensures smooth trading, reduces slippage, and attracts more users to the platform. Increasing the MET liquidity providers allocation directly addresses this fundamental need. By offering a larger slice of the MET token pie to LPs, Meteora aims to: Incentivize Greater Liquidity Provision: A higher MET reward can be a powerful magnet, attracting more users to deposit their assets and contribute to the platform’s liquidity pools. Enhance Platform Stability: Deeper liquidity makes the platform more robust and less susceptible to price volatility and manipulation. Attract New Users: A platform known for its attractive LP rewards can draw in new users seeking yield opportunities in the DeFi space. Foster Community Engagement: Rewarding LPs strengthens the bond between the platform and its community, fostering a sense of shared ownership and participation. Consider this scenario: Imagine you are deciding where to provide liquidity for your Solana tokens. Platform A offers a 10% token allocation as LP rewards, while Platform B, like a potentially revamped Meteora, offers 15%. The higher reward on Platform B becomes a significant incentive, potentially swaying your decision and attracting more capital to Meteora. Examining the Proposed 20% Team Allocation The proposal to allocate 20% of the MET supply to the team is another critical aspect of this governance update. Team allocations in crypto projects are often a subject of scrutiny and debate. Transparency and justification are key to gaining community trust and acceptance. A 20% allocation for the Meteora team could be justified by considering several factors: Incentivizing Long-Term Development: A substantial team allocation ensures that the core developers and contributors are incentivized to continue working on the project, driving innovation, and maintaining the platform over the long term. Attracting and Retaining Talent: In the competitive crypto space, attracting and retaining skilled developers, marketers, and community managers requires competitive compensation. Token allocations can be a crucial tool in this regard. Funding Future Growth: A portion of the team allocation can be strategically used to fund future development initiatives, marketing campaigns, and ecosystem expansion efforts. Alignment of Interests: By holding a significant stake in the MET token, the team’s interests become closely aligned with the success and long-term health of the Meteora platform and its community. However, it’s essential for the Meteora team to clearly communicate how these tokens will be vested, utilized, and contribute to the platform’s growth. Transparency in this area is paramount to building trust and avoiding concerns about potential token dumps or undue influence. Navigating DeFi Governance: Community Participation is Key These Solana DEX proposals from Meteora underscore the importance of DeFi governance in shaping the future of decentralized platforms. Unlike traditional centralized exchanges, DEXs like Meteora empower their communities to participate in key decisions through governance mechanisms. This means that the fate of these MET token allocation proposals ultimately rests in the hands of the MET token holders and the broader Meteora community. Here’s how you can get involved and contribute to the governance process: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on Meteora’s official communication channels, such as their X account and governance forums, for updates and discussions related to these proposals. Review the Proposals: Carefully read the full proposal documents available online to understand the details, rationale, and potential implications of each proposal. Engage in Discussions: Participate in community discussions on forums, Discord, or Telegram to share your thoughts, ask questions, and engage with other community members. Vote (If Eligible): If you hold MET tokens and are eligible to participate in governance voting, make sure to cast your vote based on your informed opinion. Your voice matters! Active participation in DeFi governance is not just about influencing decisions; it’s about shaping the future of the platforms and ecosystems you are invested in. By engaging with Meteora’s proposals, the community can collectively contribute to a more robust, equitable, and thriving DeFi environment. The Potential Impact on the Meteora Ecosystem and MET Token Price The outcome of these Meteora MET token allocation proposals could have a significant impact on the platform’s ecosystem and the MET token price. Let’s consider some potential scenarios: Scenario Potential Impact on Ecosystem Potential Impact on MET Token Price Both Proposals Approved Increased liquidity, stronger community engagement, potential for faster growth, incentivized team development. Potentially positive due to increased utility and demand for MET tokens to earn LP rewards and participate in governance. Only LP Allocation Increase Approved Improved liquidity, enhanced platform stability, positive community sentiment among LPs. Potentially moderately positive as increased LP rewards can drive demand for MET tokens. Only Team Allocation Approved Ensured team motivation and resources for development, potential long-term growth focus. Potentially neutral to slightly negative if community perceives team allocation as excessive without clear benefits. Transparency is key to avoid negative price pressure. Both Proposals Rejected Missed opportunity to enhance LP incentives and potentially secure long-term team commitment. Potentially neutral to slightly negative as lack of change might be seen as stagnation. It’s crucial to remember that token prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, including market sentiment, broader crypto trends, and project-specific developments. These proposals are just one piece of the puzzle, but they are undoubtedly a significant development for Meteora and its community. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Meteora and its Community Meteora’s unveiling of these two important MET token allocation proposals marks a pivotal moment for the Solana-based DEX. The decisions made by the community in the upcoming governance vote will have far-reaching consequences for the platform’s liquidity, team motivation, and overall ecosystem health. By increasing the allocation for liquidity providers, Meteora aims to bolster its platform’s foundation and attract more users. The proposed team allocation, if implemented transparently and strategically, can ensure continued development and long-term growth. As the DeFi landscape continues to evolve, proactive governance and community engagement are essential for the success of decentralized platforms. Meteora’s approach to involving its community in these crucial decisions sets a positive example and highlights the power of decentralized governance in shaping the future of finance.

Bitcoin price has declined by 1.2% to trade at $84,197. XRP and Solana have also edged lower with 1% and 4% dips, respectively. Dogecoin also recorded a brief rally to $0.17 before reversing. Following this decline, the total cryptocurrencies market capitalization has dropped to $2.86 trillion. Data from Tradingview shows that TOTAL is ending its rebound and could lose support at the lower parallel channel. Total Crypto Market Cap As the market sentiment flips bearish and fear grips the market again, can XRP, SOL, and DOGE lead the market recovery? Dogecoin Price Poised to Lead Cryptocurrencies Recovery Dogecoin could lead a recovery for cryptocurrencies, with top analysts predicting that the price is on the verge of a major breakout. Popular analyst Carl Moon identifies a falling wedge pattern on DOGE’s one-day price chart. A move above the upper trendline will trigger a 171% rally towards $0.43. DOGE/USDT: 1-day Chart Another analyst Ali Charts has also shared a bullish Dogecoin price prediction in the near term. He stated, “Dogecoin will break out! A close outside $0.16-$0.18 could trigger a 16% price move.” The bullish price forecast by analysts comes as Santiment data shows that whales are buying the dip. In the last three days, large DOGE addresses holding between 100M and 1B DOGE have purchased 80M DOGE. Dogecoin whales XRP Price Reverses Despite Bullish News XRP price is unable to break resistance at $2.50 and trades at $2.41 today. Various news like Bitnomial’s launch of the first XRP futures have failed to attract demand from buyers. Buyers are likely to remain on the sidelines until the SEC issues a statement confirming the appeal dismissal. The XRP four-hour price chart shows mixed signals. The RSI is at 51, and tipping south, indicating the lack of strong buying pressure. Meanwhile, a bull flag pattern has emerged on the 4-hour price chart. This bullish pattern supports a bullish Ripple price forecast with a possible 16% rise that will push the cryptocurrencies price to $2.87. XRP/USDT: 4-hour Chart Solana Holds Critical Support Amid Price Dip Solana price today trades at $128 after a 4.5% drop in 24 hours. Despite this drop, SOL is holding a critical support zone between $120 and $130, with analyst Coinvo saying that as long as this support holds, Solana can rally to new highs. Solana Price Chart One of the catalysts that could break out Solana from this zone is the recent launch of a DEX by PumpFun. The meme coin launchpad has launched its own DEX, which could stir high trading volumes, driving a bullish Solana price forecast . Summary of Cryptocurrencies Price Prediction Cryptocurrencies price have dropped today. Crypto traders refrained from buying despite President Trump making a speech at the Digital Assets Summit.

In a white paper published by the Australian Treasury, the country's government says it will embrace tokenization, real-world assets (RWAs), and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as part of a broader push to modernize its financial system. While ruling out a retail CBDC for now, the government sees a wholesale CBDC version and tokenized settlement infrastructure as key to unlocking market efficiency and broader asset access. The government says that the Australian Treasury, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, as well as the Reserve Bank of Australia are planning to launch pilot trials that use tokenized money, including stablecoins, to settle transactions in wholesale tokenized markets. ""Markets for tokenized assets may be able to increase automation, reduce settlement risk, lessen reliance on multiple financial intermediaries, simplify trading processes, reduce transaction costs, and provide broader access to traditionally illiquid assets,"" the report reads. The white paper also presents a licensing structure for crypto exchanges, which will be known in Australia as Digital Asset Platforms (DAPs). Operators of DAPs will need to meet financial services obligations such as capital adequacy and disclosure requirements while also using third-party custodians to store customer assets. The Government is also planning on addressing industry concerns of de-banking through its DAP licensing regime, it said in the white paper, to allow for banking partners to better engage in risk management. This anti-debanking effort in Australia follows continued U.S. hearings on the topic, where Senator Tim Scott’s FIRM Act seeks to stop regulators from using ""reputational risk"" to block out crypto firms from accessing banking rails.",Policy|Australia|crypto regulation,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET|ASIA|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-21 07:12:48

Let’s understand why a Japanese Bitcoin company is making such bold moves in the crypto space: Diversification and Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating traditional markets, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a valuable asset for diversification and a hedge against inflation. Metaplanet’s substantial Bitcoin holdings reflect this sentiment. First Mover Advantage in Japan: Japan has a progressive stance on cryptocurrency regulation.

Trump Crypto Influence: Political and Market Implications Eric Trump’s appointment inevitably brings the “ Trump Crypto Influence ” narrative into play.

Mainstream Investor Interest: The association with the Trump name could attract attention from mainstream investors who might have been hesitant about crypto previously. It could be seen as a signal of growing legitimacy. Geopolitical Dynamics: A Japanese company with a Trump family member on its advisory board adds an interesting layer to the geopolitical landscape of crypto, especially considering the U.S.-Japan relationship. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities Ahead While the appointment of Eric Trump is undoubtedly a significant development for Metaplanet, challenges and opportunities remain: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin investment strategy , while bold, also carries inherent risks. Effective risk management and strategic diversification will be crucial. Regulatory Uncertainty: Global crypto regulations are still evolving. Metaplanet will need to stay agile and adaptable to navigate changing legal landscapes in different jurisdictions. Public Perception: The crypto industry still faces skepticism from some quarters. Building trust and fostering positive public perception will be essential for long-term success. However, the opportunities are equally compelling: First-Mover Advantage: Metaplanet’s early and aggressive adoption of Bitcoin positions them as a pioneer in the corporate crypto space, potentially yielding significant long-term rewards.

Market analysts believe that there’s enough possibility that ETH could see another 50% drop to $1,000 as some early ETH whales resolve to heavy profit booking. Ethereum Price Struggles to Regain $2,000 Amid the overall market uncertainty, Ethereum continues to face some selling pressure as bulls fail to regain control over $2,000 levels. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has stated that investors should maintain caution before building fresh positions in ETH. “Ethereum hits $2,000. Cool, but zoom out! The big picture is brewing something bigger,” Martinez stated. As per the below chart shared by Martinez, if bulls fail to hold the Ethereum price above $2,050, it risks further falling to the next support at $1,500, and even below all the way to $1,095 levels, per his recent ETH price prediction. Source: Ali Charts As of press time, the ETH price is trading 2.26% down at $1,973 with its daily trading volume dropping over 40% to $12.21 billion. Furthermore, the ETH futures open interest has also dropped 4% under $20 billion. A recent ETH price prediction also hints that the crypto will hover near $2K for some time ahead. Early ETH Whale Sells 34,125 Coins Blockchain analytics platform SpotonChain reported that a major ETH whale appears to have secured a massive profit of $65.66 million, marking a staggering 4,156% return on investment. The whale’s holdings date back to March 2017 when they acquired the ETH from platforms like Changelly, Bitfinex, ShapeShift, and Binance at an average cost of just $46.3 per token. The whale, identified as “0x086,” deposited its entire ETH holdings of 34,125 ETH to crypto exchange Coinbase a few hours ago. This transaction happened at an average Ethereum price of $1,970. Source: SpotonChain Currently, the ETH whale activity remains mixed as some big players are moving it from exchange and moving it to staking to earn the extra yield. These are specifically the long-term ETH holders holding with diamond hands. BlackRock Explains Why Ethereum ETFs Are Struggling Despite Ethereum price eyeing a relief rally past $2,000, there’s no major relief for spot Ethereum ETFs. The outflows have continued through March 2025 so far, highlighting a major drop in institutional sentiment. While speaking at the Digital Asset Summit (DAS) in New York City, BlackRock’s head of digital assets Robbie Mitchnick explained the real reason behind this fall. Mitchnick suggested that the ETFs could have performed better if they had included staking, noting that the absence of this feature made the launch “less perfect.” “A staking yield is a meaningful part of how you can generate investment return in this space. And all the [Ether] ETFs, of course, at launch did not have staking,” he said. On Thursday, crypto asset manager Bitwise filed a proposal to introduce staking on Ethereum ETFs . The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has proposed amendments to allow the listing and trading of shares for the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, incorporating staking capabilities.

Phase 3 starts from $0.02 per token, and with the momentum building, everyone is anticipating a price increase even sooner. This phase draws nearer to full capacity, foreshadowing urgency for latecomers who want to take advantage before Phase 4 takes the cost of entry to $0.025 — a 25% jump from today’s price tag. Investor Confidence and Presale Rise Steadily The project’s measurable growth trajectory has investors quickly filling Phase 3 allocations. This tokenomics means early backers can lock in tokens for $0.02, and when those tokens hit exchanges, the price will stand to triple to $0.06, a massive 200% profit. Such mathematical certainty stands in stark contrast to the fickle nature of meme coins, delivering deliver clarity in a market clouded by hysteria. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) analysts now forecast post-launch valuations in the $1.50 to $5 range, the former representing a 7,400% jump from the current presale price. Whether such predictions hold true depends on the platform’s readiness for launch and its ability to translate the presale interest into actual use post-launch. The presale to date with $4.1 million broken demonstrates that institutional and retail trust is solid, with a $100,000 giveaway giving ten of the first presale participants each $10,000. Not only does this tactic fuel urgency, but it also reinforces community bonds, thus solidifying a base of loyal supporters ahead of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s entry into the market. All new Lending System with Token Nature Mutuum Finance (MUTM) extends yield farming capabilities by creating mtTokens which represent deposited assets in dynamic fashion including DAI and ETH. ERC tokens managed by Mutuum Finance produce time-based interest while eliminating the need to sell assets. Furthermore, mtTokens increase interoperability by allowing users to move their tokens between DeFi platforms and outside of the Mutuum ecosystem. Mutuum Finance protects the protocol from defaults by forcing borrowers to deposit assets worth more than their requested loan amount. Each $5,000 USDT loan requires ETH collateral worth $7,000 for the lender to remain covered and ensure liquidity pool integrity. The peer-to-peer lending options emerging for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have become important loan options since traditional credit providers do not support these assets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates with another distribution channel since the platform can acquire tokens through open market purchases of their own tokens. Users who stake mtTokens receive additional MTokens and also create constant market purchase demands. The sustainable feedback loop prevents token sellers from appearing in the market and helps keep sustained value throughout market price fluctuations. The project’s roadmap includes a functional overcollateralized stablecoin that adds new DeFi product options for users. The decentralized stablecoin operates as a self-stabilizing cryptocurrency to oppose centralized alternatives because it maintains complete decentralization while being transparent through user-deposited collateral. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) utilizes adjustable interest rates that follow market conditions to create an investment platform that services moderate and aggressive borrowers and cautious lenders. With a restricted time frame to phase 3, it represents one of the last chances to get tokens below $0.025, with exchange listings ready to instantly create price increases. Not only do early participants benefit from the 200% launch return but they also set themselves up for exponential growth as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) adds users and products. Getting in Before the Boom For those with a focus on functional, utilizable projects over transient fads, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a letting-in opportunity for investors. Investing in tokens at $0.02 now secures instant returns at launch and primes portfolios for potentially even quadruple-digit returns in the future as adoption grows. Head to the official channels of Mutuum Finance now to join in before the conclusion of Phase 3—latecomers back of the line; they may well miss out on the lowest price tier in a project that is setting a new course for the future of DeFi.

42086260,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142138,1742542232,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alarming Bitcoin Bull Score Falls to a Concerning Two-Year Low: What Does It Mean?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-bull-score-two-year-low/,"Is the crypto market bracing for another downturn? Recent data from CryptoQuant is raising eyebrows and sparking concern among Bitcoin enthusiasts and investors alike. The Bitcoin Bull Score, a key metric for gauging market sentiment, has plummeted to 20 – its lowest point in two years. This significant drop begs the question: what does this alarming decline in the Bitcoin Bull Score really signify for the future of crypto, and should you be worried? What is the Bitcoin Bull Score and Why Does it Matter? The Bitcoin Bull Score is an indicator developed by crypto analytics platform CryptoQuant to assess the strength of bullish sentiment in the Bitcoin market. Think of it as a barometer for market optimism. It’s calculated based on a variety of on-chain and market indicators, providing a composite view of whether the market leans towards bullish or bearish expectations. A higher score suggests stronger bullish momentum, while a lower score indicates weakening bullishness and potentially growing bearish sentiment. Why is this score so important? Here’s a breakdown: Market Sentiment Gauge: It offers a quick snapshot of the prevailing mood in the Bitcoin market, helping traders and investors understand the overall direction. Historical Significance: Historically, the Bitcoin Bull Score has been a reliable indicator of market trends. Scores above 60 have often preceded significant bull rallies, while sustained low scores have coincided with bearish phases. Predictive Potential: While not foolproof, the Bitcoin Bull Score can provide valuable clues about potential future market movements, aiding in strategic decision-making. Historical Bitcoin Bull Score Trends Bull Score Range Market Condition Potential Outcome Above 60 High Bullish Sentiment Potential Bull Rally 20-60 Neutral to Cautiously Bullish Market Consolidation or Gradual Growth Below 20 Low Bullish Sentiment Potential Bearish Market or Downturn Two-Year Low: A Cause for Concern? The current drop of the Bitcoin Bull Score to 20 is undeniably noteworthy because it marks a two-year low. This isn’t just a minor dip; it’s a significant decrease signaling a considerable weakening of bullish sentiment. According to CryptoQuant’s report on X, such low levels have historically been associated with periods of market weakness. This raises a critical question: Are we on the cusp of another extended bearish phase in the crypto market? To understand the gravity, consider these points: Historical Precedent: Past instances of the Bitcoin Bull Score falling to similar levels have often been followed by prolonged periods of price stagnation or decline. Market Psychology: A low Bitcoin Bull Score can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. When investors see bearish signals, fear can grip the market, leading to sell-offs and further price drops. Broader Economic Factors: It’s crucial to consider the broader economic landscape. Factors like inflation, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical uncertainties can amplify the impact of a low Bitcoin Bull Score on the crypto market. CryptoQuant’s Analysis: What Are the Experts Saying? The insights from CryptoQuant are particularly valuable because they are a leading provider of on-chain data and crypto analysis . Their reports are closely watched by traders and institutions for informed decision-making. CryptoQuant’s alert regarding the plunging Bitcoin Bull Score underscores the seriousness of the situation. Their expertise in analyzing market indicators lends credibility to the potential implications of this low score. Why trust CryptoQuant’s crypto analysis ? Data-Driven Approach: CryptoQuant relies on verifiable on-chain data and sophisticated algorithms for their analysis, offering a more objective perspective compared to sentiment-based opinions. Proven Track Record: They have a history of identifying key market trends and providing timely insights that have proven beneficial to their users. Comprehensive Metrics: CryptoQuant analyzes a wide array of metrics beyond just price, offering a holistic view of market health, including miner activity, exchange flows, and investor behavior. Navigating Potential Bearish Market Conditions If the low Bitcoin Bull Score indeed foreshadows a bearish market , what should investors do? Panic selling is rarely the answer. Instead, consider a strategic approach: Review Your Portfolio: Assess your risk tolerance and portfolio allocation. Is your portfolio positioned to withstand a potential market downturn? Risk Management: Implement risk management strategies such as setting stop-loss orders and diversifying your holdings. Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on market developments and further crypto analysis from reputable sources like CryptoQuant. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that crypto markets are cyclical. Bear markets, while challenging, can also present opportunities for long-term investors to accumulate assets at lower prices. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider employing a DCA strategy to gradually invest over time, reducing the risk of investing a lump sum at market peaks. Conclusion: Vigilance is Key in the Crypto Market The drop in the Bitcoin Bull Score to a two-year low is a significant development that warrants attention. While it doesn’t guarantee a prolonged market downturn , it certainly serves as a strong warning signal. By understanding the implications of this metric, staying informed with reliable crypto analysis , and adopting prudent risk management strategies, investors can navigate these potentially turbulent times with greater confidence. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and periods like these emphasize the importance of informed decision-making and a balanced perspective.

Seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez emphasized that ETH must clear this level to regain bullish momentum. Ethereum Needs To Clear $2,400 To Turn Bullish Ethereum has climbed nearly 4.5% over the past week, rising from approximately $1,800 on March 13 to $1,992 at the time of writing. However, Martinez points out that despite the recent upward movement, ETH must conquer the $2,400 level to confirm a bullish shift. While $2,400 remains about 20% away from current price levels, multiple crypto analysts believe ETH could be on the verge of a bullish trend reversal. Crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader highlighted that ETH has broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart. The analyst added that ETH’s “most hated rally is about to ignite.” Merlijn’s assessment aligns with fellow analyst Ted, who noted that a short squeeze could rapidly propel ETH to $3,000. Similarly, in an X post, crypto analyst Crypto Caesar suggested that ETH may be near this market cycle’s bottom and could soon experience a strong upward trend reversal. The analyst shared a chart showing ETH bouncing off a long-standing trendline multiple times since mid-2022. Further supporting the bullish case, analyst Amr Taha explained in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post that over 150,000 ETH have exited derivatives exchanges in the past two days. Taha noted that such large outflows often signal accumulation by institutional investors – a traditionally bullish indicator. ETH Threatens Slumping To $1,060 Despite the optimistic signals, some analysts warn that ETH may face more downside before any significant upside move. In an X post, crypto trader Mags suggested ETH could crash to a range low of $1,060 if no meaningful support level holds. Additionally, other analysts caution that ETH could fall as low as $800 if it breaks down from an ascending triangle pattern. Data from crypto exchange-traded funds (ETF) tracker SoSoValue also indicates waning institutional confidence in ETH. Notably, US-based spot ETH ETFs have seen continuous net outflows since March 5. As of now, total net assets held in spot ETH ETFs stand slightly above $7 billion, representing approximately 2.8% of ETH’s total supply. That said, Ethereum’s MVRV Ratio dropping to 0.9 could signal a bullish setup for the digital asset, though such effects typically take time to play out. At press time, ETH trades at $1,992, down 1.7% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|Altcoin|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|ETH|Ether|ETHUSDT|Symmetrical Triangle|Technical Analysis,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-21 07:30:46

However, sentiments signal potential shifts, with experts forecasting impressive actions for altcoins in the coming trading sessions. As altcoin season speculations emerge, analyst Altcoin Sherpa focused on the AI project Fartcoin. He highlighted $0.2905 as the crucial foothold for FARTCOIN’s potential recoveries. Altcoin Sherpa @AltcoinSherpa · Follow If this FARTCOIN level holds, next stop would be the $0.55-$0.65 region up next hot air rises 7:33 pm · 20 Mar 2025 182 Reply Copy link Read 21 replies Sherpa believes the altcoin could soar toward $0.65 if bulls defend the key support. That would translate to an approximately 45% surge from Fartcoin’s current price of $0.3590. Meanwhile, the nearest resistance at $0.4088 remains crucial for the altcoin’s trajectory. FARTCOIN failed to break this obstacle with its latest attempt. Another rejection will likely trigger declines toward $0.2905. Breaching this zone will demonstrate bear dominance and delay the anticipated near-term bounce-back. A decisive move past $0.4088 could support extended gains to $0.55 – $0.65, above which FARTCOIN will meet a long-term resistance at $0.6920. Broad market sentiments would be vital in determining Fartcoin’s short-term price direction. Meanwhile, the crypto landscape could be on the verge of an “altcoin season,” according to analysts. The materializing altcoin season Crypto trader and analyst Ash Crypto observed a vital technical setup for the altcoin market. The weekly chart reveals altcoin market capitalization, excluding Bitcoin. Source – Ash Crypto on X Meanwhile, the key development is the bullish divergence between the Relative Strength Index and altcoins’ market cap. The divergence suggests strengthening underlying momentum despite a bearish price outlook, suggesting impending turnarounds. The market cap printed a higher low after the latest retracement, suggesting a possible support barrier. The Relative Strength Index formed a lower low after the higher low price pattern. That printed a bullish divergence, which often heralds significant reversals. The uptrend line confirms buyers reentering to defend the key support. The latest green candlesticks highlight revived investor optimism, empowering the bullish divergence indicator. The market cap could rally to $1.2 trillion if it holds the trendline and the Relative Strength Index confirms the emerging reversal. However, breaching the trendline might see the altcoin market revising the support at $800 – $900 billion. That would further delay the anticipated 2025 altcoin season. Current altcoin market outlook The market capitalization of all altcoins maintained downtrends with lower lows and higher lows since mid-December 2024. The altcoin market cap recently secured a reliable support barrier at $1.03 trillion, catalyzing bounce-back speculations. However, the rebound might not be easy as prices remain beneath key MAs. The 200-day SMA presents a significant resistance at $1.16 trillion. Also, the largest altcoin by value, Ethereum, hints at bearish near-term actions. ETH trades at $1,970 after losing over 2% in the past day. Invezz highlighted a potential Ethereum crash to $1,250, a more than 36% dip from Ethereum’s current price. Amidst the uncertainty, FARTCOIN enthusiasts will watch the resistance at $0.4088 and the support barrier at $0.2905.

According to a recent report by WIRED, a government memo that has been circulating among State Department officials reveals the Trump administration’s plans for the United States Agency for International Development. Originally procured by the media outlet Politico, the 13-page document excerpt outlines structural changes intended for the humanitarian agency under the Trump administration. Aside from changing its name to the U.S. International Humanitarian Assistance or IHA, USAID will reportedly start incorporating blockchain technology into its procurement process. “All distributions would also be secured and traced via blockchain technology to radically increase security, transparency, and traceability,” stated in the memo. According to the memo, the use of blockchain technology in the agency is aimed at bolstering innovation and efficiency, as well as allowing for “more flexible and responsive programming focused on tangible impact rather than simply completing activities and inputs.” In early February, USAID staff were put on administrative leave before Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE ( DOGE ) slashed it workforce down from 10,000 to 300 staffers. Moreover, the State Department ordered it to stop sending a portion of payments to partner organizations around the world Read more: Trump’s pro-crypto address at DAS boosts Bitcoin confidence: expert However, it is still unclear how blockchain technology will play a role in the agency’s day-to-day operations. There are a few possibilities, one of them includes the use of a blockchain ledger to record the distribution of aid, making it more transparent and traceable. Another possible outcome is for the agency to start distributing monetary aid through cryptocurrencies like stablecoin to its partners instead of cash transfers. Just a day prior, Trump delivered a virtual address at the Digital Assets Summit where he urged the U.S. Congress to pass stablecoin regulations and establish simple rules for stablecoins and market structures. In the past, there have been instance where blockchain technology have been used by humanitarian organizations. In 2022, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees or UNHCR ran a small pilot project which distributed funds through stablecoins to displaced Ukrainians due to the Russia-Ukraine war. Similarly in 2018, The Kenya Red Cross Society launched a pilot project called “Blockchain Technology in Humanitarian Programming,” in which the blockchain was used to record transactions and to help people receive funds without needing to open a bank account. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which works with the Kenya team, also helped to develop the Humanitarian Token Solution.

As reported, the UAE is poised to become a key destination for crypto and stablecoin ventures seeking refuge from the EU’s newly implemented Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The regulatory framework, which took full effect on December 30, is creating significant challenges for crypto firms within the 27-member bloc, prompting many to consider relocating, according to industry experts.

According to data from SoSoValue, 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively pulled in $165.75 million in net inflows on Thursday, a huge leap compared to just $11.8 million the day before. It also marked the fifth straight day of positive inflows, with nearly $700 million entering Bitcoin ETFs over that period. BlackRock’s IBIT led the charge with a whopping $172.14 million in net inflows, bouncing back after a day of zero movement. Other players like VanEck’s HODL, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Grayscale’s mini Bitcoin Trust also saw more modest gains of $11.9 million, $9.19 million, and $5.22 million, respectively. However, not everyone benefited. Funds like Bitwise’s BITB, Grayscale’s ETHE, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC saw investors pulling out nearly $32.7 million altogether, showing that sentiment still varies across providers. The surge in ETF demand comes after a rough five-week stretch of outflows. Investors had been holding back due to concerns over trade war talk, rising geopolitical tensions, and macro uncertainty. But Wednesday’s Fed meeting brought some relief.

That opened the door to possible future rate cuts, sparking optimism in risk-on markets like crypto . Bitcoin responded quickly, shooting up 4.5% to $85,786 and even briefly hitting $87,431. Ethereum and Solana joined the rally with 4% and 6% gains, respectively. The total crypto market cap climbed 3% to $2.947 trillion, while futures markets saw $355 million in liquidations, mostly from short positions. Adding to the bullish sentiment was yesterday’s SEC announcement confirming that mining activities for Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash won’t fall under current securities laws. However, when writing, Bitcoin ( BTC ) was down 2% in the last 24 hours, exchanging hands at $84,165 per coin. While ETF inflows signal a resurgence of demand for regulated BTC exposure, analysts remain divided on Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. Analyst RJT_WAGMI points out that Bitcoin is hanging right at a crucial technical level, testing a descending trendline while butting heads with the 100-day moving average and the Ichimoku Cloud. The analyst noted that a breakout from the zone could trigger a strong rally, but if Bitcoin gets rejected here, it may lead to a downside move. Source: X/RJT_WAGM Trader Great Mattsby offers a bigger picture, noting that Bitcoin is still tracking within a long-term upward logarithmic trend channel, hinting the next major peak might not arrive until 2025-26 — so there could still be room to run. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju brings a macro lens, arguing that while retail demand is strong, especially via ETFs, it doesn’t reflect on-chain like it used to. He believes the bull cycle might technically be over, not in a crash sense, but more that it could take another 6 to 12 months for Bitcoin to punch through its all-time high, thanks to tight liquidity and broader economic conditions.

The rally was largely driven by speculation around U.S. President Donald Trump’s virtual appearance at the Digital Asset Summit in New York. However, following his speech, BTC quickly retracted its gains, falling to $84,000, as traders were left disappointed by the lack of groundbreaking crypto policies. Ahead of Trump’s statement, rumors circulated on X, suggesting he might announce zero capital gains taxes on certain cryptocurrencies or unveil a strategic U.S. Bitcoin reserve plan. Neither materialized. Instead, Trump reiterated his promise not to sell Bitcoin confiscated by the government and urged Congress to pass clear stablecoin legislation. His most significant comment was a pledge to make the U.S. a global leader in cryptocurrency . However, traders who bought into the pre-speech hype swiftly sold on the news, triggering the sharp price correction. Analysts Predict a Potential Bitcoin Correction While Bitcoin’s rapid dip disappointed some, chartered market technician Aksel Kibar noted that the price could still correct further, potentially falling to $73,700. He highlighted that BTC’s long-term chart still suggests a pullback to this level, which could determine the market’s direction in the coming months. Bitcoin’s price action wasn’t entirely driven by Trump’s remarks. On March 19, BTC also responded positively to the release of the FOMC minutes, where Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank’s quantitative tightening (QT) regime would slow down. Powell also hinted at two possible interest rate cuts in 2025, boosting market optimism. Futures and Spot Market Activity A large portion of Bitcoin’s recent volatility has been driven by futures market activity, but the reappearance of the BTC Coinbase premium suggests that spot market demand may be returning. This could indicate renewed buying interest, providing some stability to the market despite the recent pullback. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes celebrated what he described as the Fed’s implicit confirmation that QT would essentially end by April 1, but he warned that BTC could still face volatility .

42086320,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142140,1742542830,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Bithumb Raid: Seoul Prosecutors Investigate Crypto Exchange Over Fund Misuse Scandal,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bithumb-exchange-raid-seoul/,"In a stunning development shaking the South Korean cryptocurrency landscape, Bithumb, a leading crypto exchange, has become the center of a high-stakes investigation. Seoul prosecutors have launched a raid on the exchange, acting on allegations of significant fund misuse by its former CEO. This move signals a serious escalation in regulatory scrutiny within the crypto sector and raises critical questions about corporate governance and investor protection in the rapidly evolving digital asset market. For crypto enthusiasts and investors closely monitoring market dynamics, this Bithumb raid is a pivotal event with potentially far-reaching consequences. What Triggered the Seoul Prosecutors’ Raid on Bithumb? The raid, executed on March 20th, was reportedly initiated following a referral from South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS). The FSS, the primary financial regulator in the nation, flagged concerns regarding the alleged misuse of corporate funds by Bithumb. According to local news outlet YTN, the core of the investigation revolves around accusations that Bithumb corporate funds were improperly diverted to assist its former CEO in purchasing an apartment. This action, if substantiated, could represent a serious breach of fiduciary duty and potentially violate financial regulations. To understand the gravity of the situation, let’s break down the key elements: The Allegation: Bithumb is accused of using company funds to facilitate a personal real estate transaction for its former CEO. The Regulator’s Role: The Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) investigated the allegations and deemed them serious enough to warrant prosecutorial involvement, referring the case to Seoul prosecutors. The Action: Seoul prosecutors, upon receiving the referral, conducted a search and seizure raid at Bithumb’s offices, indicating a formal criminal investigation is underway. The Exchange’s Status: Bithumb is one of South Korea’s largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges, making this raid a significant event for the entire industry. This raid underscores the increasing vigilance of South Korean regulators towards cryptocurrency exchanges, particularly concerning the management and utilization of corporate funds. It also highlights the potential risks associated with leadership transitions and corporate governance within these often rapidly growing and less mature financial entities. Why is the Bithumb Raid a Major Development for the Crypto Exchange Industry? The Bithumb raid sends shockwaves throughout the cryptocurrency industry for several compelling reasons. Bithumb is not just any crypto exchange; it is a cornerstone of the South Korean digital asset market, which is globally recognized as one of the most active and influential. Any legal action against such a prominent player has immediate and far-reaching implications. Consider these points to understand the significance: Market Impact: Bithumb’s trading volume and user base are substantial. Negative news surrounding the exchange can trigger market volatility, affecting not only Bithumb but also the broader cryptocurrency market sentiment, especially in South Korea. Regulatory Precedent: This raid sets a precedent for how South Korean authorities will handle allegations of financial misconduct within crypto exchanges. It signals a zero-tolerance approach towards fund misuse and corporate malfeasance. Investor Confidence: Incidents like this can erode investor confidence in crypto exchanges, raising concerns about the safety and security of their investments. This is particularly critical in a market where trust is paramount. Global Scrutiny: As South Korea is a major crypto hub, actions taken by its regulators are closely watched globally. This case will likely influence regulatory approaches in other jurisdictions as well. Compliance Pressure: The raid intensifies pressure on all crypto exchanges to enhance their compliance frameworks, internal controls, and corporate governance practices to avoid similar scrutiny and legal repercussions. The Seoul prosecutors ‘ involvement signifies that this is not merely a regulatory matter but potentially a criminal investigation. This elevates the stakes significantly for Bithumb and its current management. The outcome of this investigation could have profound consequences for the exchange’s future operations and its standing in the market. Delving Deeper: What Constitutes ‘Fund Misuse’ and its Implications? The core allegation – fund misuse – warrants closer examination. In corporate contexts, fund misuse generally refers to the inappropriate or unauthorized use of company assets, often for personal gain or purposes not aligned with the company’s interests. In the case of Bithumb, the accusation centers on diverting corporate funds to aid the former CEO’s personal property acquisition. Potential implications of such fund misuse can be severe, both legally and reputationally: Aspect Implications of Fund Misuse Legal Ramifications Criminal charges for individuals involved (e.g., embezzlement, breach of trust). Fines and penalties for the company. Potential suspension or revocation of operating licenses for the crypto exchange. Civil lawsuits from shareholders or affected parties. Reputational Damage Loss of trust from users and investors. Negative brand perception and damage to Bithumb’s reputation. Decreased trading volume and market share. Difficulty in attracting new users and partners. Operational Disruptions Ongoing investigation and legal proceedings can distract management and resources. Potential regulatory sanctions may impact daily operations. Increased scrutiny from banks and financial institutions, potentially affecting banking relationships. It’s crucial to remember that these are allegations at this stage, and the investigation is ongoing. However, even the initiation of such a high-profile investigation underscores the risks inherent in the crypto industry and the importance of robust corporate governance. South Korea Crypto Regulation: A Landscape of Increasing Scrutiny The South Korea crypto regulation environment has been evolving rapidly, marked by an increasing focus on consumer protection, anti-money laundering (AML), and market integrity. South Korea was one of the first countries to implement comprehensive regulations for the cryptocurrency sector, demonstrating a proactive approach to managing the risks and opportunities presented by digital assets. Key aspects of South Korea’s crypto regulatory landscape include: Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) Registration: Crypto exchanges operating in South Korea are required to register as VASPs with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU) and comply with stringent AML and KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements. Real-Name Verification: Trading on exchanges typically requires real-name verification for user accounts, aimed at enhancing transparency and preventing illicit activities. Information Security Management System (ISMS) Certification: Exchanges must obtain ISMS certification to demonstrate robust cybersecurity measures and protect user data. Travel Rule Compliance: South Korea has implemented the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel Rule, requiring exchanges to exchange originator and beneficiary information for crypto transactions exceeding a certain threshold. Ongoing Regulatory Development: South Korean regulators continue to refine and expand crypto regulations, adapting to the evolving nature of the market and emerging risks. This includes discussions around investor protection, stablecoin regulation, and DeFi (Decentralized Finance). The Bithumb raid can be seen as part of this broader trend of heightened regulatory scrutiny. It signals that South Korean authorities are not only focused on establishing regulatory frameworks but are also actively enforcing them, particularly when it comes to allegations of financial misconduct and corporate governance failures within crypto exchanges. Impact of the Bithumb Raid on Investor Confidence and Market Stability The immediate aftermath of the Bithumb raid is likely to be felt in investor confidence and market stability, especially within the South Korean crypto market. News of such a significant investigation can create uncertainty and apprehension among investors, potentially leading to market volatility. Potential impacts on investor confidence and market stability include: Short-Term Market Fluctuations: News of the raid could trigger sell-offs or increased trading volatility for Bithumb and potentially other South Korean exchanges as investors react to the uncertainty. Erosion of Trust: Incidents like this can erode the overall trust in cryptocurrency exchanges, particularly among retail investors who may be more risk-averse. Increased Scrutiny of Other Exchanges: The Bithumb case may prompt regulators to intensify their scrutiny of other crypto exchanges in South Korea and globally, leading to further investigations or compliance checks. Potential for Contagion: Negative sentiment surrounding one major exchange can sometimes spread to the broader market, affecting the prices of cryptocurrencies and the overall market capitalization. Long-Term Regulatory Impact: The outcome of the Bithumb investigation could influence future regulatory decisions and enforcement actions in the crypto sector, both in South Korea and internationally. For investors, it is crucial to stay informed, exercise caution, and diversify their holdings to mitigate risks associated with market volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Monitoring developments in the Bithumb case and the broader regulatory landscape is essential for navigating the evolving crypto market. Actionable Insights: Navigating Risks in the Crypto Exchange Landscape The Bithumb raid serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks within the cryptocurrency exchange landscape. While crypto exchanges provide crucial gateways to the digital asset market, they also operate within a complex and often rapidly changing regulatory environment. For users and investors, understanding and mitigating these risks is paramount. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Due Diligence in Exchange Selection: Thoroughly research crypto exchanges before using them. Consider factors such as regulatory compliance, security measures, reputation, transparency, and user reviews. Security Best Practices: Implement robust security practices, including strong passwords, two-factor authentication (2FA), and secure storage of private keys (consider hardware wallets for long-term holdings). Diversification: Do not keep all your crypto assets on a single exchange. Diversify across multiple exchanges and storage solutions to reduce the risk of loss due to exchange-specific issues. Stay Informed about Regulations: Keep abreast of the evolving regulatory landscape in your jurisdiction and the jurisdictions where exchanges you use are based. Regulatory changes can impact exchange operations and user access. Understand Exchange Risks: Be aware of the risks associated with centralized exchanges, including counterparty risk, security breaches, regulatory actions, and potential market manipulation. Consider Decentralized Alternatives: Explore decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and DeFi platforms as alternatives to centralized exchanges, understanding their unique risks and benefits. By taking a proactive and informed approach to engaging with crypto exchanges, users can better navigate the risks and opportunities within this dynamic market. The Bithumb case underscores the need for continuous vigilance and responsible participation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for South Korean Crypto? The Bithumb raid by Seoul prosecutors marks a potentially watershed moment for the South Korean cryptocurrency market and the broader global crypto industry. It highlights the increasing scrutiny that crypto exchanges are facing from regulators worldwide and underscores the critical importance of corporate governance, compliance, and investor protection within this sector. The outcome of this investigation will be closely watched and could set significant precedents for future regulatory actions and industry practices. As the investigation unfolds, the crypto community awaits further details and clarity on the allegations and their potential ramifications. One thing is clear: the era of unchecked growth in the cryptocurrency space is giving way to an era of heightened regulation and accountability. For crypto exchanges, the message is resounding: robust compliance, ethical conduct, and investor protection are no longer optional – they are imperatives for survival and sustainable growth.

As the price kept plunging, the volume increased by more than 40%, which suggests the traders could have turned bearish on PI. Amid the rising attacks on PI on social media platforms and some exchanges refusing to list the token, is there any possibility of the token revamping a strong rebound as it has almost reached the lowest point? Besides, the Pi supply is steadily decreasing due to the removal of transaction fees from circulation. Nearly 528,671 PI had been burned by early March at a rate of 3000-4000 tokens per day, although it has not announced any formal coin burn. The tokens of users who missed the KYC deadline were burned, and hence this deflationary mechanism sparks the speculation of a positive impact on its value. The short-term price action of PI suggests the token has reached one of the lowest points after its mainnet launch. The bearish influence prevails despite the price testing the lower support of the falling wedge. This could point towards an extended bearish action, dragging the levels below $0.65, while the technicals hint towards a potential rebound. The stochastic RSI has reached the oversold zone and if it consolidates as it did in previous times, then the Pi price is expected to remain accumulated at around $1. Besides, if the RSI triggers a bullish rebound, then the token is expected to rise and test the resistance at $1.02 and if it clears these levels, it may enter an important resistance zone between $1.19 and $1.24. Until and unless the Pi Network price does not clear these levels, bearish clouds may continue to haunt the rally with a possibility of plunging to $0.7 or below. The optimism surrounding the PI price rally appears to have been fading quickly as the uncertainty over the open mainnet launch persists. With no clear roadmap and delayed listing by popular exchanges like Binance, it could have shaken the investor’s confidence in the token. Besides, there are no clear timelines; the future of the token remains vague, which raises the speculation that it is a scam. Therefore, the market participants are advised to be vigilant before being conclusive.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|ALTCOIN|BNB|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-21 07:51:12

This marks a continuation of its poor performance, with the coin losing more than 43% of its value over the past week. The excitement surrounding the mainnet launch is quickly fading, and Pi Coin has slipped out of the top 20 cryptocurrencies, down from the 11th spot just last week. What is Causing The Decline? Notably, Pi Coin’s value has declined due to delays in its listing on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Initial optimism surged when these platforms hinted at a potential listing, but the failure to follow through led to a decrease in demand for the coin. Another common concern is the lack of a clear roadmap for the Open Mainnet launch. While other crypto projects offer transparent timelines, Pi Network’s plans remain uncertain, leading to rumors and discussions about whether it’s a scam. Transparency Issues and More Dr. Altcoin, who has been closely involved with Pi Network, clarified that while there is a communication gap, there is no solid evidence to label Pi Network as a scam. However, he emphasized that the Pi Core Team needs to improve transparency and communication to restore investor confidence. In a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), Justin Bons, founder of CyberCapital pointed out several issues with the network. He suggested that contrary to its claims of decentralization, Pi Network remains heavily centralized. 1/9) WARNING: PI is a straight-up scam! Offering an ""MLM"" based ""mining"" scheme on mobile is a gimmick, as it does not contribute to consensus! PI is fully permissioned (centralized) & everything requires KYC, even simple TX's! PI is an investment scam; it is that bad: — Justin Bons (@Justin_Bons) March 19, 2025 Justin Bons criticized Pi Network for lack of transparency, claiming insiders might control 20% of the supply. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou also shared similar concerns, labeling it “more dangerous than meme coins.” Bons also criticized the five-year-delayed mainnet launch, calling the network’s promises of innovation and decentralization misleading. He also claimed that Pi Network’s core technology was copied from Stellar (XLM). Token Unlock Ahead, More Decline Further? Pi Coin’s price has dropped significantly, falling below $1.0 ahead of the upcoming token unlocking event. The upcoming release of 129 million Pi coins, worth $140.61 million, is expected to negatively impact the coin’s value. Large token unlocks like this have historically led to price declines. Investor concerns over the token unlock have intensified, and many members of the Pi Network community, known as Pioneers, have started locking up their PI holdings off as well.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-21 07:53:37

On March 21, local media Hankyung reported that the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Financial Services Commission is considering sanctions against crypto exchanges for allegedly operating in the country without reporting as an operator to the appropriate regulators. South Korean financial authorities require crypto exchanges to report to regulators as virtual asset service providers (VASPs) under the country’s Specified Financial Information Act. The FIU is investigating a list of exchanges and is conducting consultations with related agencies. The regulator is also considering sanctions, such as blocking access to the exchanges, as they begin to prepare countermeasures. Exchanges operated without VASP reports The list of exchanges that have allegedly provided services to South Koreans without the appropriate VASP reports includes BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix and KCEX. The exchanges reportedly provided marketing and customer support to Korean investors without going through the country’s compliance process. Under the country’s laws, operators of crypto sales, storage, brokerage and management are required to report to the FIU. If exchanges don’t comply, their business will be considered illegal and subject to criminal penalties and administrative sanctions. An FIU official said in the report that measures to block access to the exchanges included in the list are being reviewed. The official said the financial regulator is currently consulting with the Korea Communications Standards Commission, the regulator in charge of the internet, on how they can block access to the exchanges.

On March 20, prosecutors raided Bithumb following suspicions that its former CEO, Kim Dae-sik, embezzled company funds to purchase an apartment. The authorities suspect that the exchange and its executive may have violated some financial laws during the apartment purchase. However, Bithumb responded that Kim had already taken a loan to repay the funds. In addition, rumors of intermediaries getting paid to list projects on Bithumb and Upbit surfaced. Citing anonymous sources, Wu Blockchain said projects claimed to have paid intermediaries millions to get listed on the exchanges. Upbit responded, demanding the media outlet to disclose the list of digital asset projects that paid brokerage fees.

42086322,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=142142,1742544025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bold Move: Hong Kong’s EDA Group Dives into $5M Cryptocurrency Investment,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/hong-kong-eda-group-crypto/,"In a surprising turn of events that underscores the growing mainstream acceptance of digital currencies, Hong Kong-listed EDA Group has announced its consideration of a significant foray into the crypto world. Imagine a traditional industrial group stepping into the volatile yet promising realm of cryptocurrency – that’s precisely what EDA Group is contemplating. This potential $5 million investment isn’t just about chasing trends; it’s a strategic move to integrate blockchain technology into their core operations, signaling a possible shift in how businesses perceive and utilize virtual assets. Let’s delve deeper into what this exciting development means and why it could be a game-changer. Why is EDA Group Exploring Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Adoption? EDA Group’s interest in cryptocurrency isn’t a shot in the dark. It’s a calculated step towards leveraging the transformative power of blockchain technology. The company explicitly stated its intention to utilize blockchain to enhance industrial development and streamline payments . But what does this actually mean? Let’s break it down: Enhanced Industrial Development: Blockchain can revolutionize various industrial processes by providing transparency, security, and efficiency. Think about supply chain management, where tracking goods becomes seamless and tamper-proof. For a diversified group like EDA, this could translate to significant operational improvements across different sectors they operate in. Streamlined Payments: Cryptocurrencies offer faster and potentially cheaper cross-border payment solutions compared to traditional banking systems. This is particularly relevant in today’s globalized economy where businesses frequently engage in international transactions. By adopting crypto for payments, EDA Group could reduce transaction costs and improve the speed of financial operations. Future-Proofing Operations: Embracing blockchain and virtual assets isn’t just about immediate gains; it’s about positioning EDA Group at the forefront of technological innovation. As industries increasingly integrate blockchain, early adopters like EDA stand to gain a competitive edge. Setting Up a Dedicated Department for Virtual Asset Operations EDA Group isn’t just dipping its toes in the water; they are planning a full dive. The proposal to establish a dedicated department to oversee virtual asset operations speaks volumes about their commitment. This isn’t a casual side project; it’s a strategic initiative requiring specialized expertise and focused management. Here’s why this dedicated department is crucial: Specialized Expertise: The cryptocurrency market is complex and requires a unique skillset to navigate. A dedicated department ensures that professionals with the necessary knowledge in blockchain, crypto trading, and virtual asset management are at the helm. Risk Management Focus: The announcement explicitly mentions that the department will also manage risks. This is paramount in the volatile crypto market. Effective risk management strategies are essential to protect investments and ensure compliance with evolving regulations. Strategic Development: A dedicated team can focus on developing and implementing a comprehensive virtual asset strategy aligned with EDA Group’s overall business objectives. This includes identifying opportunities, exploring partnerships, and ensuring seamless integration of crypto operations. This proactive approach to virtual asset operations demonstrates that EDA Group is serious about making cryptocurrency a meaningful part of their business strategy, not just a speculative venture. Institutional Crypto Investment: A Growing Trend? EDA Group’s potential investment is part of a larger, more significant trend: the increasing institutional adoption of cryptocurrency. For years, crypto was largely seen as a retail phenomenon, but now, major institutions are entering the fray. Why is this happening, and what does it mean for the future of crypto? Factors Driving Institutional Crypto Investment: Factor Description Maturing Market The cryptocurrency market is becoming more mature with better infrastructure, regulated exchanges, and sophisticated investment tools. Diversification Benefits Crypto assets offer diversification benefits as they often have low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds. Inflation Hedge Some institutions view cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a hedge against inflation, especially in times of economic uncertainty. Technological Innovation The underlying blockchain technology is increasingly recognized for its potential to disrupt and improve various industries. Client Demand Many institutional investors are responding to growing client demand for exposure to digital assets. Examples of institutional crypto adoption are becoming more common. Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have made significant Bitcoin investments. Major financial institutions are offering crypto services and investment products. This growing trend suggests that institutional crypto investment is not just a fad but a fundamental shift in the financial landscape. Challenges and Risks in Hong Kong Crypto Investments While EDA Group’s move is exciting, venturing into Hong Kong crypto investments is not without its challenges and risks. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and regulatory landscapes are still evolving. What are some of the key hurdles EDA Group might face? Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate wildly, leading to potential losses. Managing this volatility is crucial for any institutional investor. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong, and globally, is still developing. Changes in regulations could impact crypto investments and operations. Security Risks: Cybersecurity threats, including hacking and theft, are a significant concern in the crypto space. Robust security measures are essential to protect virtual assets. Operational Complexity: Managing crypto assets, ensuring compliance, and integrating them into existing business processes can be complex and require specialized expertise. Public Perception: Despite growing acceptance, some segments of the public and traditional finance still view cryptocurrencies with skepticism. Managing public perception and ensuring transparency is important. EDA Group’s plan to set up a dedicated risk management department is a clear indication that they are aware of these challenges and are taking proactive steps to mitigate them. Navigating the Hong Kong crypto regulatory environment and implementing robust security protocols will be critical for their success. Actionable Insights: What Can Businesses Learn from EDA Group’s Crypto Consideration? EDA Group’s potential crypto investment offers valuable lessons for other businesses considering entering the virtual asset space. Here are some actionable insights: Strategic Approach is Key: Don’t treat crypto as a speculative side project. Integrate it strategically into your business objectives, whether it’s for enhancing operations, improving payments, or diversifying investments.

Recently the United States doubled down on crypto development, announcing its intent to build a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. With US dollar-backed stablecoins spreading fast, thanks to Trump’s pro-crypto stance, Europe has already raised red flags over monetary control. Now, China is weighing its options. A recent article by Zhang Ming, a top economist from China’s National Finance and Development Laboratory, highlights the risks of these digital assets strengthening US dollar dominance. The Rising Influence of Dollar Stablecoins Stablecoins pegged to the US dollar have become dominant in crypto trading and decentralized finance (DeFi). Many people in countries with weaker currencies use them as a store of value. Zhang warns that these digital assets could further solidify the US dollar’s global financial power, as they connect the real-world credit of the dollar with the virtual economy. Expanding China’s CBDC Scope One of Zhang’s key suggestions is expanding the use of China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan. Currently, it mainly serves as a digital alternative to cash (M0) for retail transactions. However, Zhang suggests that it should also cover bank deposits (M1 and M2) and business transactions. Although China has already conducted some business-to-business (B2B) cross-border CBDC payments, Zhang believes the digital yuan must go further to counter the rise of dollar-backed stablecoins. He did not mention mBridge, China’s existing cross-border CBDC project, which has international ambitions but also faces concerns over its involvement with sanctioned countries like Russia. China’s Stablecoin Potential Another option is for China to develop its own stablecoins. Zhang views this as an unexplored area, but China has already started experimenting—mainly through Hong Kong. The region has approved several crypto exchanges, launched a stablecoin regulatory sandbox, and recently saw Standard Chartered form a stablecoin venture with Animoca Brands and Hong Kong Telecom. To strengthen the Chinese yuan’s international role, Zhang suggests leveraging major Chinese platforms like Ant Group’s Alipay and Ant International. These companies already have a strong presence in Asia and beyond. By integrating digital tokens into their global payment networks, China could boost the yuan’s influence and counterbalance the dominance of US dollar stablecoins. US-China Tech War and the Future The rivalry between China and the US is not just about trade but also about technology. While the US supports innovation in the crypto space, China is focusing on government-controlled digital finance. This difference in approach could shape the future of global finance. If China’s strategy succeeds, it may change how international transactions are conducted. However, widespread adoption of the digital yuan will take time, and it remains to be seen whether it can truly challenge the US dollar. China’s crypto strategy is a clear sign of its ambitions to reshape global finance. Whether it succeeds or not, it is already influencing how nations view digital currencies and financial independence.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|FIAT|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-21 08:02:38

On March 20, the Treasury released a new policy paper outlining plans to bring key parts of the digital asset industry under existing financial services laws. According to authorities, the regulations would help “identify opportunities, manage risks, unlock innovation, protect consumers and uphold market integrity.” Under the proposed framework, crypto platforms that hold digital assets for customers, such as exchanges, custodians, and certain brokerages, will need to operate under an Australian Financial Services Licence. Platforms that deal in tokenized stored-value facilities, such as some stablecoin issuers, will also be brought into the fold. These issuers will need to meet the same requirements as other stored-value providers, including clear rules for redeeming value and safeguarding customer assets. Authorities noted that this approach would “address the unique risks of [Digital Asset Platforms] and Tokenised SVFs,” with additional disclosure rules to be implemented for tokens that don’t have clear issuers. However, businesses that create digital assets for non-financial purposes, maintain infrastructure or build blockchain software won’t be regulated under the new laws.

Stablecoins used for payments will face oversight similar to that of traditional non-cash payment systems, as they’ll be treated as stored-value facilities under the broader payments reform. However, dealing in these tokens or trading them on secondary markets won’t automatically count as financial dealing. The platforms involved in such trades won’t be considered financial markets simply because they list stablecoins or wrapped tokens. A draft law is expected to drop sometime in 2025, with rollout dates to be confirmed once the legislation is finalized. Addressing debanking in Australia The government also addressed the growing problem of de-banking, where crypto businesses are denied banking services. Officials said they’re working closely with Australia’s major banks to “understand the extent and nature of de-banking.” In recent years, de-banking has become a major headache for crypto firms in Australia, with big players like Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, NAB, and HSBC Australia cutting off or restricting services to such entities. “De-banking can have a devastating impact on de-banked businesses and individuals. It can also stifle competition and innovation in the financial services sector and negatively impact Australia’s economy,” authorities noted, adding that the proposed framework would strengthen risk management across the crypto sector and, in turn, improve trust with banks. Looking ahead, regulators will also explore how tokenisation could reshape asset markets, assess crypto tax reporting standards, monitor DeFi developments, and weigh the potential benefits of a central bank digital currency for Australia’s financial system.

According to a Mar. 20 post on X by Tether chief executive officer Paolo Ardoino, Tether ( USDT ) purchased a net $33.1 billion in U.S. Treasuries last year. This put it ahead of countries like Germany, Canada, and Mexico. In a separate post, Ardoino also noted that Tether’s global presence has grown rapidly, with USDT adoption surpassing 400 million users, mostly in developing nations. https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1902689997766922318?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw As of Mar. 21, USDT leads the stablecoin market with 62.45% of the $230 billion total supply, according to DeFiLlama data .

A proposed stablecoin bill could limit offshore issuers from accessing U.S. Treasury markets. U.S.-based competitors like USDC may gain from this bill at the expense of Tether. Nevertheless, Ardoino is still optimistic about Tether’s role in the U.S. Treasury market. During a Mar. 11 event hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, Ardoino made the case that Tether’s investments strengthen and diversify the U.S. debt markets. “We’ve done more for financial inclusion than anyone else,” he said. “And while doing that, we’re buying back U.S. debt. If we were a country, we’d be the 18th largest holder of U.S. Treasuries.” Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent continue to push for stablecoin-friendly policies, stressing their role in maintaining the dollar’s global dominance. Trump, in a Mar. 20 virtual speech at Blockworks’ Digital Asset Summit, urged Congress to pass clear, common-sense regulations to encourage institutional adoption.

A significant shift is underway in the regulatory landscape. The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), under the watchful eye of South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC), has initiated strong enforcement actions. Their target? Overseas crypto exchanges operating within South Korea without proper registration. This move signals a serious escalation in how South Korea is approaching the regulation of digital assets, and it could have far-reaching implications for both users and exchanges alike. Let’s dive into the details of this developing situation. What’s the Buzz About Korean Crypto Exchange Regulations? The core issue revolves around registration. According to a report in The Korea Economic Daily, the FIU is cracking down on overseas platforms that are serving Korean users without being registered under the Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information. Think of it as needing a license to operate within South Korean financial territory. This isn’t just a minor procedural matter; it’s about compliance with local laws designed to protect users and maintain financial integrity. Which exchanges are in the crosshairs? The report names some prominent players in the global crypto exchange arena: BitMEX KuCoin CoinW Bitunix KCEX These are not small, obscure platforms. They are exchanges with significant global reach, indicating the seriousness of the FIU’s enforcement efforts. The primary enforcement measure being considered is website access blocks. Imagine waking up one day and finding you can no longer access your preferred exchange – that’s the potential reality for Korean users of these unregistered exchanges . Why is the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) Taking Such Decisive Action? The FIU’s actions are rooted in the need to enforce crypto regulations and ensure a level playing field. The Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information is the legal backbone for this enforcement. But why is this law so important in the context of cryptocurrency? Here’s a breakdown: Combating Illicit Activities : Unregistered exchanges can be breeding grounds for illegal activities like money laundering, terrorist financing, and tax evasion. Registration and oversight help to mitigate these risks. Investor Protection : Registered exchanges are subject to regulatory scrutiny, which includes measures to protect users’ funds and data. This protection is often absent with unregistered platforms. Fair Market Practices : Regulations promote fair trading practices and transparency, ensuring that all market participants operate under the same rules. National Financial Security : By regulating crypto exchanges, the FIU aims to maintain the integrity and stability of the national financial system, preventing unregulated entities from undermining it. In essence, the FIU’s enforcement is about bringing order and accountability to the rapidly evolving crypto space within South Korea. It’s about safeguarding the financial system and protecting Korean citizens who are engaging with cryptocurrencies. Impact on Korean Crypto Users and Unregistered Exchanges This enforcement action has significant implications for both Korean users and the targeted unregistered exchanges . For Korean Users: Potential Access Restrictions : The most immediate concern is the potential blocking of website access. This could lock Korean users out of their accounts on these exchanges, making it difficult to manage or withdraw their assets. Need to Shift to Registered Exchanges : Korean users may need to transition to using locally registered exchanges to ensure uninterrupted access to crypto trading and services. This might involve account closures and asset transfers. Increased Awareness of Regulatory Compliance : This action serves as a strong reminder to Korean crypto users about the importance of using regulated platforms and being aware of local crypto regulations . For Unregistered Exchanges: Reputational Damage : Being targeted by a major financial regulator can significantly damage an exchange’s reputation and erode user trust. Loss of Korean Market Share : Website blocks mean losing access to the Korean market, which is a significant crypto market globally. Pressure to Comply or Exit : Exchanges will face pressure to either comply with Korean regulations by registering or to withdraw from serving Korean users altogether. Registration can be a complex and costly process. Global Regulatory Scrutiny : This action from South Korea could set a precedent and encourage other jurisdictions to take similar enforcement measures against unregistered exchanges . Navigating the Complexities of Cryptocurrency Enforcement Globally South Korea’s move is not happening in isolation. Globally, we are seeing a trend of increased regulatory scrutiny and cryptocurrency enforcement . Governments and financial watchdogs worldwide are grappling with how to regulate the decentralized and often borderless nature of cryptocurrencies. Challenges in Crypto Regulation: Cross-border Nature : Cryptocurrencies operate globally, making it challenging for individual nations to regulate them effectively. Exchanges can easily operate from jurisdictions with lax regulations. Technological Complexity : The underlying technology of cryptocurrencies is complex, making it difficult for regulators to fully understand and regulate all aspects of the ecosystem. Balancing Innovation and Control : Regulators need to strike a balance between fostering innovation in the crypto space and mitigating risks. Overly strict regulations can stifle innovation, while lax regulations can lead to financial instability and illicit activities. Evolving Landscape : The crypto space is constantly evolving with new technologies, applications, and business models emerging rapidly. Regulations need to be adaptable to keep pace with this evolution. Despite these challenges, the trend is clear: regulatory oversight of the crypto industry is here to stay and is likely to intensify. South Korea’s enforcement action is a strong signal of this global trend. Staying Ahead: Actionable Insights for Crypto Participants In this evolving regulatory environment, what should crypto users and businesses do to stay ahead of the curve? For Crypto Users: Prioritize Registered Exchanges : When choosing a crypto exchange, especially if you are based in or accessing services from a specific jurisdiction like South Korea, opt for platforms that are registered and compliant with local regulations. Stay Informed About Regulations : Keep yourself updated on the latest crypto regulations in your jurisdiction and any jurisdictions where you use crypto services. Regulatory changes can impact your access and usage. Diversify Your Holdings : Don’t keep all your crypto assets on a single exchange, especially an unregistered one. Diversification across multiple platforms, including registered ones, can mitigate risks. Understand KYC/AML Requirements : Be prepared to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements on regulated platforms. This is part of the regulatory framework to ensure compliance and security. For Crypto Exchanges (especially overseas platforms): Assess Regulatory Compliance Needs : If you are serving users in specific jurisdictions like South Korea, proactively assess your compliance requirements and take steps to register or comply with local regulations. Engage with Regulators : Maintain open communication with regulatory bodies and seek guidance on compliance matters. Proactive engagement can help navigate complex regulatory landscapes. Enhance Compliance Infrastructure : Invest in robust KYC/AML compliance infrastructure and processes to meet regulatory standards and build trust with users and regulators. Geographic Strategy Review : Re-evaluate your geographic strategy in light of increasing regulatory scrutiny. Decide whether to invest in compliance for specific markets or adjust your market focus. Conclusion: A New Era of Crypto Regulation Dawns in South Korea South Korea’s forceful action against unregistered exchanges marks a significant moment in the evolution of crypto regulations . It underscores the growing global determination to bring the crypto industry under regulatory oversight. For Korean crypto users, it’s a wake-up call to prioritize registered platforms and stay informed about compliance. For overseas exchanges, it’s a clear signal that operating in major markets like South Korea requires adherence to local laws and regulations. The era of operating outside the regulatory framework is rapidly closing, and a new era of compliance and accountability is dawning in the world of cryptocurrency.

His high profile and support for the industry have resulted in massive price rallies for his supporter cryptocurrencies. One such event is today, as the Kekius Maximus, an Ethereum meme coin, is flourishing with price gains under the same influence, surging nearly 100%. But what exactly happened, and will the rally continue? Elon Musk’s Post Sparks Kekius Maximus Price Rally This Thursday, Elon Musk posted on X , giving his followers a look into his office set up at the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). However, more than his role in establishing a D.O.G.E., his wall and the caption gained attention, as he displayed a painting of the famous frog theme meme coin, Kekius Maximus, and added ‘My DOGE office with the late great Kekius Maximus on the wall,’ resulting in the immediate price jump of the token. This resulted in a massive 110% price jump from $0.015 to $0.033 within a few hours. At the same time, the trading volume surged from $4.15M to $15.5, displaying high investors attention. Although the token has moved down the peak and trades at $0.02717, it has maintained a 40% surge over the last 24 hours and nearly 100% over the week. Not the First Kekius Maximus Price Surge Due to Elon Musk News Kekius Maximus has a history of volatility in Musk’s influence. In January, the token’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.40, marking nearly a 40,000% surge within a few hours. This happened when Musk adopted the Kekius meme coin briefly and set it as his profile picture on X. Interestingly, even before this, he had posted and described the image of “Pepe the Frog Emperor” as “amazing.” This left investors and early adopters of the token in heavy profits, where one made 17,000% returns on their investment. However, this Kekius price rally was short-lived and ended once he changed his profile picture again. As a result, the token tumbled, losing 92% of its value. Ever since then, it has been in a significant consolidation. This leaves investors in doubt about whether this bullish trajectory will continue. Will Kekius Maximus Price Rally Sustain? The Elon Musk effect on meme coins is a known phenomenon, where his endorsements or talks influenced these asset prices. The leading meme-themed cryptocurrencies affected by him are Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and now Kekius Maximus. Although the current surge is impressive, such rallies are short-lived as the hype ends soon. More importantly, those who benefitted from the hype ended up selling their tokens for profit, resulting in selling pressure and a downtrend. However, it is uncertain how well this rally will be sustained, as some analysts argue about a downtrend like the last time, whereas others supporting the Musk-fueled rally believe in a further uptrend. Regardless, Musk’s further involvement is important for the continuity of the surge.

South Korea's FIU Moves to Sanction Unregistered Crypto Exchanges FIU is also considering blocking access to these platforms in cooperation with the Korea Communications Standards Commission (KCSC). According to local reports, the exchanges included on the sanctions list are BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix and KCEX. These platforms are accused of violating South Korea’s anti-money laundering (AML) and financial regulations by operating without the necessary approvals. South Korea's regulatory framework requires all crypto exchanges to register with the FIU and adhere to strict AML policies. Platforms that fail to do so are considered illegal operators and could face serious penalties, including access restrictions and criminal charges. To ensure compliance, the FIU is reportedly working with the KCSC to block website access to blacklisted exchanges, preventing South Korean users from trading on these platforms. South Korea’s Strict Stance on Crypto Regulations The move is in line with South Korea's broader regulatory crackdown on the cryptocurrency industry, aimed at protecting investors and preventing financial crimes. Authorities have taken similar steps in the past, including delisting non-compliant exchanges and tightening AML enforcement on both domestic and foreign trading platforms. While the timeline for sanctions and website restrictions remains unclear, the FIU's latest action signals a firm stance against unregulated cryptocurrency activities in South Korea. *This is not investment advice.

Overall crypto market capitalization fell 3.2% in the past 24 hours, with BTC sliding from $86,000 to under $84,000, ether (ETH) dropping below $2,000 and Solana's SOL falling 5%. XRP showed steady declines bringing Wednesday’s 10% spike to a 4.8% gain over a weekly basis, while BNB Chain’s BNB continued to edge higher, bringing weekly gains to over 8%. At press time, Tron’s TRX and TON were the only major tokens in the green, rising 2% each. TRX was floated on Solana for the first time ever on late Thursday in an attempt to expand its user base. TON saw retail demand after the Toncoin Foundation said that venture capital firms now hold over $400 million worth of the asset after fresh investments. Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting delivered a brief upside catalyst markets had been waiting for, propelling BTC past $85,000 as no rate cuts were announced. However, the Fed said it would scale back its “quantitative tightening” program starting in April which traders likely interpreted as an indirect rate cut, Singapore-based QCP Capital noted in a Telegram broadcast. Options markets have started to position accordingly. “The chance of BTC reaching above $100K by June 30 has increased from 20% to nearly 30% in the last 24 hours,” Dr. Sean Dawson, head of research at onchain options platform derive.xyz, told CoinDesk in an email. “While the probability of ETH remaining above $2000 by June 30 is now a coin flip – was 40% 24 hours ago. Nearly 60% of ETH options traded on Derive.xyz in the last 24 hours were calls bought, indicating a bullish sentiment. For BTC, 34% of all volume was bought, reflecting demand for downside protection,” Dawson added. FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich, who eyes the $80,000 support level as a critical area to watch for a break of support, maintained a cautious tone. “It’s important to note that the crypto market has yet to break above its 200-day moving average, currently sitting close to $2.9 trillion. A strong rally above this level could trigger an active buying phase, but there’s also a risk of bears setting up a trap, as they’ve done several times before,” Kuptsikevich said in a Telegram message. “For bitcoin to maintain momentum, staying above this key level is crucial. If it does, it could spark renewed interest in buying a variety of coins that have been in a correction phase for a while,” he added, referring to broader altcoin and memecoin markets.",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|Solana|TRX|TON|XRP,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|SOL|TON,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-21 08:14:48

The country’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has identified multiple platforms illegally functioning in the country. Reportedly, crypto exchanges such as KuCoin and BitMEX face increased scrutiny for failing to register as virtual asset service providers (VASPs) under the Specific Financial Information Act. South Korea Targets Unregistered Crypto Exchanges As part of South Korea’s crypto regulatory efforts, the Financial Intelligence Unit has cracked down on multiple crypto exchanges alleged of illegally operating in the country. These platforms include BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix, and KCEX. While these exchanges have reportedly failed to register as virtual asset service providers (VASPs) under the Specific Financial Information Act, they face increased scrutiny. They have been found to be operating Korean websites, targeting local investors with marketing and customer support, all without proper registration or disclosure. An FIU official revealed that the regulator is currently analyzing measures to block access to these crypto exchanges. They further cited, We are currently reviewing access blocking measures for unreported overseas exchanges that are providing services to domestic investors through consultation with the Korea Communications Standards Commission. We are organizing damage cases and related data to strengthen communication between the authorities, and we expect to take tangible measures within this year. Kucoin and Other Major Exchanges Targeted for Sanctions According to local reports, South Korea crypto exchanges such as BitMEX, KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix, and KCEX are deemed as illegally operating in the country. As they have failed to adhere to proper regulatory norms, the FIU targets them for sanctions. Notably, the financial watchdog has initiated procedures to take proper actions against these crypto exchanges. With intense scrutiny, the FIU is consulting with relevant organizations to proceed further. This development follows the nation’s recent rejection of the notion of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The Bank of Korea has dismissed the possibility of adopting a crypto reserve citing its volatile nature and inherent risks. In addition, the Bank of Korea is currently experimenting with its CBDC project . The central bank will launch a CBDC pilot program in April, possibly lasting for three months. South Korea’s Crypto Regulations: An Overview The country has been introducing comprehensive measures to oversee the crypto industry.
