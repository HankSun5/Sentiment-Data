Experts Say Ruvi AI (RUVI) Is Your Best Shot At Over 105x This Year,https://timestabloid.com/missed-early-trons-trx-rally-experts-say-ruvi-ai-ruvi/,"Tron’s legendary rally delivered incredible returns for early investors, spurring a wave of regret among those who missed the opportunity.

46915820,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=779043,1751065232,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/46915820.jpeg,"Fading Spot Volumes And Muted Futures Sentiment Threaten To Send Bitcoin Below $99,000 Again",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-go-below-99000/,"Bitcoin returned to its familiar price range over the week after a dip last weekend brought its price to just under $99,000. This was followed by a bounce to the $106,000 price level, which has given bulls a reason to remain hopeful. However, on-chain data shows some deeper cracks are forming beneath the surface. The latest on-chain data from analytics firm Glassnode shows growing signs of fatigue in both spot and futures markets. These are conditions that may again cause Bitcoin price to retest $99,000. Price Support Holds, But Momentum is Clearly Fading Bitcoin has gone through multiple price swings in recent days, but it has found its way back to the narrow $100,000 to $110,000 band that has defined market structure since early May. On-chain data from Glassnode shows that strong accumulation between $93,000 and $100,000, which is visible on the Cumulative Volume Delta (CBD) Heatmap, has so far served as a buffer zone that helped Bitcoin’s prices bounce during the most recent geopolitical volatility. However, market volume indicates that this structural support may soon face additional pressure. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer According to the latest weekly report by Glassnode, investor profitability and engagement surrounding Bitcoin are cooling rapidly. Specifically, a third major wave of profit-taking is causing the 30-day realized profit average to taper, and on-chain activity has decreased significantly. The 7-day moving average of on-chain transfer volume has dropped by about 32%, from a peak of $76 billion in late May to $52 billion over the recent weekend. Current spot volume trading, which is now at just $7.7 billion, is far below the volumes seen during previous rallies. The lack of strong buying enthusiasm on the spot market shows that bullish sentiment has been replaced by caution. As such, the risk of a breakdown below $99,000 grows unless another wave of demand re-enters. Futures Market Also Cooling Off The slowdown in sentiment is not limited to the spot market. Although Bitcoin is attracting interest on derivatives exchanges, there are clear signs that futures sentiment is waning. Open interest dropped by 7% over the weekend, from 360,000 BTC to 334,000 BTC, and funding rates have been declining steadily since Bitcoin hit its Q1 2025 all-time high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Rally To $110,000 ATH As These Macroeconomic Factors Align Futures market participants had been very active through Bitcoin’s climb to $111,800 in May, but their conviction appears to be fading now. A further indication of a growing reluctance to hold long positions is the sharp decline in both the annualized funding rate and the 3-month rolling basis. Without stronger directional conviction, the futures markets may not provide the upside needed to push Bitcoin to new highs. This situation may instead contribute to additional downward pressure. So far, Bitcoin has respected the $93,000 to $100,000 support zone, which was heavily accumulated during the Q1 2025 top formation. However, with low spot volumes, on-chain activity slowing, and fading futures sentiment, this support could become tested again. If market participants with a cost basis in this zone begin to sell, the resulting pressure could drag Bitcoin below $99,000 again next week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $107,100.

While this has caused unease among short-term traders, many long-term investors see this turbulence as a signal — a cue that capital rotation is already beginning. In the background of this market reset, a new contender is gaining traction. MAGACOIN FINANCE , an emerging altcoin, is capturing investor attention as seasoned traders look beyond the familiar blue-chip names and toward tokens with fresh upside potentia l. MAGACOIN FINANCE Rising Momentum Is Appealing To New Holders MAGACOIN FINANCE attracts investors through the structural clarity of its model. It is engineered for scarcity and long-term accumulation — two factors that analysts view as strong indicators of future demand. Additionally, rising mentions in independent research and consistent traffic to its official entry portal suggest that smart money may already be positioning early. While XRP, Ethereum, and Cardano remain relevant, their long-term arcs are better suited for portfolio stability. MAGACOIN FINANCE , by contrast, offers a compelling early-access opportunity for those seeking faster exposure to the next breakout altcoin. XRP, ETH, and ADA Struggle to Sustain Momentum Despite strong fundamentals and years of development, XRP, Ethereum, and Cardano have faced persistent challenges in 2025. From fluctuating regulatory narratives to delays in institutional integration, each project is attempting to reclaim its former upward momentum. Ethereum continues to deal with congestion and competition from faster chains. Cardano remains focused on scaling adoption, while XRP faces ongoing legal and ETF speculation. These factors have contributed to inconsistent performance across the board. This hesitation is leading some investors to reconsider portfolio allocation — not by abandoning large-cap assets, but by diversifying into high-upside early-stage projects. Altcoin Cycles Favor Early-Stage Positioning Historically, altcoin bull runs are fueled by tokens that enter the market at the right narrative moment. With volatility clouding the outlook for legacy tokens, investors are increasingly identifying asymmetric opportunities in fresh projects that haven’t yet saturated. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of those early-phase names with the potential to accelerate ahead of traditional market cycles. Analyst briefings have noted a wave of capital rotation into the project, with previous stages of the rollout selling out instantly and investor sentiment aligning around the possibility of huge returns. Final Thoughts The volatility surrounding top tokens is not a signal to exit the market — it’s a signal to adapt. With XRP, Ethereum, and Cardano in transition, many investors are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE for early momentum and a cleaner upside trajectory. For those seeking new opportunities ahead of the next major market phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a clear rising star with significant growth potential.

SEC Lawsuit,https://timestabloid.com/blackrock-is-paying-close-attention-to-the-ripple-xrp-v-sec-lawsuit/,"The legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has captured the attention of financial institutions worldwide, including BlackRock, the largest asset manager on the planet. In a recent SEC filing concerning its spot Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock referenced the Ripple case as a cautionary example of how regulatory enforcement can significantly disrupt the value of a digital asset. The inclusion of XRP in BlackRock’s formal documentation signals that the stakes of this lawsuit extend far beyond Ripple. BlackRock Cites Ripple Case in SEC Filing BlackRock’s filing warned that if any regulatory body or court were to classify Bitcoin as a security, it could cause an “immediate material adverse impact” on both the price of Bitcoin and spot Bitcoin ETF shares. Remember, BlackRock is paying close attention to the Ripple v. SEC lawsuit. See for yourself. https://t.co/1pFApv80kl pic.twitter.com/j379XIoWvN — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 26, 2025 To illustrate this risk, BlackRock pointed to the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple and its executives, recalling how XRP’s market capitalization fell sharply, from over $100 billion to less than $10 billion, after the complaint was filed in December 2020. The firm’s decision to single out the Ripple case underscores its importance as a regulatory bellwether for the entire digital asset ecosystem. SMQKE Highlights Institutional Interest This growing institutional interest was echoed by popular crypto commentator SMQKE, who posted on X: “Remember, BlackRock is paying close attention to the Ripple v. SEC lawsuit.” In another referenced post, SMQKE added: “WHEN THE RIPPLE V. SEC CASE IS SETTLED, CENTRAL BANKS WILL HAVE THE GREEN LIGHT TO USE XRP THROUGH THE XRP LEDGER.” The statement reflects a widely held view within the XRP community: that Ripple’s legal clarity will unlock large-scale adoption of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) by central banks and financial institutions. Ripple has spent years cultivating partnerships with more than 40 central banks globally, positioning the XRPL as a secure, scalable, and efficient platform for cross-border payments and central bank digital currency (CBDC) deployment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Global Ambitions and the Road Ahead Ripple’s vision for XRP extends beyond private sector remittances. It includes sovereign-grade infrastructure for liquidity management, FX settlement, and CBDC interoperability. But in the U.S., regulatory uncertainty has limited the extent to which institutional players can engage with XRP. A favorable resolution in the SEC lawsuit would not only affirm XRP’s non-security status but also remove a major obstacle to enterprise and government adoption in key financial markets. Judge Analisa Torres recently denied the initial joint motion to settle the case on procedural grounds, not on its merits. A revised filing is expected soon, and legal analysts widely anticipate that a final resolution could arrive by Q3 2025. For BlackRock to reference the case in its Bitcoin ETF filing suggests that institutional finance is watching the outcome closely and preparing to act. XRP Price Outlook Remains Resilient Despite the legal overhang, XRP is currently trading around $1.98, consolidating just below the $2 psychological level. Analysts note consistent accumulation and signs of bullish divergence on the daily chart, with upside potential building as the lawsuit nears its conclusion. If Ripple secures a favorable outcome, XRP could see a rapid breakout, potentially revisiting its all-time high of $3.84 and setting the stage for new record highs. BlackRock’s explicit reference to the Ripple case confirms what many in the crypto space have long suspected: the outcome of this lawsuit is not just about Ripple, it’s about the future of digital assets in regulated finance. With institutional players like BlackRock closely monitoring developments and voices like SMQKE linking the case to central bank adoption, XRP’s path forward may be clearer than ever, once the legal fog lifts.

This time, their focus isn’t on highly volatile cryptocurrencies like Ripple (XRP) or Dogecoin (DOGE), but rather on the stock of Circle (CRCL), the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. Reports from CoinDesk, citing Bloomberg, indicate a staggering investment of almost $450 million into Circle stock by South Korean retail investors in June alone. This significant influx has propelled Circle into the position of the most heavily bought overseas stock this month and among the top four year-to-date, raising questions about a potential resurgence of the ‘ Kimchi premium ‘ phenomenon. What’s Fueling the Circle Stock Surge Among South Korean Retail Investors? The sheer volume of capital flowing into Circle stock from South Korea is remarkable. Before this, the country’s retail investors were often associated with aggressive investments in speculative digital assets, leading to the well-known ‘Kimchi premium’ – a situation where cryptocurrencies traded at higher prices in South Korea compared to global exchanges. The current buying spree in Circle shares suggests a potential shift in investment strategy or perhaps a new iteration of this premium. But why Circle? Stablecoin Appeal: Circle is primarily known as the issuer of USDC, one of the largest and most regulated stablecoins. For investors seeking exposure to the crypto space without the extreme volatility of Bitcoin or altcoins, stablecoin issuers might present a more ‘stable’ investment opportunity. Regulatory Clarity: Compared to many crypto projects, Circle operates within a more defined regulatory framework, particularly in the U.S. This perceived regulatory clarity could be highly attractive to investors wary of the legal uncertainties that have plagued other crypto ventures. Institutional Interest: The increasing institutional adoption of stablecoins and the broader blockchain infrastructure that Circle provides could be signaling long-term growth potential, which retail investors might be keen to front-run. Accessibility: Investing in the stock of a crypto-related company might offer a more traditional and accessible entry point for some investors compared to directly buying cryptocurrencies on exchanges. Understanding the ‘Kimchi Premium’ and Its Historical Impact on the Crypto Market The ‘ Kimchi premium ‘ is a term coined to describe the historical phenomenon where cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, traded at significantly higher prices on South Korean exchanges compared to international exchanges. This premium was often driven by a combination of factors: Capital Controls: Strict capital controls in South Korea made it difficult for foreign investors to arbitrage price differences, thus preventing the premium from quickly normalizing. High Demand: South Korea has a highly tech-savvy and speculative investor base, leading to intense demand for cryptocurrencies within the country. Limited Supply: The supply of crypto on South Korean exchanges could sometimes be constrained, further driving up prices. Historically, this premium has led to both immense profits for those who could exploit it and significant losses for those who bought at the inflated local prices just before a correction. The aggressive investment in Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) by South Korean investors in previous cycles exemplified this speculative fervor, often resulting in dramatic price swings. The question now is whether the current interest in Circle shares could replicate this pattern, potentially creating a new ‘Kimchi premium’ for crypto-adjacent stocks. A Strategic Pivot? Why Retail Investors Are Shifting Focus from XRP and DOGE The shift from highly volatile assets like XRP and DOGE to a more ‘traditional’ investment like Circle stock signals a potential maturation or diversification in the investment strategies of South Korean retail investors . While XRP and DOGE were attractive for their rapid, albeit unpredictable, price movements, they also carried substantial risk. The lessons learned from past market corrections and regulatory crackdowns might be influencing this change in preference. Investing in Circle offers a different value proposition: Table: Investment Profile Comparison (XRP/DOGE vs. Circle Stock) Feature XRP/DOGE (Past Focus) Circle Stock (Current Focus) Asset Type Volatile Cryptocurrencies Equity (Company Stock) Primary Value Driver Speculation, Community Hype, Utility (XRP) Company Fundamentals, Revenue (USDC), Regulatory Compliance Risk Profile Very High Volatility, Regulatory Uncertainty Medium to High (Market Risk, Crypto Sector Risk) Liquidity High (Crypto Exchanges) High (Stock Exchanges) Regulatory Standing Often Ambiguous/Challenged More Defined, Regulated (USDC as stablecoin) Investment Horizon Short-term Speculation Potentially Longer-term Growth This pivot suggests that some South Korean investors might be seeking more sustainable growth opportunities within the broader crypto market , rather than solely chasing parabolic gains from meme coins or altcoins embroiled in legal battles. What Are the Potential Implications and Risks of This New Trend for the Crypto Market? The massive inflow of capital into Circle stock by South Korean investors could have several implications, both for Circle itself and the broader crypto market : Stock Price Volatility: While Circle stock might be perceived as less volatile than direct crypto investments, a concentrated buying spree from retail investors, especially if driven by speculative sentiment, could lead to inflated valuations and subsequent corrections. Market Signal: This trend could signal a growing appetite among retail investors for exposure to the underlying infrastructure of the crypto economy, rather than just the speculative assets. It might encourage other crypto companies to consider traditional IPOs or direct listings. Regulatory Scrutiny: Any significant market movement driven by retail speculation, particularly if it creates a premium, could attract increased attention from financial regulators in South Korea and globally, potentially leading to new regulations or warnings. Diversification of Risk: For the investors themselves, shifting to a stock like Circle might represent an attempt to diversify their crypto-related portfolio beyond just digital assets, spreading risk across different types of investments within the same ecosystem. The primary risk, as highlighted by CoinDesk, is that this buying craze could indeed result in a similar outcome to previous ‘Kimchi premium’ events – a bubble that eventually bursts, leaving latecomers with losses. Investors must exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence, regardless of the asset class. Actionable Insights for Global Investors Observing South Korea’s Moves The South Korean investment landscape often serves as a fascinating bellwether for global retail trends, given its unique market dynamics and high participation rates. For investors outside South Korea, this surge in Circle stock buying offers several actionable insights: Monitor Regional Trends: Pay close attention to regional market dynamics. What’s popular in one country might signal an emerging trend globally or highlight specific local preferences that could impact asset prices. Evaluate Underlying Fundamentals: Instead of chasing hype, focus on the fundamental value of the company or project. Circle’s role in the stablecoin ecosystem and its regulatory approach are key factors to consider. Understand Stablecoin’s Growing Role: The interest in Circle underscores the increasing importance of stablecoins in the broader financial system. Investors might consider how stablecoin infrastructure companies fit into their long-term investment thesis. Beware of Premiums: Whether it’s a ‘Kimchi premium’ on crypto or a stock, any significant divergence in price from global averages should be approached with extreme caution. Such premiums are often unsustainable. Diversify Wisely: The move from highly speculative assets to a more established company stock highlights the importance of diversification, even within the crypto-related investment space. Balancing high-risk, high-reward assets with more stable, fundamental-driven investments can be a sound strategy. Conclusion: A New Chapter for South Korean Crypto Investment? The substantial investment by South Korean investors into Circle stock marks a potentially significant shift in their engagement with the digital asset space. While the echoes of the ‘ Kimchi premium ‘ are certainly present, suggesting a return of intense speculative interest, the target asset this time – a stock representing a key piece of the crypto infrastructure – indicates a more nuanced approach. It highlights a growing maturity among some retail investors who might be seeking more regulated and fundamentally sound ways to participate in the burgeoning crypto market . However, the inherent risks of concentrated retail speculation remain. As the situation evolves, the world will be watching to see if this latest investment frenzy brings sustainable growth or if history, in some form, is destined to repeat itself.

46916781,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=173066,1751066458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/46916781.jpeg,Bitcoin: 10x Research Unveils Critical Coinbase Overvaluation Warning,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-coinbase-valuation-warning/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: 10x Research Unveils Critical Coinbase Overvaluation Warning In the fast-paced and often unpredictable world of cryptocurrency, identifying profitable strategies and avoiding pitfalls is paramount. As market sentiment shifts rapidly, investors constantly seek reliable insights to navigate the digital asset landscape. Recently, a prominent voice in crypto research, 10x Research, has made a compelling and somewhat controversial call that has caught the attention of the entire market: a bold pair trade recommending a long position on Bitcoin coupled with a short position on Coinbase (COIN). This isn’t just a casual tip; it’s a strategic warning rooted in a deep digital asset analysis of current market dynamics and valuations. But why this specific recommendation, and what does it signal for your crypto portfolio? Understanding the Bold Crypto Trading Strategy from 10x Research At its core, 10x Research’s recommendation is a classic “pair trade” – a market-neutral crypto trading strategy designed to profit from the relative performance of two correlated assets, rather than their absolute price movements. In this scenario, you bet on Bitcoin outperforming Coinbase . The logic is simple yet profound: if Coinbase shares are indeed overvalued relative to the underlying crypto market, and Bitcoin continues its fundamental ascent, this strategy could yield significant returns regardless of broader market swings. This approach seeks to mitigate overall market risk by simultaneously holding a long and a short position. It’s a sophisticated maneuver, typically employed by institutional investors, but its underlying rationale provides crucial insights for every crypto enthusiast. Long Bitcoin: The belief that Bitcoin, as the flagship cryptocurrency, will continue to grow in value due to adoption, halving events, and its role as a digital gold. Short Coinbase: The expectation that Coinbase’s stock price, despite recent rallies, is inflated and due for a correction, perhaps because its growth isn’t justified by its current business fundamentals. The Relative Play: The trade isn’t about Bitcoin going up or Coinbase going down in isolation, but rather Bitcoin performing better than Coinbase. The Alarming Coinbase Market Valuation: Is a Correction Looming? The crux of 10x Research’s bearish stance on Coinbase centers on its staggering market valuation . The report highlights that COIN shares have experienced an impressive 84% rally in just two months. While such a surge might typically be celebrated, 10x Research warns that this rapid ascent appears increasingly disconnected from Coinbase ’s fundamental business metrics. The core issue? Trading volumes, the lifeblood of any exchange, have not kept pace with the stock’s parabolic rise. This divergence suggests that the recent gains in COIN are less about robust operational performance and more about speculative fervor or broader market exuberance. Consider these points regarding Coinbase’s current standing: Metric Coinbase (COIN) Status Implication Recent Stock Rally +84% in two months Significant short-term gains, potentially overheated. Trading Volume Not keeping pace with stock price Lack of fundamental justification for stock growth. Correlation to Bitcoin Price Disconnected from recent Bitcoin movements Suggests speculative rather than organic growth. Market Activity Overall market activity doesn’t justify rally Increased risk of a significant price correction. When a company’s stock price surges without a corresponding increase in its core business activities, it often signals that the stock is trading above its intrinsic value. This can make it vulnerable to sharp pullbacks, especially if broader market sentiment shifts or if investors begin to scrutinize fundamentals more closely. For Coinbase , a correction could mean a significant re-evaluation of its shares, bringing its price more in line with its actual trading volumes and market share. Bitcoin’s Enduring Strength and In-depth Digital Asset Analysis While 10x Research points to potential weakness in Coinbase , their confidence in Bitcoin remains steadfast. This is crucial for the “long” side of the pair trade. Bitcoin , the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market valuation , continues to solidify its position as a global digital store of value, often dubbed “digital gold.” Its decentralized nature, finite supply, and growing institutional adoption underpin its long-term appeal. Unlike a centralized exchange like Coinbase , Bitcoin’s value is derived from its network effects, security, and increasing utility as a global, permissionless financial rail. A comprehensive digital asset analysis reveals several factors contributing to Bitcoin’s robust outlook: Halving Events: The periodic reduction in new Bitcoin supply, historically a bullish catalyst. Institutional Inflows: Growing interest and investment from large financial institutions, including spot Bitcoin ETFs, legitimizing the asset class. Macroeconomic Hedging: Bitcoin’s perceived role as a hedge against inflation and traditional financial system instability. Network Security: The unparalleled computational power securing the Bitcoin blockchain, making it highly resilient. This stark contrast between Bitcoin’s fundamental strength and Coinbase’s potentially inflated stock price forms the bedrock of 10x Research’s recommendation. They see Bitcoin as the resilient asset, poised for continued growth, while Coinbase , despite its critical role in the ecosystem, faces challenges in justifying its current premium. Actionable Insights: Navigating Your Investment Strategy in a Shifting Landscape For investors, 10x Research’s insights offer a valuable perspective on current crypto market dynamics and potential shifts in market valuation . While a pair trade of long Bitcoin and short Coinbase might be complex for individual retail investors due to the mechanics of shorting, the underlying analysis provides critical takeaways for any investment strategy . Here are some actionable insights: Scrutinize Fundamentals: Don’t just chase rallies. Always look beyond price action to underlying business fundamentals, especially for crypto-related stocks like Coinbase . Are trading volumes, user growth, and revenue streams truly supporting the stock’s performance? Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin may be a strong long-term play, relying solely on one asset, or one type of asset (like exchange stocks), can be risky. A diversified portfolio can help mitigate the impact of unexpected corrections. Understand Relative Value: The 10x Research call emphasizes relative value. Even if the entire crypto market sees a downturn, an asset that is fundamentally stronger (like Bitcoin ) might still outperform one that is overvalued (like Coinbase shares). Stay Informed on Digital Asset Analysis: Regularly consult reputable research firms and market analysts. Their insights, even if you don’t directly replicate their trades, can inform your own decisions and help you identify potential risks and opportunities. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: Shorting stocks carries unlimited risk and is not suitable for all investors. If you’re not comfortable with complex strategies, focus on the “long” side of the analysis – strengthening your conviction in fundamentally sound assets like Bitcoin . The challenge lies in the inherent volatility of the crypto market. While expert analysis provides a roadmap, unexpected news, regulatory changes, or broader economic shifts can quickly alter market trajectories. Therefore, continuous monitoring and adaptability are key components of a successful crypto trading strategy . Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Crypto Investors 10x Research’s recommendation to go long Bitcoin and short Coinbase serves as a potent reminder of the importance of fundamental analysis in the often-euphoric crypto market. It underscores a critical divergence: the enduring strength and fundamental value proposition of decentralized digital assets like Bitcoin versus the potential overextension of centralized entities like exchanges whose stock prices may outpace their operational realities. As the crypto landscape matures, discerning between genuine growth and speculative bubbles becomes ever more crucial. Whether you choose to implement a sophisticated pair trade or simply re-evaluate your long-term holdings, 10x Research’s bold call provides an invaluable lens through which to view the current state of market valuation and refine your investment strategy for the road ahead. Staying ahead requires not just riding the waves, but understanding the underlying currents through diligent digital asset analysis .

In a post shared on X , Runefelt called on his 1.5 million followers to invest in altcoins without delay, asserting that these digital assets are on the verge of experiencing a 50-fold increase in value. His message implied that a significant rally in the altcoin market could be imminent. The forecast received mixed reactions from market observers. While some investors welcomed the possibility of substantial returns, others questioned the practicality of such rapid and dramatic price growth across the board. XRP Valuation in a 50x Growth Scenario In response to Runefelt’s claims, cryptocurrency analyst and influencer Jake Gagain offered a breakdown of how a 50x surge would affect the value of major altcoins. He estimated that, under this scenario, XRP could reach a price of $106.5. This projection was based on an assumed current trading value of $2.13 for XRP at the time of his calculation. If the top altcoins 50x we would see: $ETH : $122,350 $XRP : $106.50 $BNB : $32,266 $SOL : $7,100 $ADA : $27.50 What is @TheMoonCarl talking about?! https://t.co/6eHFgUDr8d — JAKE (@JakeGagain) June 26, 2025 A price point of $106.5 would represent a new all-time high for XRP, significantly exceeding its previous peak of $3.84. If the circulating supply of XRP remains constant at approximately 59 billion tokens, this valuation would place the asset’s market capitalization at around $6.28 trillion. Such a figure would far exceed the total market value of most companies and financial institutions globally. Comparison With Other Altcoins Gagain also provided projections for other major cryptocurrencies, assuming the same 50x increase. According to his estimates, Ethereum would reach $122,350 per token, Binance Coin (BNB) would climb to $32,266, Solana would be valued at $7,100, and Cardano could rise to $27.50. After sharing these figures, Gagain expressed doubt about the likelihood of such dramatic growth. He questioned the assumptions behind Runefelt’s predictions, suggesting that the numbers may not reflect realistic market conditions. Community Perspectives on XRP Reaching $100 Despite skepticism from some analysts, several members of the XRP community remain optimistic about the token’s long-term potential to reach or surpass the $100 mark. Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has voiced strong confidence in XRP’s future, stating that he would not consider selling his holdings for anything less than $100, even under extreme circumstances. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Crypto content creator, Modern Investor, has shared similar sentiments. He argued that XRP’s current price below $100 indicates the market is still in its early stages and that there remains time for new investors to accumulate the asset before any significant price breakout. Other speculative outlooks have been shared by anonymous market commentators. One such figure, known as Moonshilla, suggested that XRP could potentially reach $100 if Bitcoin were to rise to around $350,000. In this scenario, XRP would remain second to Bitcoin in market capitalization but still achieve a three-digit valuation. Long-Term Forecasts and Growth Drivers Forecasting platforms such as Changelly and Telegaon have also weighed in on the possibility of XRP reaching $100. Both platforms predict this milestone could occur between 2035 and 2039, aligning with broader expectations about long-term crypto adoption. Several factors are considered potential catalysts for XRP’s growth, including its established use case in cross-border payment systems, the prospect of regulatory clarity in the U.S., the future introduction of XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , and broader integration into global financial networks. While reaching a $100 price point remains a highly speculative outcome, ongoing discussions reflect sustained interest in XRP’s utility and long-term value proposition within the digital asset space.

Recently, a notable transaction sent ripples across the market: a wallet believed to be associated with Grayscale, a prominent digital asset manager, deposited a substantial 16,350 ETH, valued at approximately $39.8 million, to Coinbase Prime. This Grayscale ETH deposit immediately sparked intense speculation among traders and analysts alike. What does such a large-scale Coinbase Prime transfer signify for the broader market, and what could be the motivations behind this move bSet featured imagey one of the biggest players in digital asset management ? What Exactly Happened with the Grayscale ETH Deposit? According to data from Arkham Intelligence, the transaction occurred just minutes ago, involving a wallet identified as linked to Grayscale. The sheer volume of 16,350 ETH, equivalent to nearly $40 million, makes this an event worth scrutinizing. This isn’t just a casual transfer; it’s a strategic move by a major entity in the crypto space. Grayscale, known for its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and other investment products, manages billions in digital assets. Therefore, any significant movement of funds from their associated wallets is closely watched for clues about future market direction or internal portfolio adjustments. The destination of these funds, Coinbase Prime, is equally important. Unlike a regular retail exchange, Coinbase Prime caters specifically to institutional clients, offering advanced trading tools, high liquidity, and robust security features tailored for large-volume transactions. This choice of platform suggests a deliberate, professional execution, rather than a spontaneous or speculative individual trade. Understanding the Significance of a Coinbase Prime Transfer When an institution like Grayscale chooses Coinbase Prime for a large transfer, it speaks volumes about the nature of the transaction. Coinbase Prime is not merely an exchange; it’s an integrated platform designed for institutional investors, offering: Enhanced Security: Cold storage solutions, multi-signature wallets, and robust compliance frameworks are standard, providing a secure environment for significant capital. Deep Liquidity: Access to a wide network of liquidity providers ensures that large orders can be executed with minimal slippage, crucial for moving tens of millions of dollars worth of ETH. OTC Desks: Often, such large transfers precede or are part of over-the-counter (OTC) deals, where assets are traded directly between parties without affecting public exchange order books. This allows for discreet and efficient execution. Integrated Services: Beyond trading, Coinbase Prime offers prime brokerage services, custody, and reporting, making it a comprehensive solution for institutional digital asset management . The use of such a specialized platform suggests that Grayscale is either preparing for a large-scale sale, rebalancing its portfolio, or facilitating a transaction that requires institutional-grade infrastructure. It’s a clear indicator of strategic intent. Is This an Ethereum Whale Signaling a Market Shift? In the crypto lexicon, an Ethereum whale refers to an individual or entity holding a significant amount of ETH, enough to potentially influence market prices with their transactions. Grayscale, by virtue of the vast sums of cryptocurrency it manages on behalf of its clients, certainly qualifies as a whale. The movement of 16,350 ETH is not small; it represents a considerable chunk of the circulating supply if liquidated quickly. So, what could an Ethereum whale like Grayscale be signaling with this move? Several possibilities emerge: Liquidation or Sale: The most immediate concern for the market is whether this deposit is a precursor to selling. If Grayscale intends to sell these ETH holdings, it could exert downward pressure on Ethereum’s price, especially if executed on open markets. Portfolio Rebalancing: Grayscale might be rebalancing its various trusts or investment products. As market conditions change, asset managers frequently adjust their holdings to maintain desired allocations or to optimize performance. Staking or Lending: The ETH could be moved to Coinbase Prime for participation in staking programs or institutional lending pools, generating yield for their clients. OTC Deal Execution: As mentioned, it could be part of a pre-arranged OTC trade, where the ETH is being transferred to a buyer directly, bypassing public exchanges. This would have minimal direct impact on market prices. The market’s reaction will largely depend on which of these scenarios plays out. Monitoring subsequent transactions from this Coinbase Prime address will be crucial for understanding Grayscale’s ultimate intent. The Broader Crypto Market Impact: What Does it Mean for ETH? Any large institutional move, especially from a player like Grayscale, can have a noticeable crypto market impact . Historically, significant inflows or outflows from Grayscale’s trusts, particularly GBTC, have correlated with Bitcoin’s price movements. While this specific transfer involves Ethereum, the principle remains similar. If this Coinbase Prime transfer leads to selling, we might see a temporary dip in ETH’s price as supply increases on exchanges. However, if it’s for rebalancing, staking, or an OTC deal, the direct market impact might be minimal or even positive in the long run, signaling continued institutional engagement with Ethereum. Investors should consider this event within the larger context of Ethereum’s ecosystem, including the upcoming Dencun upgrade, the growth of DeFi, and the overall sentiment around Layer 2 solutions. A single whale movement, while significant, rarely dictates the long-term trajectory of a major asset like Ethereum on its own. However, it does add to the volatility and uncertainty in the short term, especially for those sensitive to large supply shifts. Navigating Digital Asset Management: Insights for Investors For both institutional and retail investors, understanding the nuances of digital asset management is paramount. This Grayscale ETH deposit highlights several key takeaways: Transparency is Key: Data platforms like Arkham Intelligence provide invaluable insights into on-chain movements, allowing market participants to track significant transactions and anticipate potential shifts. Institutional Influence: Large players have the capital and infrastructure to move markets. Monitoring their actions can offer clues, but shouldn’t be the sole basis for investment decisions. Diversification and Risk Management: Relying too heavily on a single asset or reacting impulsively to whale movements can be risky. A well-diversified portfolio and a clear risk management strategy are essential. Beyond Price: While price action is important, understanding the underlying reasons for large transfers (e.g., staking, OTC deals) provides a more complete picture than simply reacting to a deposit on an exchange. This event underscores the increasing maturity of the crypto market, where institutional players are becoming more active and sophisticated in their operations. It’s a sign that digital assets are firmly entrenched in mainstream finance, requiring careful consideration of their unique dynamics. The Grayscale ETH deposit to Coinbase Prime is more than just a large transaction; it’s a window into the evolving strategies of institutional investors in the crypto space. Whether it signals a pending sale, a strategic rebalancing, or a move towards enhanced yield, its implications for the crypto market impact are being closely watched. This particular Coinbase Prime transfer serves as a reminder of the power of Ethereum whale movements and the growing sophistication in digital asset management . As the crypto landscape continues to mature, understanding these high-volume transactions will remain crucial for anyone navigating the exciting, yet volatile, world of digital currencies.

As technical patterns flatten and ETF speculation lingers, a new narrative is forming: capital is moving into smaller, faster-moving altcoins—and one name is starting to lead that charge: MAGACOIN FINANCE . MAGACOIN FINANCE Accelerates as Retail Demand Drives Early Growth MAGACOIN FINANCE is in full acceleration. Its presale has raised over $10 million, with each funding round closing faster than the last. There are no ETF dependencies, no regulatory hurdles, and no legacy baggage—just a clean, early-stage asset moving on raw momentum and a growing base of believers. Traders are drawn to its simplicity: a fixed supply, no VC allocations, and an entry price still under a cent. Unlike XRP or ETH, which need market-wide sentiment shifts to move meaningfully, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already surging from retail demand alone. It’s the kind of setup crypto veterans recognize: low float, rising community interest, and a presale that’s quickly selling out. Ethereum Struggles Near Resistance Amid Cautious Outlook Ethereum, still trading around $2,455, is struggling to break above its resistance zones. Despite ETF inflows and recent upgrades like Pectra, price action has been sluggish. Analysts are watching the $2,500–$2,650 range, but even optimistic forecasts suggest only moderate gains over the next few months. A death cross on the two-week chart has only added to the caution, raising questions about short-term upside. XRP Faces Uncertainty Despite Regulatory Clarity and Bullish Forecasts XRP is in a similar position. After settling its long-standing legal battle with the SEC in May, Ripple finally has regulatory clarity—but that hasn’t translated into a breakout. The token is hovering between $2.09 and $2.23, with resistance around $3.00. Futures open interest and whale accumulation are picking up, but the overall trend still feels muted. Even with bullish forecasts aiming for $5 or more, the timeline remains uncertain. Closing Words Many who missed the early runs of SHIBA or DOGE are now eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as their next chance—before listings, before headlines, before the rest of the market catches on. In a cycle defined by cautious optimism and stalled majors, this is the type of trade that rewrites portfolios. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers what Ethereum and XRP currently can’t—fast momentum and early-stage upside. For traders chasing high-reward plays before the next wave, this presale may be the breakout opportunity the market hasn’t fully priced in yet.

For years, its notorious volatility kept many traditional finance players on the sidelines. Well, buckle up, because the narrative is rapidly changing, and a recent report has just dropped a bombshell that could redefine Bitcoin’s place in the investment world. We’re talking about a monumental shift in IBIT volatility , signaling a new era for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What’s Behind This Stunning Shift in IBIT Volatility? The news comes from Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who recently shared a remarkable observation on X. He reported that the 60-day volatility of BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, which tracks Bitcoin, has plummeted. Just a year ago, IBIT’s volatility was an astounding 5.7 times higher than that of the S&P 500. Today? It has declined to just above parity, meaning IBIT volatility is now nearly matching that of the U.S. stock market. This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it’s a profound transformation. For context, imagine a high-performance sports car that was once notoriously difficult to handle suddenly becoming as smooth and predictable as a family sedan on the highway. This dramatic reduction in volatility for a Bitcoin-backed product like IBIT sends a powerful message to the financial world. It suggests that Bitcoin, through the lens of a regulated ETF, is shedding its ‘wild west’ image and embracing a new level of maturity. Why Does Bitcoin Volatility Matter for Your Portfolio? For a long time, the significant Bitcoin volatility was both its allure and its deterrent. Traders loved the rapid price movements, offering opportunities for quick gains. However, for long-term investors, especially institutional ones, such unpredictability was a major hurdle. Pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds prioritize stability and predictable returns. High volatility means higher risk, which often translates to strict allocation limits or outright exclusion from traditional portfolios. The decline in Bitcoin volatility is a game-changer because it addresses this core concern. When an asset becomes less volatile, it becomes more attractive to a broader spectrum of investors who are risk-averse or operate under strict investment mandates. This shift is not just about price swings; it’s about the asset’s perceived risk profile and its potential to be a stable component of a diversified portfolio rather than just a speculative bet. Is Bitcoin Now Truly a Peer to the S&P 500? The comparison to the S&P 500 is particularly significant. The S&P 500 is widely regarded as the benchmark for the U.S. stock market and a proxy for the overall health of the economy. It represents a basket of 500 large U.S. companies, known for their relative stability and consistent performance over the long term. For Bitcoin’s volatility to approach that of the S&P 500 means it’s no longer just an outlier; it’s starting to behave like a mature financial asset. What does this mean in practical terms? It implies that the risk-reward profile of Bitcoin, particularly when accessed via a regulated vehicle like IBIT, is becoming comparable to established equities. This convergence could fundamentally alter how financial advisors and portfolio managers view cryptocurrency. It moves Bitcoin from the ‘alternative, high-risk’ bucket into a potentially more integrated role within traditional asset allocation models. This evolution is crucial for broader acceptance and integration into mainstream finance. Unlocking New Horizons: The Promise of Institutional Adoption The sharp drop in IBIT volatility is a monumental step towards accelerated institutional adoption . Institutions, by their nature, are conservative. They require regulatory clarity, robust infrastructure, and, critically, manageable risk profiles. While Bitcoin ETFs have provided the regulatory clarity and infrastructure, the persistent volatility remained a sticking point. Now, with volatility mirroring the S&P 500, a major barrier has been lowered. Consider the benefits for institutional investors: Diversification: Bitcoin still offers a low correlation with traditional assets, meaning it can provide true diversification benefits to a portfolio, especially if its volatility is contained. Accessibility: ETFs like IBIT provide a familiar, regulated wrapper, making it easy for institutions to gain exposure without directly managing digital assets. Risk Management: Reduced volatility makes risk assessment and management much simpler, aligning Bitcoin more closely with existing institutional frameworks. This development could unleash a new wave of capital into the crypto space. We’re talking about pension funds, university endowments, corporate treasuries, and wealth management firms, all of whom have been watching from the sidelines, waiting for the right conditions. The reduction in volatility, combined with the ease of access through ETFs, makes a compelling case for including Bitcoin in their portfolios, marking a pivotal moment for institutional adoption . What Does This Stability Mean for the Broader Crypto Market? The implications of Bitcoin’s newfound stability extend far beyond just IBIT or Bitcoin itself. This increased crypto market stability , spearheaded by Bitcoin’s maturation, could have a ripple effect across the entire digital asset ecosystem. As the dominant cryptocurrency, Bitcoin often sets the tone for the rest of the market. A more stable Bitcoin could lead to: Reduced Altcoin Volatility: While altcoins will likely remain more volatile than Bitcoin, a stable BTC could provide a more solid foundation, potentially leading to less extreme swings in the broader market. Increased Investor Confidence: A less volatile market attracts more cautious investors, fostering an environment of sustained growth rather than boom-and-bust cycles. Enhanced Regulatory Comfort: Regulators often view high volatility as a sign of an immature or risky market. Bitcoin’s stability could encourage more favorable regulatory frameworks globally. Innovation and Utility Focus: With less focus on price speculation, the industry can pivot more towards developing real-world applications, utility, and infrastructure, attracting talent and investment focused on long-term value. This doesn’t mean the crypto market will become boring. Innovation will continue at a rapid pace. However, the underlying asset that anchors the market – Bitcoin – is showing signs of becoming a more reliable and predictable investment vehicle, which is essential for achieving true crypto market stability and mainstream acceptance. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Remarkable Journey Towards Maturity The journey of Bitcoin from a niche digital experiment to a globally recognized asset has been nothing short of extraordinary. The latest data on IBIT’s volatility, indicating its near parity with the S&P 500, marks a significant milestone in this evolution. It signals a new chapter where Bitcoin is increasingly seen not just as a speculative gamble, but as a legitimate, maturing financial asset capable of fitting into traditional investment portfolios. This profound shift in Bitcoin volatility perception is a testament to the market’s maturation, the impact of institutional-grade products like BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, and the growing understanding of digital assets. For investors, both retail and institutional, this offers a compelling reason to re-evaluate Bitcoin’s role in their financial strategies. The future of finance is undoubtedly embracing digital assets, and Bitcoin’s journey towards stability is paving the way for a more integrated and accessible crypto future.

The digital asset platform, backed by Intercontinental Exchange, outlined in its Form S-3 filing that it could issue common and preferred stock, debt instruments, warrants, or bundled securities depending on market conditions. Bakkt’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy While Bakkt has yet to acquire Bitcoin, the filing aligns with a recent update to its investment policy, allowing the firm to allocate capital toward BTC and other digital assets under its broader treasury strategy. The company stated the timing and scale of any potential crypto purchases would be influenced by several factors, such as capital market receptivity, operational performance, and strategic factors. The filing also acknowledges Bakkt’s history of operating losses and limited track record, and notes that it has identified factors that cast doubt on its ability to continue as a going concern, making the flexibility to tap into capital markets critical for the firm’s operational plans. The $1 billion shelf registration would allow Bakkt to access funds swiftly if market conditions turn favorable, and provide optionality for the company amid its ongoing efforts to stabilize its financial footing while seeking opportunities in digital assets. Bakkt On Crypto IPO Wave The latest effort to secure capital and explore Bitcoin purchases comes as momentum builds in the crypto sector, which is evidenced by new IPO activity from firms like Circle and eToro, along with Gemini’s recent filing . The NYSE-listed firm said that these milestones are “fostering a new kind of public participation in technology that’s reshaping the future of finance.” It went on to add, “At Bakkt, we know what it means to run a public company in this space.

Yet, the broader financial landscape, particularly the performance of the US Stock Market , often provides crucial context and can even hint at future trends for digital assets.

What’s fueling this remarkable Nasdaq Record High ? AI Revolution: The explosive growth in artificial intelligence continues to drive demand for chips, software, and cloud services, directly benefiting tech giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet. Corporate Earnings: Many of the Nasdaq’s largest constituents have reported robust earnings, exceeding analyst expectations and demonstrating strong fundamentals even in a challenging economic environment. Investor Confidence: A renewed appetite for growth stocks, fueled by expectations of potential interest rate cuts and a generally optimistic outlook on technological advancements, has channeled significant capital into the sector. Magnificent Seven’s Continued Influence: The so-called ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech titans (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla) continue to exert immense influence, with their collective performance often dictating the Nasdaq’s trajectory. Their sheer market capitalization and ongoing innovation act as powerful engines for the index. This surge highlights the market’s belief in the long-term potential of technological innovation to drive economic progress and create new value, a sentiment that often spills over into the crypto space, particularly for projects focused on Web3, AI, and decentralized technologies. What Drives the S&P 500 Performance to Uncharted Territory? Not to be outdone, the broader S&P 500 index also ascended to a new peak, rising 0.19% to 6,152.66. As a benchmark for the overall health of the U.S. economy, the S&P 500’s achievement signifies a widespread strength across various sectors, not just technology. The robust S&P 500 Performance is a testament to several interconnected factors: Broad-Based Corporate Earnings: Beyond tech, sectors like financials, industrials, healthcare, and consumer discretionary have shown resilience and growth, contributing to a more diversified market rally. Companies are managing costs effectively and seeing strong consumer demand. Resilient Economy: Despite concerns about inflation and interest rates, the U.S. economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with strong employment figures and steady GDP growth. This underlying economic stability provides a solid foundation for corporate profitability. Optimism on Interest Rates: While the Federal Reserve has maintained a hawkish stance, market participants are increasingly optimistic about the prospect of future rate cuts, which would reduce borrowing costs for businesses and potentially boost consumer spending. Share Buybacks and Dividends: Many S&P 500 companies are returning capital to shareholders through aggressive share buyback programs and consistent dividend payouts, which can enhance stock prices and attract investors. The S&P 500’s climb reflects a collective belief in the fundamental strength and adaptability of American corporations. This broad market optimism often sets a positive backdrop for all asset classes, including digital ones. The US Stock Market’s Ascent: A Beacon of Economic Optimism? The simultaneous record highs in both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 paint a picture of profound optimism within the broader US Stock Market . This isn’t just a fleeting moment; it’s a culmination of various economic forces and investor confidence. But what does this mean for the everyday person, and indeed, for those observing the volatile crypto markets? The market’s ascent can be seen as a strong indicator of several underlying economic strengths: Factor Impact on Market Relevance to Broader Economy Strong Corporate Profits Higher valuations, investor confidence Healthy business environment, job creation Consumer Spending Drives revenue for many companies Indicates consumer confidence and economic activity Innovation & Technology New growth avenues, productivity gains Transforms industries, creates future wealth Stable Employment Ensures consistent consumer demand Low unemployment, wage growth While some might point to potential overvaluation or the concentration of gains in a few large companies, the breadth of the S&P 500’s participation suggests a more widespread economic health. This robust traditional market performance can sometimes act as a leading indicator, suggesting a ‘risk-on’ environment where investors are more willing to take on risk across various asset classes. Navigating Market All-Time Highs: Opportunities and Considerations for Investors When major indices hit Market All-Time Highs , it naturally sparks a mix of excitement and apprehension. For long-term investors, these highs can validate their strategies and signify healthy growth. However, it also raises questions about sustainability and potential corrections. It’s a critical juncture where understanding the nuances becomes paramount. Opportunities: Wealth Creation: For those already invested, these highs represent significant portfolio growth and increased net worth. Positive Economic Signal: Sustained market highs often correlate with a robust economy, indicating strong corporate performance and consumer confidence. Momentum Trading: Some traders may find opportunities in continuing upward trends, though this comes with higher risk. Considerations & Challenges: Valuation Concerns: High prices can mean stretched valuations, potentially limiting future upside or increasing vulnerability to negative news. Increased Volatility: Markets at highs can be more susceptible to sharp pullbacks or corrections as investors might be quicker to take profits. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): The temptation to jump into a rising market can lead to irrational decisions, especially for new investors. Interest Rate Outlook: Future interest rate decisions by central banks could impact corporate borrowing costs and overall market liquidity. For investors, the key is to maintain a balanced perspective, focusing on long-term goals rather than short-term fluctuations. This principle holds true whether you’re navigating traditional stocks or the often more volatile crypto landscape. How Shifting Investor Sentiment in Traditional Markets Impacts Crypto The relationship between traditional financial markets and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies is complex and evolving. While often seen as separate, the prevailing Investor Sentiment in the stock market can have a profound, albeit sometimes indirect, impact on digital assets. This connection is primarily observed through ‘risk-on, risk-off’ dynamics and capital flows. The ‘Risk-On, Risk-Off’ Dynamic: When traditional markets like the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are soaring, it often signifies a ‘risk-on’ environment. In such periods, investors generally have a higher appetite for risk, which can lead them to allocate more capital to higher-beta assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, during ‘risk-off’ periods (when traditional markets are declining or volatile), investors tend to seek safer havens, potentially drawing capital away from crypto. Correlation Trends: Historically, Bitcoin, often seen as a proxy for the broader crypto market, has shown periods of correlation with tech stocks (Nasdaq). This is partly because both are considered growth assets, benefiting from abundant liquidity and investor optimism. When tech performs well, crypto often follows, and vice versa. However, there’s also a growing narrative of crypto’s unique value proposition (e.g., decentralization, inflation hedge) allowing it to move independently at times. Institutional Capital Flows: The increasing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially with the advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs, means that more traditional investors now have direct exposure to crypto. As these large institutions manage their broader portfolios, their sentiment towards the overall market can influence their crypto allocations. A buoyant stock market might make them more comfortable diversifying into digital assets. Macroeconomic Factors: Factors like inflation, interest rates, and global economic growth affect both traditional and crypto markets. For instance, if inflation concerns ease, it might lead to a more accommodative monetary policy, benefiting both stocks and crypto by increasing liquidity. Understanding these interconnections is crucial for crypto investors, as it provides a broader context for market movements beyond just crypto-specific news. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Crypto Investor Given the current landscape where traditional markets are reaching unprecedented highs, what should a discerning crypto investor consider? It’s not about abandoning one for the other, but about understanding the symphony of global finance. Stay Informed, Broadly: Don’t just follow crypto news. Keep an eye on macroeconomic indicators, central bank policies, and the performance of major stock indices. These broader trends can often signal shifts in investor appetite for risk, which directly impacts crypto. Diversify Wisely: While crypto offers immense potential, a well-rounded portfolio might include exposure to both traditional assets and digital ones. Consider how your crypto holdings fit into your overall financial strategy. Understand Correlation vs. Causation: Just because crypto moves with stocks doesn’t mean stocks are directly causing crypto’s moves, or vice versa. Both might be reacting to underlying macro factors. Focus on fundamentals for your chosen crypto assets. Manage Risk: All-time highs in any market can induce FOMO. Avoid making impulsive decisions. Stick to your investment thesis, use dollar-cost averaging, and set clear risk management parameters. Don’t overextend yourself based on exuberance in traditional markets. Long-Term Vision: Both traditional markets and crypto experience cycles. While current highs are exciting, maintaining a long-term perspective can help you weather inevitable corrections and capitalize on sustained growth. Focus on projects with strong utility, development, and community. By integrating insights from the traditional financial world with a deep understanding of the crypto space, you can make more informed decisions and navigate the evolving market landscape with greater confidence. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Financial Evolution The recent ascent of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to Market All-Time Highs is a powerful testament to the resilience and growth potential of the US Stock Market . These milestones reflect robust corporate earnings, strong economic indicators, and a prevailing sense of optimism among investors. While the crypto market often dances to its own beat, it is undeniably part of this larger financial ecosystem. The prevailing Investor Sentiment , whether driven by tech triumphs on the Nasdaq or broad economic strength reflected in the S&P 500 Performance, can create ripples that reach every corner of the investment world, including digital assets. For crypto enthusiasts, these traditional market highs offer valuable context. They signal a ‘risk-on’ environment that can foster capital inflows into more speculative assets, yet they also underscore the importance of diversification and prudent risk management. As we move forward, the interplay between these two seemingly distinct worlds will only grow more intricate, demanding a holistic understanding from all investors. By staying informed, adapting strategies, and maintaining a long-term perspective, you can confidently navigate the exciting, interconnected future of finance.

In a recent X post, Garlinghouse announced, “Ripple is dropping our cross appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they’ve previously said. We’re closing this chapter once and for all, and focusing on what’s most important – building the Internet of Value. Lock in.” His statement marks a decisive turning point in the nearly five-year legal standoff between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a case that has shaped the landscape of digital asset regulation in the United States. End of a Landmark Case The SEC first filed suit against Ripple in December 2020, alleging that its XRP token was sold as an unregistered security. The case saw multiple legal milestones, the most significant being Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling in July 2023. Ripple is dropping our cross appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they’ve previously said. We’re closing this chapter once and for all, and focusing on what’s most important – building the Internet of Value. Lock in. https://t.co/ZsRgDfcpLh — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) June 27, 2025 She found that while Ripple’s institutional XRP sales violated securities laws, programmatic sales on public exchanges did not, providing a partial win for Ripple and a critical precedent for the crypto industry. Despite the ruling, both parties filed appeals: Ripple challenged the $125 million civil penalty and permanent injunction against institutional sales, while the SEC initially sought to revisit the programmatic sales ruling. That changed earlier this year. In March 2025, the SEC informed the court that it would not pursue its appeal. Meanwhile, Ripple continued to push back on the fine and injunction, eventually proposing a $50 million settlement and asking the court to lift the restrictions. But on June 26, 2025, Judge Torres denied the motion, asserting that final judgments could not be vacated without compelling justification. Just one day later, Garlinghouse publicly confirmed Ripple would drop its cross appeal. The SEC is expected to follow through by withdrawing its appeal, bringing an end to the lengthy litigation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What the Outcome Means By stepping away from further appeals, both sides are accepting the original judgment. Ripple will pay the full $125 million fine and remain subject to the injunction restricting institutional XRP sales within the U.S. However, the 2023 ruling that XRP is not a security when traded on public platforms stands unchallenged , solidifying XRP’s legal clarity for retail markets. This outcome is not only a legal resolution but also a strategic one. It removes the cloud of uncertainty that has hovered over Ripple and XRP for years, allowing the company to focus on growth, product expansion, and market adoption without the distraction of courtroom battles. Ripple’s Next Chapter Garlinghouse made it clear that Ripple’s attention is now turning to its core mission: building the Internet of Value. This vision revolves around creating a blockchain-based payment infrastructure that enables real-time, low-cost, cross-border money transfers, particularly using XRP as a liquidity bridge asset. With regulatory clarity on XRP’s retail status and the legal battle behind it, Ripple is better positioned to attract partners, scale its enterprise services, and drive innovation in the global payments ecosystem. The Ripple vs. SEC saga may finally be coming to a close, but its impact will continue to ripple across the crypto industry for years to come.

The dream of achieving 100x ROI may seem elusive today, but analysts are now spotlighting Ruvi AI (RUVI) as a promising opportunity with equally explosive potential. This AI-powered blockchain token is already making waves in the market, thanks to its utility, structured growth, and an emphasis on transparency. With $2 million raised, 165 million tokens sold, and a growing holder base of over 1,600 participants, Ruvi AI’s ongoing presale and early-entry bonuses are turning heads. This could be the moment to claim a spot in what experts predict to be the next big success in crypto. Why Ruvi AI’s utility changes the game Unlike Dogecoin, which relied predominantly on hype and sentiment, Ruvi AI stands out for its utility-driven approach. Ruvi AI combines blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to offer scalable solutions across critical industries like marketing, entertainment, and finance. These high-demand sectors benefit from Ruvi AI’s tools, which optimize ad targeting, personalize customer experiences, and enhance financial transaction transparency. This emphasis on real-world applications ensures that Ruvi AI’s demand isn’t speculative. Its value is deeply tied to how it solves tangible problems for businesses and institutions, giving it a strong foundation for scalable growth. Predictable growth and ROI potential Ruvi AI’s structured growth model has further bolstered investor confidence. During the Phase 2 presale, RUVI tokens are priced at $0.015 per token, offering a low-cost entry point for savvy investors. Once the presale concludes, the token’s price is guaranteed to increase to $0.07, marking an instant 5x gain for early participants. Even more exciting are analyst predictions projecting a $1 valuation post-listing. For presale buyers, this marks an impressive 66x ROI. Considering its momentum and growing adoption, Ruvi AI is fast becoming a top pick for investors looking to replicate early Dogecoin-like returns. Achievements that prove Ruvi AI’s potential The buzz around Ruvi AI is backed by strong results. Here’s a snapshot of its impressive milestones: $2 million raised during the presale, showcasing broad investor trust. Over 165 million tokens sold, underscoring substantial market demand. A rapidly growing community of more than 1,600 holders, signaling investor confidence and high engagement. These early achievements solidify Ruvi AI’s credibility and set the stage for its anticipated breakout success. Amplify ROI with Ruvi AI’s VIP tiers Another reason investors are flocking to Ruvi AI is its VIP investment tiers, which reward early backers with token bonuses and exponential profit potential. Here’s how they break down: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tailored tiers ensure investors of all levels can capitalize on Ruvi AI’s growth potential while maximizing their returns ahead of its market debut. A secure and transparent investment Ruvi AI goes beyond promises by taking steps to ensure security and transparency. The project recently passed a third-party audit by CyberScope, validating its smart contracts and confirming its safety for investors. Furthermore, its partnership with the WEEX Exchange guarantees post-presale liquidity, enabling token holders to easily trade RUVI tokens once the presale ends. These efforts provide additional layers of trust and accountability that build investor confidence. Real-world applications drive longevity What sets Ruvi AI apart from speculative tokens is its commitment to solving real-world problems. Here are a few key examples of how Ruvi AI creates value beyond mere investment returns: Marketing: Cutting-edge AI tools help businesses improve ad targeting, optimize campaigns, and minimize costs. Entertainment: Content creators gain access to blockchain-backed payments and AI-driven personalization, boosting their engagement strategies. Finance: Institutions benefit from fraud detection tools and scalable transaction solutions powered by Ruvi AI. These applications ensure Ruvi AI maintains steady demand across industries, guaranteeing its longevity in a competitive crypto market. Why It’s Time to Invest For investors hoping to catch the next big wave in crypto, Ruvi AI’s combination of utility, transparency, and early entry bonuses makes it a standout option. Starting at just $0.015 per token, the token offers unmatched growth potential, with a guaranteed rise to $0.07 post-presale and a projected $1 valuation shortly after. With $2 million raised, 165 million tokens sold, and strategic partnerships with trusted players like CyberScope and WEEX Exchange, Ruvi AI is set for greatness.

Meanwhile, the ONDO price outlook shows some back-and-forth as whale wallets stir things up. But while both tokens make waves, BlockDAG (BDAG) is flipping the script with a fully gamified airdrop. This isn’t your typical click-and-forget airdrop; this one’s about tasks, rankings, and real rewards. The best part? Your effort pays off over time. Each quarter resets the leaderboard, but your quest progress carries forward. That means players who stick with it build momentum. Some top participants have already bagged tens of millions of BDAG. It’s a system made for serious players, not bots. If you’re thinking long term and want to find the best crypto for 2025, BlockDAG’s quest-based model is worth a deep look. BlockDAG: Airdrop with Quests, Rankings & Real Rewards Forget passive rewards, BlockDAG’s airdrop is structured like a competition. Every three months, the leaderboard resets, but you don’t lose your quest points. You can keep stacking rewards through four mission types: Testnet, Presale, Social, and Referral. The top 100 players split 100 million BDAG , with the #1 ranked wallet claiming 10.1 million. No bots, no shortcuts, just full-throttle grinding. This format rewards consistency. Deploy smart contracts, buy into the presale, invite others, share content, and it all earns points. And it builds serious community momentum ahead of the mainnet. It’s no wonder crypto communities are calling it the best crypto for 2025; this isn’t hype, it’s execution. As for the numbers, BlockDAG is currently in Batch 29 at $0.0030 for only 12 hours before the price rises to $0.0080. So far, it has raised $323 million through the sale of 23.3 billion BDAG coins. The final cap is set at 45 batches and $600 million. With a listing price target of $0.05, that’s over 16x upside from where we are now. And with MEXC, LBANK, XT.com, and BitMart all lined up for exchange listings, things are heating up. Plus, BlockDAG isn’t just talk; 2 million users are already mining through the X1 app, while the physical mining rigs ship starting July 7. With audits by Halborn and CertiK, plus an expanding toolset, BlockDAG is proving its value now, not later. That’s why it’s front and center on every list of best crypto for 2025 contenders. ONDO: Whale Action Builds Tension as Price Hovers The ONDO price outlook has everyone watching closely after a string of major whale movements in the last two days. Transfers involving 2 million+ ONDO tokens have been spotted shifting between exchanges and private wallets, hinting at possible reaccumulation before a bigger price move. Some large holders are exiting, others are buying dips, and it’s all adding up to a moment of tension. ONDO is trading at $1.33 as of June 24, holding firm at the support level from last week’s breakout. With a strong focus on tokenized real-world assets and institutional-grade DeFi, ONDO remains on the radar for analysts. Whether long-term holders continue to buy or short-term exits take over will determine the next direction. But if demand from big players stays intact, ONDO could quietly climb as one of the second-half winners in 2025. SHIB: Burn Rate Surge Sparks Buzz Around a Comeback There’s fresh energy behind the Shiba Inu (SHIB) breakout potential after a wave of token burns. In just the past day, 410 million SHIB were burned, bringing the monthly total near 12 billion. It’s one of the most aggressive burns we’ve seen lately, and it’s happening as wallet activity starts to tick up. The real question now: can this burn-driven momentum push SHIB back toward its yearly high? SHIB is currently priced around $0.000017, with bulls setting sights on breaking through $0.00002. But this potential rally isn’t just about supply cuts. Shibarium’s development and growing DeFi usage are bringing actual functionality to the meme coin space. Big wallets are loading up again, showing renewed interest. For early holders from the 2021 run-up, this could be the launchpad or a good chance to exit on strength. Either way, SHIB’s setup is drawing serious attention. Final Thoughts Both the ONDO price outlook and Shiba Inu breakout potential show momentum backed by big moves, whales for ONDO, and massive burns for SHIB. But if you’re after more than just price action, BlockDAG delivers on participation and growth. It’s not a claim-and-go airdrop; it’s a structured challenge where real players rise through ranks. With the price at $0.0030 for 12 hours before jumping to $0.0080, this could be one of the most rewarding entries of the year. Add in its active presale, mobile mining, exchange support, and 100 million BDAG airdrop pool, and BlockDAG looks locked in as the best crypto for 2025 . If you’re ready to earn your place and multiply your gains, BlockDAG might be the hottest move you can make right now.

As momentum fades for some big-name tokens, a few under-the-radar players are building real excitement. One of those is Unstaked, a blockchain-based AI project that’s quickly moving from presale underdog to serious contender. With a token price of just $0.012091 and over $10.6 million raised so far, Unstaked is catching attention fast. At the same time, Dogecoin (DOGE) price updates reflect growing weakness, with key support breaking down and traders rushing to exit. In contrast, Hyperliquid (HYPE) price today is climbing after a fresh all-time high, pushing it to the top of short-term trading watchlists. But for those trying to pick the next winner among crypto coins to buy, Unstaked is making a stronger case than either DOGE or HYPE, by combining use case, ROI potential, and early-stage access in one place. HYPE Climbs After New High, But Caution Creeps In While DOGE weakens, Hyperliquid (HYPE) price today is grabbing headlines after hitting a record $44.76. That’s a 25% gain this week, supported by open interest now exceeding $1.83 billion, a strong sign of trader commitment. That said, volume and trade count have pulled back slightly, even as price continues to hold. On-chain data remains positive, with MACD in the green and prices still above key Fibonacci levels. Analysts believe $50 is next, with room for $52.99 if buyer strength returns. HYPE is quickly rising through the ranks of trending crypto coins to buy, drawing attention from traders focused on short-term upside. However, some are beginning to ask questions. High entry prices, limited early access, and signs of fading volume are pushing cautious buyers to consider alternatives with bigger growth potential, and that’s where Unstaked enters the picture. DOGE Breaks Key Support as Long-Term Holders Exit The latest Dogecoin (DOGE) price updates show the token in decline after falling below a key level at $0.18. DOGE is currently trading near $0.176, down 9% from a recent high. Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) is spiking, meaning many are taking profits or cutting losses. This kind of data often points to deeper corrections ahead. DOGE has also slipped under its 50-day EMA of $0.195, while its RSI sits at a weak 38, confirming a bearish setup. If bulls fail to reclaim $0.181, DOGE could head toward $0.157, its low from April. Making matters worse, long-dormant wallets are becoming active again, “Age Consumed” metrics show older tokens moving, often a sign of large holders distributing. DOGE’s current chart and on-chain signals are raising concern. Once a go-to for retail traders, it’s now slipping off many crypto coins to buy lists as focus shifts toward more utility-driven tokens.

Today, these markets have kicked off the trading day with a notable uptick, a development that could ripple across various asset classes, including digital currencies. Understanding the Positive Start in US Stock Markets The financial world awoke to a welcome sight today as major indices across the US stock markets opened in positive territory. This early momentum suggests a prevailing sense of optimism among traders and investors, a stark contrast to some of the volatility witnessed in recent times. The slight but significant gains across the board indicate a broad-based positive sentiment rather than isolated sector strength. Here’s a quick look at the opening figures that set the tone for the day: S&P500: +0.16% NASDAQ: +0.17% Dow: +0.27% These modest gains, while seemingly small, can often be indicative of underlying market confidence and can set the trajectory for the rest of the trading day. What factors might be contributing to this positive start? What’s Driving Investor Sentiment? The prevailing investor sentiment is a complex tapestry woven from various economic, corporate, and geopolitical threads. A positive opening like today’s often stems from a combination of factors. Perhaps there’s optimism around upcoming economic data releases, such as inflation reports or employment figures, which investors anticipate will show resilience or improvement. Alternatively, strong corporate earnings reports from key companies might be bolstering confidence, suggesting that businesses are performing better than expected even in a challenging economic climate. Geopolitical stability, or at least a lack of escalating tensions, can also play a significant role in calming nerves and encouraging investment. When uncertainty recedes, investors are more likely to deploy capital into equities. This positive start could also be a reaction to recent statements from central banks, signaling a potentially less aggressive stance on monetary policy, which is often seen as a tailwind for stock valuations. The Bellwether: Decoding the S&P500’s Rise The S&P500 , widely regarded as one of the best gauges of large-cap U.S. equities and a broad indicator of the health of the American economy, showed a gain of 0.16% at the open. This index comprises 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States, representing a diverse range of sectors. Its positive movement suggests that optimism isn’t confined to a single industry but is rather spread across various segments of the economy. When the S&P500 moves up, it often signals that institutional investors and fund managers are feeling confident about the overall market direction. For many, the S&P500’s performance is a key benchmark for their portfolio’s health. Tech’s Momentum: What the NASDAQ’s Uplift Means The NASDAQ Composite, heavily weighted towards technology and growth companies, also registered a positive opening, climbing 0.17%. This index is often more volatile than the S&P500 or the Dow due to its concentration in sectors that can experience rapid shifts in investor interest and technological advancements. A positive start for the NASDAQ indicates continued strength or renewed interest in the tech sector, which has been a significant driver of market performance over the past decade. It suggests that investors are still willing to bet on innovation and growth, even amidst concerns about valuations and interest rates. The performance of tech giants within the NASDAQ can have a disproportionate impact on the index’s overall movement, making its positive open a significant indicator for the broader tech landscape. The Industrial Pulse: The Dow Jones’ Contribution Rounding out the major indices, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 prominent American companies often referred to as “blue-chip” stocks, led the gains with a 0.27% increase. The Dow, with its focus on established industrial and financial stalwarts, provides a snapshot of the traditional economy’s health. Its stronger opening today could indicate robust performance in sectors like manufacturing, banking, and consumer goods. A healthy Dow often reflects stability and confidence in the bedrock industries that form the backbone of the U.S. economy. For investors seeking stability and dividend income, the companies within the Dow are often key considerations, and its positive movement is a reassuring sign for long-term economic outlook. Implications for the Broader Financial Landscape and Crypto While this article focuses on traditional equities, the interconnectedness of global financial markets means that movements in US stock markets rarely occur in isolation. A positive opening in stocks can often lead to a “risk-on” environment, where investors feel more comfortable allocating capital to assets perceived as higher risk, including cryptocurrencies. When traditional markets are strong, it can reduce the perceived need for safe-haven assets, and some liquidity might even flow into digital assets as investors seek higher returns. Conversely, a strong stock market can sometimes divert attention and capital away from nascent markets like crypto, especially if the narrative is that traditional assets offer sufficient growth. However, in the current climate, many crypto investors closely watch the stock market for cues on overall market sentiment and macroeconomic trends. A sustained period of positive stock performance could foster a more optimistic environment for crypto, provided there are no specific regulatory headwinds or internal market issues. Challenges and What to Watch For Despite the positive start, it’s crucial to remember that market dynamics can shift rapidly. Potential challenges that could temper this optimism include: Inflationary Pressures: Persistent high inflation could prompt central banks to maintain or even increase interest rates, potentially dampening corporate earnings and consumer spending. Interest Rate Outlook: Future interest rate hikes or even the duration of current high rates can impact borrowing costs for companies and consumers, affecting profitability and growth. Geopolitical Developments: Unforeseen global events or escalating conflicts can quickly introduce volatility and shift investor sentiment from positive to cautious. Corporate Earnings Season: While some earnings might be positive, a broader trend of disappointing results could quickly reverse market gains. Investors should continue to monitor economic indicators, corporate announcements, and global events to stay informed. The initial positive opening is a good sign, but the market’s trajectory throughout the day and week will depend on a confluence of these factors. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor For those navigating both traditional and digital asset landscapes, today’s positive opening in the US stock markets offers a few key takeaways: Observe the Follow-Through: A strong open is just the beginning. Watch if the gains hold throughout the day and week. Sustained positive momentum is more significant than an initial bounce. Diversification Remains Key: Regardless of market direction, a diversified portfolio across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, crypto, commodities) can help mitigate risks. Stay Informed on Macro Trends: Economic reports, central bank decisions, and global news have a profound impact on all markets. Understanding these broader trends is vital. Assess Risk Appetite: A “risk-on” environment might encourage some to explore higher-risk assets like certain cryptocurrencies, but always do so within your personal risk tolerance. Concluding Thoughts: A Promising Start Today’s positive opening in the US stock markets —with the S&P500 , NASDAQ , and Dow Jones all showing gains—is undoubtedly a promising sign for the broader financial landscape. It reflects a current wave of positive investor sentiment , driven by various factors ranging from economic optimism to corporate performance. While the day is still young and market dynamics are fluid, this initial uplift provides a hopeful outlook for investors across different asset classes. It underscores the importance of staying attuned to traditional market movements, as they often provide valuable context for understanding the wider economic currents that influence even the most independent markets, like cryptocurrency.

But as we move deeper into 2025, some analysts are sounding the alarm: these market veterans may sit out the next big run. Momentum is shifting. Sentiment is cooling. And the focus is turning to emerging players—especially one new altcoin called MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s building real traction among investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Emerging Favorite While the blue-chip cryptos tread water, MAGACOIN FINANCE is racing ahead. This new presale project has drawn the attention of traders for its capped token supply, audited smart contracts, and explosive early momentum. Analysts are predicting gains of up to 75x—or even 100x—before its official exchange debut. Some forecasts even hint at a possible $1 valuation if the community growth continues at its current pace. The project has already surpassed $10 million in presale funding, and each stage is selling out faster than the last. Its blend of viral energy, fixed supply, and speculative upside makes it exactly the kind of coin that thrives in markets where major players have slowed down. MAGACOIN FINANCE doesn’t need to outperform ETH or XRP in total value—it only needs a small piece of the retail wave looking for fresh opportunities. And right now, it’s delivering exactly what risk-seeking investors are hunting: early entry, low cost, and huge potential upside. Why XRP, Ethereum, and Solana Are Losing Steam XRP has seen some relief since resolving its legal issues with the SEC, but that win hasn’t translated into lasting price movement. Analysts cite continued resistance near the $2.30 level and legal overhangs that keep institutional capital hesitant. Ethereum, despite the ETF speculation that helped boost its price earlier in the year, is now trading below major moving averages. The narrative is no longer enough. Without a fresh catalyst, ETH appears stuck in a consolidation phase. Solana, once the breakout star of the cycle, is also facing new concerns. Roughly 75% of its recent revenue has come from meme coin activity—a statistic that raises sustainability questions. Even with institutional interest and ETF chatter, investor enthusiasm has cooled. A regulatory cloud still looms, especially after the SEC pushed back against staking-based ETFs tied to Solana’s ecosystem. Final Thoughts: MAGACOIN FINANCE is the way XRP, Ethereum, and Solana will likely remain relevant in the long term. But in the fast-moving world of crypto, relevance isn’t always enough. Momentum, timing, and opportunity are what drive outsized returns. For now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the project that checks all those boxes—and some analysts believe it could be the top-performing presale of 2025.

Santiment notes in a new post on the social media platform X that Chainlink registered 363.73 notable GitHub events in the past 30 days. The figure far exceeds the second-ranked DeFi project, DeepBook Protocol ( DEEP ), which clocked 193.57 events. The DeepBook project is a decentralized central limit order book (CLOB), which is what exchanges use to facilitate buying and selling between traders by recording bids and offers. Third on the list is DeFiChain ( DFI ), a layer-1 protocol designed specifically for decentralized finance apps. The project registered 152 notable GitHub events in the past month. Source: Santiment/X Chainlink, DeepBook and DeFiChain also occupied the top three spots on the list last month as well. Santiment notes that it doesn’t count routine updates and uses a “better methodology” to collect data for GitHub events based on a “backtested process.” The analytics firm has previously said that heavy development activity centered around a crypto project is a positive indication that could mean that the developers believe the protocol will be successful. It also indicates that the project is less likely to be an exit scam. LINK is trading at $12.83 at time of writing. The 17th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down more than 2% in the past 24 hours.

46918530,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=779137,1751068854,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/46918530.jpeg,Analyst Spots Bitcoin Time Bomb Hidden In Bullish Weekly Chart,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-time-bomb-hidden-bullish-weekly-chart/,"In a post on 27 June, crypto-market chartist Dr Cat (@DoctorCatX) warned that Bitcoin’s ostensibly bullish weekly structure may be concealing a latent “time bomb” that could detonate if bulls fail to force a decisive breakout over the next three to four weeks. The technician’s diagnosis hinges on a classic Ichimoku paradox: an expanding bullish kumo and a flat Kijun Sen on the weekly timeframe are clustering with a constellation of bearish warnings on the daily and two-day charts. Bitcoin Faces A July Time Bomb “Look at the weekly kumo: it’s expanding, widening,” Dr Cat began. “This means that bullish momentum is building for potential trend sustainability even though the trend is not active as Kijun Sen is flat.” The observation is significant because an enlarging kumo—formed by the Senkou Span A/B envelope—generally represents thickening support, making sudden breakdowns statistically less probable as long as the cloud keeps widening. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer At the same time, the Chikou Span (CS) is “above the candles without a gap,” but, Dr Cat cautioned, it has “4 weeks deadline to close above ATH or will enter the candles.” Should the lagging line be absorbed back into price, the textbook interpretation is a loss of bullish conviction at the largest visible scale. That ostensibly constructive weekly backdrop contrasts starkly with a “lot of red flags on the daily hinting for a bearish scenario which can escalate on many levels.” Among those alarms is the prospect of a death TK cross on the two-day chart, anticipated “tonight,” in which the Tenkan Sen slips below the Kijun Sen—often the prelude to a down-leg when it materialises beneath the cloud. “So how do you interpret such conflicting information from different timeframes?” the analyst asked rhetorically, underscoring that traders who privilege only a single interval risk being blindsided. Dr Cat’s answer is a roadmap defined by time. Because the weekly cloud continues expanding, “it is hard for the price to dump a lot” immediately; historically, the kumo “needs first to become flat.” The flattening mechanism is mechanical: if Bitcoin fails to record a fresh all-time high “in 2 weeks from now,” roughly by the week that begins 14 July, the leading Senkou Span A numerator will stop rising, truncating cloud expansion. That in turn opens a window for gravity to reassert itself on the higher timeframe. Against that backdrop the analyst offered two conditional trajectories. First scenario: bearish signals on the lower charts mature. “The price will likely need at least 1.5 month or so for a very big dump on the weekly scale, because the weekly kumo will keep expanding for 2 more weeks,” Dr Cat wrote. During that holding period the market could “range around / just do small dumps to the $90s,” a reference to the high–$90 000 zone that has defined range lows since late spring. Should this grind continue beyond the second half of July without a structural shift on daily Ichimoku metrics, weekly momentum would invert: the kumo would cease expanding and the CS would dive into prior candles, removing two of the most durable layers of longer-term support. Related Reading: Top Analyst Predicts New Bitcoin Peak Timeline And ‘Double Cycle Blowoff’ Second scenario: bulls seize the initiative. To “save the chart from the warning signs,” buyers must engineer “a higher high above the $110,600 high shortly after the 27th of June,” thereby invalidating the bearish daily setup and re-energising the top-down trend. Time is critical: after “the week starting on 14th of July,” the CS will approach prior candlesticks, making each subsequent failure to print a new high proportionally more damaging. Dr Cat locates a final decision node on “the Sunday of the week starting on the 14th of July”—20 July—when the interplay between a stalling cloud and an in-candle CS could arm an additional set of “red flags for bulls.” The post stops short of assigning explicit probability weightings to either outcome, but its construction implies that the market’s most consequential catalyst in mid-summer may not be macro data or ETF flows so much as a self-reflexive technical countdown visible to every chart-watcher who uses Ichimoku. With roughly three weeks remaining before the cloud loses upward curvature, participants must choose between forcing a breakout above $110,600 or bracing for a higher-time-frame correction that could test sub-$100 000 territory. Whether Bitcoin’s expanding cloud proves a shield or a trap is, by Dr Cat’s own framing, “hidden in plain sight.” For now, the bullish weekly silhouette buys bulls breathing-room, but the daily and two-day warnings ensure that every hour the asset trades side-ways the theoretical time bomb ticks louder. At press time, BTC traded at $106,778.

The latest Ethereum (ETH) price forecast points to a push toward $3,000 thanks to strong technicals and ETF tailwinds. At the same time, fresh Chainlink (LINK) price analysis shows a rebound from $13 support with targets now climbing toward $15–$16. But while these tokens are moving on their own merits, the bigger question is what comes next, what powers the next cycle? That’s where Web3 ai steps in. It’s not just another AI tool. It’s building something bigger: a full-stack, AI-enhanced platform where traders and investors can find signals, analyze risk, and uncover real opportunities, all in one place. The best crypto coin to buy might not be ETH, LINK, or even BTC, it could be the one helping power them all. Web3 ai: Where Crypto Tools Finally Come Together Every past cycle introduced new crypto tools, but they always came scattered. One app for portfolio tracking, another for risk, a third for yield farming, and a dozen tabs for news. Web3 ai is taking a different path. It’s building an AI-powered hub where every major function a crypto investor needs, strategy, analysis, security, discovery, comes pre-connected and enhanced by machine learning. It’s not just about access; it’s about efficiency. Web3 ai’s platform includes eight integrated tools: a Portfolio Optimizer that rebalances assets in real time, a DeFi Yield Farming Advisor to surface top opportunities across protocols, and a Risk Management (VaR) Simulator that stress-tests portfolios with live market data. Add to that an AI Scam Detector, a Staking & Lending Advisor, a Borrowing Advisor, and dual News & Sentiment Aggregators, and you’re looking at the most complete AI suite built specifically for crypto. Now in Stage 9 of its presale, Web3 ai’s native token, $WAI, is priced at $0.000443. So far, the project has raised $8.5 million, and it’s targeting a listing price of $0.005242, which reflects a potential 1,700% ROI for early entrants. But more than returns, this is about adoption. The platform is designed to become part of a user’s daily trading rhythm, checking signals, running stress tests, comparing protocols, all in one tab. For investors looking beyond short-term pumps, Web3 ai could easily be the best crypto coin to buy heading into the next cycle. Because while others chase narratives, Web3 ai is building tools that actually work. Ethereum (ETH) Price Forecast: Can It Break $3,000 Soon? The latest Ethereum (ETH) price forecast points to a steady climb, with analysts setting short-term targets around $2,570 to $2,600 by the end of June. Strong support zones at $2,510 and resistance near $2,660 are keeping things interesting. If Ethereum can close above that $2,660 range, it could make a serious push toward $3,000. The recent “Pectra” upgrade and growing ETF inflows are helping fuel this momentum. Looking further into 2025, some models suggest a potential run up to $5,770, while more conservative forecasts hover around $3,200–$3,700. The Ethereum (ETH) price forecast from InvestingHaven and CoinPedia puts the high range close to $6,000, assuming strong market conditions. For now, the $2,400–$2,800 range remains the key battleground. With solid technical signals and increased institutional demand, ETH is one to watch as the market gears up for what could be a major second-half rally. Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis: Holding Strong at $13, Eyeing $15 Next The latest Chainlink (LINK) price analysis shows LINK trading just above $13 after bouncing from its recent support zone near $12.77. It’s been moving inside a $10.10–$15.00 range for weeks, but the recovery has started to look more stable. Short-term resistance sits around $13.80–$14.00, with wider technical targets pushing toward $15.30 if momentum holds. RSI and MACD are neutral but showing early signs of upward bias. Looking ahead, most forecasts are cautiously optimistic. CoinCodex sees LINK hitting $13.38 by mid-July, while longer-term projections stretch up to $25 or even $32 by year-end. The 20-day and 200-day EMAs are lined up at $14.99 and $15.88, so breaking past $15 could shift the trend. With demand growing around oracle networks and real use cases expanding, this Chainlink (LINK) price analysis suggests that LINK’s slow grind upward might be setting the stage for a bigger move. The Final Take Ethereum is holding above $2,500 with short-term targets near $2,600, and the latest Ethereum (ETH) price forecast still points toward a potential $3,000 breakout. Chainlink is steady near $13, with resistance forming around $15. According to the latest Chainlink (LINK) price analysis, breaking that level could open up room for a stronger mid-year move. But while both are showing strength, the bigger question is where traders will get the edge in the next cycle. That’s where Web3 ai fits in. Instead of offering one more tool, it’s building a full AI-powered stack, all in one place. From trade signals to fraud detection, it’s about making high-level crypto intel easier to access and use. For those looking beyond charts, Web3 ai could be the best crypto coin to buy now, before its presale turns into the full platform launch.

The ruling will force these platforms to stand legally responsible for the posts users make with them. Thanks to the Supreme Court in Brazil’s new ruling, social media platforms like Facebook, TikTok and X will have to make immediate moves to get rid of material such as hate speech, incitement to violence or “anti-democratic acts”, without a prior judicial go-ahead. Brazil has become increasingly sensitive toward harmful digital content, especially its impact on young people, and this ruling is a side effect of that. https://twitter.com/bolsonarosp/status/1938714862739501299?s=46 Brazil’s Supreme Court’s ruling demands preemptive action Since news broke about the ruling, critics have weighed in with scathing reviews, some warning it could lead to pre-emptive censorship by the tech groups it targets. There is also the possibility that the decision could fuel tensions with President Donald Trump’s administration, which has already threatened to hit any foreign national found to be censoring American companies and citizens with visa restrictions. Just last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington was considering sanctioning a Brazilian supreme court judge under the Magnitsky Act, which targets foreign officials for corruption or human rights abuses. The judge, Alexandre de Moraes, was targeted for temporarily banning X, formerly Twitter, last year after its billionaire owner refused to comply with court orders that demanded he suspend certain accounts. The ruling on Thursday officially paves the way for Brazilian individuals to be able to sue digital platforms if they refuse to delete illegal content that has been brought to their attention. In the past, apps and sites only took civil responsibility for damages caused by third-party posts when they refused to comply with judicial orders to take down the offending content. Eight out of 11 judges have now decided that the previous rule is “no longer sufficient to protect fundamental rights and democracy,” hence the new ruling. Conservatives concerned about Brazil’s clamor for tougher internet regulation In recent times, there have been calls for tougher internet regulation in Brazil , especially after riots in Brasília on January 8, 2023, that saw supporters of the far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro storm government buildings, pushing for a military coup. This is concerning to conservatives in the South American nation who said the ruling, which will be effective once it is officially published, would have a considerable effect on freedom of speech. Rightwing lawmaker Coronel Chrisóstomo told local broadcaster Jovem Pan that Congress will have to step in if they are to resist censorship. Tech groups have also responded coldly, with Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, expressing concern for the implications the ruling will have on speech as well as the millions of businesses that rely on their apps for growth and job creation in Brazil. “[It] brings legal uncertainties and will have significant consequences for free expression, innovation and digital economic development, significantly increasing the risk of doing business in Brazil,” Meta said. Google expressed similar sentiments, saying it had already expressed “concerns about changes that could impact freedom of expression and the digital economy”, before adding that it was analysing the decision.

For anyone tracking the future of cryptocurrency, recent developments from U.S. Congress signal a pivotal shift in the timeline for comprehensive crypto legislation . What does this mean for the industry and your digital holdings? Navigating the New Timeline for Crypto Legislation The buzz in Washington D.C. has been palpable as lawmakers grapple with how to best integrate cryptocurrencies into existing financial frameworks. According to insights from Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett, a significant recalibration is underway. Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) has publicly committed to completing crucial market structure legislation by the end of September. This adjusted deadline marks a deviation from an earlier, more ambitious August target set by President Trump. This reset isn’t just about pushing dates; it reflects the complex, multi-faceted nature of crafting effective digital asset policies that balance innovation with consumer protection and financial stability. Understanding the Role of US Congress in Digital Asset Policy When it comes to shaping the future of finance, the US Congress plays a central role. Both the Senate and the White House are reportedly aligning on distinct legislative pathways, focusing on key areas like market structure and stablecoins. This collaborative, yet sometimes fragmented, approach highlights the bipartisan effort – and inherent challenges – in establishing a clear regulatory framework. While the Senate moves forward with its revised schedule, the House of Representatives remains notably quiet regarding the timing of a vote on the highly anticipated GENIUS Act . The legislative dance between these chambers is crucial for determining the ultimate shape of crypto laws that will govern how digital assets are created, traded, and used across the nation. The Imperative of Stablecoin Legislation One of the most pressing areas for lawmakers is stablecoin legislation . These digital assets, designed to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, have garnered significant attention due to their potential for widespread adoption and systemic importance. Clear rules for stablecoins are seen as essential for protecting consumers, preventing illicit finance, and fostering innovation within a secure environment. Without a robust framework, the growth of stablecoins could pose risks to financial stability, particularly if they become widely used for payments and settlements. Therefore, the commitment from the Senate and White House to address this segment specifically underscores its critical role in the broader digital economy and its potential to bridge traditional finance with the crypto world. Shaping the Future with Market Structure Legislation Beyond stablecoins, the larger umbrella of market structure legislation is equally vital. This encompasses a wide range of regulations governing how digital assets are traded, custodied, and cleared. Think about rules for cryptocurrency exchanges, broker-dealers, and other intermediaries. The goal is to bring clarity and consistency to a nascent industry that currently operates under a patchwork of state and federal guidelines, or sometimes, none at all. A well-defined market structure could enhance investor protection by setting standards for transparency and accountability, reduce market manipulation, and attract greater institutional participation, ultimately legitimizing the digital asset space in the eyes of traditional finance and mainstream investors. The Anticipated Impact of the GENIUS Act While much attention is on the Senate’s progress, the House’s GENIUS Act looms large. Although details on its specific content and voting timeline remain scarce, President Trump is reportedly expected to sign it into law next month. The implications of such a significant piece of legislation, particularly if it passes the House and receives presidential assent, could be profound. It could set precedents for how different types of digital assets are classified, how exchanges are regulated, and what consumer protections are put in place. The silence from the House on its voting schedule only adds to the anticipation and speculation surrounding this potentially transformative bill, which could redefine the legal landscape for crypto in the U.S. Challenges and Opportunities on the Path to Clarity Crafting comprehensive crypto legislation is no small feat. Lawmakers face the daunting task of understanding complex technology, balancing innovation with risk mitigation, and navigating strong lobbying efforts from various industry stakeholders. The challenges include defining what constitutes a security versus a commodity, establishing clear oversight responsibilities between agencies like the SEC and CFTC, and ensuring global competitiveness. However, the opportunities are immense: clear rules could unlock massive investment, foster job creation, and solidify the U.S.’s position as a leader in the global digital economy. The current legislative efforts represent a crucial step towards realizing these benefits, providing a stable foundation for future growth. What This Means for You For individuals and businesses involved in cryptocurrency, these legislative developments are not just political news; they directly impact the landscape in which you operate. A clearer regulatory environment could lead to more secure platforms, more accessible services, and potentially greater stability in the market. Conversely, delays or poorly crafted legislation could introduce uncertainty and hinder growth. Staying informed about these timelines and the content of proposed bills is essential for navigating the evolving digital asset space. The push by US Congress for decisive action suggests that significant changes are on the horizon, promising a more defined future for crypto in America. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Assets in the U.S. The reset of the legislative timeline by U.S. Congress marks a critical phase for cryptocurrency in America. With the Senate prioritizing market structure legislation by September and the House’s GENIUS Act awaiting a vote, the path towards comprehensive digital asset regulation is becoming clearer, albeit with its twists and turns. These efforts, particularly around stablecoin legislation , aim to provide much-needed clarity, foster innovation responsibly, and protect consumers. While the journey is complex, the commitment from Washington signals a growing recognition of crypto’s integral role in the future of finance. The coming months will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of digital assets for years to come, potentially ushering in an era of unprecedented growth and adoption under a clearer regulatory umbrella.

News from Walter Bloomberg on X indicates a strong sense of optimism: the US EU Tariff Deal is confidently expected to be finalized before the July 9 deadline. For those navigating the volatile waters of the cryptocurrency market, such macro-economic developments are far more than just headlines; they are potential harbingers of shifts in investor sentiment and capital flows. Let’s delve into why this agreement holds such immense significance and how it could ripple through the global economy, touching even the decentralized world of digital assets. Understanding the US EU Tariff Deal: A Path to Stability? For years, trade relations between the United States and the European Union have been a complex tapestry of cooperation and contention. Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, have often been a flashpoint, impacting everything from steel and aluminum to agricultural products and even digital services. The current negotiations aim to resolve lingering disputes and prevent the re-escalation of trade wars that could have detrimental effects on global supply chains and consumer prices. A successful US EU Tariff Deal would signify a significant de-escalation, fostering a more predictable and stable environment for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. To fully grasp the weight of this impending agreement, it’s helpful to consider its historical context and the specific issues at play: Historical Context: Remember the transatlantic trade tensions during previous administrations? Disputes over steel and aluminum tariffs, subsidies for aircraft manufacturers (Boeing vs. Airbus), and even debates over digital services taxes have characterized recent US-EU trade relations. While some of these were temporarily suspended or resolved, underlying disagreements often linger. The failure of the ambitious Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) in the past also highlights the complexities involved in forging comprehensive agreements between these economic giants. This current push for a deal is a renewed effort to mend fences and build a more robust trade framework. Current Focus: While the exact details of the ongoing negotiations are often kept confidential until a deal is struck, key areas of discussion typically include: Steel and Aluminum Tariffs: The US had imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU, citing national security concerns. The EU retaliated with its own tariffs on certain US goods. Finding a permanent resolution here is crucial. Digital Services Taxes (DSTs): Several EU countries have implemented or proposed DSTs on large tech companies, many of which are US-based. The US views these as discriminatory, leading to potential retaliatory tariffs. Green Subsidies and Trade: As both blocs push for green transitions, discussions around subsidies for renewable energy and other green technologies, and how these might impact trade, are becoming increasingly important. Agricultural Access: Long-standing disagreements over agricultural product access and standards continue to be a sensitive area. Mutual Benefits: Why are both sides so keen on reaching an agreement? The benefits are substantial: For Businesses: Reduced tariffs mean lower costs for importing raw materials and components, making goods more competitive. Predictability in trade policy allows businesses to plan long-term investments and expand operations with greater certainty. For Consumers: Lower import costs can translate to lower prices for a wide range of goods, from cars to consumer electronics and food. This effectively increases purchasing power. Supply Chain Resilience: A stable trade environment helps diversify supply chains, reducing reliance on single regions and making them more resilient to global shocks. Economic Growth: Increased trade generally leads to higher economic output, job creation, and innovation. The confidence expressed by both sides suggests that significant progress has been made, and the political will exists to cross the finish line. What Does the Global Trade Outlook Mean for Your Investments? Beyond the immediate implications for specific industries, the broader Global Trade Outlook is a critical indicator for overall economic health. When major economic blocs like the US and EU demonstrate a commitment to open and fair trade, it sends a powerful positive signal to investors worldwide. Conversely, trade disputes can breed uncertainty, leading to cautious spending, reduced investment, and even inflationary pressures. This directly impacts how capital is allocated across various asset classes, including the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. Consider these key aspects that influence the Global Trade Outlook and, by extension, your portfolio: Scenario Impact on Global Trade Potential Market Reaction Implication for Crypto Market Trends Successful US EU Tariff Deal Increased predictability, reduced costs, enhanced supply chain stability, stronger economic ties. Positive investor sentiment, rally in equity markets, potential for growth in risk assets (e.g., tech stocks). Likely ‘risk-on’ sentiment, potentially boosting Bitcoin and altcoin prices as investors seek higher returns; increased institutional interest. Deal Fails / Delays Continued uncertainty, potential for new tariffs, supply chain disruptions, strained diplomatic relations. Negative investor sentiment, flight to safety (e.g., bonds, gold), increased volatility across markets. Potential ‘risk-off’ sentiment, leading to downward pressure on crypto prices; investors might temporarily withdraw funds from volatile assets. Partial Agreement / Limited Scope Some issues resolved, but major disagreements remain; mixed signals for long-term stability. Mixed market reaction, sector-specific impacts, general cautious optimism. Neutral to slightly positive, but with underlying caution; market might react to specific sector news relevant to crypto (e.g., tech, financial services). A stable and cooperative Global Trade Outlook fosters an environment where businesses can thrive, and innovation can flourish. This fundamental stability is a bedrock for investment across all sectors, traditional and digital alike. Boosting Economic Confidence: How Does It Ripple Through Markets? The concept of Economic Confidence is a powerful, yet often intangible, force. It reflects the collective belief of consumers, businesses, and investors in the future stability and growth of an economy. When confidence is high, people are more likely to spend, businesses are more likely to invest and hire, and investors are more willing to take on risk. A breakthrough in the US EU Tariff Deal could provide a significant boost to this confidence, not just within the US and EU, but globally, as it signals a return to multilateral cooperation over protectionism. Let’s break down how this confidence translates into tangible economic effects: Consumer Spending: When consumers feel secure about their jobs and future economic prospects, they are more willing to spend on goods and services. Reduced tariffs on imported goods can also directly lower prices, putting more money in consumers’ pockets and further stimulating spending. This ‘feel-good factor’ is crucial for economies reliant on domestic consumption. Business Investment: Companies thrive on predictability. A stable trade environment, free from the threat of sudden tariffs or trade wars, encourages businesses to invest in new technologies, expand production capacities, and hire more employees. This long-term planning is essential for sustainable economic growth and innovation. Investor Behavior: High Economic Confidence typically leads to a ‘risk-on’ mentality among investors. They are more willing to allocate capital to growth-oriented assets, including equities, venture capital, and even emerging markets. Conversely, low confidence triggers a ‘flight to safety,’ where investors move funds into less volatile assets like government bonds or gold. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): Countries with stable and open trade policies are more attractive destinations for foreign direct investment. Companies are more likely to set up operations, factories, or research centers in regions where they can reliably import and export goods without unexpected barriers. This inflow of capital creates jobs and transfers technology. Central Bank Policy: Central banks often monitor economic confidence indicators closely. A boost in confidence might give them more leeway in their monetary policy decisions, potentially influencing interest rates and the overall availability of credit in the economy. The successful resolution of the US EU Tariff Deal would therefore not just be a win for trade negotiators; it would be a significant psychological boost for the global economy, setting a positive tone for future growth and collaboration. Navigating Cryptocurrency Market Trends in a Changing Economic Climate For enthusiasts and investors in digital assets, understanding the interplay between macroeconomics and Cryptocurrency Market Trends is paramount. While often seen as a separate, decentralized ecosystem, the crypto market is not immune to global economic shifts. Increased Economic Confidence , fueled by positive developments like the impending US EU Tariff Deal , can lead to a ‘risk-on’ environment where investors are more comfortable allocating capital to higher-risk, higher-reward assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Conversely, global trade tensions or economic instability can prompt a ‘flight to safety,’ pulling funds out of volatile assets. Here’s how these broader economic narratives intertwine with the unique dynamics of the crypto space: Correlation with Traditional Markets: Historically, Bitcoin, and by extension, the broader crypto market, has shown periods of correlation with traditional equity markets, particularly tech stocks. When global economic sentiment improves, and indices like the S&P 500 or Nasdaq rise, crypto often follows suit. This is because both are considered ‘risk assets’ by many institutional investors. A positive trade deal reduces systemic risk, encouraging broader market participation. Institutional Adoption: A stable global economic environment, marked by positive trade relations and high confidence, makes it easier for large financial institutions and corporations to justify their foray into the crypto space. Regulatory clarity and reduced economic uncertainty are key factors for institutional investors who operate under strict compliance and risk management frameworks. When the global economy is calm, these players are more likely to allocate significant capital to digital assets, driving demand and legitimizing the market. Inflationary Pressures and Safe Havens: While some view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation (digital gold), its price action has also been influenced by inflation expectations and central bank responses. If the US EU Tariff Deal helps reduce import costs and alleviate inflationary pressures, it might temper the ‘inflation hedge’ narrative for some, but bolster the ‘growth asset’ narrative. Conversely, if economic stability falters due to trade wars, the demand for true safe havens (like physical gold) might rise, potentially drawing some capital away from crypto. Global Liquidity: Trade agreements contribute to global liquidity by fostering greater capital flows and reducing barriers to cross-border transactions. Higher global liquidity can indirectly benefit crypto markets by increasing the overall pool of capital available for investment, some of which will inevitably find its way into digital assets. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Diversify Wisely: While macro events are important, remember crypto’s unique drivers. Diversify your portfolio within crypto (Bitcoin, Ethereum, altcoins) and across asset classes. Monitor Macro News: Keep an eye on major economic announcements, central bank decisions, and significant geopolitical developments like trade deals. These can offer clues about shifts in market sentiment. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): In times of uncertainty or volatility, DCA can be a sound strategy, allowing you to build positions over time without trying to time the market perfectly. Long-Term Vision: For many, crypto is a long-term play based on technological innovation and adoption. Short-term macro fluctuations, while impactful, shouldn’t overshadow the underlying fundamental progress of the blockchain space. Ultimately, the health of the global economy provides the backdrop against which Cryptocurrency Market Trends play out. A positive resolution to the US EU Tariff Deal can only strengthen that backdrop. Shaping the Future: The Role of International Trade Policy The ongoing negotiations for the US EU Tariff Deal are a microcosm of the broader landscape of International Trade Policy . These policies are not static; they evolve in response to global challenges, technological advancements, and geopolitical shifts. The commitment of major economic powers to constructive dialogue and resolution of disputes sets a crucial precedent for future global cooperation. This stability is fundamental for the smooth functioning of global supply chains, the equitable distribution of goods, and ultimately, the prosperity of nations. For the crypto community, a world with fewer trade barriers and greater economic integration often translates to more opportunities for digital innovation and adoption. Let’s explore the broader implications of effective International Trade Policy : Multilateralism vs. Bilateralism: The US-EU deal highlights the ongoing tension between pursuing multilateral agreements (through bodies like the World Trade Organization, WTO) and bilateral deals. While the WTO faces challenges, major bilateral agreements like this one can still contribute to global trade liberalization and set standards that others might follow. Impact on Emerging Markets: Major trade deals between economic giants like the US and EU can have significant ripple effects on emerging markets. Reduced trade barriers in developed economies can free up resources, potentially increasing demand for goods and services from developing nations. Conversely, if trade tensions persist, it can lead to protectionist measures that hurt smaller economies reliant on exports. Technological Integration and Digital Trade: Modern trade policy is increasingly grappling with the digital economy. Discussions around data flows, digital services taxes, and cross-border e-commerce are now central. Interestingly, blockchain technology, with its potential for secure, transparent, and efficient record-keeping, could play a significant role in facilitating future digital trade agreements and streamlining customs processes. Imagine smart contracts automating international payments and logistics – a future enabled by robust trade policy. Geopolitical Stability: Trade relations are inextricably linked to geopolitics. A strong and cooperative trade relationship between the US and EU not only benefits their economies but also strengthens their political alliance, acting as a stabilizing force in a complex global landscape. This unity can be crucial in addressing other global challenges, from climate change to security. Addressing New Challenges: Trade policy is no longer just about goods and services. It’s about addressing new challenges like climate change (e.g., EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, CBAM), labor standards, and intellectual property rights in the digital age. The US-EU negotiations are likely touching upon some of these complex, forward-looking issues. The successful navigation of these complex issues in the US EU Tariff Deal would be a testament to the enduring power of diplomacy and the critical role of well-crafted International Trade Policy in shaping a more prosperous and stable global future. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for Global Markets? The reported confidence from both the U.S. and EU regarding a swift resolution to their tariff disputes before the July 9 deadline is a significant positive development. This potential US EU Tariff Deal is more than just a trade agreement; it’s a powerful signal of renewed cooperation and a potential catalyst for boosting Economic Confidence worldwide. While the direct implications for Cryptocurrency Market Trends are nuanced and depend on broader market sentiment, a stable and predictable Global Trade Outlook , shaped by thoughtful International Trade Policy , generally creates a more favorable environment for risk assets and fosters overall economic growth. As we approach the deadline, the world watches, hoping this optimism translates into a tangible agreement that benefits global economies, strengthens international relations, and by extension, creates a more fertile ground for innovation and adoption in the dynamic world of digital finance. This deal could indeed be a crucial step towards a more integrated and prosperous global economy.

Once lauded for its aggressive embrace of Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, the company now finds itself embroiled in a deepening legal quagmire. What started as a bold financial maneuver has escalated into a series of class-action lawsuits, alleging securities fraud and misleading statements that could have profound implications for the company and the broader crypto investment landscape. Are we witnessing the unraveling of a pioneering corporate Bitcoin strategy, or simply the growing pains of a volatile asset class meeting traditional financial regulations? Strategy Bitcoin Lawsuits: What’s Happening Behind the Scenes? Strategy is currently navigating a tempest of legal action, facing at least five separate class-action lawsuits. These aren’t just minor disputes; they represent a significant challenge to the company’s financial practices and public disclosures. According to reports from Decrypt, these lawsuits allege securities fraud, specifically pointing to a period between April 2024 and April 2025 where the company purportedly misled investors. The core of the accusation centers on Strategy’s communication regarding the expected returns and inherent risks associated with its substantial Bitcoin holdings. It’s a high-stakes battle, with multiple law firms vying for the lead role in what is expected to be a consolidated case, all eager for the potential for substantial legal fees. The urgency of the situation is underscored by a looming July 15 deadline for the consolidation of these cases. This move aims to streamline the legal process, bringing together similar claims into a single, more manageable proceeding. For investors, this consolidation could mean a more unified front against the company, potentially strengthening their collective bargaining power. The outcome of these Strategy Bitcoin lawsuits could set a significant precedent for how publicly traded companies handle and disclose their cryptocurrency investments. MicroStrategy Legal Challenges: A Shift from Visionary to Vulnerable? For years, MicroStrategy, under the leadership of Michael Saylor, was seen as a trailblazer. It was the first publicly traded company to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, a move that initially generated immense excitement and, for a time, significant paper gains. Saylor became a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, often touting its potential as a hedge against inflation and a superior store of value compared to traditional assets. This aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy saw the company accumulate vast amounts of the cryptocurrency, turning it into a de facto Bitcoin proxy for many investors. However, this pioneering approach also exposed the company to the notoriously volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. The current wave of MicroStrategy legal challenges suggests a fundamental shift in perception. Investors who bought into the “Bitcoin play” are now alleging that the company’s statements about returns and and risks were not adequately transparent or, worse, were actively misleading. This raises critical questions about the duty of publicly traded companies to accurately represent the risks associated with unconventional asset strategies to their shareholders. Key points contributing to these challenges include: Aggressive Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy’s strategy involved leveraging debt to acquire more Bitcoin, amplifying both potential gains and losses. Public Statements vs. Reality: Allegations suggest a disconnect between optimistic public pronouncements and the actual financial risks being incurred. Market Volatility: The inherent price swings of Bitcoin mean that even well-intentioned strategies can face severe headwinds. Understanding Bitcoin Investment Risks: What Should Investors Know? The lawsuits against Strategy serve as a stark reminder of the inherent Bitcoin investment risks . While Bitcoin has shown remarkable long-term growth, its price action is anything but stable. Swings of 20%, 30%, or even 50% in short periods are not uncommon. For individual investors, such volatility can be stomach-churning. For a publicly traded company holding billions in Bitcoin, these fluctuations directly impact its balance sheet and profitability. Investors considering exposure to crypto, whether directly or through companies like Strategy, must understand: Extreme Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is influenced by a myriad of factors, including regulatory news, macroeconomic trends, technological developments, and even social media sentiment. Lack of Fundamental Valuation: Unlike traditional companies with earnings, dividends, and assets that can be fundamentally valued, Bitcoin’s value is largely derived from supply and demand, adoption, and its perceived utility as a digital asset. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, posing risks of unexpected changes that could impact market dynamics. Custody Risks: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin, especially for a corporation, introduces unique security and custody challenges. These risks are precisely what the lawsuits claim Strategy failed to adequately convey to its investors, leading to a situation where expectations may have been misaligned with reality. Securities Fraud Allegations: Unpacking the Legal Claims The heart of these lawsuits lies in the securities fraud allegations . In essence, securities fraud occurs when a company or individual makes misleading statements or omissions of material fact in connection with the sale or purchase of securities, leading to financial harm for investors. For Strategy, the accusations revolve around the period between April 2024 and April 2025, during which the company allegedly provided an inaccurate picture of its Bitcoin strategy’s potential and perils. What constitutes “misleading statements” in this context? Allegation Type Description Financial Impact Overstating Potential Returns Accusations might include presenting overly optimistic projections for Bitcoin’s price appreciation without adequately highlighting downside risks. Potential for investor losses based on misinformed decisions. Understating Risks & Omissions Failure to sufficiently warn investors about the extreme volatility of Bitcoin, the potential for significant unrealized Bitcoin losses , or the impact of leveraging debt to acquire crypto, contributing to securities fraud allegations . Shareholder value erosion due to unacknowledged risks and potentially withheld material facts. If proven, such allegations could result in substantial financial penalties for Strategy, including damages paid to affected investors. The legal battle will likely scrutinize public statements, investor presentations, and financial disclosures made by the company during the specified period. The Impact of Unrealized Bitcoin Losses: A Financial Wake-Up Call The catalyst for these lawsuits appears to be Strategy’s recent disclosure of nearly $6 billion in unrealized Bitcoin losses . This figure is staggering and represents a significant paper loss on their substantial Bitcoin holdings. An “unrealized loss” occurs when the current market value of an asset is lower than its purchase price, but the asset has not yet been sold. While not a “realized” cash loss until the asset is sold, it significantly impacts a company’s balance sheet, shareholder equity, and perceived financial health. The company’s accompanying warning that it “may not return to profitability” further exacerbated investor concerns. This statement is a critical red flag for any publicly traded company, as sustained profitability is a key indicator of financial stability and future growth potential. For Strategy, this suggests that the magnitude of their Bitcoin losses is so significant that it could overshadow their core business operations for an extended period. The implications of such massive unrealized losses are multifaceted: Balance Sheet Impairment: Reduces the company’s net assets, impacting its financial ratios and creditworthiness. Investor Confidence Erosion: Leads to a loss of trust among current and potential investors, potentially driving down stock price. Profitability Concerns: Even if the core software business is profitable, the sheer scale of crypto losses can drag down overall net income. Auditor Scrutiny: Such disclosures often trigger increased scrutiny from auditors and regulators. This situation highlights the double-edged sword of Strategy’s Bitcoin strategy: immense potential upside during bull markets, but equally immense downside risk during bear markets. What Does This Mean for the Future of Corporate Crypto Adoption? The legal challenges facing Strategy are more than just a company-specific issue; they represent a crucial test case for corporate crypto adoption. As more companies consider adding cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets, the Strategy lawsuits will likely serve as a cautionary tale. They underscore the importance of transparent risk disclosure, robust financial reporting, and realistic expectations when integrating volatile digital assets into traditional corporate structures. For investors, this saga emphasizes the need for thorough due diligence. Don’t just look at a company’s exciting new strategy; scrutinize the risks, read the fine print in financial disclosures, and understand the potential downsides. The allure of high returns often comes with equally high risks, and companies have a legal and ethical obligation to make those risks clear. A Precedent-Setting Case? As the July 15 deadline approaches and the legal teams prepare for consolidation, the crypto world watches with bated breath. The outcome of these Strategy Bitcoin lawsuits could set a significant precedent for how publicly traded companies handle and disclose their cryptocurrency investments. It could influence future accounting standards, regulatory guidelines, and the overall appetite of corporate treasuries for digital assets. Whether Strategy emerges from this legal battle relatively unscathed or faces substantial penalties, one thing is clear: the era of corporate Bitcoin adoption is entering a new, more scrutinized phase.

For those invested in cryptocurrencies and digital assets, the authenticity of online interactions and the security of personal data are not just concerns, but foundational pillars of trust. The rise of sophisticated deepfakes, capable of mimicking voices, faces, and mannerisms with startling accuracy, poses an unprecedented threat to this trust. Imagine a world where your digital persona could be weaponized against you, creating fake endorsements or spreading misinformation. This alarming prospect underscores the urgency for robust legal frameworks, and Denmark is stepping up to lead the charge. Denmark’s Pioneering Stance on Deepfake Regulation Denmark is on the cusp of implementing a landmark legal change designed to give its citizens unprecedented control over their own digital likeness. The Danish government is actively working to amend existing copyright law, granting individuals explicit rights to their own body, facial features, and voice. This move represents a significant shift in how personal identity is protected in the age of advanced artificial intelligence. This groundbreaking initiative is specifically tailored to strengthen protections against the malicious creation and dissemination of deepfakes. According to reports from The Guardian, Denmark’s department of culture is preparing to submit a formal proposal to amend current legislation. What makes this effort particularly strong is the already secured cross-party support, indicating a unified national commitment to safeguarding individual rights against emerging digital threats. Jakob Engel-Schmidt, the Danish culture minister, articulated the core philosophy behind this legislative push, stating, “In the bill we agree and are sending an unequivocal message that everybody has the right to their own body, their own voice and their own facial features, which is apparently not how the current law is protecting people against generative AI.” This statement highlights a crucial recognition: traditional laws were simply not designed to contend with the complexities introduced by modern AI technologies. The Rise of Generative AI and the Urgent Need for Safeguards The rapid advancement of generative AI has brought about incredible innovations, from creating stunning digital art to assisting in scientific research. However, with this power comes a significant potential for misuse, particularly in the realm of deepfakes. These AI-generated fabrications can be used for: Misinformation Campaigns: Creating fake videos of politicians or public figures making false statements, capable of swaying public opinion and destabilizing democracies. Financial Fraud: Impersonating individuals to gain access to sensitive information or conduct unauthorized transactions, posing a direct threat to digital asset holders. Reputational Damage: Producing fabricated content that damages a person’s image or career, often without their consent. Non-Consensual Content: Generating explicit material featuring individuals without their permission, leading to severe personal distress and privacy violations. The ease with which deepfakes can be created and spread necessitates a proactive legal response. Current laws often struggle to categorize and prosecute these new forms of digital harm, leaving individuals vulnerable. Denmark’s approach seeks to address this by establishing a fundamental right that empowers individuals to control their own digital representations, moving beyond reactive measures to preventative legal frameworks. A Global Look: Denmark’s Approach vs. US AI Copyright Efforts While Denmark is forging a path with a comprehensive, fundamental rights-based approach, other nations, like the United States, have adopted more piecemeal strategies. In the U.S., several states have enacted their own deepfake laws, primarily focusing on specific misuse cases such as: Misinformation during elections. The creation and dissemination of non-consensual sexually explicit content. However, these state-level efforts face significant challenges. A proposed budget reconciliation bill in the U.S. Congress could potentially strip states of their power to regulate AI for a decade. This preemption would create a regulatory vacuum, leaving citizens exposed to the very harms that state laws aimed to mitigate. This stark contrast highlights the different philosophies in addressing the complex issue of AI copyright and digital impersonation. Feature Denmark’s Proposed Law United States (Current State Laws) Scope of Protection Body, facial features, voice (comprehensive personal attributes) Mainly elections, non-consensual sexually explicit content (specific use cases) Legal Mechanism Amendment to existing copyright law State-level statutes, often criminal or civil penalties Approach Proactive, fundamental right to personal attributes Reactive, addressing specific harms post-facto Federal Intervention Risk Low (national initiative) High (potential preemption by new budget reconciliation bill) Securing Your Digital Identity Protection in the AI Era The Danish initiative offers a compelling model for global digital identity protection . By establishing a clear right to one’s own features, it empowers individuals in an increasingly digitized world. This is particularly relevant for the cryptocurrency community, where identity verification and protection against impersonation are critical for secure transactions and participation in decentralized ecosystems. Benefits of such a law include: Empowerment: Individuals gain legal recourse against unauthorized use of their digital likeness. Trust: Fosters greater trust in digital content and online interactions by creating accountability for deepfake creators. Precedent: Sets a strong international precedent for other nations to follow, pushing for more robust global AI governance. However, implementing such a law is not without its challenges. Defining the precise scope of “facial features” or “voice” in a legal context can be complex. Enforcement across international borders, especially when deepfakes originate from different jurisdictions, will also require innovative solutions and international cooperation. Despite these hurdles, Denmark’s proactive stance represents a vital step towards ensuring that human dignity and rights are upheld in the face of rapidly advancing technology. A Blueprint for the Future? Denmark’s proposed law is more than just a national regulation; it’s a potential blueprint for how societies can adapt to the profound implications of generative AI . As AI capabilities continue to expand, the need for clear ethical guidelines and legal frameworks becomes ever more pressing. This pioneering legislation could inspire other countries to adopt similar measures, leading to a more secure and trustworthy digital environment for everyone. For the crypto and blockchain communities, where identity and authenticity are paramount, such legal advancements offer a layer of security that complements technological solutions. Protecting the fundamental right to one’s own digital self is not just about preventing harm, but about building a future where individuals retain sovereignty over their digital existence.

The SEC is also expected to drop its appeal, signaling a potential end to the high-profile lawsuit. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse shared the news in a statement on X , writing: “Ripple is dropping our cross appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they’ve previously said. We’re closing this chapter once and for all, and focusing on what’s most important – building the Internet of Value. Lock in.” The action came fewer than 24 hours after a judge, Analisa Torres, refused a joint request from the parties for an “indicative ruling” that would have allowed her to approve a revised settlement without a full appellate review. The company and the SEC have shown no sign that they want to escalate the case through the rounds of appeals; instead, both sides have referenced the judge’s suggestion that the case should end with both of them dropping their lawsuits. The XRP suit, filed by the SEC in December 2020, accused Ripple of conducting an unregistered securities offering through sales of XRP tokens. The case rapidly turned into a legal bellwether for how US regulators may treat cryptocurrencies more broadly. Ripple and SEC legal saga is nearing end Ripple’s decision to withdraw its cross-appeal follows months of fierce negotiations and a blizzard of court filings over the past year. The court had ruled in July of 2023 in a split decision that while Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP violated securities laws, the company’s programmatic sales (sales on exchanges) did not. In her written opinion, Judge Torres also said that XRP is not a security, delivering a partial victory to Ripple. However, the SEC’s rattling against the crypto industry cooled after political power in the country shifted following Donald Trump’s re-election to the Oval Office in 2024. In a warmer environment in crypto, the commission restarted discussions with Ripple about settling the case. The SEC also said it would ask the court to lift the freeze on Ripple’s ability to engage in such transactions. But Judge Torres rejected the revised settlement twice anyway — first over its procedural deficiencies, then because she believed that the parties had not proved significant “exceptional circumstances” that would merit straying from the norm. Rather than pushing on, Ripple and the SEC allowed things to settle. XRP price pumps on legal resolution The crypto community reacted enthusiastically as news of the XRP lawsuit nearing its conclusion sparked a strong rally in the token’s price. With the SEC now using more measured language, some analysts see this as a positive indication that future regulatory actions may be less aggressive and more balanced. Legal analysts hailed the exit plan as a savvy and dignified solution to one of the most closely watched crypto cases in recent years. Ripple executives emphasized that their attention is now firmly on the road ahead. Garlinghouse reaffirmed the company’s commitment to building the Internet of Value and turning that vision into reality. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The answer might surprise you. Recent insights from Coin Bureau founder Nic Puckrin on X suggest that Bitcoin mining Iran could be a far more significant player on the global stage than many realize. Imagine a nation leveraging its abundant natural resources to power a digital revolution, all while navigating complex geopolitical currents. This revelation shines a spotlight on the intricate relationship between energy, geopolitics, and the decentralized world of cryptocurrency. The Surprising Scale of Bitcoin Mining Iran According to Nic Puckrin’s analysis, Iran may account for a substantial 3.1% of global Bitcoin mining activity. While this percentage might seem modest at first glance, it places Iran among the top contenders in the highly competitive world of cryptocurrency production. This isn’t just about individual miners; it’s a strategic national endeavor. The country reportedly capitalizes on its vast reserves of oil and gas, utilizing these cheap energy sources to fuel domestic mining operations. In some cases, this energy is even sold at highly subsidized rates to foreign operators, with Chinese entities often cited as key beneficiaries. The scale of these operations hints at a well-organized infrastructure, far beyond what casual observers might expect. It raises crucial questions about energy allocation, economic strategy, and the environmental footprint of such large-scale endeavors. Unpacking Iran Cryptocurrency Mining’s Allure What makes Iran such an attractive destination for cryptocurrency miners? The answer primarily lies in economics. The cost of electricity in Iran is remarkably low, ranging from an astonishing $0.01 to $0.05 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). To put that into perspective, the global average electricity cost for industrial use is significantly higher. This ultra-cheap energy translates directly into incredibly low operational costs for miners. Consider this: Low Production Costs: At these rates, mining a single Bitcoin could cost as little as $1,300. When compared to Bitcoin’s market price, this offers an immense profit margin, making Iran a goldmine for those with access to its energy grid. Economic Incentive: For Iran, cryptocurrency mining offers a potential pathway to generate revenue and bypass international sanctions. By converting cheap domestic energy into a globally recognized digital asset, the nation can potentially circumvent traditional financial systems. Strategic Resource Utilization: Instead of solely exporting raw oil and gas, Iran can convert a portion of its energy into a digital commodity, diversifying its economic output and potentially bolstering its financial resilience. This unique economic environment has fostered a thriving, albeit sometimes controversial, mining ecosystem within the country. The True Cost: Energy Consumption Bitcoin and State Control While the economic benefits are clear, Iran’s aggressive push into Bitcoin mining is not without its challenges and controversies. A significant concern revolves around the immense energy consumption Bitcoin mining demands. The country has faced widespread blackouts, particularly during peak demand seasons, which have been attributed in part to the surge in electricity usage by cryptocurrency miners. Furthermore, the involvement of state-affiliated entities adds another layer of complexity. Key mining operations are allegedly run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and are protected by the military. This suggests a strategic, state-backed approach to leveraging Bitcoin for national interests. However, it also leads to: Regulatory Interference: Reports suggest alleged interference with regulatory shutdowns, indicating a struggle between the need for energy stability and the state’s desire to continue mining operations. Public Discontent: The energy misuse and resultant blackouts have sparked considerable public concern and frustration, highlighting a conflict between national economic strategy and the daily lives of citizens. Geopolitical Ramifications: The state’s direct involvement in mining raises questions about the use of Bitcoin in international relations, sanctions evasion, and potential for illicit financing. The delicate balance between economic gain and societal impact is a constant tightrope walk for Iranian authorities. Beyond Borders: Understanding Middle East Crypto Dynamics Iran’s foray into large-scale Bitcoin mining isn’t an isolated incident but rather a prominent example of the broader, evolving landscape of Middle East crypto adoption. The region, rich in energy resources and often subject to complex geopolitical dynamics, presents a unique environment for the growth of digital assets. Countries across the Middle East are exploring various aspects of cryptocurrency, from central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to embracing blockchain technology for various industries. However, Iran’s approach stands out due to its direct link between state-controlled energy resources and the mining of a decentralized asset. This presents both opportunities and significant regulatory and political challenges. The Middle East’s strategic location and abundant energy make it a natural hub for energy-intensive industries like crypto mining. However, the region also grapples with: Regulatory Uncertainty: Many countries are still developing comprehensive frameworks for cryptocurrencies, leading to periods of prohibition followed by cautious acceptance. Sanctions and Compliance: For nations like Iran, the use of crypto is often viewed through the lens of sanctions evasion, complicating international relations and compliance efforts. Energy Management: Balancing the economic benefits of mining with the demands on national energy grids remains a critical challenge for all energy-rich nations considering this path. Iran’s experience offers a fascinating case study for how these factors play out in practice. The Future of Geopolitical Bitcoin : What’s Next? The narrative surrounding Iran’s significant role in Bitcoin mining underscores a critical emerging trend: the increasing intersection of cryptocurrency with national geopolitics. As nations recognize the potential of digital assets, we are likely to see more strategic maneuvering to control or influence the global hash rate. The future of geopolitical Bitcoin could involve: Energy Sovereignty: Countries with abundant and cheap energy will continue to explore cryptocurrency mining as a means of converting otherwise underutilized or undervalued resources into liquid assets. Sanctions Evasion: For sanctioned nations, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will remain a tool for circumventing traditional financial blockades, pushing the boundaries of international economic warfare. Regulatory Scrutiny: International bodies and individual governments will intensify their efforts to monitor and regulate cross-border crypto flows, especially those linked to state actors or illicit activities. Environmental Concerns: The energy footprint of Bitcoin mining will continue to be a hot-button issue, prompting debates about sustainable mining practices and the broader environmental impact of digital currencies. Iran’s situation serves as a stark reminder that Bitcoin, despite its decentralized nature, operates within a world of sovereign states, each with its own agenda and strategic imperatives. Conclusion Iran’s alleged 3.1% share of global Bitcoin mining is more than just a statistic; it’s a window into the complex interplay of energy, economics, and geopolitics in the digital age. Driven by incredibly low electricity costs and potentially backed by powerful state entities, Iran has carved out a significant, albeit controversial, niche in the Bitcoin ecosystem. While it offers a pathway for economic resilience and sanctions circumvention, it also brings forth challenges like energy misuse and regulatory clashes. As the world increasingly grapples with the implications of decentralized finance, Iran’s model serves as a potent example of how nations might leverage digital assets to reshape their economic destinies and navigate a challenging global landscape. The story of Bitcoin in Iran is far from over, and its unfolding chapters will undoubtedly offer valuable lessons for the future of global finance.

The model allows users to create and edit images with text prompts and visual inputs, capabilities meant to be on par, or even compete with leading AI developers like OpenAI and DeepSeek. QwenVLo is an improvement on Alibaba’s previous Qwen2. 5-VL baseline model and extends it to support new tasks such as text-to-image and image-to-image generation. One standout feature is that of progressive generation, which means that users can see an image as it’s being built — a level of transparency and interactivity rare in most AI tools today. “This newly upgraded model not only ‘understands’ the world but also generates high-quality recreations based on that understanding,” the company said in a blog post. The firm explained that users can generate an image by sending a prompt, such as generating a picture of a cute cat, or modify an existing image by uploading a cat photo and requesting an edit, like adding a cap on the cat’s head. Alibaba sharpens AI strategy with Qwen series The push into AI is no longer a glam-up girl for Alibaba’s e-commerce dominance. The company has been aggressively working its way into AI since early 2024. In February, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu said that the e-commerce and IT behemoth would prioritize its work on artificial general intelligence (AGI). He stressed that developing AGI had now become Alibaba’s top priority, highlighting the rising significance of AI to the company’s growth and competitive edge in the future. Alibaba has already launched a range of models under the Qwen brand, each tailored to a specific modality — text, image, video, and audio. QwenVLo replaces that mix of things and is built to perform on lower-end machines, including mobiles and personal laptops; however, unlike most state-of-the-art AI models, which still need loads of cloud computing power to run efficiently. In March 2025, Quark released a new Quark app, which included the new Qwen functionality. Now, the app operates as an AI-powered smart assistant with search, summarization, and creative tools. It demonstrates Alibaba’s desire to build AI models and weave them into consumer-facing experiences. Alibaba challenges DeepSeek and OpenAI in AI race The release of QwenVLo by Alibaba coincides with a wave of AI-related initiatives worldwide. US-founded OpenAI has released GPT-4o, its most advanced multimodal model yet, which can understand and respond with text, images, and audio. Over in China, all eyes were on DeepSeek, a homegrown startup for whom cost efficiency is fast becoming a make-or-break challenge in AI development, as it claimed to have created a large competitive language model for just a few million dollars. Tech titans all over China have since rushed out similar AI services that are faster, cheaper, and more versatile. One of its first serious entries is Alibaba’s Qwen Vlo, which has the potential to take on both its Western and Chinese competitors by delivering high-quality and low-weight multimodal functionality. The race is now more about who can build the smartest model, but who can make that intelligence usable at scale. Alibaba is betting that the types of people who use an app every day- students, designers, business owners, and developers- will flock to tools that are quick, simple to use, and optimized for various devices. However, whether Qwen VLo is something marquee names dominate the users in the market is yet to be seen. But Alibaba has hammered the message: China is not just keeping pace with the world in the race for AI supremacy — it is determined to lead it.

However, as the crypto market evolves, newer projects like Ruvi AI (RUVI) are emerging with explosive growth potential that even Bitcoin might struggle to match. Ruvi AI’s focus on utility, structured growth, and return potential has analysts predicting it could become this year’s biggest gainer. Here’s why many investors believe Ruvi AI could far outperform Bitcoin in 2025. The case for Ruvi AI’s growth potential Bitcoin has cemented its position as a secure and reliable asset, but its growth trajectory has naturally slowed over the years. With over a decade of price appreciation, Bitcoin’s market cap presents high barriers for significant percentage increases. On the other hand, Ruvi AI is at the start of its growth curve, offering investors an incredible return potential through its value-driven approach. Ruvi AI combines blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to solve real-world problems across industries like marketing, entertainment, and finance. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily functions as a store of value, RUVI tokens serve practical, high-demand applications, creating tangible value. Adding to its appeal, Ruvi AI offers a structured growth model designed for rapid price increases. Currently priced at just $0.015 in Phase 2 of its presale, RUVI tokens are guaranteed to rise in value to $0.07 after the presale, delivering a nearly 5x return right out of the gate. Analysts predict the token could reach $1 post-listing, equating to a 66x ROI for early investors. This impressive growth potential is light years ahead of what Bitcoin can realistically offer in the coming years. Ruvi AI’s early success proves its appeal Ruvi AI’s presale performance demonstrates its viability and appeal to investors looking for high-growth opportunities. Key milestones include: Raising $2 million in presale funding. Selling over 165 million tokens, highlighting robust early demand. Attracting more than 1,600 holders, signaling widespread interest and adoption. The guaranteed $0.07 price post-presale provides a built-in safety net for investors while amplifying confidence in the token’s structured development. VIP tiers reward early investors with more gains For those seeking to maximize their returns, Ruvi AI offers VIP investment tiers with substantial token bonuses.

Ripple-SEC Settlement Stalled After Court Rejection The Ripple-SEC case seemed to be moving forward after both parties agreed on a reduced $50 million settlement, but the joint motion for an indicative ruling has now been rejected in court. According to the filing shared by defense lawyer James K. Filian in an X post, the two haven’t “come close” to showing exceptional circumstances outweighing public interest or the administration of justice that would justify modifying the judgment. This means that the original fine of $125 million still stands for Ripple. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binance Open Interest Shoots Up: Warning For BTC? Following the news, XRP has taken a bearish hit to its price, as the below chart displays. The asset was trading around $2.15 at the time the news broke out, but it has since fallen below $2.09, implying a decrease of around 3%. Naturally, this reaction is quite mild by the cryptocurrency sector’s standards, but could still suggest some panic selling. Sentiment among the retail crowd, however, has seen a surprising jump, as per social media data. XRP Sentiment On Social Media Has Seen A Bullish Jump In a new post on X, the analytics firm Santiment has talked about how the social media users have responded to news of the Ripple-SEC case stalling. The indicator shared by Santiment is the “Positive/Negative Sentiment,” gauging the ratio between positive and negative comments involving a given coin on the major social media platforms. The indicator separates between positive and negative posts/threads/messages on the platforms using a machine-learning model and determines how the counts of the two compare. Here is a chart that shows the latest trend in the metric for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP: As displayed in the above graph, the Positive/Negative Sentiment is currently above the 1 mark for all three of these cryptocurrencies, indicating that posts pertaining to bullish sentiment outweigh the bearish ones. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests $108,000, But Holders Disagree On Direction For Bitcoin and Ethereum, however, the positive comments only have a slight advantage, meaning that while optimism does exist among the crowd, it’s quite mild. From the chart, it’s visible that XRP has diverged from these assets with a sharp spike, which has taken its Positive/Negative Sentiment to a value of 2.1. This is the highest level for the cryptocurrency in 17 days and corresponds to there being more than double as many bullish calls as bearish ones. Often, retail sentiment acts as a contrarian signal, with extreme values in either direction leading to some sort of reversal in the price. As such, while this development in crowd mentality could potentially imply investors aren’t worried about the news, the indicator could still be to keep an eye on.

The buzz around a potential altcoin rally is growing louder, and for good reason. Recent insights from a prominent analyst suggest that the stage might be set for a significant uptrend in altcoin prices, driven by a crucial on-chain metric: exchange flows. If history is any guide, this could be the signal many investors have been waiting for to witness an exciting surge across the altcoin landscape. Understanding Crypto Exchange Flows: What Are They Telling Us? When we talk about crypto exchange flows , we’re referring to the movement of cryptocurrencies into and out of centralized exchanges. These movements offer valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future price action. High inflows often suggest selling pressure, as investors move assets to exchanges to sell them. Conversely, high outflows can indicate accumulation, as investors withdraw assets to hold them in private wallets, signaling a long-term bullish outlook. CryptoQuant Analyst Axel Adler Jr. recently highlighted a fascinating trend on X. He noted that the monthly inflows and outflows of altcoins from major cryptocurrency exchanges have been recorded at a mere $1.6 billion. This figure stands notably below the annual average of $2.5 billion. What does this moderate flow rate signify? According to Adler Jr., it points towards a clear pattern of asset consolidation. Consider these key takeaways: Reduced Selling Pressure: Lower inflows mean fewer altcoins are being sent to exchanges for immediate sale. Increased Holding Behavior: Lower outflows suggest investors are not rushing to sell their holdings, opting instead to keep them off exchanges. Supply Shock Potential: As fewer coins are available for immediate sale on exchanges, any significant buying pressure could lead to a rapid price increase due to limited supply. This dynamic creates an environment where growing accumulation potential becomes evident. When smart money and retail investors alike begin to quietly accumulate assets off exchanges, it often precedes a significant market move. Is Altcoin Accumulation Setting the Stage for a Boom? The concept of altcoin accumulation is central to Adler Jr.’s thesis. When market participants are withdrawing their altcoins from exchanges and holding them in cold storage or private wallets, it suggests a strong belief in the future value of these assets. This behavior indicates a shift from short-term trading to long-term investment strategies. Why is this important for an altcoin rally? Imagine a scenario where a significant portion of a cryptocurrency’s circulating supply is held off exchanges. This creates a reduced supply on the open market. If demand for that altcoin suddenly increases, there are fewer sellers willing to part with their assets at current prices. This imbalance between supply and demand naturally pushes prices upward. It’s a classic economic principle at play in the digital asset space. Adler Jr.’s analysis of previous market data strongly supports this view. He explicitly states that “low exchange flows preceded significant altcoin price rallies.” This historical correlation is a powerful indicator, suggesting that the current market conditions might be mirroring past cycles that led to substantial gains for altcoin holders. While past performance is not indicative of future results, understanding these patterns can offer valuable context for current trends. What Does a Significant Altcoin Rally Look Like? The term “ altcoin rally ” evokes images of rapid, often exponential, price increases across a broad spectrum of alternative cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin often leads the market, altcoin rallies are typically characterized by money flowing from Bitcoin into various altcoins, or new capital entering the broader crypto market and diversifying into these assets. Historically, significant altcoin rallies have shared common characteristics: Broad Participation: Not just a few altcoins pump, but many projects across different sectors (DeFi, NFTs, Layer 1s, gaming) experience notable gains. Increased Trading Volume: As prices rise, trading activity surges, indicating heightened investor interest and liquidity. Renewed Market Optimism: A general sense of euphoria and positive sentiment pervades the market, often attracting new retail investors. Narrative-Driven Pumps: Specific narratives or technological advancements often fuel interest in particular altcoins, leading to concentrated pumps. The current low exchange flows could be seen as the quiet period before such an explosion of activity. It’s the calm before the potential storm of buying pressure and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) that characterizes a strong bull run. In-Depth Market Analysis: What Else to Consider? While low exchange flows are a compelling indicator, a comprehensive market analysis involves looking at multiple factors. No single metric tells the whole story, and a holistic view is always recommended for making informed decisions. Other key indicators and considerations include: Bitcoin Dominance: A declining Bitcoin dominance often signals an altcoin season, as capital rotates from BTC into altcoins. Macroeconomic Environment: Global economic conditions, interest rates, and inflation can influence investor appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. On-Chain Metrics (beyond flows): Look at active addresses, transaction counts, and network growth for individual altcoins to gauge organic adoption. Development Activity: Projects with consistent development, new features, and strong community engagement tend to perform better long-term. Regulatory Landscape: Evolving regulations can impact investor confidence and market sentiment. Adler Jr.’s observation serves as a powerful piece of the puzzle, but savvy investors will always cross-reference it with other data points to build a robust investment thesis. This multi-faceted approach helps in identifying both opportunities and potential risks in a volatile market. Crafting Your Crypto Price Prediction Strategy: Actionable Insights Given the potential for an altcoin price prediction that points upward, what actionable steps can investors consider? It’s crucial to approach the market with a well-thought-out strategy, especially when anticipating significant price movements. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While the overall market sentiment might be bullish, not all altcoins will perform equally. Research individual projects, their use cases, teams, and tokenomics. Diversify Your Portfolio: Instead of putting all your eggs in one basket, consider spreading your investment across a few promising altcoins in different sectors. Stagger Your Entries: If you believe an altcoin rally is imminent, consider dollar-cost averaging into your chosen assets rather than making a single large purchase. This helps mitigate risk if prices dip before a major ascent. Set Realistic Expectations: While rallies can be exciting, they are often followed by corrections. Have a profit-taking strategy in mind. Risk Management is Key: Only invest what you can afford to lose. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and even strong signals can sometimes be invalidated by unforeseen events. The current low exchange flows suggest a period of quiet accumulation. For those who are patient and strategic, this phase could present an opportune moment to position themselves for potential future gains. Staying informed and disciplined will be your greatest assets. Conclusion: Are Altcoins on the Cusp of a Breakthrough? The analysis from CryptoQuant’s Axel Adler Jr. provides a compelling narrative for a potential altcoin rally . The observed low crypto exchange flows , significantly below the annual average, strongly indicate a period of quiet altcoin accumulation . Historically, such conditions have often been precursors to substantial price surges, offering a glimmer of hope for investors eager to see their portfolios grow. While no crypto price prediction is foolproof, the confluence of reduced selling pressure and increased holding behavior paints a bullish picture. As we continue to monitor the market, integrating this valuable insight from market analysis with other on-chain and macroeconomic indicators will be key. The stage appears to be set for altcoins to potentially shine, rewarding those who have been patiently accumulating and holding. Keep a close eye on these trends, as the coming months could prove to be incredibly dynamic for the altcoin space.

Many fade away after the hype, leaving users unsure of real value. But some stand out. The best altcoins to watch in 2025 are not built on empty promises. Instead, they deliver strong utility and encourage hands-on engagement. In this piece, you will learn about 5 standout projects: BlockDAG, TAO, ONDO, NEAR, and FET. Each one has built systems that reward true participation. Whether through structured airdrops, useful blockchain tools, or smart integrations, these altcoins are making real contributions to the space. Keep reading to see why these are the best altcoins to watch for anyone interested in long-term, practical crypto ecosystems. 1. BlockDAG: Utility-Based Airdrop Driving Real Blockchain Engagement BlockDAG leads the list of the best altcoins to watch by offering a utility-based airdrop that promotes real engagement. Instead of giving away coins for social media tasks, BlockDAG (BDAG) asks users to interact with its testnet ecosystem. People can earn rewards by deploying smart contracts, minting NFTs, using the wallet, and exploring the blockchain explorer. This creates a deeper understanding of how the system works before the mainnet launch. The goal is clear: not just to attract attention but to build a strong and knowledgeable community. This process also helps the team fix bugs and improve performance. The result is a win-win: users get early rewards, and BlockDAG builds a better system. So far, BlockDAG has raised $324 million. More than 23.3 billion coins have been sold, with a return of 2,660% for those who joined in batch 1. Now in batch 29, the price is $0.0276. A special offer lets new users join at just $0.0030, though this will soon rise to $0.0080 in less than 12 hours. With this smart airdrop campaign, BlockDAG is proving why it is one of the best altcoins to watch in 2025. 2. TAO: Supporting AI With Rewarded Contributions TAO fuels the Bittensor network, a decentralized platform for machine learning. Unlike many coins that reward passive holders, TAO gives rewards based on work. Users must run validator nodes or provide machine learning models to the system. This method ties rewards directly to contributions that help the network grow. It reflects the same principles seen in BlockDAG, encouraging real participation. As the world of AI and blockchain continues to expand, TAO’s focus on technical involvement ensures it remains among the best altcoins to watch for long-term use. 3. Ondo Finance: Connecting Real-World Assets to DeFi Ondo Finance links tokenized real-world assets, such as US Treasuries, to the world of DeFi. Through its ONDO coin, users are rewarded for providing liquidity to products like tokenized bonds. This isn’t about empty rewards; it’s about driving meaningful financial activity. Airdrops and rewards serve to support real liquidity rather than act as mere promotions. This practical approach places ONDO alongside BlockDAG among the best altcoins to watch in 2025. Its work with major platforms further strengthens its role in creating real-world utility for blockchain. 4. NEAR Protocol: Encouraging Builders and Users NEAR Protocol takes a developer-first approach to its token allocation. It holds hackathons, grants, and testnet challenges where participants earn rewards for building. These activities push real engagement, whether through smart contract deployment, app creation, or network governance. NEAR’s focus on rewarding true contributions mirrors BlockDAG’s vision. That’s why NEAR is one of the best altcoins to watch this year, as it continues to build an active and useful ecosystem. 5. Fetch.ai (FET): AI Agents Bringing Utility to Blockchain Fetch.ai runs a network of decentralized AI agents that complete tasks across areas like transport, finance, and logistics. FET coins are earned by running agent nodes, training AI models, and sharing data. This system transforms users into active players rather than passive holders. Like BlockDAG’s structured rewards, Fetch.ai encourages work that supports real technical progress. As AI grows more connected to blockchain, FET remains one of the best altcoins to watch for its clear, applied value. Final Thoughts Today, airdrops are no longer about quick promotions. They are becoming structured tools that help users learn and grow with the blockchain. The best altcoins to watch this year, BlockDAG, TAO, ONDO, NEAR, and FET, are each offering meaningful ways for people to take part in their ecosystems. Through real work and useful contributions, they show where the future of blockchain is heading. BlockDAG’s interactive approach stands out, but each project is helping shift crypto from hype to true purpose. If you are looking for coins with lasting value, these are some of the best altcoins to watch in 2025.

A compelling new partnership is set to redefine how we interact with stablecoins, promising exciting developments for the entire ecosystem. This isn’t just another collaboration; it’s a strategic move designed to amplify the utility and reach of a specific asset, potentially paving the way for broader adoption and innovation. Get ready to dive into the details of how a new USD1 stablecoin vault is making waves. World Liberty Financial and its Vision for Decentralized Finance In a groundbreaking move that’s capturing attention across the crypto landscape, World Liberty Financial , a DeFi protocol with notable associations, is stepping forward to expand its footprint in the decentralized finance space. Their latest initiative marks a pivotal moment, showcasing a clear intent to foster growth and accessibility within the digital asset economy. This protocol is not just participating; it’s aiming to lead by creating innovative solutions that cater to the evolving needs of the DeFi community. This strategic push by World Liberty Financial underscores a broader trend within DeFi: the continuous pursuit of robust, user-friendly financial tools that bridge traditional finance with the decentralized world. By focusing on a stablecoin vault, they are addressing a fundamental need for stability and liquidity, essential components for any thriving financial ecosystem. Unlocking Potential with the USD1 Stablecoin Vault At the heart of this exciting partnership lies the launch of a dedicated USD1 stablecoin vault. But what exactly is USD1, and how will this new vault function to benefit users? USD1 is designed to be a stable digital asset, pegged to the value of the US dollar, offering a reliable store of value and a medium of exchange within the volatile crypto markets. The new vault aims to provide a secure and efficient way for users to engage with USD1, making it more accessible and liquid across various platforms. The vault will be deployed on two prominent lending platforms: Euler and Lista. This multi-platform approach is crucial for maximizing reach and interoperability. Here’s a quick look at how it works: Enhanced Liquidity: By integrating with Euler and Lista, the vault will provide deep liquidity for USD1, allowing users to easily lend, borrow, and trade the stablecoin. Yield Opportunities: Participants will have opportunities to earn yield on their USD1 holdings by depositing them into the vault on these lending platforms. Cross-Platform Accessibility: The dual launch ensures that users across different segments of the DeFi ecosystem can access and utilize USD1. This initiative is a clear signal of the growing sophistication and integration within the stablecoin market, moving beyond simple issuance to creating complex financial instruments that drive utility. Re7 Labs: Fueling Innovation and Expanding Reach The strategic partner in this venture is Re7 Labs , a key player whose recent achievements highlight their growing influence in the crypto space. Re7 Labs recently secured substantial funding, up to $10 million from Hong Kong’s VMS Group, marking a significant entry point for traditional finance into the digital asset realm. This investment not only validates Re7 Labs’ vision but also provides the capital necessary to execute ambitious projects like the USD1 stablecoin vault. Re7 Labs’ expertise in blockchain technology and its commitment to fostering robust decentralized solutions make them an ideal partner for World Liberty Financial. Their role extends beyond mere technical implementation; they are instrumental in strategizing the expansion of USD1 adoption, particularly across the dynamic BNB Chain. This collaboration leverages Re7 Labs’ technical prowess and financial backing to bring a high-impact product to market. Driving DeFi Adoption Across the BNB Chain Ecosystem The choice of BNB Chain as the primary platform for this initiative is no coincidence. BNB Chain has emerged as a leading blockchain for decentralized applications, known for its high transaction speed, low fees, and a rapidly expanding ecosystem. The launch of the USD1 stablecoin vault on BNB Chain is strategically designed to: Boost Stablecoin Utility: Provide BNB Chain users with another robust and reliable stablecoin option for various DeFi activities. Attract New Users: Lure more users to the BNB Chain ecosystem by offering compelling yield opportunities and enhanced liquidity for USD1. Foster Interoperability: Strengthen the connection between different DeFi protocols on BNB Chain, creating a more interconnected and efficient financial landscape. This move is expected to significantly contribute to the overall growth and maturity of the DeFi sector on BNB Chain, making it an even more attractive destination for developers and users alike. What Does This Mean for the Broader DeFi Protocol Landscape? The partnership between World Liberty Financial and Re7 Labs, coupled with the launch of the USD1 stablecoin vault, holds significant implications for the broader DeFi protocol landscape.

The latest economic data from the United States has sent ripples, particularly through the volatile crypto market. The recent surge in PCE Inflation has not only surpassed expectations but also ignited fresh concerns about the health of the US Economy . For anyone holding digital assets, understanding these shifts is crucial. Let’s unpack what this means for your investments, especially the unpredictable Bitcoin Price , and the broader Crypto Market . Understanding PCE Inflation: Why It Matters to the US Economy When economists and central bankers talk about inflation, they often look at several metrics. Among them, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index holds significant weight, especially for the U.S. Federal Reserve. Unlike the more commonly cited Consumer Price Index (CPI), the PCE index captures a broader range of goods and services, and it adjusts for changes in consumer behavior, making it a more comprehensive gauge of inflation for policymakers. The core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is particularly scrutinized because it offers a clearer picture of underlying inflationary trends. A rise in core PCE Inflation suggests that price increases are becoming more entrenched across various sectors of the US Economy , not just driven by temporary spikes in specific commodities. This makes the recent data a critical indicator for future monetary policy decisions and overall economic stability. The Shocking Rise: What the 0.2% Core PCE Data Means The latest report indicates that U.S. core PCE inflation rose by 0.2% in May compared to the previous month. While this might seem like a small number, it significantly exceeded the market’s forecast of a 0.1% increase. This unexpected jump signals that inflationary pressures are not subsiding as quickly as many had hoped, challenging the narrative of a smooth path back to the Federal Reserve’s target inflation rate. For context, even a slight deviation from forecasts in key economic data can trigger substantial market reactions. A higher-than-expected PCE Inflation figure suggests that the Federal Reserve might need to maintain its hawkish stance for longer, potentially keeping interest rates higher or delaying anticipated cuts. This has direct implications for borrowing costs, corporate earnings, and investor sentiment across all asset classes, including the Crypto Market . Bitcoin Price and Gold’s Plunge: A Direct Reaction to Economic Shifts? Following the release of the PCE data, the financial markets responded swiftly. While the Nasdaq 100 index continued its ascent, breaking new all-time highs, both Bitcoin and gold experienced a notable decline, falling by approximately 2% on June 27. This divergence highlights the complex interplay between traditional markets and digital assets in the current economic climate. Why did the Bitcoin Price dip alongside gold, traditionally a safe-haven asset, while tech stocks soared? The answer lies in the perceived implications of persistent inflation. Higher inflation, especially when accompanied by strong economic growth (as indicated by the Nasdaq’s performance), can lead to expectations of tighter monetary policy. This environment often favors growth stocks (which benefit from a strong economy) but can be detrimental to assets like Bitcoin and gold, which are often seen as inflation hedges or alternative stores of value. When real yields rise due to higher interest rate expectations, the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold and Bitcoin increases, making them less attractive to investors. The recent Bitcoin Price action underscores its growing sensitivity to macro-economic indicators. Decoding Stagflation Risk: Is the US Economy Heading for Trouble? Perhaps one of the most concerning takeaways from the recent PCE data, as highlighted by CoinDesk, is the added strength it lends to the view that the US Economy might be heading towards Stagflation Risk . But what exactly is stagflation? Stagflation is an economic condition characterized by slow economic growth (stagnation), high unemployment, and rising prices (inflation). It’s a challenging scenario for policymakers because traditional tools used to combat inflation (raising interest rates) can worsen economic stagnation, while tools to boost growth (lowering interest rates) can exacerbate inflation. The current situation presents a worrying cocktail: persistent inflation (as shown by PCE), coupled with signs of slowing growth in certain sectors or potential future economic weakness. If the U.S. economy continues to experience inflation above target while growth falters, the specter of Stagflation Risk becomes more real. This would present a significant challenge for the Federal Reserve and could have profound long-term implications for all financial markets, including the nascent Crypto Market . Navigating the Crypto Market: Strategies Amidst Inflationary Pressures For cryptocurrency investors, understanding these macroeconomic currents is paramount. The traditional narrative of Bitcoin as a pure inflation hedge is being tested as its correlation with broader risk assets sometimes outweighs its ‘digital gold’ properties. Here are some actionable insights for navigating the Crypto Market : Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While Bitcoin remains dominant, explore other digital assets that might offer different risk-reward profiles or use cases. Long-Term Perspective: Volatility is inherent in crypto. Focus on the long-term fundamentals of projects rather than short-term price swings driven by macro news. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on economic data, central bank policies, and geopolitical events. These factors increasingly influence the Bitcoin Price and the entire Crypto Market . Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Implement stop-loss orders and rebalance your portfolio regularly to manage exposure. Consider Stablecoins: In times of high volatility and economic uncertainty, stablecoins can offer a temporary refuge for capital, preserving value while you assess market conditions. What’s Next for the US Economy and Digital Assets? The path forward for the US Economy is uncertain, with the persistent PCE Inflation and the growing Stagflation Risk presenting significant hurdles. The Federal Reserve’s next moves will be critical, and investors should brace for continued volatility. For the Crypto Market , this means a period of heightened sensitivity to traditional economic indicators. The narrative around digital assets will continue to evolve as they mature and become more intertwined with global financial systems. While the immediate reaction saw the Bitcoin Price dip, the long-term value proposition of decentralized finance and blockchain technology remains strong. However, navigating these turbulent waters requires vigilance, adaptability, and a deep understanding of both macroeconomics and crypto fundamentals.

This week, the firm released a “Stablecoin Safety Matrix” that evaluates digital dollar tokens based on regulatory oversight and reserve quality. USDC, Agora USD (AUSD), and Usual USD (USD0) failed to meet the firm’s internal criteria and will be phased out. Anchorage urged its institutional clients to switch to Global Dollar (USDG), a rival stablecoin issued by Paxos and supported by a consortium in which Anchorage itself is a founding member. “Following our Stablecoin Safety Matrix, USDC, AUSD, and USD0 no longer satisfy Anchorage Digital’s internal criteria for long-term resilience,” Rachel Anderika, head of global operations at Anchorage, said in a statement justifying the decision. She continued to say that they specifically identified elevated concentration risks associated with the issuer structures — something they believe institutions should carefully evaluate. Stablecoin race heats up as lawmakers act and Circle defends USDC Anchorage’s move comes amid a flurry of activity in the stablecoin world. Financial giants and crypto firms are vying for dominance in the $250 billion market, which Citi and Standard Chartered analysts predict could grow to the trillions. Nordic lawmakers are trying to give stablecoin issuers regulatory accommodation as well. Recent developments came from the GENIUS Act, which the US Senate passed. White House crypto policy lead David Sacks has said the bill may become law by next month. Despite Anchorage’s move, other stablecoin evaluators remain favorable toward USDC. S&P Global recently gave USDC a “strong” stability rating. The crypto-native ratings firm Bluechip gave it a B+ in economic safety. Circle, which issues USDC , pushed back on Anchorage’s claims, defending its “long-standing compliance record” and full backing by fiat reserves. “We were the first stablecoin issuer to comply fully with the EU’s crypto regulations,” a spokesperson said. Industry pushes back on Anchorage Anchorage’s move has drawn sharp criticism from key players in the crypto space. Nick Van Eck, founder of Agora and the issuer of AUSD, accused the firm of spreading misinformation and failing to disclose its financial interest in USDG. Nick Van Eck said he would have understood if Anchorage had delisted USDC and AUSD to prioritize stablecoins from which it profits. However, he criticized the firm for smearing competitors under the guise of safety, calling the move unserious. Viktor Bunin of Coinbase, which co-launched USDC, also criticized Anchorage’s report and described it as a poorly executed hit piece. Jan Van Eck, CEO of asset manager Van Eck and father to Nick, mocked the company’s safety matrix and suggested it was laughable, predicting that the firm might soon take it down. Circle reiterated that regulated institutions back USDC and maintain robust liquidity and transparency. Other custodians also supported USDC and AUSD. BitGo’s chief revenue officer, Chen Fang, said the company was not ceasing support for USDC. Agora and Circle are longtime partners in AUSD, and Joshua Lim, co-head of markets at FalconX, said the firm can accommodate the needs of clients trading AUSD and USDC. While Anchorage moves forward with its stablecoin revamp, it may face increased scrutiny of its motives and transparency. The stablecoin wars are not over — and trust, it seems, is the true currency at play.

With impressive upside forecasts, this new project is sending waves throughout the crypto market. Investors have been observed pouring capital into the presale, with the rate going up, based on recent on-chain activity. PEPE In The Headlines As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Soars Following the recent ceasefire announcement in the Middle East, the crypto market is on fire again. Newbies have been rushing to buy PEPE, even as serious investors look for better sources of long-term gains. One of their best options this month is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is currently in phase 5 of its presale. Tokens in the current phase are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. The process of gradual price increments is expected to continue until the final listing price of $0.06. So far, over $11.2 million has been raised from around 12,450 buyers. At the current price of $0.03, buyers in the presale are getting their MUTM tokens at a 50% discount. That is a massive opportunity that you should not let pass you by. So far, investors have capitalized on this opportunity, and 50% of the tokens for the phase have already sold out, less than a month after they were launched. Consequently, the window to get your tokens at a 50% discount is fast closing. A major driver of the current pace of the presale is the partnership between Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and CertiK. The two will partner on a bug bounty program that will offer $50,000 in rewards to security experts, developers, and researchers. The program is split into four tiers, which are critical, major, minor, and low, based on the severity of the vulnerability. The bug bounty program with CertiK comes after Mutuum Finance (MUTM) already received a CertiK Token Scan Score of 95. It signals the team’s commitment to continued security for its users. Its goal is to create the safest trading platform for everyone in the DeFi world. Due to this massive partnership with CertiK, the analysts have recently raised their forecasts for MUTM tokens. According to the latest projections, the price of MUTM tokens could rise by 24x once they go live. Based on that forecast, a $1,300 investment in the presale could net you over $31,000. However, there is no maximum cap on how much you can invest; this could be your biggest gainer for your crypto portfolio in 2025. The Protocol Design Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built as a non-custodial DeFi protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders supply liquidity into the pools and receive interest payments in return. Borrowers, on the other hand, supply overcollateralized collateral to access the liquidity in the communal pools. The interest rates for both lenders and borrowers are determined by a pool’s utilization rate. As the proportion of loans taken by borrowers rises, it pushes the interest rates higher. For instance, if a lender deposits $10,000 worth of USDC in a pool, the utilization could start rising, since USDC is a high-demand asset. That could push their annual percentage yield from 9% to 15%. In such a case, they could receive $1,500 on their deposit per year. This is a great strategy to make a reliable income in the crypto sector. It does not require any access to advanced charting tools or advanced crypto trading strategies. For investors to grow their wealth sustainably, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be a major draw. To support the price of MUTM tokens, which is essential to the overall growth of the ecosystem, the team will implement a buy-back-and-distribute program. Under this program, protocol revenue will be used to purchase MUTM tokens off the open market and distribute them to stakers in the safety module. That will have the effect of boosting the price of MUTM tokens while also encouraging more people to participate in the protocol, boosting its total user base. This will lead to a positive cycle of revenue growth and MUTM token purchases, ensuring the MUTM tokens’ value will continue to rise sustainably. To protect the overall solvency of the ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will engage in extensive asset screening. Depending on the unique qualities of each asset, the team may take various actions, including caps and restrictions. Caps will ensure that in case the price of an asset experiences a rapid shift, it does not have an outsized impact on the stability of the ecosystem. Additionally, the team could restrict some assets when they detect problems with their price data oracle. Summary: MUTM Tokens Are A Hidden Gem Of Summer 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an exciting DeFi project that could deliver explosive returns for your portfolio. With tokens currently available at a massive 50% discount, coupled with the protocol design that will ensure sustained growth in their price, this is one opportunity you cannot afford to miss.

For those invested in cryptocurrencies, understanding these global shifts is paramount. A recent statement from former U.S. President Donald Trump regarding Iran uranium enrichment has sent a clear message, one that could significantly impact not just traditional markets but also the volatile crypto landscape. How might the threat of renewed conflict in the Middle East reshape investor sentiment and market trends? Understanding the Warning: What Does “Another Strike” Mean for US Iran Relations? During a press conference at the White House, former President Donald Trump issued a stern warning: if Iran attempts to enrich uranium again, the United States will consider another strike. This statement, initially reported by the Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, immediately reignited discussions about the delicate and often volatile relationship between Washington and Tehran. The phrase “another strike” refers to previous military actions or threats of action taken by the U.S. against Iranian targets or proxies, particularly during Trump’s previous term. The context of this warning is crucial. Iran’s nuclear program has been a point of international contention for decades. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), often called the Iran nuclear deal, aimed to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions in exchange for sanctions relief. However, the Trump administration withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018, re-imposing stringent sanctions. In response, Iran gradually scaled back its commitments under the deal, increasing its uranium enrichment levels and stockpiles beyond the limits set by the agreement. This escalation has been a constant source of tension. When leaders speak of military action, even as a consideration, markets listen. For crypto investors, this isn’t just about geopolitics; it’s about potential shifts in market volatility, commodity prices, and investor flight to perceived safe havens. The implications of such a development can ripple through global economies, affecting everything from oil prices to supply chains, and ultimately influencing the broader financial ecosystem where digital assets operate. The History of Iran Uranium Enrichment: A Persistent Global Concern Iran’s pursuit of uranium enrichment has been a central element of its nuclear program and a primary concern for the international community. Uranium enrichment is a process that increases the concentration of uranium-235, the fissile isotope necessary for nuclear reactors and, at higher levels, nuclear weapons. Here’s a brief overview: Early 2000s: Iran’s clandestine enrichment activities were exposed, leading to international sanctions and diplomatic efforts. 2015 JCPOA: The landmark agreement limited Iran’s enrichment capacity, purity levels (to 3.67%), and stockpile size, ensuring a “breakout time” of at least a year for nuclear weapons development. 2018 U.S. Withdrawal: The Trump administration’s exit from the JCPOA and re-imposition of sanctions led Iran to gradually exceed the enrichment limits. Current Status: Iran has enriched uranium to levels far beyond the JCPOA limit, reaching 60% purity, a significant step closer to weapons-grade (90%). Its stockpile has also grown considerably. Each step Iran takes in increasing its enrichment levels heightens concerns in Washington, Jerusalem, and Riyadh. The latest warning from Trump underscores the continued U.S. stance that such advancements are unacceptable and could provoke a military response. This situation creates a climate of uncertainty, which can be particularly unsettling for risk assets like cryptocurrencies, as investors often seek stability during times of crisis. Navigating Strained US Iran Relations: A Tightrope Walk The relationship between the United States and Iran has been fraught with tension for decades, marked by periods of confrontation and sporadic attempts at diplomacy. Trump’s recent statement is a reminder of the fragility of this dynamic. Key aspects of this strained relationship include: Sanctions Regime: The U.S. has maintained a robust sanctions program against Iran, targeting its oil exports, financial institutions, and key industries. These sanctions aim to pressure Iran to alter its nuclear program and regional behavior. Regional Proxy Conflicts: Both nations support opposing sides in various Middle Eastern conflicts, including in Yemen, Syria, and Iraq, leading to indirect confrontations. Direct Confrontations: Incidents like the 2020 assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani by a U.S. drone strike and subsequent Iranian missile attacks on U.S. bases have brought the two nations to the brink of direct conflict. Nuclear Diplomacy Stalemate: Efforts to revive the JCPOA have largely stalled, leaving the nuclear issue unresolved and contributing to ongoing tensions. The prospect of “another strike” by the U.S. would represent a significant escalation, potentially leading to a broader regional conflict. This uncertainty directly impacts global economic stability. When major powers are on the cusp of military engagement, the flow of goods, energy, and capital can be severely disrupted, creating ripple effects across all financial markets. The Broader Impact: How Geopolitical Tensions Threaten Global Stability When a major power like the United States issues warnings to a strategically important nation like Iran, the implications extend far beyond their immediate borders. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have a long history of impacting global affairs, particularly in the energy sector. A military confrontation could lead to: Oil Price Spikes: The Persian Gulf is a critical waterway for global oil shipments. Any disruption, perceived or real, can cause crude oil prices to surge, leading to higher energy costs worldwide. Shipping Lane Disruptions: The Strait of Hormuz, a narrow choke point at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, is vital for global trade. Threats to shipping in this area can disrupt supply chains and increase insurance costs, impacting everything from consumer goods to industrial components. Investor Uncertainty: Heightened tensions typically lead investors to pull funds from riskier assets and seek refuge in traditional safe havens like gold, the U.S. dollar, and government bonds. This shift can cause significant outflows from equity markets and, by extension, cryptocurrencies. Regional Destabilization: A conflict could draw in other regional actors, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, potentially escalating into a wider Middle East war with devastating humanitarian and economic consequences. The interconnectedness of the global economy means that even localized conflicts can have widespread effects. For the crypto market, which is still maturing and highly sensitive to external shocks, such developments can trigger sharp price movements and shifts in investor sentiment, contributing to market volatility. Examining Global Economic Stability in the Face of Conflict The potential for conflict between the U.S. and Iran poses a direct threat to global economic stability. The Middle East is a vital region for energy supply and international trade, making any instability there a concern for economies worldwide. Here’s how such tensions can manifest economically: Economic Indicator Potential Impact of US-Iran Conflict Oil Prices Significant spikes due to supply concerns and geopolitical risk premium. Inflation Higher energy and shipping costs can fuel inflationary pressures globally. Supply Chains Disruptions to maritime routes and increased geopolitical risk can cause delays and higher costs. Consumer Confidence Decreased confidence due to economic uncertainty and potential conflict. Interest Rates Central banks might face pressure to adjust policies in response to inflation or economic slowdown. Beyond these immediate impacts, prolonged instability can deter foreign direct investment, hinder economic growth, and divert resources towards military spending, away from productive sectors. For an emerging asset class like cryptocurrencies, which often thrive on a stable and growing global economy, such disruptions can pose significant headwinds. How Does This Affect Market Volatility and Crypto? The potential for renewed U.S.-Iran conflict directly contributes to market volatility across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. While crypto markets are often influenced by their own unique drivers, they are not immune to broader macroeconomic and geopolitical currents. Here’s how heightened geopolitical risk can impact crypto: Risk-Off Sentiment: During times of global uncertainty, investors tend to move away from riskier assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies, towards perceived safe havens. This can lead to significant sell-offs in the crypto market. Correlation with Traditional Markets: While cryptocurrencies were once thought to be uncorrelated with traditional markets, recent trends show an increasing correlation, especially with tech stocks. If equities suffer due to geopolitical events, crypto often follows suit. Impact on Stablecoins: While stablecoins aim for price stability, extreme market conditions can test their peg, and their underlying reserves can be affected by broader economic downturns. Bitcoin as Digital Gold? Some proponents argue Bitcoin acts as a digital safe haven, similar to gold, during crises. While it has shown some characteristics of this in certain scenarios, its relatively young age and high volatility mean it’s not a guaranteed safe haven for all investors. Its price action during geopolitical crises can be unpredictable, sometimes rising, sometimes falling with broader market sentiment. Regulatory Scrutiny: Periods of global instability can also prompt increased scrutiny from regulators regarding capital flows and financial stability, potentially impacting the crypto industry. Investors in digital assets must remain vigilant, understanding that external geopolitical factors can exert considerable pressure on prices and sentiment. Diversification and careful risk management become even more critical during such times. Actionable Insights for Navigating Uncertainty In a world where geopolitical statements can send ripples through global markets, what can investors, especially those in the crypto space, do to prepare? Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources for updates on geopolitical developments. Understanding the nuances of situations like Iran uranium enrichment and US Iran relations is crucial. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Before making any investment decisions, honestly evaluate your comfort level with potential losses. Geopolitical events can lead to rapid and unpredictable market swings. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your eggs in one basket. While crypto offers exciting opportunities, a diversified portfolio across different asset classes (including traditional assets) can help mitigate risks during periods of market volatility. Consider Stablecoins and Fiat: During extreme uncertainty, temporarily moving a portion of your crypto holdings into stablecoins or even fiat currency can be a strategy to preserve capital. Long-Term Perspective: Avoid making rash decisions based on short-term news cycles. If your investment thesis is strong for the long term, temporary dips due to geopolitical events might present buying opportunities for those with a high risk tolerance. Understand Correlations: Be aware of how crypto markets correlate with traditional markets during crises. Sometimes they move together, sometimes they diverge. These insights are not financial advice but general guidelines to help investors approach a complex and uncertain global landscape with greater awareness. A Compelling Summary: The Enduring Shadow of Geopolitics Donald Trump’s warning regarding Iran uranium enrichment serves as a potent reminder that geopolitical events hold significant sway over global economic stability and financial markets. The intricate dance of US Iran relations, fueled by historical grievances and strategic imperatives, continues to be a major source of geopolitical tensions. While the immediate outcome of Trump’s statement remains to be seen, the underlying threat of conflict casts a long shadow, contributing to pervasive market volatility across the globe. For cryptocurrency investors, this means maintaining a heightened sense of awareness. The digital asset space, while innovative and disruptive, is increasingly intertwined with the broader macroeconomic environment. Understanding how global events, from political rhetoric to potential military actions, can impact investor sentiment and capital flows is no longer optional but essential.

MAGACOIN FINANCE Shows Strategic Setup and Strong Buyer Signals MAGACOIN FINANCE has attracted investors of all cadre, retail and institutional. It combines fixed-supply dynamics, pre-listing asymmetry, and growing market awareness. The project isn’t seeking validation through comparisons or gimmicks. Instead, it has become a strategic position in many 2025 portfolios. With increasing global uncertainty and a shifting regulatory environment, traders are searching for strong asymmetric opportunities with built-in scarcity and forward-facing design. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that mold. XRP ETF Milestones Are Turning Heads Ripple’s recent milestones have shifted the landscape of digital assets with tangible force. Canada made history by launching the first-ever spot XRP ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange, marking a major breakthrough in regulated digital asset investment. This development, backed by Ontario’s regulatory green light, signals institutional confidence and elevates XRP’s profile on the global stage. Early Investors Are Looking Beyond the Headlines Institutional validation is a powerful signal — but in crypto, early movers often shift capital before the mainstream catches up. While XRP is becoming more attractive to large funds, individual investors and high-risk portfolios are rotating toward opportunities with lower entry points and higher return asymmetry. That rotation is now beginning to spotlight MAGACOIN FINANCE — a project building momentum beneath the surface of the major headlines. What sets this project apart is not hype or narrative alone, but a visibly accelerating inflow of early interest. Analysts tracking early-stage crypto behavior are seeing MAGACOIN FINANCE picked up across research hubs and private investment channels. Previous stages sold out rapidly, and new waves of investor capital are entering without hesitation. Final Thoughts XRP’s trajectory may soon enter a new chapter with institutional inflows, ETF exposure, and enhanced regulatory clarity. Yet, amid the celebration, another story is unfolding — one that early investors believe could offer a much steeper growth curve in the short-to-mid term. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a name shared in private calls, investor briefings, and presale strategy circles. It’s not competing with XRP — it’s emerging in parallel as a powerful position for those who know the value of timing, structure, and early conviction.

46923073,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=173105,1751074809,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/46923073.jpeg,"Donald Trump’s Optimistic View: Crypto Unlocks Jobs, Bitcoin Eases Dollar Pressure",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-crypto-jobs-boost/,"BitcoinWorld Donald Trump’s Optimistic View: Crypto Unlocks Jobs, Bitcoin Eases Dollar Pressure In a surprising and significant pivot, former U.S. President Donald Trump has recently voiced a notably positive stance on cryptocurrencies, highlighting their potential to stimulate economic growth and alleviate pressure on the U.S. dollar. This marks a notable shift from his past skepticism, signaling a growing mainstream acceptance and political recognition of digital assets. His comments, reported by Odaily Planet News, emphasize crypto’s resilience during recent stock market downturns, a point that resonates with many investors looking for alternative assets in volatile times. But what exactly does this mean for the future of the financial landscape, and how does Donald Trump crypto endorsement play into this evolving narrative? The Evolving Donald Trump Crypto Stance: From Skeptic to Supporter? For years, Donald Trump was known for his cautious, if not outright critical, views on cryptocurrencies. He famously stated in 2019 that he was “not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money,” citing their volatility and potential for illicit activity. This long-held skepticism made his recent comments all the more impactful, sending ripples through the crypto community and traditional financial markets alike. His latest remarks suggest a more nuanced understanding, or at least a pragmatic acknowledgment, of the digital asset space. Trump’s assertion that cryptocurrencies “contribute to job creation” and that “Bitcoin helps reduce pressure on the U.S. dollar” indicates a shift from mere financial speculation to recognizing their broader economic utility. This change in rhetoric could be influenced by several factors: Growing Mainstream Adoption: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, have seen significant institutional adoption and retail interest, making them harder to ignore. Political Pragmatism: With a substantial portion of the younger voting demographic showing interest in crypto, adopting a more favorable stance could be a strategic political move. Economic Realities: The global economic landscape, marked by inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions, may highlight the need for diversified financial instruments. This evolving perspective from a prominent political figure could lend significant legitimacy to the crypto industry, potentially paving the way for more favorable regulatory frameworks and increased institutional investment. It transforms the conversation around digital assets from a niche tech phenomenon to a critical component of economic policy and national competitiveness. How Does Bitcoin Dollar Pressure Relief Work? One of the most intriguing aspects of Trump’s statement is the idea that Bitcoin dollar pressure relief is a tangible benefit. The U.S. dollar has long enjoyed its status as the world’s primary reserve currency, a position that grants the U.S. significant economic and geopolitical power. However, this dominance also comes with inherent pressures, including managing inflation, maintaining global confidence, and dealing with the economic fallout of international events. So, how could Bitcoin potentially alleviate some of this pressure? Here are a few ways: Diversification of Global Reserves: As nations and large institutions seek to diversify their reserves beyond traditional fiat currencies, Bitcoin offers a non-sovereign, decentralized alternative. This diversification can reduce the sole reliance on the dollar, spreading out systemic risk. Hedge Against Inflation: Bitcoin’s fixed supply (21 million coins) and programmatic issuance schedule make it a compelling hedge against inflation, especially compared to fiat currencies that can be printed at will. If global investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a reliable store of value, it could absorb some of the capital that might otherwise flow into dollar-denominated assets during inflationary periods. Alternative for International Trade: While still nascent, the potential for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to facilitate cross-border transactions could bypass traditional banking systems reliant on the dollar. This could reduce the demand for dollar liquidity in international commerce, easing some of the operational burdens on the dollar. Innovation in Financial Infrastructure: The underlying blockchain technology of Bitcoin can inspire new, more efficient financial infrastructures that are less dependent on existing dollar-centric systems, leading to a more distributed global financial network. While the dollar’s dominance is unlikely to be overthrown anytime soon, Bitcoin’s growing role as a global, digital asset certainly adds a new dimension to the international monetary system. It presents an opportunity for a more balanced global financial ecosystem, where the burden of reserve currency status is potentially shared, or at least complemented, by decentralized alternatives. Crypto Creates Jobs : A New Economic Frontier Beyond its financial implications, Trump’s emphasis on how crypto creates jobs highlights a crucial, often underestimated, aspect of the industry: its robust contribution to employment and economic development. The cryptocurrency and blockchain sector is not just about trading; it’s a burgeoning ecosystem that requires a diverse range of skills and expertise. Consider the various sectors within the crypto industry that are actively creating employment opportunities: Blockchain Development: This is the core. Developers are needed to build new protocols, smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and maintain existing blockchain networks. Roles include Solidity developers, Rust developers, core protocol engineers, and Web3 architects. Cybersecurity: Given the digital nature of assets, robust security is paramount. Cryptography experts, blockchain security auditors, and penetration testers are in high demand to protect networks and user funds. Financial Services: Crypto exchanges, lending platforms, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols require financial analysts, traders, quantitative researchers, risk managers, and compliance officers. Legal and Regulatory: As regulations evolve, there’s a growing need for legal professionals specializing in blockchain law, intellectual property, and compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) standards. Marketing and Community Management: Building and sustaining a crypto project requires strong community engagement, content creation, social media management, and strategic marketing. Mining and Infrastructure: Companies involved in Bitcoin mining, for instance, create jobs in hardware development, data center management, electrical engineering, and energy efficiency optimization. NFTs and Metaverse: The rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the metaverse has spurred demand for digital artists, game developers, virtual reality engineers, and community managers for virtual worlds. The growth of these sectors demonstrates that the crypto industry is far more than just speculative trading; it’s a legitimate economic engine fostering innovation, technological advancement, and a wide array of specialized careers. As more businesses integrate blockchain technology, the demand for these skills will only continue to grow, making crypto a significant contributor to global employment. The Complex Dance: US Dollar Bitcoin Dynamics The relationship between the US dollar Bitcoin dynamics is a fascinating study in economic evolution. For decades, the dollar has been the undisputed king of global finance, underpinning international trade, debt, and foreign exchange reserves. Bitcoin, on the other hand, emerged as a radical alternative, promising decentralization, censorship resistance, and a hedge against traditional financial systems. Initially, many saw Bitcoin as a direct competitor to the dollar, a digital gold that would eventually replace fiat currencies. While that extreme view has tempered, the interplay between the two remains complex: Aspect U.S. Dollar Bitcoin Issuance Control Centralized (Federal Reserve) Decentralized (Algorithmic) Volatility Relatively stable High volatility Global Acceptance Universal in traditional finance Growing, but not universal Inflation Hedge Subject to inflation Often seen as an inflation hedge Instead of a zero-sum game, many now view the relationship as one of co-existence and even potential synergy. Bitcoin can serve as a valuable alternative asset, a hedge against economic instability, and a tool for financial innovation, while the dollar continues to serve its traditional role. The key takeaway from Trump’s comments is that even powerful figures are beginning to see how Bitcoin can complement, rather than just challenge, the existing financial order, particularly by offering a release valve for economic pressures. Understanding the Broader Cryptocurrency Impact on Society Trump’s statements, while focused on jobs and dollar pressure, open up a broader discussion about the overall cryptocurrency impact on the global economy and society. The influence of digital assets extends far beyond mere financial speculation, touching upon innovation, financial inclusion, and even geopolitical dynamics. Here are some key areas where cryptocurrency is making a significant impact: Financial Inclusion: Cryptocurrencies offer banking services to the unbanked and underbanked populations worldwide. With just a smartphone, individuals can access savings, lending, and payment services without needing traditional bank accounts. Cross-Border Payments: Traditional international remittances are often slow and expensive. Cryptocurrencies offer a faster, cheaper, and more transparent alternative for sending money across borders, benefiting migrant workers and international businesses. Technological Innovation: The underlying blockchain technology is a foundational innovation, similar to the internet. It’s not just about money; it’s about creating trustless, decentralized systems for supply chain management, digital identity, voting, and more. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): These new organizational structures, governed by code and community consensus, are revolutionizing how groups can coordinate and make decisions, potentially leading to more transparent and efficient governance models. Digital Ownership (NFTs): Non-fungible tokens are changing the paradigm of digital ownership, enabling verifiable scarcity and provenance for digital art, collectibles, and even real-world assets, creating new economies for creators. The resilience of crypto during stock market declines, as noted by Trump, further underscores its potential as a distinct asset class. While still volatile, its behavior can sometimes decouple from traditional markets, offering diversification benefits. This growing recognition from political figures, combined with ongoing technological advancements, suggests that cryptocurrency is here to stay and will continue to shape our financial and digital future in profound ways. Challenges and the Path Forward Despite the growing optimism and positive political rhetoric, the cryptocurrency space is not without its challenges. Regulatory uncertainty remains a significant hurdle globally, with different countries adopting varying approaches to digital assets. Concerns about market volatility, consumer protection, and the environmental impact of certain consensus mechanisms like Bitcoin’s proof-of-work also persist. However, the industry is actively working to address these issues. Developers are exploring more energy-efficient technologies, regulatory bodies are slowly but surely developing clearer guidelines, and educational initiatives are helping to demystify crypto for the general public. The increasing dialogue, especially from influential figures like Donald Trump, suggests a future where cryptocurrencies are integrated more seamlessly into the global financial fabric, with a clearer path for innovation and responsible growth. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Assets? Donald Trump’s recent comments represent a significant milestone in the journey of cryptocurrencies from fringe technology to mainstream acceptance. By acknowledging crypto’s role in job creation and its potential to ease pressure on the U.S. dollar, he has contributed to a more positive and pragmatic discourse around digital assets. This shift from skepticism to cautious endorsement from a major political figure underscores the undeniable and growing cryptocurrency impact on our economy and society. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, driven by technological innovation and increasing adoption, such political recognition could be instrumental in fostering a more supportive environment for growth, innovation, and responsible regulation. Whether you’re an investor, a developer, or simply an observer, the future of digital assets promises to be dynamic, challenging, and undoubtedly transformative.

This assertion, reported by the Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, underscores a growing awareness at the highest levels of government regarding the strategic importance of Trump crypto policy and its implications for global power dynamics. It’s a moment that could redefine the future trajectory of US cryptocurrency adoption and innovation. Why is US Cryptocurrency Support So Crucial? The statement from Donald Trump is more than just a passing comment; it reflects a deep understanding of the ongoing technological and economic competition between global superpowers. For years, the debate around US cryptocurrency policy has swung between caution and innovation. Now, it appears a more assertive stance is emerging, driven by the recognition that digital assets are not merely speculative tools but foundational technologies that will shape future financial systems and national security. Innovation Leadership: A proactive stance allows the U.S. to lead in blockchain development, Web3 technologies, and the creation of new financial instruments, rather than playing catch-up. Economic Competitiveness: Embracing the crypto industry can unlock new economic growth, create jobs, and attract capital, ensuring the U.S. remains a global economic powerhouse. National Security: Control over digital infrastructure and currencies is increasingly seen as a matter of national security, preventing adversaries from dominating crucial technological frontiers. Global Standards: By actively participating, the U.S. can help shape international regulatory frameworks and technological standards for digital assets , aligning them with democratic values. China Crypto Strategy: A Formidable Contender? Trump’s warning about China crypto dominance is not without basis. While China has taken a stringent approach to banning cryptocurrency trading and mining within its borders, it has simultaneously been aggressively pursuing its own central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan (e-CNY). This dual strategy suggests a nuanced approach: suppress decentralized, uncontrollable crypto while pioneering state-controlled digital money. China’s motivations are clear: Aspect China’s Approach Potential U.S. Counter-Strategy Decentralized Crypto Banned trading and mining; strict regulations. Foster innovation with clear regulatory frameworks. CBDC Development Aggressive pilot programs for digital yuan. Explore digital dollar, ensure privacy and security. Blockchain Technology Heavy investment in state-controlled blockchain. Support open-source and permissionless blockchain. Global Influence Aims to reduce reliance on USD, expand digital yuan use. Maintain USD dominance through innovation and partnerships. This stark contrast highlights the potential for a geopolitical race where control over digital assets could become as significant as military might or traditional economic power. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Industry? A more supportive stance from a major political figure like Donald Trump could have profound implications for the entire crypto industry . It signals a potential shift from an era of regulatory uncertainty and skepticism to one of greater acceptance and perhaps even strategic endorsement. This could lead to: Clearer Regulation: Political will to support crypto could translate into more defined and favorable regulatory frameworks, reducing ambiguity for businesses and investors. Increased Institutional Adoption: Greater political backing might encourage more traditional financial institutions to enter the space, seeing reduced risk and increased legitimacy. Boosted Innovation: With a more welcoming environment, developers and entrepreneurs might be more inclined to build groundbreaking projects within the U.S., fostering a robust ecosystem. Enhanced Market Confidence: Positive political rhetoric can improve market sentiment, potentially attracting more retail and institutional investment into various digital assets . For those invested in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, such statements are not just political soundbites; they are indicators of future policy direction that can significantly impact asset values and market stability. The prospect of bipartisan support for the crypto industry , even if from different motivations, presents a compelling narrative for growth. The Geopolitical Chessboard: Who Will Dominate Digital Assets? The race for supremacy in digital assets is a complex geopolitical chessboard. The U.S. has historically led in technological innovation and financial markets. However, its cautious approach to crypto has allowed other nations, including China, to make significant strides. Trump’s comments suggest a realization that inaction could lead to a forfeiture of this crucial advantage. The implications extend beyond just currency: Data Sovereignty: Who controls the underlying data and infrastructure of digital transactions? Financial Sanctions: How will digital currencies impact the effectiveness of traditional financial sanctions? Global Trade: Could digital currencies facilitate new forms of trade that bypass existing systems? The push for a clear Trump crypto policy, or indeed, any U.S. administration’s policy, is therefore not just about fostering a new asset class but about securing a nation’s position in the evolving global order. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Enthusiast What does this mean for you, whether you’re an investor, developer, or simply a keen observer of the crypto industry ? Stay Informed: Political rhetoric can quickly turn into policy. Keep a close eye on legislative developments and statements from key political figures. Understand the Nuances: Not all support for crypto is the same. Differentiate between support for decentralized cryptocurrencies and state-controlled digital currencies. Assess Regulatory Risk: While positive sentiment is good, regulatory clarity is what truly de-risks the space. Look for tangible legislative progress. Consider Long-Term Trends: The geopolitical competition over digital assets is a long-term trend. Position your portfolio or projects to benefit from the broader adoption and institutionalization of crypto. This statement from a former U.S. President is a significant milestone, marking a moment where the strategic importance of cryptocurrencies is being openly acknowledged at the highest echelons of power. It signals a potential turning point where the U.S. may accelerate its efforts to secure its leadership in the burgeoning world of digital assets , ensuring it doesn’t cede ground to rivals like China. Conclusion: The Dawn of a New Digital Race? Donald Trump’s assertion that the U.S. must back the crypto industry lest China crypto efforts dominate is a powerful testament to the shifting geopolitical landscape. It elevates the discussion around US cryptocurrency from a niche financial topic to a matter of national strategic importance. This recognition, regardless of political affiliation, is a net positive for the broader adoption and legitimacy of digital assets . The coming years will likely see an intensified race between global powers to establish dominance in this crucial technological frontier, shaping not just the future of finance, but the balance of global power itself.

46923865,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=756749,1751075505,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46923865.jpeg,Robinhood expands on crypto futures launched earlier this year,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/robinhood-expands-crypto-offerings/,"Robinhood Markets is deepening its crypto push with the launch of micro-futures contracts for three major digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP), and Solana (SOL). Announced on Friday, the move marks a significant expansion of the company’s crypto derivatives offerings. The new contracts are part of Robinhood’s larger mission of bringing complex financial products to the masses of retail traders. Micro futures allow traders to bet for or against the price action of digital assets with much less of an upfront investment. Each contract contracts at a smaller size than the standard size of a futures contract, thus allowing for smaller individual retail trading positions and a relatively low risk and lesser investment. Per the announcement, micro Bitcoin Friday futures, micro XRP futures, and micro Solana futures are now listed on the platform. All contracts are cash-settled and traded almost 24 hours a day, five days a week. “These products are intentionally built to be intuitive and user-friendly,” Robinhood said. “They help to democratize access to crypto futures markets for the everyday retail investor.” With these new futures, Robinhood is looking to cater to an increasing portion of retail traders hungry for more flexible and diversified crypto trading options but do not want to jump to more sophisticated and expensive platforms like Binance or CME. Robinhood expands on crypto futures launched earlier this year Introducing these new futures comes on top of Robinhood’s derivatives products already on the market. In early 2024, Robinhood introduced crypto futures, with Bitcoin and Ethereum the first to be offered. Those were followed by micro Bitcoin and Friday futures — weekly contracts designed to capture Friday price volatility. The new XRP and Solana futures offer Robinhood’s futures to four crypto assets. XRP and Solana are two of the most actively traded altcoins on the market. Their debut is an indication that there is an appetite for more diverse crypto derivatives than just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Robinhood’s crypto futures contracts are fully cash-settled, so no actual crypto is delivered. This gives traders exposure to price without taking responsibility for wallets or custody. The company has also slowly stepped up its futures offerings beyond crypto. The firm now enables trading in futures tied to indices, currencies, and commodities — all part of an overall shift to become a one-stop shop for modern investing. Robinhood pushes global expansion after Bitstamp acquisition And Robinhood’s push into crypto is also part of its broader global strategy. Previously, in June, it finalized its purchase of Bitstamp , one of the world’s oldest, most respected crypto exchanges, for about $200 million. Bitstamp has a solid infrastructure, a growing international customer base, and relevant regulatory licenses in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere. Robinhood received over 50 active licenses and registrations with the acquisition, equipped to expand its crypto operations outside the US. This is largely interpreted as a reaction to increasing competition in the global crypto sector. Large exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance have widened internationally, especially in more crypto-friendly regulatory environments. Robinhood is also considering the purchase of WonderFi, a Canadian digital asset platform backed by the investor and entrepreneur Kevin O’Leary. This particular takeover would further solidify their footprint in Canada and bring some DeFi to their existing offerings. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev has been emphatic that his company views crypto as a long-term growth focus. Lately, he has described Robinhood’s vision to become a “financial super app” that does everything from stock trading to banking, crypto, and financial education.

Odaily Planet News reported on these pivotal announcements, highlighting Trump’s call for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates and his intent to issue new tariff notices. Understanding the implications of these declarations is crucial for anyone navigating the current financial landscape, as they directly influence the Trump Economic Policy and its broader effects. Understanding Trump’s Economic Policy Demands President Trump has consistently advocated for lower interest rates, viewing them as a crucial tool to stimulate economic growth and maintain the competitive edge of the United States. His recent remarks reiterate this stance, putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease its monetary policy. Simultaneously, the announcement of impending new tariff notices signals a continuation, and perhaps an escalation, of his administration’s assertive trade strategy. This two-pronged approach – monetary loosening and trade protectionism – forms the bedrock of what many define as Trump Economic Policy . What are the potential motivations behind such strong pronouncements, and how do they align with his ‘America First’ agenda? Trump’s economic philosophy often prioritizes domestic industry and aims to reduce trade deficits. His calls for rate cuts are rooted in the belief that lower borrowing costs will encourage business expansion, job creation, and a more competitive U.S. dollar, boosting exports. On the trade front, tariffs are seen as a tool to force other nations to negotiate more favorable trade deals, even if it means temporary disruptions. These policies collectively shape the distinctive Trump Economic Policy that has characterized his tenure. The Federal Reserve Rates Conundrum: Will Powell Budge? The Federal Reserve, under Chairman Jerome Powell, operates with a dual mandate of maximizing employment and maintaining price stability. While presidential pressure is a constant, the Fed typically bases its decisions on economic data, striving for independence from political influence. Trump’s call for lower Federal Reserve Rates comes amidst ongoing debates about inflation, employment figures, and global economic headwinds. A rate cut could make borrowing cheaper, potentially boosting corporate profits and consumer spending, but it could also signal underlying economic weakness or risk overheating the economy. Key Considerations for Federal Reserve Rates: Economic Data: The Fed primarily reacts to indicators like inflation, GDP growth, and unemployment rates. Global Context: International economic slowdowns or geopolitical tensions can influence the Fed’s stance. Market Expectations: Central bank decisions often aim to manage market expectations to avoid undue volatility. The market will be watching closely to see if the central bank yields to political pressure or maintains its independent course regarding Federal Reserve Rates . The decision will have far-reaching implications for everything from mortgage rates to corporate investments. Global Trade Tariffs: A New Wave of Disruption? The impending dispatch of letters outlining new Global Trade Tariffs suggests that trade tensions are far from over. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, intended to protect domestic industries and encourage local production. While proponents argue they level the playing field, critics warn of retaliatory measures, increased consumer costs, and disruptions to global supply chains. The countries targeted by these new obligations could face significant economic challenges, and the ripple effects of escalated Global Trade Tariffs could be felt worldwide. Potential Impacts of New Tariffs: Increased Consumer Prices: Tariffs are often passed on to consumers, leading to higher costs for imported goods. Supply Chain Disruptions: Businesses may struggle to source materials or components, leading to production delays and higher operational costs. Retaliation: Targeted countries may impose their own tariffs on U.S. goods, harming American exporters. Uncertainty: The unpredictability of trade policy can deter long-term business investment. What specific industries or nations might be affected, and how will they respond to these renewed challenges in Global Trade Tariffs ? Potential Crypto Market Impact: Navigating Volatility How do these traditional economic maneuvers affect the decentralized world of digital assets? The interplay between macroeconomics and the Crypto Market Impact is complex. Historically, cryptocurrency markets have shown sensitivity to broader economic trends, though sometimes acting as a counter-cyclical hedge. Interest Rate Cuts and Crypto: Lower interest rates in traditional finance can sometimes make riskier assets, like cryptocurrencies, more attractive as investors seek higher yields than those offered by low-interest savings or bonds. A weaker dollar, often a consequence of rate cuts, can also make Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies more appealing as alternative stores of value against fiat currency devaluation. Trade Tariffs and Crypto: Escalating trade wars create economic uncertainty, which can lead investors to seek ‘safe haven’ assets. While gold has traditionally filled this role, Bitcoin is increasingly being considered as a digital alternative due to its decentralized nature and limited supply. However, extreme volatility stemming from global economic instability could also lead to a flight to liquidity, where all assets, including crypto, face sell-offs. The overall sentiment around these policy decisions will undoubtedly influence the broader Crypto Market Impact , potentially leading to increased volatility or new investment trends. What This Means for the US Economic Outlook The combined effect of potential interest rate adjustments and new trade barriers paints a nuanced picture for the US Economic Outlook . While lower rates could provide a short-term boost to certain sectors, persistent trade disputes could hinder long-term growth and lead to higher inflation due to increased import costs. Businesses face uncertainty regarding investment decisions, and consumers might grapple with fluctuating prices for everyday goods. The administration’s policies aim to strengthen domestic industries, but the global interconnectedness of economies means that unilateral actions often have far-reaching consequences. Monitoring these developments will be crucial for understanding the trajectory of the US Economic Outlook in the coming months. Will these policies lead to sustained prosperity, or will they introduce new challenges that necessitate a recalibration of economic strategies? The answers will unfold as markets react and policymakers respond to the evolving landscape. President Trump’s latest economic pronouncements underscore a period of significant uncertainty and potential shifts in global financial dynamics. From the tug-of-war over interest rates with the Federal Reserve to the looming threat of new trade tariffs, these decisions will undoubtedly shape not only traditional markets but also the burgeoning cryptocurrency ecosystem. Investors and market watchers alike must remain vigilant, adapting strategies to navigate the evolving landscape defined by these powerful policy moves. The coming weeks will reveal the initial responses to these tariff notices, setting the stage for further market reactions and influencing the global economic trajectory.

Ethereum Rally Marked By Shift In Dynamics According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, Ethereum’s latest rally has been accompanied by a notable shift in market dynamics – including a flip to positive funding rates, a potential short squeeze, and a rise in ETH inflows to Binance crypto exchange. Related Reading: Ethereum Breakout Imminent? Broadening Wedge Hints At $4,200 Surge Recent data from Binance reveals a significant shift in ETH funding rates from negative to positive. Positive funding rates typically indicate that traders are opening or holding leveraged long positions, reflecting expectations of further upside. However, rising funding rates may also raise the risk of a short-term price pullback if long positions become overextended. Data from CoinGlass shows that 68.15% of liquidations over the past 24 hours were long positions – highlighting this risk. Taha also emphasized the role of a short squeeze in Ethereum’s recent price surge and the increase in funding rates. As ETH’s price climbed, it retested the previous short-squeeze zone around $2,500. He explained: In that earlier event, short positions were forcibly closed by initiating aggressive market buy orders to cover their exposure, triggering a cascading effect known as a short squeeze. This dynamic occurs when traders who had bet against ETH (shorts) are forced to close their positions by aggressively buying back the asset to limit losses. Meanwhile, ETH inflows to Binance have also spiked. On-chain exchange data suggests that 177,000 ETH was deposited into Binance over a three-day period – an unusually high volume. Such a surge typically signals increased selling pressure or large-scale repositioning by major holders. Large transfers of ETH to exchanges often precede either potential sell-offs or liquidity provisioning. In conclusion, Taha noted that while a short-term correction may be likely, ETH’s breakout above $2,500 underscores the aggressive speculative activity driving its recent price action. Traders are advised to closely monitor funding rates and exchange flows for signs of an impending retracement. ETH Bulls Take The Charge Recent technical analysis suggests ETH may be gearing up for a breakout above the $2,800 resistance level. The asset also recently formed a golden cross on the daily chart, fuelling speculation that a new all-time high (ATH) could be within reach. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls Wake Up: $4,000 Target Back on the Radar After Reclaiming Key Level That said, ETH is not entirely in the clear. Technical analyst Crypto Wave recently predicted that the cryptocurrency may revisit lower levels in the $1,700 to $1,950 range. At press time, ETH trades at $2,429, down 0.4% over the past 24 hours.

MAGACOIN FINANCE is getting market attention with analyst-projected returns that outpace more established tokens. While legacy coins continue to show resilience and signs of progress, momentum is quickly shifting. Why Analysts Say MAGACOIN FINANCE Is a 2025 Power Play MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction faster than any token in early 2025. With a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens and no venture capital unlocks, the structure heavily favors early buyers. Audited by HashEx and fueled by a politically bold theme, the token is turning heads across analyst circles. Its scarcity model, combined with real utility features and a transparent roadmap, makes it stand out from traditional meme coins. Presale demand is surging. Every phase has seen rapid sellouts, with thousands joining ahead of its exchange debut. Experts now call MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most undervalued entries in the market. XRP Shows Signs of Stability with ETF Momentum XRP is entering a new phase of reduced volatility. Its 30-day realized volatility is at a multi-year low, hovering around 44%, pointing to consolidation. Multiple XRP spot ETF applications are under review, and there’s strong belief that the SEC will approve them by 2025. Solana Gains Institutional Backing as DeFi Surges Solana’s DeFi footprint continues to expand. Its total value locked (TVL) crossed $10.9 billion this month, powered by rising user fees and a surge in new protocols. Seven asset managers—including Invesco Galaxy—have filed for spot Solana ETFs, a clear signal of growing institutional confidence. Avalanche Strengthens Its Position in Web3 and Gaming Avalanche continues to impress with fast transactions and low fees. Its subnet architecture supports projects in Web3, gaming, and NFTs. While the recent price action has been uncertain, technical indicators remain solid. As more projects integrate its scalable infrastructure, the potential for long-term growth stays intact. Most forecasts place AVAX in the $20–$28 range by year-end. Analyst Sentiment Shifts to Opportunity and ROI While XRP, Solana, and Avalanche maintain strong use cases and institutional interest, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being viewed as a superior upside opportunity. The fixed token supply, quick presale momentum, and market-ready structure are driving strong projections. MAGACOIN FINANCE is no longer a niche option. It’s now a serious contender for one of the highest growth stories of the year.

While a July 4 deadline has been emphasized, Trump’s recent remarks suggest a degree of flexibility, signaling a complex legislative journey ahead. For anyone tracking market movements and economic shifts, understanding the nuances of this potential Trump tax bill is par amount. This development carries significant weight, not just for traditional markets but also for the broader financial landscape, including the burgeoning cryptocurrency space, which often reacts to major economic policy shifts. What’s the Significance of the July 4 Deadline? When President Trump first mentioned a July 4 deadline for the comprehensive tax and spending bill, it immediately grabbed headlines. The choice of Independence Day is highly symbolic, aiming to evoke a sense of patriotic urgency and a fresh start for the American economy. Historically, such symbolic deadlines are used to galvanize political will and create momentum for legislative action. However, as Trump himself noted, this deadline, while significant, is not set in stone. The idea is to push lawmakers towards a swift resolution, but the reality of legislative processes often dictates a more drawn-out timeline. A ‘tax and spending bill’ typically encompasses a wide array of proposals, from adjustments to corporate and individual income tax rates to new government spending initiatives. These bills are designed to stimulate economic growth, reduce the tax burden on specific groups, or fund critical public programs. The flexibility mentioned by Trump, including the possibility of extending the timeline beyond August if necessary, indicates an awareness of the formidable challenges in drafting and passing such a sweeping piece of legislation. This flexibility, while pragmatic, can also introduce uncertainty into markets, as investors prefer clear timelines and predictable policy. Why is There Mounting Legislative Pressure? The push for a new tax and spending bill comes amidst mounting legislative pressure from various fronts. Political parties, aiming to fulfill campaign promises or solidify their economic platforms, are keen to see significant policy changes enacted. For Republicans, tax cuts often represent a core tenet of their economic philosophy, aiming to boost business investment and job creation. Democrats, on the other hand, might focus on ensuring fairness in the tax code and directing spending towards social programs or infrastructure. Beyond party lines, special interest groups, industry lobbyists, and even the general public exert considerable pressure. Businesses seek favorable tax environments to foster growth, while consumers hope for relief from rising costs or increased disposable income. The current economic climate, characterized by inflation concerns and potential recessionary fears, amplifies this pressure. Lawmakers are tasked with balancing these diverse demands while navigating the complex political landscape of Capitol Hill. The stakes are high, as the outcome of this bill could profoundly impact various sectors of the economy and the daily lives of millions of Americans. Unpacking the Potential Economic Impact Any major tax and spending bill is expected to have a substantial economic impact . If tax cuts are enacted, businesses might reinvest their savings, leading to increased production, hiring, and potentially higher wages. For individuals, lower taxes could mean more disposable income, stimulating consumer spending. Conversely, significant spending programs could inject capital into specific industries, creating jobs and driving innovation. However, there are also potential downsides to consider. Large tax cuts without corresponding spending reductions could swell the national debt, potentially leading to higher interest rates in the long run. Similarly, increased government spending, if not managed carefully, could exacerbate inflationary pressures. The cryptocurrency market, in particular, often reacts to broader macroeconomic indicators and government fiscal policy. Policies that increase national debt or inflation might lead investors to seek alternative assets like Bitcoin, which some view as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Conversely, policies that foster strong economic growth and stability could reduce the perceived need for such hedges. The precise effects will depend on the specifics of the bill – which industries benefit, how it’s funded, and its overall scale. Key Areas of Potential Impact: Corporate Sector: Lower corporate taxes could incentivize companies to repatriate profits, invest domestically, and expand operations, potentially boosting stock market performance. Small Businesses: Simplified tax codes or specific deductions could provide much-needed relief and encourage entrepreneurship. Individual Consumers: Changes to income tax brackets, deductions, or credits directly affect household budgets and purchasing power. Inflation: The overall fiscal stimulus or contraction could influence inflation rates, impacting the cost of living and the value of currency. Investment Landscape: Shifts in tax policy can alter the attractiveness of different asset classes, including real estate, stocks, bonds, and even digital assets. Navigating Future Fiscal Policy: What to Expect? The discussions surrounding this bill are a preview of future fiscal policy directions under a potential new administration. Fiscal policy, which involves the government’s use of spending and taxation to influence the economy, is a powerful tool. The approach taken with this bill could signal a commitment to supply-side economics (focused on production and investment through tax cuts) or a more demand-side approach (focused on stimulating consumption through government spending or direct aid). Understanding the proposed changes is crucial for businesses and investors. For instance, if the bill includes provisions that favor specific industries, those sectors might see increased investment and growth. If it aims to simplify the tax code, it could reduce compliance burdens for businesses of all sizes. Conversely, complex new regulations or targeted taxes could create headwinds for certain economic activities. The ongoing debate highlights the delicate balance policymakers must strike between stimulating growth, managing debt, and ensuring economic equity. Challenges and Considerations Ahead: Passing a comprehensive tax and spending bill is rarely straightforward. Several challenges could delay or alter its passage: Political Gridlock: Deep partisan divides can make consensus difficult, leading to prolonged negotiations or even legislative stalemates. Economic Data: Shifting economic indicators, such as inflation rates, unemployment figures, or GDP growth, could necessitate revisions to the bill’s proposals. Public Reception: The bill’s perceived fairness and its potential impact on different income groups will heavily influence public support, which can, in turn, affect political will. Unforeseen Events: Global events, geopolitical tensions, or domestic crises could shift legislative priorities and resource allocation. The flexibility Trump mentioned is a recognition of these inherent difficulties. It suggests a pragmatic approach to legislation, prioritizing eventual passage over strict adherence to an initial timeline. For market participants, this means continued vigilance and adaptability will be key. A Critical Juncture for the Economy Donald Trump’s emphasis on the July 4 deadline for a tax and spending bill, while acknowledging its flexibility, underscores the urgency and complexity of the economic policy landscape. The mounting legislative pressure reflects diverse interests and the critical need to address current economic challenges. The potential economic impact of such a bill could reshape industries, influence consumer behavior, and set the tone for future fiscal policy. As discussions evolve, stakeholders across all financial sectors, including those deeply invested in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, will be watching closely to understand how these proposed changes might ripple through the global economy.

The total crypto market cap is currently around $3.32 trillion, with Bitcoin holding steady above $108,000 and Ethereum climbing back to $2,503. While some altcoins are gaining momentum, others are showing early signs of weakness. Market activity remains mixed, but overall support for strong, well-positioned tokens continues. Among these, Qubetics is beginning to stand out. With a confirmed listing on a top ten centralized exchange and a 20 percent price increase already set, Qubetics is emerging as the best crypto to buy now. Qubetics ($TICS) is addressing real issues in digital asset ownership by offering a tokenization platform that operates across multiple blockchains. This makes asset control more flexible and accessible. At the same time, Avalanche is facing downward pressure after failing to hold recent highs, and Hedera is trading within a narrow range, waiting to break resistance or drop further. This article will explore each of these projects and examine which one holds the strongest potential right now. RWAT by Qubetics: Solving Real Problems in the Blockchain World Qubetics is delivering a Real World Asset Tokenization (RWAT) platform that brings true utility to the blockchain industry. The core goal is to turn physical and digital items into tradable tokens. But what sets Qubetics apart is how it allows cross-chain functionality without locking users into one blockchain. As the first Web3 aggregator, it connects popular blockchains and provides a frictionless path to real ownership. For example, a Web3 gaming studio sitting on valuable in-game assets can tokenize those items as NFTs or asset-backed tokens. Through Qubetics, they can offer those tokens on different chains, build secondary markets, and allow staking for yield; all without having to recreate systems from scratch on each chain. That saves time, opens more value paths, and attracts users from across ecosystems. This kind of service positions Qubetics as the best crypto to buy now for those serious about asset utility. Final Call to Join the Qubetics Presale: The Best Crypto Presale Right Now Qubetics has locked in its launch on one of the world’s top ten centralized exchanges. The token will officially list on June 30 at 11 AM UTC, with a confirmed listing price of $0.40. This is a 20 percent jump from the current presale price of $0.3370. That’s not just a listing but an instant price boost for early buyers who got in before the clock runs out. With listing buzz building, $TICS is gaining traction fast among those looking for utility-backed projects with real value. Right now, the final stage of the Qubetics crypto presale is live and closing soon. The public sale officially ends on June 30 at 8 AM UTC, just three hours before the token goes live for trading. At $0.3370 per token, there are only 9 million $TICS left. So far, more than 516 million tokens have been sold and over $18.1 million has been raised. The community has already grown to 28,300 token holders and is expanding quickly. Following a major update to its tokenomics, Qubetics reduced its total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion tokens. That cuts excess supply and instantly adds scarcity. On top of that, the public sale share was raised to 38.55 percent. More tokens in the hands of actual users means more power with the community. That setup builds both trust and long-term strength. For those grabbing $TICS now, the reward is simple and direct. A $2,000 buy at $0.3370 gives you around 5,938 tokens. Once it hits $0.40 at listing, that stash will be worth $2,375. That’s a 20 percent return, locked in before the market even opens. And it could be just the beginning. Analysts are already calling for $TICS to hit between $5 and $10 during the next bull cycle. That same $2,000 could turn into $59,380 if targets hold. Avalanche: Double Top Forms as Price Slips From Recent High Avalanche (AVAX) has not kept up with the broader crypto market in recent weeks. It lost almost 4 percent in just one day and is now 24 percent below its recent high of $23.7. That drop forms a double top; a pattern where price tests highs twice and then falls. It signals weakness and possible short-term selling pressure. Traders are now watching support around $17.50. If that level breaks, it could mean more downside. Despite broader strength across altcoins, Avalanche has not followed. This makes it less attractive for those seeking the best crypto to buy now. Market watchers are holding back until AVAX shows a confirmed reversal or finds stronger support. Hedera: Price Stays in Tight Range Around Key Levels Hedera (HBAR) has been trading between $0.150 and $0.155. That is a very tight zone. It found support at $0.150, which is now acting as a key floor. But it has not managed to move above $0.155 either. For now, the token is in wait mode; holding steady but not gaining. That stability shows strength but not momentum. HBAR needs to break above that ceiling to show any real growth potential. Until then, it remains a slow mover in a fast-paced market. That puts Hedera in a neutral zone not weak like AVAX, but not ready to rally like Qubetics. Community members are watching this zone closely to spot any early signs of strength. Conclusion: Qubetics Leads as AVAX Slips and HBAR Stalls Avalanche is currently facing heavy selling pressure. It’s showing a bearish double top pattern and has dropped nearly 24 percent from its recent peak. The price continues to slide, making short-term upside limited and uncertain. Hedera, on the other hand, remains steady but hasn’t managed to break key resistance. While it holds its ground around support, it lacks momentum. In contrast, Qubetics is closing its final-stage presale with strong tokenomics and a confirmed listing that includes a 20 percent price jump. Backed by its real-world asset tokenization system and cross-chain access, Qubetics stands out as a strong contender for those looking best crypto to buy now . For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the best crypto to buy now? Qubetics stands out as the best crypto to buy now due to its near-sold-out presale and 20 percent listing bonus. Why is Avalanche falling recently? Avalanche formed a double top and dropped nearly 24 percent from its recent high, showing short-term weakness. What is Hedera’s current price trend? HBAR is stuck between $0.150 and $0.155 with no major move expected until it breaks resistance. Summary Qubetics ($TICS) is now deep into its final presale phase, with $0.3370 per token and a confirmed listing at $0.40 that delivers a 20 percent gain instantly. With over $18.1 million raised and more than 516 million tokens already sold, demand is heating up fast. The platform uses Real World Asset Tokenization (RWAT) to turn tangible assets into tradable tokens and offers real use cases in the blockchain space. Compared to AVAX, which is falling, and HBAR, which is range-bound, Qubetics offers actual value and timing for growth. With only 9 million tokens left, and price set to rise, Qubetics clearly leads in both utility and ROI.

Ethereum (ETH) is hovering near $2,430, down 4 % on the week even after whales grabbed a million coins and spot-ETF inflows hit $230 million in three days. Analysts say holding $2,400 could ignite a rally, yet Q3 is typically ETH’s weakest quarter. Cardano (ADA) trades around $0.55. A negative MVRV (-12 %) shows undervaluation, but price action sits inside a falling channel. Bulls need a daily close above $0.62; failure risks a slip to $0.55.

With the majors in limbo, analysts now shine the spotlight on MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale rewriting 2025’s playbook. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Matters Explosive momentum: Rooted in the instantly recognizable “Make America Great Again” narrative, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the year’s fastest-selling presales. Wallet counts and investors are soaring, signaling genuine traction. Big upside : Researchers project 25x–35x gains from today’s entry, with whispers of 100× potential if market conditions align.

With all 15 presale stages completed and the Bonus Round now active, Lightchain AI is capturing attention across private chats, developer forums, and investor groups without relying on celebrity endorsements. Its AI-native infrastructure, featuring a custom virtual machine and a consensus model that rewards real computation, is resonating with those seeking long-term utility. As the July 2025 mainnet launch approaches, Lightchain AI’s organic momentum proves that real tech and real traction don’t need viral moments to thrive. Dogecoin Sees Another Boost Tied to Social Media Buzz Dogecoin (DOGE) is seeing a resurgence that has seen the return of social media personality-triggered gains for the joke cryptocurrency. A renewed speculators’ interest on the back of tweets from Elon Musk mentioning DOGE with a potential new Department of Government Efficiency charge has sent the price soaring. This latest run up comes alongside a wider rally in the meme coin space, with Dogecoin climbing roughly 6% over the the last 24 hours to around $0.24. Analysts note that this uptrend could help send DOGE to $0.30 in the near term, should it continue. But they also warn that such rallies, frequently driven by social media chatter, can be precarious, and do not appear to have staying power without the traditional underpinnings of fundamental strength. Lightchain AI Builds Momentum Organically Through Community Hype Lightchain AI is building real momentum through organic community hype, not manufactured headlines. The platform actively funds builders, researchers, and emerging projects—focusing on data oracles, tooling, explorers, and dApps powered by its AI Virtual Machine (AIVM). Additional grants are on the way, reinforcing a developer-first vision. The infrastructure is equally compelling: cross-chain capabilities, decentralized validator and contributor nodes, and a developer portal with full technical documentation. Public GitHub repositories will open at mainnet launch, ensuring transparency. Meanwhile, Lightchain’s Meme Launchpad and ecosystem tools are going live, combining utility with community-driven creativity. With DeFi partnership onboarding in progress, Lightchain AI is becoming a grassroots powerhouse fueled by builder trust and growing trader curiosity. One Grows Loud, The Other Grows Strong- Lightchain AI is Rooted for the Future While some projects chase the headlines, Lightchain AI is quietly building something bigger—real infrastructure, bold vision, and lasting impact. At just $0.007 in the Bonus Round, Lightchain isn’t about hype; it’s about substance. Backed by decentralized validator nodes, a $150,000 grant pool for dApps, and an upcoming public GitHub release, Lightchain AI is laying the groundwork for a revolutionary future. Even better? The original 5% team allocation has been reallocated to builders, ensuring innovation stays front and center. With serious capital flowing in, Lightchain AI is primed for powerful, sustainable growth. Ready to be part of the future of AI?

At the time of writing, the asset is priced at $106,841, marking a mild 0.4% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite brushing a daily high of $107,884, BTC appears to be consolidating in a narrow range, with market participants watching for the next significant move. Amid this relatively flat price action, on-chain trends suggest that not all is quiet under the surface. A new analysis by CryptoQuant contributor “oinonen” sheds light on wallet activity within Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges by trading volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests $108,000, But Holders Disagree On Direction Bitcoin Mid-Tier Investors Take Center Stage on Binance Oinonen’s findings point to a sharp increase in whale-level participation, as well as a notable contribution from mid-tier investors, which could have implications for broader market behavior. Citing CryptoQuant’s on-chain metrics, the analyst revealed that Binance’s inflow data shows that wallets depositing between 10 and 100 BTC now account for 40% of all Bitcoin inflows. These wallet sizes typically belong to high-net-worth individuals, trading firms, or mid-sized institutions—those who sit between retail traders and deep-pocketed whales. In contrast, whale-level inflows (100–1,000 BTC) currently represent 20% of the total, highlighting that mid-tier players may be driving more exchange activity than larger whales at this time. Interestingly, whale activity still made a major appearance recently. On June 16, inflows of 10,000 BTC surged and made up 83% of total exchange inflows on Binance that day, reinforcing earlier observations from Oinonen about increased whale presence over the past year. According to CryptoQuant’s whale ratio metric, that presence has reportedly jumped by as much as 400% since mid-2023. Binance Deposit Data Points to Rising Institutional Interest Beyond just inflow ratios, Binance’s overall deposit metrics suggest a growing trend of larger average deposits. The average Bitcoin deposit rose from 0.36 BTC in 2023 to 1.65 BTC in 2024. The exchange processed $21.6 billion in user fund deposits in 2024, roughly 40% more than the combined totals of the next ten crypto exchanges. Despite the growing institutional footprint, the significant portion of deposits in the 10–100 BTC range shows that mid-level market participants remain active contributors to the trading ecosystem. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer This data may reflect a broader shift in how BTC is being accumulated and moved, where influence is shared between whales and mid-sized investors. While whale flows often generate headlines, the consistent presence of mid-tier wallets can signal healthier market participation and a more distributed form of liquidity provision across the board. With Bitcoin still consolidating near key price levels, these on-chain trends could help shape its next breakout, whenever it comes. Featured image created with DALL-E.

HYPE Rises in Volume and UNI Charts Future Growth,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-0-0030-expires-in-12-hours-price-rises-to-0-0080-next-hype-rises-in-volume-and-uni-charts-future-growth/,"Uniswap (UNI) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) are making waves again. UNI’s recent price dip has opened a debate among traders; some are calling for a continued drop, while others see it as a launchpad for a longer rally. At the same time, the tone around HYPE has shifted as strong buying activity and chart signals show growing bullish sentiment. If you’re searching for crypto coins to buy now, don’t just look at short-lived trends. Focus on platforms with strong tech, real liquidity, and solid expansion plans. BlockDAG (BDAG) fits that model. It has already raised more than $323 million and is preparing for a major sponsorship reveal. In a market filled with speculation, BlockDAG brings clarity, traction, and consistent delivery. BlockDAG $0.0030 Entry Closes Soon: Why Get In Before the Next Surge? BlockDAG has now entered Batch 29, with the coin priced at $0.0276, marking a 2,660% gain since Batch 1. But what’s pulling attention is the current frozen price at $0.0030, available for 12 hours. Once expired, BDAG’s value will rise to $0.0080. This jump isn’t based on guesswork; it’s scheduled, giving buyers a massive upside window. For those looking at crypto coins to buy now, this countdown adds a sense of urgency. More than 23.3 billion BDAG coins have already been claimed. Each batch closure pushes prices up and tightens the available supply. This isn’t a waiting game; it’s a timed roadmap. As prices rise with each batch, getting in early becomes more difficult. That’s why the $0.0030 phase continues getting serious attention. BlockDAG’s next milestone is coming June 30, a U.S. sponsorship deal that could reset expectations across the market. Set to be one of the biggest ever seen in crypto, the reveal will land just as the final phase of the presale kicks in. Media attention, broader awareness, and price speculation are expected to follow. If you’re holding BlockDAG already, you’re positioned well for the next price hike. And if not, now may be the last easy entry point before the real rally begins. The system is clear: locked pricing, vanishing supply, and major events on the horizon. Uniswap: Staying Relevant Through Tech and Growth Uniswap (UNI) remains a key name in the decentralized finance space. Lately, the focus has been on UNI’s potential for long-term price gains. Even with recent price shifts, UNI keeps drawing interest from seasoned holders. Experts are tracking its governance changes and increased trading activity as signs of stable progress. The conversation around clearer DeFi regulation also keeps UNI in the spotlight. Looking ahead, UNI may benefit as Ethereum upgrades and DeFi gets more attention from big institutions. Its governance model and fee-sharing tools give it staying power as new projects enter the space. That makes it a serious option for those building strong DeFi portfolios. As platform liquidity grows, UNI could gain even more appeal. For anyone looking into crypto coins to buy now, UNI remains a solid option backed by both usage and updates. Hyperliquid: Volume Spikes and User Growth in Focus Recent market analysis around Hyperliquid (HYPE) highlights how it’s standing out in the altcoin scene. Trading volume is rising, and liquidity pools are showing signs of strength. Analysts are watching closely as charts signal upward moves. There’s also rising interest in the community as users point to new feature launches and ecosystem partnerships. If you’re looking at fast-moving coins, HYPE could be one to track. Wallet activity and new user addresses are rising, driving short-term optimism. Analysts say this kind of growth is worth noting. Combined with planned platform upgrades, the market now sees HYPE as one of the top-performing smaller coins in the spotlight. For those scanning crypto coins to buy now, HYPE is gaining serious momentum across both charts and social metrics. In Summary Uniswap (UNI) continues to prove itself through upgrades and long-term positioning. Analysts believe its recent shifts point to sustainable growth, helped by future Ethereum updates. Hyperliquid (HYPE) is climbing thanks to strong volume, a growing user base, and incoming features that are turning heads. But it’s BlockDAG that’s moving with the most clarity. Its $0.0030 entry price is frozen for 12 hours only, after which it will rise to $0.0080. Plus, the project’s massive sponsorship deal announcement on June 30 promises an even bigger spotlight. If you’re exploring crypto coins to buy now, this may be your best-timed option. With supply falling, visibility growing, and $323M already raised in presale, BlockDAG is set to deliver one of the biggest upsides this year!

Snorter Bot — Telegram Meets Trading Snorter Bot brings advanced trading tools straight to Telegram, including MEV resistance and real-time sniping.

Its community-first governance structure is also driving high engagement. Final Word Crypto presales in 2025 are more competitive—and more promising—than ever.

Metaplanet’s +125% rally highlights recent investor preference for balance sheet BTC exposure over operational mining models, though leadership could shift with some valuations looking stretched. While future conditions remain uncertain, Bitcoin’s evolving role as both a high-beta tech proxy and a macro hedge may allow it to benefit across multiple scenarios. A major factor behind Bitcoin’s weaker on-chain metrics is the collapse in activity related to Ordinals, which allowed users to inscribe digital content onto individual Satoshis— effectively enabling Bitcoin-native NFTs. Bitcoin sets new highs and holds strong above $100K as Ordinals fade and onchain activity slows. Equity markets reward treasury-heavy BTC proxies over operational miners. Please note that VanEck has exposure to bitcoin. Three key takeaways for mid-May to mid-June: Price Resilience in a Volatile Macro Backdrop: Bitcoin ((BTC)) set new all-time highs above $110K , though geopolitical tension briefly pushed BTC as low as $98K on June 22nd, marking a six-week low. Onchain Activity Slows: Transaction volume and fee revenue declined, with Ordinals volumes hitting year-to-date lows, highlighting Bitcoin’s growing reliance on off-chain adoption. Treasury Plays Outperform… for Now: Metaplanet’s ( MTPLF ) +125% rally highlights recent investor preference for balance sheet BTC exposure over operational mining models, though leadership could shift with some valuations looking stretched.

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Bitcoin quietly carved new all-time highs this month, reaching nearly $112K on May 22 and trading above $110K again on June 9. Yet, in the wake of escalating U.S.-Iran tensions over the weekend, BTC briefly fell to ~$98K , its lowest level in over a month, before stabilizing back above $100K . Despite this volatility, 30-day moving averages remain elevated at ~$ 107K . Interestingly, borrowing rates have cooled to 7%, about 50% lower than at the start of 2025, indicating neutral market sentiment and increased stability. While future conditions remain uncertain, Bitcoin’s evolving role as both a high-beta tech proxy and a macro hedge may allow it to benefit across multiple scenarios. In peace, improved risk appetite could favor high-growth assets like BTC. In conflict, rising fiscal deficits and currency concerns may bolster the asset’s appeal among reserve-seeking investors. Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance Hit Multi-Year Highs in June Source: Glassnode as of 6/19/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Bitcoin Dominance and Institutional Flows Bitcoin’s market dominance rose another 1% in June, setting a new 30-day moving average high for this cycle. This continued rise reflects Bitcoin’s strengthening role as the preferred crypto asset among institutional investors, even as altcoins remain largely trapped in speculative, retail-driven narratives. Since the 2021–2022 altcoin cycle, Bitcoin has reclaimed nearly all market share gains made by other crypto assets. The momentum in dominance supports the view that Bitcoin has matured into a digital store-of-value -- functionally “digital gold”-- for both public and private institutions. Unlike prior cycles, investors today can access leveraged BTC exposure through public equities. Strategy (MSTR), for example, offers deep liquidity and capital efficiency, while smaller entrants like Semler Scientific ( SMLR ) provide high-volatility trading opportunities. These structures appear to absorb speculative demand that might have previously flowed into altcoins. While ETH and SOL treasury strategies show early promise, Bitcoin continues to command the lion’s share of institutional flows, supported by its dominant liquidity, simple narrative, and macro positioning. Altcoins, by contrast, have struggled to attract sustained inflows, with market activity largely rotational and retail-driven. As a result, Bitcoin appears to be pulling in net new capital, while altcoins operate in a more insular environment, reinforcing BTC’s status as the foundation of institutional crypto exposure. Onchain Performance: Activity Slows as Offchain Adoption Grows Daily Bitcoin Transactions and Fees Hovered Near YTD Lows in June Source: Glassnode as of 6/19/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. While market-facing indicators such as price action, futures, flows, and institutional positioning remain supportive, Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics point to softening activity. Over the past 30 days: The Bitcoin network processed an average of 364,000 transactions per day, down 8% month-over-month and 42% year-over-year. Daily fee revenue averaged $641K , down 57% year-to-date. In contrast, block rewards earned by miners remain elevated at approximately $45M per day, assuming 144 blocks/day at $100K per BTC. This means that, on an annualized basis, transaction fees account for just 1.4% of the estimated $16.4B in yearly block rewards, a stark mismatch between network usage and price performance. This disconnect may persist, especially as Bitcoin adoption increasingly occurs offchain through financial products like ETPs and corporate treasuries, rather than through native blockchain activity. Looking ahead, the scheduled block reward halvings in 2028 and 2032 will further reduce miner revenue, raising structural questions about the long-term sustainability of security incentives if fee generation doesn’t materially recover. Ordinals (""Bitcoin NFTs"") Activity Fell To 2025 Lows in June Source: Glassnode as of 6/19/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Ordinals Cool Off A major factor behind Bitcoin’s weaker on-chain metrics is the collapse in activity related to Ordinals, which allowed users to inscribe digital content onto individual Satoshis—effectively enabling Bitcoin-native NFTs. After launching in early 2023, Ordinals briefly revitalized Bitcoin’s base layer, bringing in unprecedented retail demand. Transaction volumes surged, fees spiked, and Bitcoin—which historically lacked the smart contract capabilities of chains like Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and Solana ( SOL-USD )—saw renewed relevance as an application layer. From late 2023 through early 2024, Ordinals helped narrow the perceived gap between Bitcoin and more expressive chains by enabling digital collectibles, meme assets, and experimental DeFi primitives on BTC. But in June, activity collapsed: transaction volumes fell 39% month-over-month, marking new 2025 lows and the weakest performance since the latest wave of interest began in late 2024. The decline reflects both cooling speculative interest and structural challenges in sustaining high-fee on-chain activity. While the protocol was an important moment for Bitcoin’s cultural evolution, its volatility underscores the difficulty of building persistent user demand on a chain not optimized for programmability. Bitcoin Pure-Play Stocks Source: FactSet as of 6/19/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Metaplanet (+125%) Metaplanet stood out as a top performer among Bitcoin pure-plays this month, up 125% MoM. The company announced three purchases of Bitcoin: On May 19th, June 2nd, and June 16th, Metaplanet acquired 1,004 , 1,088 , and 1,112 Bitcoin, respectively, bringing its total holdings to 10,000 BTC . The company also announced its 2025-2027 Bitcoin Plan, targeting 210,000 BTC by 2027. While we flag that Metaplanet’s NAV Premium to basic shares ( ~7.1x ) remains elevated compared to Strategy’s ( ~1.8x ) and Semler Scientific’s (~1.1x ), we recognize the company’s dominance as a Bitcoin treasury company in the Japanese and broader Asian markets, in addition to certain tax and regulatory advantages it offers over spot Bitcoin. Strategy (-11%) In late May, Strategy announced its latest Bitcoin acquisition, adding 4,020 to bring its total to 580,250 BTC . On June 6th, Strategy priced a $980M public offering of 10.00% Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock ('STRD'), with proceeds earmarked for further Bitcoin acquisitions and general corporate purposes. The non-cumulative preferred shares, structured to pay quarterly cash dividends when declared, represent Strategy’s latest innovation in capital structure to scale BTC exposure without issuing common equity. While MSTR’s 1M performance was negative, we note that its YTD (+28%) performance still largely outpaces Bitcoin’s (+7%), and that its NAV premium suggests more downside protection than Metaplanet’s. CleanSpark (-7%) CleanSpark ( CLSK ) doubled its BTC treasury year-over-year, now holding 12,502 BTC . In May, it produced 694 BTC , selling only 293.5 . While CleanSpark holds more BTC than Metaplanet, its market cap is only one-third as large, suggesting either a steep discount on miners or a premium on treasuries. Notably, CleanSpark has avoided equity dilution since November 2024, a rare feat in the mining space, and continues to scale through localized energy strategies. Still, the market’s broader view on mining economics remains skeptical. Marathon Digital (-12%) Despite having the highest energized hash rate (58.3 EH/s) and the second-largest BTC treasury ( 49,179 BTC ), Marathon fell 12% MoM, underperforming other pure-plays. While the company has begun building out its own infrastructure, about 45% of its operational hashrate still comes from hosted arrangements, which can limit margins and strategic flexibility, especially when compared to fully integrated miners. Marathon’s past reliance on third-party hosting and its history of equity dilution continue to weigh on investor sentiment. That overhang could persist unless the company transitions more fully to a self-operated model or demonstrates progress in diversifying its revenue base beyond core mining.

Nearly four in ten Americans saddled with credit card debt have been dishonest about it, with wealthier individuals more likely to hide the truth, says LendingTree in a new report. “LendingTree surveyed more than 900 people with credit card debt and found that many feel ashamed about it. Many have chosen to keep quiet about what they owe, while others take it a step further, lying to those closest to them about what they’re going through.” Credit card balances have surged since 2021 when they reached a collective bottom at $770 billion, thanks in part to pandemic-era checks from the government. Since then, things have taken a turn for the worse. • 39% of Americans with credit card debt have lied about it, usually to their spouse, partner, parents or siblings. • 49% feel shame about their level of credit card debt and either downplay or hide the burden. • 46% of Americans now hold at least some credit card debt, and half of Americans making at least six figures have it. • 35% of women with credit card debt will admit it, compared to 21% for men, and baby boomers are more than twice as likely as Gen Zers or Millennials to tell the truth. LendingTree says a majority of Americans feel they have a grip on their credit card debt, regardless of whether they’re comfortable talking with their loved ones about it.

According to Ogle, while Across operates under the appearance of decentralized governance, insiders, including project lead Kevin Chan and CEO Hart Lambur, orchestrated governance proposals requesting large grants from the DAO under the premise of benefiting the protocol but used hidden, insider-linked wallets to manufacture the appearance of broad community support. Allegations of $23M DAO Manipulation Ogle, who also happens to be an adviser for Donald Trump-tied WLFI, claimed that on-chain traces suggest that wallets tied to Chan, including “maxodds.eth,” and others, funded by Lambur and team members, cast decisive “yes” votes to pass treasury proposals that may not have cleared quorum otherwise. He also spoke about a 2023 proposal that transferred 100 million ACX, then valued around $15 million, to Risk Labs under terms that stated the tokens would not be sold for two years, though later discussions indicated token option sales to strategic investors, contradicting initial claims. A subsequent proposal seeking 50 million ACX, worth $7.5 million, also passed with heavy insider wallet support, with Ogle noting that Chan’s wallets accounted for nearly half of the “yes” votes. The pattern, Ogle claimed, indicates that the team proposed and passed grants to their private for-profit entity while maintaining a facade of community governance. He added that these contradict core DAO principles designed to protect against conflicts of interest by ensuring that those controlling a protocol cannot quietly benefit at the expense of the broader token holder community. Ogle also disclosed he holds a long position in the ACX token and has previously transacted with the team. He stated that the alleged misuse of hidden votes to secure large token transfers to Risk Labs not only drains DAO resources but also creates future sell pressure for holders. Lambur Responds: “We Did Nothing Wrong” Lambur, for one, refuted the allegations, calling them “completely untrue.” The exec clarified that Risk Labs is a nonprofit Cayman foundation, not a private for-profit entity, and operates under fiduciary responsibilities. He also explained that the DAO proposals followed transparent processes with public discussions and a seven-day voting period that received no objections. Lambur stated that team members are allowed to buy ACX tokens with personal funds and vote in DAO proposals without disclosing all wallet addresses, while noting that addresses like “maxodds.eth” are publicly linked to Chan and were not used secretly. The co-founder of Across Protocol denied claims that the team sold granted tokens early, pointing out that the Risk Labs multisig still holds more tokens than were granted, aligning with the stated vesting commitments. Lambur acknowledged room for improvement in explicitly disclosing voting participation within proposals but rejected the notion that the DAO votes were manipulated, and stressed Across’s steady protocol growth and commitment to transparency. Lashing out at Ogle’s credibility and motives, he tweeted, “Ogle is completely anonymous, although he was recently (and credibly) accused of insider trading on the Trump memecoin. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but this guy isn’t exactly the most credible actor in our space. Ogle: I doubt I’ll get an apology from you for your incredibly dishonest post. But I hope you think twice before accusing other good teams in the future.” The post Across Protocol Team Accused of a $23M Grab; Co-Founder Responds appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|DAO,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|CORE,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-28 03:15:00

With 2026 seen by many as a defining year for altcoin growth, attention is rapidly turning to fresh contenders making early moves before the broader market rally. Among the new entrants catching serious attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE — a rising altcoin drawing interest from investors seeking stronger early positioning and faster upside potential. Cardano and XRP Eyeing Long-Term Growth Milestones Cardano and XRP have long stood as symbols of perseverance in the altcoin space. Both projects boast extensive roadmaps, long-term institutional interest, and consistent market participation over multiple cycles. Analysts maintain price forecasts suggesting steady appreciation toward psychological milestones — including the much-anticipated $5 mark. However, these projected targets, while optimistic, are increasingly viewed as slow-burn scenarios. For newer investors and early-stage participants, waiting several cycles for top-tier altcoins to fulfill legacy goals may not offer the kind of asymmetric upside many seek in today’s high-volatility environment. The Rise of MAGACOIN FINANCE as a Strategic Early Entry This growing appetite for faster-moving opportunities is what’s pushing MAGACOIN FINANCE into the spotlight. While not yet a household name, the project is drawing focused capital inflows based on one key principle: strategic early access. Previous stages of its rollout sold out quickly, and analyst sentiment around the token is rising due to its fixed-cap structure, emerging momentum indicators, and entry-level pricing that reflects early-stage potential. The project is being positioned by many investors as a high-upside allocation that could surge well before legacy tokens complete their long arcs. Analysts Favor MAGACOIN FINANCE In 2025–2026 With macro indicators aligning for a broad crypto breakout between late 2025 and 2026, early investors are scouting asymmetric bets — tokens that offer explosive potential from a lower market base. These setups historically deliver the highest ROI during bull market phases. MAGACOIN FINANCE has increasingly been mentioned in private research reports and altcoin watchlists as one of the few early-phase tokens that still retains strong upside. Its structure appeals to investors seeking new narratives and capital efficiency, rather than chasing the tail-end of long-established projects. Final Thoughts As Cardano and XRP continue their march toward long-term targets, investors are diversifying into faster-growing altcoins with tighter setups and untapped momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one such token — positioned early, structured for growth, and gaining real traction ahead of schedule. For those seeking new opportunities ahead of the next major altcoin cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a clear rising star with potential to outpace legacy tokens on the road to 2026.

On-chain analytics firm Glassnode reported that within 24 hours, long positions worth $28.6 million and short positions worth $25.2 million were liquidated. This rare two-sided flush left many leveraged traders caught off guard and highlighted the fragility of current sentiment. Speculative Leverage Clears as Open Interest Falls The volatility also led to a 7% decline in BTC-denominated open interest, which dropped from 360,000 BTC to around 334,000 BTC. This decline indicates a reset in speculative leverage, potentially paving the way for a more stable market structure. Bitcoin’s price remained within the $100,000 to $110,000 range, with reduced on-chain activity hinting at a consolidation period rather than the beginning of a new rally. Glassnode noted that both profitability metrics and user participation are currently subdued. Technical Indicators Point to Key Support Levels From a technical viewpoint, Bitcoin’s failure to surpass external liquidity near $109,000 triggered a gradual decline in the short-term trend. On the 4-hour chart, BTC remains trapped within a descending channel, with a key support zone identified between $103,400 and $104,600. This area coincides with a daily fair value gap (FVG) and is backed by the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), raising the likelihood of a short-term bounce if momentum returns. Market Awaits Breakout as Bullish Momentum Stalls If BTC can collect internal liquidity within this critical zone, a bullish breakout above the descending channel remains plausible. However, the current lack of trading momentum and subdued on-chain activity suggests that the market could remain range-bound until stronger demand emerges. Inflation Concerns Weigh on Sentiment Adding to the uncertainty are macroeconomic headwinds. The latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation data, the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge, showed an increase to 2.3%, matching expectations. However, Core PCE rose to 2.7%, slightly above forecasts. This marked the first increase in core inflation since February 2025, reinforcing the Fed’s cautious stance. As a result, expectations of an imminent interest rate cut have been tempered. Tight Financial Conditions Create Pressure for Bitcoin With inflation proving sticky, the Fed is unlikely to lower interest rates soon, keeping financial conditions tight. This environment is generally unfavorable for risk assets like Bitcoin. Glassnode’s quarterly data further highlights the tepid sentiment, with spot trading volume rising only slightly by $7.7 billion in Q2, while transfer volumes declined 36% earlier in the quarter. This combination of macroeconomic pressure and market consolidation suggests that Bitcoin’s next move remains uncertain.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-06-28 03:35:37

On-chain data reveals a surge in whale activity, with hundreds of millions of XRP changing hands. $915M in XRP Snapped Up in One Week In just one week, XRP whales snapped up over 420 million tokens, worth more than $915 million, which shows strong confidence among investors in XRP. However, new wallet creation has dropped to a two-month low, showing that while whales are buying, retail interest remains cautious. Recently, XRP surged 6% to $2.23 as over 108 million XRP traded in a single hour. Whales were highly active during the rally. XRP held steady, backed by strong buying pressure. On-chain data shows that whales have been actively moving XRP over the last two weeks. On June 18, Ripple transferred 200 million XRP (around $439 million) to an unknown wallet, possibly for institutional use or strategic purposes. Meanwhile, on June 12, June 15, and June 19, three large transactions totaling over 80 million XRP (worth around $175 million) were sent from unknown wallets to Coinbase , which were likely whales preparing to sell or take profits. Previously, 230 million XRP were moved from Ripple to an unknown wallet, and 50 million XRP were moved between two unknown wallets. These large transfers point to increased XRP activity. XRP Eyes Breakout Above $2.20 XRP might be trading sideways, but these transactions show that whales are quietly loading up. The number of wallets holding over 1 million XRP also hit a record high of 2,850. Recently, XRP also saw a massive 442.7% jump in daily active addresses, hitting 181,000 in just 24 hours. The major spike in shoes growing user interest and real network activity. XRP is currently trading at $2.18, up 3.6% in the last 24 hours. It is showing gains of 2.7% over the past week and has recovered after dipping below $2.00 earlier in the week. The recent rebound and rising volume show that buyers are stepping in. But for a clear breakout, XRP must hold above $2.20. If rejected, price could revisit the $2.05–$2.10 support. Technicals are mostly neutral with momentum and MACD showing mild bullish signals.

Some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency is preparing for another massive rally toward the $0.50 resistance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Next Price Discovery Coming? Analyst Shares BTC’s 2025 Roadmap SEI Leads Crypto Market As the market recovers from the recent pullback, SEI has soared from its local low and broken out of crucial levels. Earlier this week, the cryptocurrency pulled a nearly 100% rally from its 16% drop. Notably, SEI’s price followed the rest of the market last week and retested the $0.15 level, a support not seen since early April. Over the weekend, the altcoin recovered the crucial $0.20 area before jumping nearly 70% at the start of the week. Since then, the token has been hovering between $0.24 and $0.29, attempting to break out of the $0.30 resistance on Friday morning. Following this performance, analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems named SEI the “Bull of the week,” highlighting the cryptocurrency’s “beast mode” fueled by “the record on-chain activity of the token that has brought in new investors and whales” to the network after the breakout. Notably, the cryptocurrency is leading the top 100 cryptocurrencies list with a 43% weekly surge, surpassing the performance of market leaders Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Crypto Raven noted that SEI “has done a great job of breaking out as the market is looking very fresh right now,” suggesting the cryptocurrency could rally another 70%. Per the post, “if the market supports a bit more, we can very well reach $.5 from here. Back to the glory days of SEI.” Nonetheless, the market watcher considers that the altcoin could consolidate around the current area for a short period before continuing its rally toward the Q4 2024 levels. $0.28 Reclaim Needed For Bullish Continuation Analyst Nebraskangooner highlighted a four-month inverse Head and Shoulders (H&S) pattern on SEI’s chart, noting that it was confirmed after this week’s breakout. The cryptocurrency broke out of the formation’s neckline after Wednesday’s price action, pointing out that “anything down to key support would be a solid retest spot.” After the retracement to the $0.27 area, the cryptocurrency retested the neckline, which SEI must hold for bullish continuation. Notably, SEI’s price has held this level despite closing around the $0.25 mark on Thursday. Similarly, Michaël van de Poppe affirmed that SEI will likely continue to rally as a “massive” bullish divergence on its trading pair against Bitcoin suggests that the cryptocurrency’s price is reversing. Based on this, the analyst forecasted that investors could “see 300+ sats soon.” Related Reading: Solana Price At ‘A Very Delicate Level’ – Analyst Says $148 Reclaim Is Key Meanwhile, market watcher The Wyckoff Architect shared a Low Time Frame (LTF) analysis on SEI’s price action. To the analyst, a reclaim of the Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $0.285 will confirm bullish continuation, with the cryptocurrency consolidating before breaking out. On the contrary, failing to reclaim and hold this area would trigger a bear scenario and risk a drop to a new local low. As of this writing, SEI is trading at $0.28, a 12% increase in the daily timeframe.

ETH just posted a 10% pullback in June, mirroring past patterns that sometimes precede recoveries, but also testing investor patience. XRP, meanwhile, continues to hover in its tight $2.00–$2.30 range, weighed down by persistent selling pressure and sluggish momentum despite strong on-chain signals and whale accumulation. While both are moving sideways at a time when the market is beginning to crave something different—something faster, louder, riskier. That’s where meme coins come in. And among the new contenders, one meme coin is beginning to stand out. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A New Challenger with Explosive Potential Meme coins aren’t new. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu already showed what happens when community hype meets good timing. But the 2025 market is different. It’s more crowded, more cynical—and far more selective. Coins like Dawgz AI and $DAGZ have sparked interest, but none have captured the same kind of raw retail energy as MAGACOIN FINANCE . What’s driving it? Simplicity, timing, and a burning desire among traders to catch the next big run before it hits exchanges. While Ethereum and XRP lean on institutional narratives and long-term fundamentals, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something more immediate: a speculative rocket ship with serious social momentum. Presale rounds are closing quickly. Online chatter is surging. And early buyers are banking on the same pattern that turned SHIBA millionaires overnight—getting in before the wave crests. Of course, overtaking Ethereum or XRP in market cap is highly unlikely. But that’s not the point. No serious trader expects MAGACOIN FINANCE to dethrone Ethereum’s smart contract empire or XRP’s payment infrastructure. What they do see, however, is a coin that could 20x, 50x, even 100x in the right conditions. Not over years—within months. High Risk, High Reward—and High Speed Let’s be honest: Ethereum and XRP aren’t going to make anyone rich overnight at this stage. They’re stable, reliable, and increasingly institution-owned. But for crypto traders still chasing asymmetric upside, a meme coin like MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something the majors can’t—a clean shot at life-changing gains without needing the entire market to cooperate. Yes, it’s volatile. Yes, it’s risky. But that’s the very reason why it’s flying under the radar of cautious investors—and straight into the hands of those who know how this game works. By the time mainstream headlines catch on, it may already be too late.

Bitcoin remained in a tight range around the $107,000 level, while most altcoins plunged. This article provides a forecast for top crypto prices like Ripple (XRP), Livepeer (LPT), and Quant (QNT). XRP price technical analysis XRP price chart | Source: TradingView XRP, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, remained on edge this week as investors waited for another catalyst. It remained slightly below the 50-day moving average, and is now slowly forming a symmetrical triangle pattern whose two lines are about to converge. XRP’s triangle pattern has formed after the token surged by triple digits in November last year. This means that it is part of the bullish pennant pattern, a popular continuation sign in technical analysis. Further, XRP price remains at the strong pivot reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines. It has also formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern. Therefore, the XRP price will likely have a strong bullish breakout in the coming days, with the next point to watch being the psychological point at $2.5. A move above that price will point to more upside, potentially to the year-to-date high of $3.38. The risk, however, is if the XRP price drops below the lower side of the triangle at $1.80. Such a move will lead to more downside over time. Livepeer price technical analysis LPT price chart | Source: TradingView Livepeer is a top cryptocurrency project at the intersection of video and artificial intelligence. It uses a decentralized computing model that enables users to share their resources to simplify the streaming process. Livepeer price jumped sharply last month after being listed on Upbit, the biggest crypto exchange in South Korea. These gains were shortlived as the token crashed from last month’s high of $14.23 to the current $5.90. The daily chart shows that the Livepeer price has remained below the 50-day moving average. It has also dropped below the important support level at $8.43, its lowest level on August 5 last year. Therefore, the most likely situation is where the LPT price continues falling as sellers target the next key support level at $3.30, the lowest point this year. A move above the key resistance level at $8.43 will invalidate the bearish Livepeer forecast. Quant price prediction QNT price chart | Source: TradingView Quant is a top utility crypto project in the financial services industry. Its main product is known as Overledger and is used by top companies like Hitachi and Oracle. It is also part of the ongoing creation of the digital euro project by the European Central Bank (ECB). Overledger ensures interoperability between different blockchains and traditional systems, acting as the gateway that facilitates communication, data transfer, and asset exchanges across multiple distributed ledger technologies (DLT). Quant price rose to $105,20 on Saturday, and is slightly below the important resistance level at $120. It has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, a popular continuation signs in technical analysis. Quant is now forming the handle section and has already moved above the 50-day moving average. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where it bounces back to the upper side of the cup at $120. This cup has a depth of about 70%. Measuring the same distance from the upper side brings the eventual Quant price target to $180.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. 3 leading crypto gems under $5 could explode in the 2025 bull run; one with potential for 8,000% gains. Table of Contents Little Pepe: The $0.0012 memecoin gearing up for a layer-2 takeover TRON: The silent giant gunning for $1 Hedera: Enterprise powerhouse trading at a discount Final thoughts As the 2025 bull market begins to stir from its slumber, savvy investors are already positioning themselves into what could be the year’s most explosive low-cap crypto opportunities. While blue chips like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate headlines, the real alpha often lies beneath the surface, among coins trading under $5, with asymmetric upside potential and strong fundamentals. Here are three such tokens poised for outsized gains in 2025, each trading below $5, and one of them could deliver an astonishing 8,000% return. You might also like: From meme to the moon: Why LILPEPE might outperform XRP this bull cycle Little Pepe: The $0.0012 memecoin gearing up for a layer-2 takeover Fresh off the swamps of meme history and armed with real Layer 2 innovation, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) isn’t an average frog coin. It’s a project that fuses memetic culture with serious blockchain infrastructure, and early indicators suggest it’s poised to leap ahead of the memecoin pack. Unlike typical ERC-20 memecoins, LILPEPE is powering its own Layer 2 blockchain, promising ultra-low fees, rapid finality, and a native token economy rooted in decentralization. With zero buy or sell tax, the protocol stays true to DeFi’s original promise: financial freedom with zero friction. The current Stage 3 presale price is just $0.0012, with nearly $1.85 million already raised out of a $2.525 million cap. Over 1.6 billion tokens have been sold, and interest continues to surge, thanks in part to the project’s wild $777k giveaway . Participants who contribute $100 or more and complete social tasks stand a chance to win $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. What sets LILPEPE apart isn’t just its meme-fueled marketing blitz, it’s the plan. A full Layer-2 ecosystem, exchange listings, and a roadmap that humorously but clearly outlines product and community growth. With only $0.0012 entry pricing and an eye on becoming the “KING” of Layer 2s, LILPEPE could be the Shiba Inu of 2025, but with real tech under the hood. A return to just $0.10 would mark an 8,000% increase, and considering its unique value prop, that might not be as far-fetched as it sounds. TRON: The silent giant gunning for $1 While meme mania grabs attention, seasoned investors are watching TRON (TRX) with laser focus. TRON has stealthily become the 8th largest cryptocurrency by market cap , recently overtaking Dogecoin. What’s more impressive is that this rise has been driven not by social media buzz, but by fundamentals. TRON’s daily USDT transaction volume continues to outpace Ethereum, and its network efficiency is attracting significant institutional capital. A $210 million reverse initial public offering IPO, increased Grayscale inflows, and superior network utility have all contributed to its quiet dominance. From a technical standpoint, TRON is forming a bullish setup aligned with Fibonacci extension patterns. Analysts suggest a target of $1 by late summer, especially if the price holds above the $0.27 support level and pushes through the $0.30-$0.32 resistance range. That’s over 3x from current levels; a highly realistic target with strong risk-reward symmetry. Source: Tradingview Hedera: Enterprise powerhouse trading at a discount Current Price: ~$0.15 Potential Return: 600% Hedera (HBAR) may have endured a brutal correction, crashing over 60% from its 2025 high of $0.40, but analysts agree: this could be the perfect accumulation zone. Trading volume is beginning to recover, and the project’s long-standing partnerships with enterprises like IBM, Google, and Boeing continue to differentiate it from more speculative Layer 1s. Source: CoinMarketCap Structurally, HBAR boasts some of the fastest finality and lowest energy consumption in the industry, making it ideal for enterprise smart contracts and regulated environments. As ESG narratives grow stronger in the second half of 2025, Hedera’s carbon-negative framework could become a unique selling point. If momentum returns, reclaiming its former $0.40 level is likely the first target. To this day, specialists mention a rise towards $1.00 if capital rotation focuses on highly efficient chains and Hedera continues growing its ecosystem. Final thoughts The crypto space continues to evolve, but one truth remains: undervalued assets with real use cases — or the meme magic to spark virality — can outperform expectations. Little Pepe, TRON, and Hedera each represent different corners of the market: meme-driven L2 innovation, infrastructure-grade scalability, and enterprise adoption. For investors seeking high-upside bets under $5, these three names offer uniquely asymmetric profiles for 2025, and perhaps a shot at generational wealth.

XRP and Solana—once the stars of institutional portfolios and retail speculation—are no longer sparking the kind of excitement they once commanded. A wave of new capital is moving elsewhere, and for analysts watching the market closely, the story is becoming increasingly clear: presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE are starting to define the year’s real opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Wildcard Investors Are Betting On MAGACOIN FINANCE is accelerating and its presale is quickly becoming the magnet for speculative capital and analyst attention alike. The appeal? It’s not just the price—it’s the architecture. A 170 billion token cap, zero VC unlock schedules, and a completed HashEx audit give the project a rare combination of scarcity, transparency, and trust. More importantly, it’s moving fast. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already raised eight figures in presale contributions, with each new round vanishing quicker than the last. There’s an energy behind it that hasn’t been seen in the market since the early days of DOGE or SHIB. But unlike those memes, this one is launching with a blueprint—real tokenomics, clear timelines, and smart contract validation. Analysts are taking notice. Some see a 25x path. Others, citing early momentum and viral growth, are floating numbers north of 75x or even 100x if the trend holds. In a market hungry for volatility and returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just filling a void—it’s lighting one up. Established Coins Like XRP and Solana are Fading Energy For XRP, the path looked promising at the start of the year. Legal clarity was a win, and a Canadian ETF gave the asset a stronger institutional profile. But the price has struggled to reflect that progress. Range-bound between key resistance and weak demand zones, XRP now finds itself stuck in a holding pattern. Momentum traders? They’ve moved on. Solana’s case is different—but no less telling. After explosive growth in 2023 and 2024, its DeFi metrics are weakening. TVL has dropped, and SOL’s 19% decline over the past month paints a picture of fatigue. Developers remain active, and the chain’s fundamentals are solid, but the hype engine is cooling. Without a confirmed ETF or major catalyst, SOL feels like it’s coasting—at least for now. Final Words The 2025 market isn’t lacking in options—it’s lacking in ignition. XRP and Solana may still have long-term value, but right now, they’re not moving the needle. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, is proving that early-stage hype—when paired with solid fundamentals—can be a powerful force. The presale window won’t stay open forever. And if analyst forecasts are right, missing this one could be this cycle’s biggest regret.

A massive $24.6 million transfer to Robinhood, reported by Whale Alert, follows a 7% price surge, yet volatility persists. Geopolitical tensions, including a shaky U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Iran, have rattled crypto markets. Dogecoin’s price hovers at $0.164, struggling against a descending channel pattern. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in its presale phase 5, raising $11,200,000 with over 570 million tokens sold to 12,500 holders. Could this DeFi project outshine Dogecoin? Investors are watching closely. Let’s explore the dynamics shaping these crypto coins. Dogecoin’s price wobble Dogecoin’s recent price action is raising eyebrows. Trading at $0.164, the memecoin climbed 7% in 24 hours but hit resistance at $0.165. A whale’s 155 million DOGE dump coincided with a 12% spike to $0.1674 before a pullback. Trading volume dropped 10%, signaling weak momentum. On-chain data from CoinGlass shows $18.34 million in DOGE leaving exchanges, hinting at accumulation by long-term holders. This could ease selling pressure. However, Dogecoin remains trapped in a descending channel. A daily close above $0.17 might trigger a 20-50% rally. For now, uncertainty clouds Dogecoin’s path. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a fresh alternative. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shines in presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in the crypto market with its presale success. Phase 5 is underway, over 50% filled, with tokens priced at $0.03—a 200% rise from phase one’s $0.01. The window to buy at this level is closing fast, as phase 6 will lift prices 16.7% to $0.035. With a launch price of $0.06, buyers now secure a guaranteed 100% ROI. Projections suggest MUTM could hit $3 post-launch in 2025, offering a staggering 100x return. Over 570 million tokens are sold, and 12,500 holders are onboard. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving its mettle. Let’s dive into its unique offerings. Innovative DeFi lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its dual lending system. Its Peer-to-Contract model uses smart contracts for automated, market-responsive interest rates, ensuring stability. The Peer-to-Peer approach connects lenders and borrowers directly, ideal for volatile assets. Users retain full asset control, unlike centralized platforms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also introduces mtTokens, which represent deposits and accrue interest, tradable within the ecosystem. A staking module rewards mtToken holders via token buybacks, fostering long-term gains. Furthermore, a native stablecoin on Ethereum will enhance liquidity and reduce volatility risks. This robust framework positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top crypto to buy now. Security and transparency elevate its appeal. Security and community incentives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is prioritizing trust with a CertiK audit, scoring 95.00 for security. No vulnerabilities were found in its smart contracts, and no incidents occurred in 90 days.

46932372,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=756758,1751086633,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46932372.jpeg,Gemini offers tokenized MSTR to its EU customers,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/gemini-gives-eu-tokenized-shares-of-us-firms/,"Crypto exchange Gemini is expanding into tokenized stocks, offering its EU clientele early access. The company settled on tokenized shares of Strategy for its initial rollout. That means Gemini users in the EU can now purchase MSTR on the platform and move it freely on the chain. It insisted that all one needs now to access the tokenized shares is a smartphone and an internet connection. Nonetheless, the company plans to tap into more stocks and ETFs in the near future. Gemini aims to export US equities all over the world So far, tokenized MSTR on Gemini is tradable on Arbitrum, the Ethereum Layer 2 , though the platform claimed it would expand to more networks. The company is also working with blockchain-based startup Dinari, aiming to offer enhanced liquidity, transparency, and—where allowed—economic rights equivalent to those of the underlying asset. Their collaboration will also allow Gemini users to buy fractional shares of Strategy as on-chain tokens backed by real securities. Its Friday announcement read, “Combining the best assets in the world with the 24/7/365 form factor of crypto is how we reimagine and rebuild the financial system. ” The firm’s goal is to export US equities globally and connect the world’s greatest companies to the people. The company is not the only one pursuing tokenized shares, with major crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken looking for the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval to venture into the space. Nevertheless, the exchanges’ likelihood of receiving broker-dealer licenses is high at the moment, especially in light of Dinari’s recent approval. However, the platform can only offer the equities to non-US users. Dinari’s tokenized equities, dShares, are now available on decentralized finance platforms, including Coinbase’s Base blockchain network. Gabriel Otte, the co-founder and CEO of Dinari, asserted that their goal was to elevate the entire financial system, wanting to establish an on-chain exchange. Plume Network and Backed also pursue the RWA tokenized space to provide users with popular US stocks like Tesla and Apple. Gemini rolled out Solana staking services Gemini recently launched Solana staking services for ETFs, corporations, and high-net-worth individuals. The exchange stated that users can now earn staking rewards on the Solana network while enjoying the advantages of their cold storage wallets. Moreover, users can choose their preferred validator or rely on Gemini’s in-house validator. The company also partnered with Purpose Investments , offering its Solana ETF (SOLL). SOLL represents Purpose Investments’ second staking ETF, which is supported by Gemini’s custody and staking infrastructure. Vlad Tasevski, Chief Investment Officer at Purpose Investments, even argued that the company’s partnership with Gemini will strengthen its Canadian market and build trust with investors. Solana treasury company DeFi Development Corp. is also working with Gemini while it increases its SOL holdings and stakes them over time.

At the time of writing, ETH is trading around $2,423, marking a slight 0.9% daily decrease and standing more than 50% below its all-time high of $4,878. This stagnation has coincided with a broader lack of catalysts to drive a sustained rally, leaving traders cautious about Ethereum’s near-term trajectory. Despite this lack of price momentum, network activity on Ethereum tells a different story. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims $2,444 Level – Bullish Continuation In Focus Ethereum On-Chain Metrics Point to Increased Network Engagement According to CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Alemán, the number of confirmed transactions on the Ethereum network recently spiked to 1,750,940, making it the third-highest daily transaction count in its history. Alemán notes this trend may signal underlying usage strength, even as market participants wait for a more significant price response. Alemán’s analysis focuses on Ethereum’s “Transaction Count (Total)” metric, which captures all forms of activity, including ETH transfers, smart contract executions, and interactions with decentralized applications and DeFi protocols. The recent surge reverses a months-long downtrend and represents the highest transaction count since January 14, when Ethereum recorded 1.96 million transactions. According to Alemán, this spike may be driven by increased arbitrage, trading activity, and interactions with Layer 2 networks, which continue to absorb substantial transaction volume. Platforms like Arbitrum and Optimism remain key contributors to Ethereum’s broader usage. He further points out that, despite ETH price volatility within the $2,100–$2,880 range in recent weeks, the uptick in network traffic may hint at early-stage accumulation or renewed DeFi interest. This dynamic, while not immediately reflected in the asset’s valuation, suggests that Ethereum’s core infrastructure continues to see meaningful use. Speculative Behavior and Exchange Flows Raise Short-Term Concerns Separately, another CryptoQuant analyst, Amr Taha, has examined Ethereum’s recent technical setup from a derivatives market perspective. Taha highlights that ETH funding rates on Binance have shifted from negative to positive territory, a sign that leveraged long positions are building, which may reflect expectations of continued price upside. However, this shift also raises the potential for overextension, particularly if longs begin to dominate positioning. Related Reading: Ethereum Fakes Out Bears – Altcoin Rally Depends On Key Level Breakout Taha also references a recent retest of a key short-squeeze zone, during which market participants who had shorted ETH were forced to close positions, triggering rapid buy orders. Such moves can generate short-term surges, but they’re often followed by correction phases once speculative energy fades. Meanwhile, exchange data showed more than 177,000 ETH deposited on Binance over three days, indicating potential sell pressure or repositioning by large holders.

What’s fueling this interest? For starters, the project’s early presale phases have been met with overwhelming demand. Over 20,000 people have joined its growing community, and more than 5,000 investors have already jumped in. This isn’t just a meme coin with flashy branding. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a capped supply, a staking system with strong APY, and an audited smart contract. The tech is legit, and that’s making a big difference in how seriously it’s being taken. Cryptocurrency is known for its wild cycles and unexpected turns. And right now, it looks like the spotlight is shifting. Traders who once stuck close to familiar names like Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano are starting to move in a new direction—toward a lesser-known but quickly rising contender called MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts Predict Big Upside Several crypto analysts have pointed to MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential standout this year, with some forecasting returns as high as 30x or more for those who bought in early. That kind of excitement has drawn comparisons to early-stage runs of coins like Shiba Inu—but with stronger fundamentals to back it up. As capital shifts away from older projects weighed down by regulation or stagnation, this new altcoin is catching fire. The timing is right, and so far, the execution is matching the hype. Big Players Face Headwinds Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap, is hovering near $2,500. It’s seen a decent bump thanks to ETF inflows and interest from institutions. But even with those positives, it’s struggling to break through the $2,600 level. XRP isn’t faring much better. It’s down around $2.10 after peaking earlier this year, despite Ripple settling its long-running legal battle with the SEC. Then there’s Cardano. Priced below $0.74, ADA has been hurt by controversy tied to its founder. While its developer activity remains high, recent headlines have left investors wary. Final Take MAGACOIN FINANCE may be new, but it’s already making a case for itself. With a strong start, growing community support, and serious analyst attention, it’s quickly becoming more than just another speculative token. For those watching the crypto space closely, this might be one of the more interesting stories of 2025—and potentially, one of its biggest surprises.

Here’s What Is Next,https://timestabloid.com/big-news-for-xrp-ripple-officially-ends-cross-appeal-heres-what-is-next/,"Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer, Brad Garlinghouse, has officially announced that the company is dropping its cross-appeal in the long-standing legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to Garlinghouse, the SEC is also expected to withdraw its appeal as previously indicated. This decision marks a significant development in the legal proceedings between Ripple and the SEC , signaling, as Garlinghouse describes it, the closing of a key chapter in the case. In his statement, Garlinghouse emphasized that the company is now fully focused on advancing its primary mission of building the Internet of Value. Ripple’s Strategic Decision Following Court Options The CEO’s announcement came shortly after a statement from Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty. Alderoty addressed the legal context surrounding this decision, clarifying that the court had given Ripple two clear options. The company could either dismiss its appeal, which challenged the court’s earlier finding on historical institutional sales, or proceed with the appeal process. Alderoty indicated that the decision to withdraw the appeal reflects Ripple’s strategic choice to move forward operationally while reinforcing that the legal status of XRP remains unaffected. He underscored that XRP’s classification as not being a security in secondary market sales remains unchanged and intact. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Context Behind the Appeal Withdrawal This development follows the recent ruling by Judge Analisa Torres, who denied the joint motion submitted by both Ripple and the SEC seeking to modify certain key terms in the court’s final judgment. The denial of the joint request prompted both parties to reconsider their next steps within the litigation process. Alderoty’s comments suggest that Ripple weighed the court’s directive carefully before determining that dismissing the appeal was in the company’s best interest. XRP’s Legal Status Remains Unchanged Garlinghouse’s message further signals Ripple’s clear intention to redirect its focus away from the prolonged legal challenges and toward its operational goals. The reference to building the Internet of Value reflects Ripple’s continued efforts to expand its global payments infrastructure and further the adoption of blockchain-based financial solutions. His statement conveys a strong message of closure regarding this phase of litigation, indicating confidence in the company’s legal position and strategic direction. Closing the Chapter and Looking Ahead Alderoty’s remarks also make it clear that the decision does not impact the broader clarity Ripple achieved through previous court rulings, particularly the ruling that XRP is not a security in secondary sales. He reaffirmed that, despite the decision to withdraw the appeal related to past institutional sales, the company’s operations will proceed without interruption. The expectation that the SEC will also formally drop its appeal aligns with prior indications from the regulatory body. There is a mutual understanding to bring this phase of the legal dispute to a close. The conclusion of this chapter removes a significant legal overhang that has persisted since the case was first filed in December 2020.

As the platform’s activity is boosting with increasing inflows of top cryptos like BTC to Binance, growing institutional participation, and consistent BNB utility through trading and fee reductions. The stage is set for a strong upside in the BNB price trajectory and experts are projecting targets above $900 mark. Keep reading to know more. BTC Inflows Indicate Rising User Activity In Binance In recent data shared by an analyst , BTC inflows to Binance have surged, but this data showed a bigger picture for BNB than BTC. The broader implications go beyond BTC alone. Since BTC is the most dominant crypto holding over $2 trillion market cap, and a significantly large proportion of exchange-related activities occur on Binance. This itself is a strong optimistic point for Binance’s fundamentals. A closer look at its BTC inflows rising on Binance is a clear indication that BSC is witnessing growing user activity, which is evident by BSC’s daily transactions chart and active addresses chart of H1 2025. This reveals a more compelling narrative for Binance Coin (BNB), as this directly reveals that investor engagement on Binance rises, and BNB stands to benefit fundamentally. Binance Liquidity On Rise Similarly, when capital flows to an exchange, utility tokens like BNB are used for ecosystem access that boosts both demand and value. Based on CryptoQuant’s chart, the metric “exchange inflow – spent output value bands (%)” revealed that Whale-level transactions (10K BTC) spiked on June 16th, representing 83 percent of all inflows. This indicates that whale presence on Binance is advancing and is beneficial for the ecosystem. This indicates that capital inflows of institutional entities are rising. Source: cryptoquant Since, it’s a fact that liquidity is a key driver of any exchange’s health, and Binance is witnessing a rise in liquidity with advancing BTC inflows, which means more traders, higher order book depth, and tighter spreads. Therefore, as its platform utility gains organically, the BNB price rise seems imminent. Also, the current conditions are laying the groundwork for a strong bullish outlook for the BNB price in the coming weeks or months. Analyst Hints at a Rise Towards $900 in BNB Price Last year, the BNB price saw a magnificent climb from $202 to $794. However, bears dropped their price to $510 in Q1 of 2025. Later, in Q2, bullish momentum reawakened by hitting $698 by the last week of May. [post_titles_links postid=”475863″] Despite this growth, BNB has been stuck in a sideways trend for the past four weeks in June. This price action appears like a descending triangle pattern in the short term, and a breakout could propel it to $700 in the short term, with a recent catalyst to be activated on June 30th with the Maxwell hard fork . However, the long-term gains depend on its platform’s utility, which also appears to be promising. On a high time frame, the $BNB chart is really screaming for higher, especially when compared with the rest of the market. The price is just consolidating below a key resistance level, aligned with the previous cycle top. So we are really close to price discovery. The structure… pic.twitter.com/PXubnSAZJ0 — Sjuul | AltCryptoGems (@AltCryptoGems) June 27, 2025 Moreover, an analyst, AltCryptoGems, projected that the BNB price is trading in a long-term ascending channel and BNB is close to entering a price discovery mode for targets above $900.

The new offering announced on Friday expands on Robinhood’s existing crypto product lineup. Micro SOL, XRP Futures Contracts Go Live On Robinhood Robinhood has added micro futures contracts for XRP and Solana, and Bitcoin Friday futures to its trading platform. Micro futures are smaller contracts that allow retail and smaller-scale investors to speculate on or hedge against the price action of assets like stock indices, commodities, or currencies with lower capital requirements and less risk compared to standard futures. The Menlo Park, California-headquartered zero-commission trading venue already offers standard XRP and Solana futures on its platform. These are micro versions of standard cash-settled contracts offered by Chicago-based derivatives behemoth CME Group. The new micro XRP futures represent 2,500 XRP per contract (around $5,200 at publication time). Robinhood announced its foray into crypto futures earlier this year. At the time, the company said the rollout would initially be limited to Bitcoin and Ether. However, it later expanded to XRP and Solana futures. One way the U.S.-based trading firm has bolstered its crypto offerings is via strategic acquisitions of key players in the space. Earlier this month, Robinhood sealed a $200 million acquisition of crypto exchange Bitstamp — a deal pundits suggest will help it expand worldwide. The broker is extending its focus on derivatives as an effort to compete with established players like Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley’s E*TRADE, which already offer crypto futures. Besides Robinhood, several prominent derivatives platforms have expanded their crypto suite under the new crypto-friendly Donald Trump administration. As ZyCrypto reported , the CME Group debuted its XRP futures on May 19, setting the stage for the eventual greenlighting of spot-based XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). They registered approximately $542 million in notional monthly volume , which indicates strong institutional appetite. According to Bloomberg analysts, there is now a staggering 95% likelihood of spot XRP products being approved for launch in 2025.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|SOL|Solana|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|SOL|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-28 05:19:32

Ripple has decided to drop its cross-appeal in its long-running court battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse made the announcement on social media on June 27. He also revealed that the SEC is expected to drop its own appeal soon. In a statement, Garlinghouse said, “We’re closing this chapter once and for all, and focusing on what’s most important – building the Internet of Value.” XRP Price Update Following the news, XRP’s price turned green and showed a small recovery. However, if we look at the bigger picture, XRP is still in a bearish trend. This means the price has been making lower highs and lower lows over time. Like most downtrends, there are short-term bounces where the price moves up a bit before heading lower again. To officially confirm a bullish trend reversal, XRP would need to form a higher low or break above a key resistance level, showing signs of strength. As of now, those signals haven’t shown up yet. Key Levels to Watch Here are the important support and resistance levels for XRP in the coming days: Support: The price has been finding support between $2.25 to $2.21. If XRP falls below this, the next major support is between $1.92 to $1.95, which is where the price recently bounced back from. Resistance: On the upside, XRP is facing resistance at around $2.19 to $2.20. If it manages to break this level, the next hurdles are at $2.25 and then between $2.30 to $2.35. At the moment, not much has changed in XRP’s overall price action.

In just the first half of the year, hackers have stolen over $2.1 billion across 75 incidents, according to a new report from TRM Labs , marking a 50% increase from previous years. Crypto Thefts Skyrocket in 2025 TRM Labs highlighted that infrastructure attacks—including private key thefts, seed phrase breaches, and front-end hijacks—accounted for over 80% of the stolen funds. These attacks were often ten times larger than other exploit types and typically enabled by social engineering or insider access. “These breaches expose critical weaknesses at the foundation of cryptosecurity,” said TRM Labs. North Korea Behind $1.6 Billion in Crypto Hacks The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) has been linked to a staggering $1.6 billion in stolen crypto this year—about 70% of the total. The largest hack was reportedly on Bybit , a Dubai-based exchange, pushing the average hack size to $30 million in 2025, double the $15 million average in 2024. North Korea continues to exploit crypto markets to evade international sanctions, making it one of the most dangerous state actors in the digital asset space. [post_titles_links postid=”474444″] Israeli Hacker Linked to $100M Nobitex Breach In another shocking case, Nobitex, an Iranian exchange, lost $100 million in crypto during a coordinated attack in June 2025. Investigations revealed that the hack was led by Israeli cybercriminal Gonjeshke Darande, highlighting how geopolitical tensions are now directly impacting crypto security. How Crypto Companies Can Protect Themselves TRM Labs outlined several key steps to combat these growing threats: Cold storage for user funds Multi-factor authentication (MFA) Regular security audits Insider threat detection systems Social engineering countermeasures Transparent communication with users With crypto hacks becoming more frequent and severe, platforms must act quickly. From wallet breaches to exchange exploits, the global crypto ecosystem is under pressure. As high-stakes actors like North Korea and Israel-based groups intensify their attacks, implementing robust security frameworks is no longer optional—it’s essential.

North Korea orchestrates large-scale thefts using sophisticated phishing, social engineering (e.g., fake job offers, deepfake Zoom calls), supply chain compromises, and private key thefts. They primarily use stolen funds to evade international sanctions and finance their illicit weapons programs, including nuclear and ballistic missile development. What are the main vulnerabilities in crypto infrastructure that hackers are exploiting? Hackers are primarily exploiting critical infrastructure weaknesses, including stolen private keys, compromised seed phrases, and front-end hijacks. They also target DeFi smart contracts through vulnerabilities like re-entrancy exploits and flash loan manipulations. What are crypto companies and exchanges doing to respond to this surge in hacks? Crypto companies are responding by reinforcing fundamental security measures like multi-factor authentication (MFA), cold storage for funds, regular security audits, and implementing insider threat detection systems. They are also improving social engineering countermeasures and engaging in international collaboration with law enforcement to track and disrupt these networks.",News|Hack,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-28 05:30:59

Ripple is officially pulling back its cross appeal, and the SEC is expected to do the same. After years of courtroom drama, this could mark the end of one of crypto’s most high-profile battles. Recently, Judge Torres rejected a joint request from the SEC and Ripple to approve a proposed settlement. The deal aimed to cut Ripple’s civil penalty to $50 million and lift the permanent injunction. One of the X users noted that it’s not over until the SEC formally confirms. Bill Morgan shared that a vote from SEC commissioners is still needed, but it’s now just a matter of when, not if. SEC Vote Still Needed, But Outcome Is Certain Former SEC official Marc Fagel explains the SEC still needs to formally vote to drop its appeal. The SEC’s previous vote only approved the proposed agreement, not a full case dismissal. Since the settlement was conditional and the court didn’t approve it, the SEC now needs to hold a separate vote to officially drop the appeal. Injunction Remains Marc Fagel confirms that while the Ripple-SEC litigation is effectively over, the injunction against Ripple remains in place. When asked about Ripple’s institutional strategy, he warns distributing XRP through other companies could still violate securities laws, though he noted the current SEC’s lax enforcement makes outcomes unpredictable. So, the fact that Ripple was ready with this decision less than a day from the Torres ruling means it at least heavily planned for this scenario, discussed it with the SEC, and made whatever agreements/discussions necessary for moving forward. Thank heavens this is over! https://t.co/4gX0pIgyWj — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) June 28, 2025 Attorney Fred Rispoli weighed in on Ripple’s surprise announcement and noted that the timing was not accidental. Ripple’s decision to drop its cross appeal came just a day after Judge Torres’ final judgment, which shows that the outcome was likely planned in advance. According to Rispoli, Ripple and the SEC had already discussed the terms behind closed doors, setting the stage to quietly bring this long battle to a close. 2023 Ruling Stands: XRP Not a Security in Retail Sales XRP price jumped to $2.15 following the announcement. The case will fully close once the SEC also drops its appeal, which is expected in the coming weeks.

The key reason behind this price rise is a major shift in whale behavior. According to data from CryptoQuant , XRP’s 90-day moving average of whale flows turned positive in early May. This is significant because the last time this metric turned green, XRP soared 420% in just one month. After months of outflows between January and April, the renewed inflows suggest that whales are showing interest again, possibly preparing for a major breakout in the coming months. CTO David Schwartz also confirmed more acquisitions are coming, raising investor confidence. Ripple (XRP) Whales Signal Growing Confidence Futures trader Dom noted that wallets holding more than 1 million XRP have reached a record high of 2,850. Meanwhile, wallets holding over 10,000 XRP have increased by 6.2% since the start of the year, totaling 306,000. This rise in large and mid-sized wallet holders highlights growing long-term investor confidence in XRP, even though the price has remained relatively stable for some time. Is XRP Going To Go Up ? Yes, XRP is showing strong signs of resilience and potential for a breakout. Despite a notable drop in trading volume on Binance—hitting its lowest since August 2020—XRP has consistently closed above the $2 mark every month since December 2024. This sustained price level suggests solid underlying strength. Adding to the bullish outlook, whale flows have turned positive for the first time in months, indicating renewed interest from large holders who often lead major price moves. On the institutional side, CME XRP futures have recorded a massive $542.8 million in volume in just one month, signaling strong demand from both professional and retail investors. While volume metrics show caution, the price action and rising institutional involvement suggest XRP could be setting up for a bigger rally soon. [post_titles_links postid=”475916″] XRP SEC Lawsuit Finally Enters Conclusion Ripple is dropping our cross appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they’ve previously said.

Lock in. https://t.co/ZsRgDfcpLh — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) June 27, 2025 The sentiment turned positive also because, finally, after a decade, Ripple will drop its cross-appeal , and the SEC is expected to do the same. CEO Brad Garlinghouse says the Ripple vs SEC case is finally closing. The market reacted positively, with XRP jumping 3%, as traders viewed the resolution as removing a major cloud over XRP’s future. Meanwhile, Polymarket gives a 76% chance of an XRP spot ETF approval by year-end, giving XRP a positive hope to XRP investors. Analysts like XForceGlobal see the recent dip to $1.90 as a healthy setup for the next leg up. If XRP breaks above $2.65, it could open the door to a bigger rally. With Ripple’s ongoing expansion and growing futures demand, sentiment is shifting in XRP’s favor.

Imagine a giant financial ripple spreading across the global market – that’s precisely the kind of buzz generated when a significant Bitcoin transfer takes place. Recently, the crypto community was abuzz following reports of a colossal 7,999 BTC, valued at approximately $858 million at the time, being moved from the prominent exchange Coinbase to an unknown new wallet. This single transaction has ignited widespread speculation, prompting many to ask: What does this mean for Bitcoin and the broader crypto landscape? What Just Happened? Decoding the Massive Bitcoin Transfer The cryptocurrency tracking service Whale Alert, known for monitoring large on-chain movements, reported the intriguing transaction that saw 7,999 BTC depart from Coinbase. For context, this amount of Bitcoin represents a significant portion of the total circulating supply and a substantial sum of money by any standard. The transfer’s destination, an ‘unknown new wallet,’ immediately raises questions and fuels curiosity within the community. When such a large sum of Bitcoin moves, it’s akin to a major tremor in the financial world. These aren’t your everyday retail transactions; they are the movements of entities with substantial holdings, often referred to as ‘whales.’ The sheer size of this particular Bitcoin transfer suggests it was executed by an individual, institution, or group with considerable financial power and strategic intent. Key details of the transaction: Amount: 7,999 BTC Origin: Coinbase exchange Destination: An unknown, newly created wallet address Approximate Value: $858 million (at the time of transfer) Reported by: Whale Alert Understanding these details is the first step in unraveling the potential implications of such a monumental event. Who is Behind the Crypto Whale Movement? The term ‘ crypto whale ‘ refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices. When a whale makes a move, the crypto world takes notice. The identity of the owner of this particular 7,999 BTC remains shrouded in mystery, as is common with most large on-chain transactions unless the wallet is explicitly linked to a known entity (like an exchange’s cold storage or a public company). There are several theories about who might be behind such a significant movement and their motivations: Institutional Investor: Large financial institutions, hedge funds, or corporations are increasingly allocating capital to Bitcoin. This could be a new entrant making a significant purchase for long-term holding. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Desk: An OTC desk might be moving funds after facilitating a large private transaction between a buyer and a seller, bypassing the open market to avoid price slippage. Exchange Rebalancing: While the funds moved *from* Coinbase, it’s possible another exchange or a large custodial service is rebalancing its cold storage or hot wallets. Individual High-Net-Worth Investor: A very wealthy individual could be moving their substantial holdings for security reasons or preparing for a private transaction. Preparation for Sale/Distribution: Less likely if moving to an ‘unknown new wallet’ as opposed to another exchange, but still a possibility for future distribution or different custodial arrangements. The challenge lies in the pseudonymous nature of blockchain. While we can see the transactions, identifying the real-world entities behind the addresses requires more sophisticated forensic analysis, which is often not publicly available. The Significance of Coinbase in Large BTC Movements Coinbase is one of the largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchanges globally, especially popular among institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals in the Western world. Its reputation for security and compliance makes it a trusted gateway for significant capital flows into and out of the crypto market. When funds move *off* an exchange like Coinbase, it often suggests a few things: Long-Term Holding (Cold Storage): Many investors prefer to move large amounts of Bitcoin off exchanges into personal cold storage wallets (e.g., hardware wallets) for enhanced security, indicating a long-term hodling strategy rather than immediate trading. Private Transactions: The funds might be destined for an OTC deal, where a buyer and seller agree on a price off-exchange. Diversification of Custody: An entity might be diversifying its custodial arrangements across multiple platforms or moving funds to a self-custody solution. Conversely, large inflows *to* an exchange can sometimes signal an intent to sell, as assets need to be on an exchange to be traded. Therefore, an outflow from Coinbase , especially of this magnitude, is often interpreted positively by the market as it suggests accumulation and reduced selling pressure, though this is not always a definitive indicator. Analyzing the BTC Movement: What On-Chain Data Reveals The beauty of blockchain technology lies in its transparency. Every BTC movement is recorded on a public ledger, making ‘on-chain analysis’ a powerful tool for understanding market dynamics. While the identity of the whale remains unknown, the data itself provides valuable insights. On-chain analysis involves examining transactions, wallet balances, and other data points directly from the blockchain. For this particular transaction, analysts would look at: Transaction Fees: Indicating the urgency or priority the sender placed on the transfer. Wallet History: If the receiving wallet later moves funds, or if it has received funds from other known sources, it can provide clues. Exchange Balances: A significant outflow from Coinbase could slightly reduce its BTC reserves, which some analysts monitor as an indicator of market sentiment. However, it’s crucial to note that on-chain data, while transparent, is not always straightforward to interpret. A single large transaction does not necessarily dictate market direction. It’s one data point among many, and its true significance often only becomes clear in retrospect or when combined with other market indicators. Comparison to Previous Whale Moves: Historically, similar large transfers have sometimes preceded significant market shifts, but often they are simply logistical moves. For instance, in late 2020 and early 2021, numerous large BTC transfers off exchanges preceded Bitcoin’s parabolic bull run, signaling institutional accumulation. However, not every large move has such a dramatic follow-up. The challenge for on-chain analysis is distinguishing between routine operational transfers and those with market-moving intent. Potential Market Impact and Future Outlook So, what’s the big picture? Does a single 7,999 BTC transfer from Coinbase immediately spell doom or boom for the market? The reality is often more nuanced. While the initial reaction might be speculation and heightened interest, the direct impact on price is not guaranteed. Potential Market Impact: Factor Potential Positive Implication Potential Negative Implication Market Sentiment Could signal long-term holding, reducing supply on exchanges. Could spark fear if misinterpreted as preparation for a dump. Liquidity Removes BTC from immediate trading pools. No direct negative impact on liquidity unless funds are moved to illiquid addresses. Price Action Often seen as bullish (accumulation). No immediate bearish signal unless followed by other selling indicators. Actionable Insights for Readers: Don’t Panic: A single large transaction, while noteworthy, is rarely a definitive market signal on its own. Avoid making impulsive trading decisions based solely on such alerts. Observe Context: Look for patterns. Are there other large outflows from exchanges? Are there corresponding inflows to known custodial services or OTC desks? Focus on Fundamentals: While on-chain data is fascinating, the broader market fundamentals, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory news often have a more significant long-term impact. Security First: For those holding substantial crypto, this event is a reminder of the importance of self-custody and moving funds off exchanges into secure cold storage when not actively trading. The mystery surrounding this BTC movement continues, and only time will tell the true purpose behind it. However, it serves as a powerful illustration of the transparent yet often enigmatic nature of large-scale cryptocurrency transactions. Compelling Summary: The Enduring Mystery of the Whale The recent 7,999 BTC transfer from Coinbase to an unknown wallet underscores the captivating and sometimes perplexing world of cryptocurrency. This massive Bitcoin transfer , reported by Whale Alert, immediately became a focal point for discussion, highlighting the power and influence of the elusive crypto whale . While the identity and precise intentions behind this significant BTC movement remain unconfirmed, the event offers a valuable case study in on-chain analysis and the nuances of interpreting large transactions from major platforms like Coinbase . It serves as a potent reminder that in the decentralized landscape, transparency of data coexists with the anonymity of participants, creating a constant dance between insight and speculation. As the crypto market continues to evolve, vigilance and a holistic understanding of various market indicators remain paramount for every participant.

Just as we advocate for ownership over our digital assets, the question of who controls our personal data, especially our private photos, becomes paramount. Recently, Facebook, under its parent company Meta, began prompting users for an unprecedented level of access: permission for Meta AI to scan and suggest edits for photos directly from their camera roll, including those never shared on the platform. This move, while framed as a creative convenience, raises significant camera roll privacy concerns that resonate deeply with anyone committed to data sovereignty. Understanding Meta AI’s Deep Dive into Your Photos Imagine scrolling through Facebook to create a new Story, and a pop-up appears, inviting you to opt into “cloud processing.” This isn’t just about photos you’ve already uploaded. Meta AI is asking to access your entire phone’s camera roll to automatically generate AI-edited versions. Here’s what that entails: Ongoing Uploads: By clicking “Allow,” you permit Facebook to upload media from your camera roll to its servers “on an ongoing basis.” Data Points: This process is based on information like time, location, or themes embedded within your photos. Creative Suggestions: The AI aims to generate new ideas like collages, recaps, AI restylings, or photo themes. While the message assures users that only they can see the suggestions and the media isn’t used for ad targeting, the implications for Facebook data access extend far beyond simple creative tools. It’s a fundamental shift in how a major tech platform interacts with your most private digital assets. Navigating Facebook Data Access and Meta’s AI Terms The core of this new feature lies in Meta’s AI Terms, which users implicitly agree to by enabling “cloud processing.” These terms outline a broad scope of data usage: Facial Feature Analysis: Your media, including facial features, will be analyzed by AI. Content Modification: This analysis allows Meta to “summarize image contents, modify images, and generate new content based on the image.” Retention and Use of Personal Information: Meta’s AIs gain the right to “retain and use” any personal information you’ve shared to personalize AI outputs. This includes “information you submit as Prompts, Feedback, or other Content.” Human Review: Interactions with Meta’s AIs, including conversations, may be reviewed by humans. The ambiguity around what constitutes “personal information” beyond prompts and feedback, especially concerning privately uploaded photos, is a critical point of concern. Despite inquiries, Meta has not provided further clarification, leaving users to interpret the full scope of their consent. This level of Facebook data access , particularly for unshared photos, represents a significant expansion beyond Meta’s previously announced training of AIs on publicly shared data. The Slippery Slope of AI Photo Suggestions This new feature highlights a recurring theme in the tech world: the delicate balance between innovation and user privacy. For Meta, tapping into users’ unshared photos offers a significant advantage in the competitive AI race, providing a vast, rich dataset for training and development. However, for end-users, the “slippery slope” is real. It’s often unclear what they are truly agreeing to when such features appear, masked as creative enhancements. Early user experiences reflect this confusion. Some users have reported Facebook automatically transforming old photos into anime using AI photo suggestions , while others have sought help to disable the feature. This anecdotal evidence underscores the need for greater transparency and explicit consent mechanisms that are easily understood by the average user. Empowering Your Digital Privacy: Managing Settings Fortunately, for those concerned about this extensive Facebook data access , there are settings to manage or disable the feature. We located it within Facebook’s Settings, under the “Preferences” section, labeled “Camera roll sharing suggestions.” On this page, you’ll find two key toggles: Suggest photos from your camera roll when browsing the app: This toggle controls general photo suggestions. Cloud processing: This is the crucial toggle that enables or disables Meta’s ability to use AI on your camera roll photos for “creative suggestions.” Based on the initial pop-up, this should be an opt-in feature. It’s worth noting that while the pop-up might seem new, posts from earlier this year indicate confused users encountering similar messages. Meta also provides Help Documentation for both iOS and Android users regarding this feature. However, the enforceability of Meta’s AI terms as of June 23, 2024, coupled with the lack of publicly accessible older versions of these terms, makes it challenging for users to track changes in data usage policies related to camera roll privacy . Protecting Your Digital Privacy in the AI Era The emergence of features like Meta AI’s camera roll access underscores a crucial point for all digital citizens: the ongoing need for vigilance regarding our digital privacy . In an age where AI capabilities are rapidly expanding, understanding the terms and conditions of the services we use is more important than ever. While the allure of AI-powered creative tools is undeniable, the potential trade-off in terms of personal data control demands careful consideration. As we move further into an AI-driven world, the onus falls on users to actively manage their privacy settings, question ambiguous terms, and advocate for clearer data policies from tech companies. Your camera roll contains some of your most personal memories; ensuring their privacy remains paramount.

46935096,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72822,1751090269,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple (XRP) vs SEC: Legal Expert Sets the Record Straight on Judge Torres Ruling,https://timestabloid.com/legal-expert-sets-the-record-straight-on-judge-torres-ruling/,"Following Judge Analisa Torres’s decision to reject the joint motion from Ripple and the SEC, opinions quickly surfaced online about what the ruling meant. Crypto analyst CasiTrades posted an interpretation suggesting that the decision was a procedural delay. According to her, Judge Torres refused to weigh in on penalties, opting to wait until the appeal’s conclusion, with no legal changes resulting from the ruling. Bill Morgan Pushes Back Attorney Bill Morgan immediately responded , correcting that interpretation and explaining that this is not just a routine delay or a matter of timing. He reminded the community that Judge Torres had already ruled on penalties in her earlier final judgment from August 2024 . Morgan pointed out that what happened in court was not the judge refusing to preview her answer but rather a firm rejection of the proposed settlement terms designed to reduce Ripple’s fine and remove the injunction. Incorrect. She ruled on penalties a long time ago. It is not just another delay. The settlement process involving having the fine reduced and injunction removed is at an end. https://t.co/iBpW54O28G — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 26, 2025 The End of This Settlement Attempt Morgan’s clarification shifts the narrative away from the idea that the settlement process remains open. He explained that the settlement effort involving renegotiating the $125 million penalty to $50 million and removing the injunction is now closed at the district court level. The court’s message was that unless Ripple and the SEC pursue further appeals or withdraw them entirely, the judgment stands . Morgan’s view highlights that this ruling formally ends the current attempt at resolving those penalty terms outside of the appellate process. Distinguishing Facts from Misinterpretation While CasiTrades pointed to the fact that XRP’s legal status remains unchanged and that no new penalties were introduced, Morgan argued that this misses the core issue. The ruling was not about deferring penalties but about refusing to modify them. Judge Torres made it clear in her ruling that the court would not alter a final judgment simply because both parties requested it, and they did not provide the exceptional circumstances required for such a ruling. Morgan emphasized that her decision was not procedural but final regarding the proposed changes to penalties and injunctions. The Path Forward Judge Torres’ rejection of the joint motion came as a shock to many market participants, as experts had expressed confidence that she would grant the motion. Ripple and the SEC now have two paths forward. They can proceed with their appeals to challenge the parts of the judgment they dispute, or they can drop the appeals and accept the court’s existing ruling. There is no open-ended settlement discussion left on penalties or injunctions within the district court. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

BlockDAG flips the script with its 100 million BDAG airdrop. This isn’t a last-minute bonus. It’s an entry point for those ready to build the network from the ground up. The airdrop runs across four quest paths: Testnet, Presale, Social, and Referral. But it’s more than a checklist. Each quest connects with real features already running. BlockDAG (BDAG) is live with a working testnet, a no-code dApp builder, and a mining platform that includes 2 million mobile miners and over 18,150 ASIC units sold. This event is the easiest way yet into a Layer 1 project that has already raised $324 million with zero help from venture capital. Testnet Quests: Airdrop Tasks That Push the Product The Testnet quest track takes center stage in this campaign, asking users to dive straight into BlockDAG’s system before the mainnet goes live. You can try deploying smart contracts, test the wallet, or even report bugs. This isn’t just for fun. The data from these quests gives developers real feedback on how the platform performs. While most people in presales don’t touch the tech until much later, BlockDAG is handing it over early and asking, “Can you break it before launch?” The result is a stronger system and a group of users who know how it works from the start. Presale Quests: Building Growth with Every Move Presale quests are set up to boost BlockDAG’s foundation. Here, users do more than buy coins. They take real steps in the project’s early rollout. You can earn BDAG by downloading the X1 mobile miner , buying mining hardware like the X10, X30, or X100, and bringing in referrals. These tasks aren’t made for quick grabs. They help shape a working crypto economy. The current presale price is locked at $0.0030, with a confirmed launch price of $0.05. But the numbers are real. More than 23.3 billion BDAG have already been sold, and the price will rise to $0.0080 in just 12 hours. BlockDAG’s crypto presale isn’t chasing attention. It’s building real action, and that momentum is just getting started. Social and Referral Quests Turn Users Into the Driving Force The third and fourth parts of BlockDAG’s airdrop, Social and Referral quests, are no accident. While other projects rely on ads or influencers to grow, BlockDAG is letting users spread the word themselves. You can earn coins by following BlockDAG on X (Twitter), joining its Telegram group, reacting to updates, or making content about its tools. Referral rewards only count when the people you invite actually take part. No empty sign-ups. This kind of word-of-mouth growth fits right into crypto’s roots, and it’s already showing results. BlockDAG now has close to 200,000 holders and often ranks at the top of Telegram trend lists for presale projects. What makes this campaign stand out isn’t just the reward size. It’s that every task points to something already working: The testnet is active, not a sample. The dApp builder is ready to use now. The X1 app is mining BDAG for over 2 million users. The presale has brought in $324 million and keeps gaining ground. All of this connects to a launch plan starting later in 2025, with staking, DeFi features, and listings across 20 exchanges already in the pipeline. Why This Airdrop Might Be the Best Time to Get In This airdrop isn’t just a bonus. It’s a core part of BlockDAG’s launch strategy, timed right before the six-week rollout begins. With $324 million already raised in presale and the current price at $0.0030 (set to rise to $0.0080 in 12 hours), the window to get in early is closing fast. People joining now aren’t late, they’re helping shape what comes next. With direct access to the testnet, a growing referral system, miner shipments kicking off soon (July 7 for X30/X100 and August 15 for X10), and a live dev platform, this crypto airdrop might be one of the last easy ways to enter before things level up. Most early crypto sales are based on what might happen. BlockDAG is already giving people real tools to try and rewarding them for doing so. That makes this more than just a marketing push. It’s a way to find the users who want to build alongside the platform. Because in a market that’s always looking ahead, getting involved now isn’t just about claiming rewards. It’s about being part of something that’s growing in real time.

In a move that has sent ripples across global markets, U.S. President Donald Trump has announced an immediate suspension of trade talks with Canada. The reason? Canada’s new Digital Services Tax (DST) on U.S. tech firms. This development marks a significant escalation in an already tense economic relationship, raising concerns about potential new Trump Tariffs and the future of US Canada Trade . For anyone following the intricate dance of global economics and its impact on the digital realm, this is a critical moment. What is the Digital Services Tax and Why Does it Matter? At the heart of this dispute lies the Digital Services Tax. But what exactly is it, and why is it causing such a stir? Simply put, a DST is a levy on the revenue generated by large digital companies, rather than on their profits. Many countries argue that current international tax rules, designed for a traditional economy, don’t adequately capture the value created by digital giants operating across borders. Targeted Revenue: DSTs typically target revenue from activities like online advertising, social media services, and the sale of user data. Jurisdictional Reach: The tax aims to ensure that multinational tech companies pay their ‘fair share’ in countries where they have a significant user base, even if they don’t have a large physical presence. Global Trend: Canada is not alone in implementing such a tax; several European Union countries have already done so, leading to similar trade tensions with the U.S. Canada’s move to implement its own Digital Services Tax , set to take effect, is seen by the U.S. as discriminatory against its tech behemoths like Google, Meta, and Amazon. President Trump, in his announcement on Truth Social, labeled it a “blatant attack” on American businesses, setting the stage for a dramatic confrontation. Unpacking the US Canada Trade Standoff: A New Era of Tariffs? The immediate suspension of trade talks signals a serious breakdown in diplomatic and economic relations between two of the world’s closest allies. This isn’t just about a tax; it’s about sovereignty, economic fairness, and the power dynamics of international commerce. The U.S. stance is clear: unilateral digital taxes are unacceptable and will be met with retaliation. President Trump’s threat of new Trump Tariffs within seven days sends a chilling message. While specific details are yet to be revealed, history suggests these could target key Canadian exports, ranging from aluminum and steel to agricultural products. The ongoing criticism of Canada’s long-standing tariffs on U.S. dairy products further complicates the picture, indicating a broader dissatisfaction with existing trade imbalances. The intricate web of US Canada Trade is vast and interconnected. Both nations are each other’s largest trading partners, with billions of dollars in goods and services crossing the border daily. Any disruption, especially through punitive tariffs, could have far-reaching consequences for industries and consumers on both sides. The escalating trade tensions between the US and Canada could redefine future economic relations. The Threat of Trump Tariffs: What’s at Stake for Businesses? The specter of new Trump Tariffs looms large, creating uncertainty for businesses that rely on the seamless flow of goods and services across the US-Canada border. The previous rounds of tariffs under the Trump administration demonstrated their capacity to disrupt supply chains, increase costs, and ultimately harm consumers. What could these tariffs look like, and which sectors might be most affected? While speculative, potential targets could include: Agricultural Products: Building on the dairy dispute, other agricultural goods could be targeted. Raw Materials: Aluminum and steel, which were subjects of previous tariffs, might once again be in the crosshairs. Manufactured Goods: Any sector with significant cross-border trade could face new barriers. The immediate impact for businesses would be increased operational costs, potential loss of market access, and a need to re-evaluate supply chain strategies. This economic friction is not just a political spat; it directly impacts livelihoods and profitability. Potential Tariff Impacts: A Comparison Sector Potential Impact of Tariffs Previous Precedent (if any) Dairy Increased costs for consumers, reduced market access for producers. Long-standing disputes over Canadian supply management. Aluminum/Steel Higher prices for manufacturers, supply chain disruptions. Previous US tariffs on Canadian imports (2018-2020). Automotive Risk of increased vehicle costs, impact on integrated supply chains. Threats of tariffs on auto imports in previous administrations. Forest Products Higher lumber prices, impact on construction industry. Ongoing softwood lumber disputes. Is Canada’s Tech Tax a Global Trend? Lessons from the EU. Canada’s implementation of the Tech Tax Canada is not an isolated incident. It’s part of a broader global movement by nations seeking to update their tax frameworks for the digital age. Many countries argue that the current international tax system allows tech giants to generate substantial revenue in their markets while paying minimal taxes locally, often by routing profits through low-tax jurisdictions. The European Union has been at the forefront of this debate, with countries like France, Italy, and Spain implementing their own DSTs. These moves have similarly triggered strong reactions from the U.S., leading to threats of retaliatory tariffs. The U.S. position, historically, has been to push for a multilateral solution through the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) rather than individual country taxes. However, the slow pace of international consensus has led many nations, including Canada, to take unilateral action. This creates a patchwork of differing tax regimes, complicating compliance for global tech companies and fueling International Trade Disputes . The core issue remains: how to fairly tax profits generated by digital services that transcend physical borders. Navigating International Trade Disputes: Strategies for the Future. The current standoff between the U.S. and Canada highlights the growing complexity of International Trade Disputes in the 21st century. Beyond traditional goods, the digital economy presents new challenges for taxation, regulation, and fair competition. Resolving these disputes requires a delicate balance of diplomacy, economic leverage, and a willingness to find common ground. For businesses, navigating this volatile landscape requires strategic foresight: Diversify Supply Chains: Reduce over-reliance on single countries or trade routes. Monitor Policy Changes: Stay informed about evolving tax laws and trade policies in key markets. Engage with Stakeholders: Work with industry associations and policymakers to advocate for stable and predictable trade environments. Legal and Tax Counsel: Seek expert advice on adapting to new digital tax regimes and potential tariff impacts. For policymakers, the challenge is to move towards a more harmonized global tax framework that addresses the digital economy’s realities without stifling innovation or triggering protectionist measures. The alternative is a fragmented global economy riddled with ongoing trade wars. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Global Trade The suspension of US Canada Trade talks over Canada’s Digital Services Tax is more than just a bilateral disagreement; it’s a microcosm of the broader challenges facing global commerce. The threat of new Trump Tariffs underscores the high stakes involved, impacting not just tech giants but also countless businesses and consumers reliant on cross-border trade. As the world grapples with how to fairly tax the digital economy, this escalating dispute serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for international cooperation to prevent further fragmentation and foster a stable global economic environment. The next seven days will be critical in determining the immediate trajectory of this significant International Trade Dispute .

But time and again, the biggest winners come from presale allocations that enter the market early and ride the entire wave of adoption. In 2025, analysts are closely watching how capital rotates into smaller-cap assets, particularly those with fixed token models, strong market entry strategies, and unique positioning. Presales offer a rare combination of low entry points, growing attention, and structured tokenomics — and that’s exactly what’s putting projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, BlockDAG, and QUBETICS on the radar. MAGACOIN FINANCE: An Asymmetric Opportunity MAGACOIN FINANCE has steadily become one of the most talked-about early entries in the current cycle. With a model built around scarcity mechanics and long-lead market strategy, it has emerged as a calculated play for those looking beyond surface narratives. Institutional analysts are paying attention to the token’s growth trajectory — previous stages sold out instantly, and traction across research platforms has grown in recent weeks. The design isn’t just about speculative hype. It’s rooted in asymmetric opportunity: an early allocation before wider market awareness, with structural upside potential that few late-stage tokens can replicate. BlockDAG: The Infrastructure Play BlockDAG is gaining momentum as a scalable infrastructure layer focused on distributed consensus and low-latency throughput — a sector often overlooked in retail conversations. With enterprise-grade scalability and increasing developer attention, BlockDAG’s presale is being seen as a foundational bet on the next wave of Web3 performance solutions. While it may not grab headlines like narrative tokens, infrastructure plays like BlockDAG tend to surge during bull cycles when performance and scalability matter most. Analysts expect long-term growth as adoption of high-speed blockchains continues to expand. QUBETICS: Quantum-Inspired DeFi Mechanics QUBETICS introduces a futuristic edge to the DeFi landscape with quantum-inspired algorithms designed to optimize yield strategies and cross-chain functionality. The project is early, but the underlying tech thesis has attracted technical investors and speculative interest. The focus here isn’t on hype but on innovation. For those looking to diversify their presale exposure across different verticals — including DeFi and smart contract evolution — QUBETICS may offer early-mover advantages ahead of broader recognition. Final Thoughts As the 2025 bull market shapes up, investor focus is rapidly shifting toward projects that blend strong fundamentals with early-stage entry potential. Presales are no longer just speculative playgrounds — they’re strategic access points for long-term plays. MAGACOIN FINANCE , BlockDAG, and QUBETICS each offer a distinct angle in this evolving market. For those seeking new opportunities that combine structure with momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a clear rising star.

A significant shift is underway in how everyday investors can engage with the volatile yet exciting world of digital assets. Robinhood, the popular mobile trading platform, has just made a groundbreaking announcement that could redefine accessibility to the cryptocurrency market: the launch of Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP), and Solana (SOL) micro futures contracts. This isn’t just another product launch; it’s a strategic move to empower more individuals to participate in sophisticated trading strategies with lower capital requirements and reduced risk. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the broader crypto landscape. What Are Robinhood Micro Futures and Why Do They Matter? According to reports, Robinhood has officially rolled out micro futures contracts for some of the most prominent cryptocurrencies. But what exactly are these ‘micro’ contracts, and why is Robinhood venturing into this space? Micro futures are essentially miniature versions of standard futures contracts. They represent a fraction of the value of a full-sized contract, making them significantly more accessible to retail traders. Here’s why they’re a game-changer: Lower Capital Requirements: You don’t need a massive trading account to get started. This opens the door for a much wider range of investors. Reduced Risk Exposure: While all trading involves risk, the smaller contract size means less capital is at stake for each trade, allowing for more precise risk management. Flexibility: They offer the ability to fine-tune your exposure to an asset’s price movements, whether you’re looking to hedge against volatility or speculate on price direction. Robinhood’s expansion into micro futures aligns with its mission to democratize finance. By offering these products, they’re providing a bridge for everyday investors to engage in more advanced trading strategies that were once primarily the domain of institutional players or high-net-worth individuals. This move signifies Robinhood’s commitment to diversifying its offerings beyond spot trading, bringing a new dimension to how users can interact with digital assets. Understanding the Landscape of Crypto Futures Trading Robinhood’s journey into futures isn’t new; they’ve been steadily expanding their derivatives offerings since the beginning of the year, starting with forex, indices, and commodities. The first foray into cryptocurrency futures included Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH), and now, with the addition of XRP and SOL, their crypto futures trading suite is becoming even more comprehensive. So, what does crypto futures trading entail? Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a specific future date. In the context of cryptocurrencies, these contracts allow traders to speculate on the future price of digital assets without actually owning the underlying cryptocurrency. Robinhood’s crypto futures products are cash-settled, meaning that at expiration, instead of exchanging the actual crypto, the profit or loss is settled in cash based on the price difference. The rise of crypto futures trading has been a significant development in the broader digital asset market, offering tools for: Hedging: Protecting existing crypto holdings from adverse price movements. Price Discovery: Futures markets often provide insights into market sentiment and future price expectations. Leverage: While micro futures reduce risk, futures trading generally allows for leveraged positions, amplifying potential gains (and losses). Robinhood’s emphasis on ‘micro’ contracts is a deliberate strategy to make these powerful tools more approachable, mitigating some of the inherent risks associated with traditional, larger futures contracts. Diving into Bitcoin Futures on Robinhood Bitcoin (BTC) remains the king of cryptocurrencies, and its price movements often dictate the broader market sentiment. The introduction of Bitcoin micro futures on Robinhood is particularly significant because it offers a highly liquid and widely understood asset in a more digestible format for retail traders. For those looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price fluctuations without the complexities of direct crypto ownership or the higher capital demands of standard BTC futures, Robinhood’s offering is ideal. Imagine you hold a portfolio of various altcoins, and you want to hedge against a potential downturn in the overall crypto market, often led by Bitcoin. A small Bitcoin futures position could help offset potential losses in your spot holdings. Conversely, if you believe Bitcoin is poised for a rally, you can use these micro contracts to capitalize on that upward movement with a relatively small initial investment. This flexibility makes Bitcoin futures an invaluable tool for both risk management and speculative trading strategies, now more accessible than ever through Robinhood. The Expansion: XRP Futures and SOL Futures Beyond Bitcoin, Robinhood’s decision to include XRP and SOL micro futures is a strong indicator of the growing demand for diversified crypto derivatives. Both XRP and Solana (SOL) represent significant ecosystems within the crypto space, each with its unique use cases and enthusiastic communities. XRP Futures : A New Avenue for a Long-Standing Asset XRP, known for its role in facilitating fast and low-cost international payments through Ripple’s network, has a dedicated following. Its price has often been subject to significant volatility, making it an interesting candidate for futures trading. With XRP futures now available in micro form, traders can: Speculate on XRP’s price movements driven by legal developments, partnerships, or adoption news. Hedge existing XRP holdings against market dips. Gain exposure to a top-tier altcoin without the need to hold the underlying asset directly. This adds a new layer of utility for XRP, allowing a broader set of investors to engage with its price dynamics. SOL Futures : Tapping into the Solana Ecosystem Solana (SOL) has emerged as a formidable competitor in the blockchain space, renowned for its high transaction throughput and burgeoning DeFi and NFT ecosystem. The inclusion of SOL futures reflects its growing importance and market liquidity. For traders, SOL futures offer a way to: Capitalize on the rapid development and adoption within the Solana ecosystem. Hedge against volatility in their SOL spot holdings, particularly during periods of high market activity. Participate in the growth story of a leading smart contract platform. The availability of SOL futures provides another sophisticated tool for managing risk and pursuing opportunities within the dynamic altcoin market. Are There Any Challenges or Considerations for Trading Micro Futures? While Robinhood’s micro futures offer unprecedented accessibility, it’s crucial to approach them with a clear understanding of the associated risks and responsibilities. Even with lower capital requirements, derivatives trading involves leverage, which can amplify both gains and losses. Here are some key considerations: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. While micro contracts reduce exposure, rapid price swings can still lead to quick losses if not managed properly. Understanding Derivatives: Futures contracts are more complex than simply buying and holding an asset. It’s essential to understand concepts like margin, leverage, settlement, and expiration dates. Liquidation Risk: If your position moves against you and your margin falls below a certain level, your position can be automatically closed (liquidated), leading to a total loss of your invested capital. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for crypto derivatives is still evolving. While Robinhood operates within established frameworks, future regulatory changes could impact the market. It is always advisable to start with a small amount, educate yourself thoroughly, and consider consulting a financial advisor before diving into futures trading. Conclusion: A New Era of Accessible Crypto Derivatives Robinhood’s launch of Bitcoin, XRP, and SOL micro futures contracts marks a pivotal moment for retail crypto investors. By significantly lowering the barrier to entry for derivatives trading, Robinhood is not only expanding its product suite but also empowering a new generation of traders with tools previously reserved for institutional players. This move could lead to increased market participation, more sophisticated hedging strategies among individual investors, and a further maturation of the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Whether you’re looking to hedge your existing crypto portfolio, speculate on future price movements, or simply explore more advanced trading strategies with manageable risk, Robinhood’s new micro futures offer an exciting avenue. As the crypto market continues to evolve, platforms like Robinhood are playing a crucial role in making it more inclusive and dynamic for everyone.

Now, analysts are pointing to Ruvi AI (RUVI) as a project with similar traits, labeling it as a cheap gem with the potential for a 13,700% ROI . Packed with innovation, utility, and transparency, Ruvi AI appears set to emulate Binance Coin’s meteoric rise. Why Ruvi AI Draws Comparisons to Binance Coin Binance Coin achieved its success through its real-world functionality, becoming an essential tool within the Binance ecosystem. Similarly, Ruvi AI integrates blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to offer practical solutions across industries like marketing , entertainment , and finance , giving RUVI tokens significant utility. Marketing: Ruvi AI’s AI-driven tools help businesses refine ad targeting, optimize campaigns, and maximize ROI. Entertainment: Content creators benefit from blockchain-backed payment systems and AI-powered audience personalization, enhancing engagement and monetization. Finance: Ruvi AI’s applications in fraud detection, scalable transactions, and operational transparency make it indispensable for modern financial institutions. This utility-first philosophy ensures that Ruvi AI isn’t just another speculative token. Its value directly derives from its functionality and demand in solving real-world problems. Structured Growth Predicts Massive Returns One reason investors are flocking to Ruvi AI is its clear and measurable growth trajectory. During its current Phase 2 presale , RUVI tokens are available at just $0.015 each , providing a low-cost entry point for early adopters. Once the presale concludes, tokens are guaranteed to rise to $0.07 , delivering nearly 5x returns right away. However, the biggest draw lies in analysts’ projections. They predict Ruvi AI could hit a $1 valuation post-listing , representing an astonishing 66x ROI for early backers. With predictions of a 13,700% ROI , Ruvi AI is drawing attention as one of the most promising opportunities in the crypto space. Achieving Early Success Ruvi AI’s presale performance underscores its potential. Key milestones include: $2 million raised , reflecting strong investor demand. Over 165 million tokens sold , highlighting widespread adoption. A growing community of more than 1,600 holders , validating its appeal and trustworthiness. These early achievements demonstrate Ruvi AI’s ability to attract interest from investors across the spectrum, further building its momentum as a top-tier opportunity. Earn Big With VIP Investment Tiers Ruvi AI goes the extra mile to reward early supporters with its enticing VIP investment tiers , designed to maximize returns through bonus tokens. Here’s how it works: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These options allow investors to amplify their gains while participating in one of the most promising tokens of 2025. Transparency and Security Build Confidence Ruvi AI understands the importance of earning investor trust, which is why it prioritizes transparency and security . The platform has successfully passed a third-party audit by CyberScope , ensuring that its smart contracts are reliable and secure. Additionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange , ensuring post-presale liquidity , allowing investors to trade RUVI tokens seamlessly once the presale is complete. These measures solidify Ruvi AI’s commitment to creating a safe and investor-friendly ecosystem. Practical Applications Ensure Long-Term Growth What makes Ruvi AI truly unique is its focus on solving real problems. Its contributions to marketing, entertainment, and finance demonstrate its ability to create enduring value. Businesses and individuals alike stand to benefit from Ruvi AI’s innovative solutions, ensuring sustained and increasing demand for its token. Why Ruvi AI Stands Out For those who missed Binance Coin in its early days, Ruvi AI offers a second chance to secure life-changing gains. With an affordable entry price of $0.015 , a guaranteed rise to $0.07 , and a projected $1 valuation post-listing , Ruvi AI has all the ingredients for enormous returns. With $2 million raised , 165 million tokens sold , and strategic partnerships with CyberScope and WEEX Exchange , Ruvi AI is setting the standard for transparency, scalability, and utility. For smart investors, the opportunity is clear: Ruvi AI is positioned to be the next big thing in crypto.

Are you ready for the next big move in the crypto market? All eyes are on Robinhood Crypto as its highly anticipated keynote in France approaches. While some market watchers predict a short-term ‘sell the news’ dip, leading to a potential market fluctuation, analysts at Compass Point are painting a different picture, viewing this event as a prime Investing Opportunity for savvy participants. This isn’t just another corporate announcement; it could be a pivotal moment for those looking to expand their digital asset portfolios. Understanding the Robinhood Crypto Momentum Robinhood has been quietly, yet significantly, growing its footprint in the digital asset space. The platform, initially known for commission-free stock trading, has successfully diversified, with its crypto business showing impressive resilience and growth. In the second quarter alone, Robinhood reported a staggering Digital Asset Revenue of $252 million. This substantial figure underscores the increasing user engagement and confidence in Robinhood’s crypto offerings. Furthermore, the company’s stock has surged by over 120% year-to-date, reflecting investor optimism about its future trajectory, particularly within the burgeoning crypto sector. Why the Crypto Keynote Matters for Your Portfolio The upcoming Crypto Keynote is more than just a presentation; it’s expected to unveil key product developments that could reshape Robinhood’s crypto ecosystem and, by extension, impact the broader market. Analyst Ed Engel of Compass Point anticipates several significant announcements, including: Tokenized Stock Trading: This could bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized assets, offering new ways to invest in equities through blockchain technology. Staking Services: Allowing users to earn passive income by locking up their cryptocurrencies, a feature highly sought after by long-term holders. Perpetual Futures: Introducing more advanced trading instruments, catering to experienced traders seeking leverage and sophisticated strategies. It’s worth noting that stablecoins are reportedly excluded from these immediate announcements, suggesting a focus on more dynamic and potentially higher-yield products. These additions could significantly enhance Robinhood’s competitive edge and attract a wider range of crypto enthusiasts and investors. Navigating the ‘Buy the Dip’ Phenomenon The concept of ‘ Buy the Dip ‘ is a well-known strategy in volatile markets, and it might just apply here. While a ‘sell the news’ event could trigger a temporary price correction as short-term traders cash out, the underlying fundamentals and future product roadmap suggest that any such dip could be short-lived and represent a chance for long-term accumulation. Compass Point’s decision to raise Robinhood’s price target to $96 is a strong indicator of their conviction. This optimistic outlook is fueled by the anticipated product launches and the potential for Robinhood’s inclusion in the S&P 500, which would further solidify its position in mainstream finance. Seizing the Investing Opportunity: What You Need to Know For investors, the Robinhood keynote presents a unique situation. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Closely follow the keynote announcements to understand the exact nature of the new products and services. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Crypto markets are inherently volatile. Understand that any short-term dip, while an opportunity for some, still carries risk. Long-Term Vision: If Robinhood’s new offerings attract significant user adoption and increase its Digital Asset Revenue , the long-term outlook for its crypto segment remains strong. Consider whether this aligns with your investment horizon. Diversification: As always, avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. Even with exciting developments, a diversified portfolio is key. The expansion into more sophisticated crypto products positions Robinhood not just as a gateway for beginners, but as a serious contender for experienced crypto traders and investors. This evolution could significantly boost its user base and transaction volumes, driving further revenue growth. The Future Horizon for Robinhood and Crypto Robinhood’s aggressive push into advanced crypto offerings signals a broader trend: the mainstreaming of digital assets. By making features like staking and perpetual futures more accessible, Robinhood could play a crucial role in onboarding the next wave of crypto users. This strategic expansion is not just about increasing revenue; it’s about cementing Robinhood’s place as a dominant force in the evolving financial landscape where traditional and decentralized finance increasingly converge. The success of these new ventures will undoubtedly be a key factor in its continued growth and its potential for even greater market capitalization. In conclusion, Robinhood’s upcoming Crypto Keynote in France is shaping up to be much more than a routine corporate event. While the immediate market reaction might lead to a temporary ‘ Buy the Dip ‘ scenario, the strategic product announcements, particularly in tokenized stocks, staking, and perpetual futures, present a compelling Investing Opportunity . With robust Digital Asset Revenue growth and a strong analyst backing, Robinhood is poised to further solidify its position in the crypto space. Savvy investors will be watching closely, ready to capitalize on what could be a transformative moment for the platform and the broader crypto market.

Co-founder Zak Folkman revealed this during his Wednesday speech at the Permissionless conference in New York, where he also announced the release of the new World Liberty Financial App. WLFI Attracts Interest Amid USD1 Growth Plans “There has been a lot of interest from several public vehicles who want to use WLFI to be held in their treasuries as well,” said Folkman, as quoted in a Bloomberg report. He also commended Strategy’s Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor, for his continued promotion of using crypto for corporate reserves, adding that World Liberty had a strong relationship with the Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiast. The trend has grown in popularity following Strategy’s success. The company recently bought 245 BTC for approximately $26 million, a relatively modest acquisition by its standards that took its stash to 592,345 BTC. Many others have followed in the business intelligence firm’s footsteps, including Metaplanet, a Japanese firm whose latest $133 million purchase has pushed its holdings to 12,345 BTC. The executive also spoke about the crypto project’s USD1 stablecoin, which has a market value of around $2.1 billion, claiming it was “literally just a matter of time” before it became the highest-capped stablecoin in the market. Fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies have become more appealing to investors with the introduction of the GENIUS Act. The legislation, which recently passed the Senate, outlines a full regulatory structure for stablecoin issuers in the United States. While Tether’s USDT remains the undisputed leader in the sector with about $156.8 billion in circulation, USD1, which went live on DWF Liquid Markets earlier in the month, got a boost in its valuation in May when Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX announced it would use the asset to settle a $2 billion minority stake purchase in Binance. More Developments The DeFi project, which has Tron founder Justin Sun as its single-largest investor with a $75 million stake , also recently revealed plans to make its native cryptocurrency tradable. “You asked to make WLFI transferable — we heard you,” WLF wrote in a post on X. “The team is working behind the scenes to make it happen. Big news coming soon.” Currently, the WLFI token allows holders to vote and submit proposals for changes within the project’s ecosystem. However, the coins are not yet transferable. These developments follow reports that the Trump family had sold 20% of their stake in World Liberty over the past few weeks.

In fact, the spike has led to the highest level that Ethereum’s daily transactions have been in over 16 months, showing a return to the blockchain that seemed previously abandoned. Ethereum Daily Transactions Cross 1.7 Million According to data from the on-chain data aggregation website, Nansen, the Ethereum daily transaction count has spiked by almost 50% over the last few days. The week had begun with the daily transaction count sitting at 1.2 million on Monday. However, by Wednesday, this figure was already changing rapidly to reach new yearly peaks. Related Reading: Extended Wave 5 Scenario Puts Bitcoin Price Above $300,000 With Step-Like Structure In Place As the Ethereum price rose above $2,400, so did participation on the blockchain, leading daily transactions to rise to 1.729 million. This sharp spike has led to the highest level so far in 2025, and is the first time since January 2024 that the daily transactions has crossed the 1.7 million mark. At the same time, there was also an unusual spike in the daily active addresses, which rose by almost 50% as well in the same time period. The daily active addresses rose from 345,406 addresses to 593,637 addresses in the space of four days. All of these have happened as the Ethereum price has recovered, suggesting that the spike in on-chain participation is actually more from investors buying than selling. If this trend continues, then it could send the Ethereum price soaring higher from here. Sell Volume Begins Dominating ETH Price In contrast to the rise in Ethereum on-chain participation, there has also been an increase in the on-chain sell volume compared to the buy volume. Nansen data points out that in the $168.37 million on-chain buy volume recorded in a 24-hour period, approximately $78.15 million was going toward buys, while a little over $90 million was from sellers. Related Reading: Ethereum Not Out Of The Woods Yet: Why Another 30% Crash To $1,800 Is Coming Furthermore, when it comes to individual transactions involved in buying and selling Ethereum, the sellers remain in the lead. There were more than 52,000 buy transactions recorded during this period, with around 24,300 buyers. While the sell transactions ran up towards 74,000, with sellers at more than 32,000. This shows a higher percentage of sellers compared to buyers, which would explain why the price has been unable to reach other support levels. This rise in the selling volume suggests that the buys are not enough to absorb the selling volume. This could fight off any buying momentum that could lead to a price recovery and keep the Ethereum price down while the crypto market struggles to find its footing.

Cosmos (ATOM) is expanding its network through IBC and institutional ETFs, while Hedera (HBAR) is attracting enterprise use through its high-speed hashgraph consensus and upcoming ETF decisions. However, Qubetics ($TICS) is drawing urgent attention by addressing one of the most pressing problems in blockchain technology: the inability of isolated networks to interoperate. Its final crypto presale stage is now live, just days before a confirmed top 10 exchange listing on June 30, with expected short-term gains of 20%. Qubetics has gradually earned the trust of its backers through months of active development, transparent updates, and community participation. By unifying disconnected chains through native interoperability, Qubetics delivers immediate relevance for crypto adopters and developers alike. As the top crypto presale currently live, Qubetics offers a rare entry point before demand accelerates post-listing. Qubetics: Unlocking True Blockchain Interoperability Despite growing interest in multi-chain platforms, many cryptocurrency buyers still face daily friction when moving assets, building applications, or accessing services across different networks. Qubetics addresses this problem through a Web3-aggregated chain that integrates multiple blockchains, including Bitcoin, into a unified architecture. This allows for seamless cross-chain asset transfers, data flows, and decentralized service interoperability. Built with a robust network design and enhanced by Ethereum-compatible infrastructure, Qubetics enables decentralized applications (DApps) to communicate across ecosystems without leaving the network. Blockchain developers can now build interoperable applications without having to choose sides. Platforms once limited by isolation now benefit from direct integration, unlocking real utility for both users and builders. By focusing on this critical infrastructure gap, Qubetics distinguishes itself. Whether handling tokenized assets, settling cross-border payments, or building DeFi protocols, its interoperability function creates a flexible, future-ready blockchain layer that most networks still lack. Upcoming Exchange Listing Fuels Momentum Qubetics is scheduled to list on a top-10 global cryptocurrency exchange on June 30 at 11:00 a.m. UTC, just hours after the public sale closes at 8:00 a.m. UTC the same day. Analysts tracking Qubetics have projected a potential 20% surge in value upon listing, citing increased liquidity, tight supply, and rising demand. What makes this even more compelling is the groundwork that has already been laid. With over $516 million in TICS sold and more than 28,300 token holders, Qubetics enters the open market with strong foundational support. Analysts have also identified Qubetics as a high-upside project, suggesting it could rise by up to 100 times post-launch, driven by its real-world applications and interoperability layer. Final Presale Phase: The Last Chance to Join Early Qubetics is now in its 37th and final crypto presale stage. The current price of $TICS stands at $0.3370. Fewer than 9 million tokens remain before the sale concludes, after which $TICS is projected to list at $0.40. This implies a near-term ROI of 18.93 percent for participants who join at the final stage. What’s changed is not just the price. Supply has dropped from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, with 38.55% now allocated to the public. This shift concentrates power in the hands of the community, ensuring long-term alignment and stability. With $18.1 million raised so far and volume accelerating, the momentum is real. Analysts expect post-listing price targets to range between $5 and $10, citing token scarcity and demand concentration. Investment Example: Why Timing Matters Now At the current price of $0.3370, a $4500 commitment secures approximately 13,353 $TICS tokens. If Qubetics reaches the projected $10 post-listing, that amount could translate to $133,530. Should the token rise to $15 after mainnet launch, the return could reach $200,295. Early adopters who entered at Stage 1 ($0.01) are already positioned for gains of over 3270%. For those considering entry today, the final stage of this top crypto presale still offers a realistic opportunity for substantial upside. Cosmos Gains Strength as Volume Surges and Upgrade Nears Cosmos (ATOM) is gaining traction with a 6.7 percent jump in volume and a bullish reversal confirmed by ascending lows and strong RSI. The v25 upgrade proposal—Gaia v25.0.0—is now under community review and could bring new protocol-level efficiencies. ATOM also benefited from increased institutional attention, including ETFs under evaluation by Nano Labs and Bitbank’s new listing activity. Its IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) continues to be one of the most respected interoperability tools in the crypto industry, although adoption remains slower than many had expected. The price is consolidating above $4.00 after a strong V-shaped recovery. Short-term sentiment has turned cautiously bullish. Hedera Hashgraph Builds Momentum Ahead of ETF Decision HBAR continues to advance institutional credibility. HashPack has now integrated Coinbase’s fiat on-ramp, making it easier to access HBAR and stake directly through the ecosystem. A preliminary SEC decision on Grayscale’s HBAR ETF filing is expected by July 9. Meanwhile, a separate ETF proposal by Canary Capital has been delayed to September. On-chain, HBAR shows strong fundamentals. Transaction fees rose 340 percent, TVL is climbing, and a golden cross has formed. HBAR operates on a hashgraph model, enabling over 100,000 transactions per second. The current price support is situated near $0.28, with potential upside toward $0.40 in the near term. Conclusion: The Final Countdown for the Top Crypto Presale Cosmos and Hedera are making measurable progress through technical upgrades and institutional access. Both are established networks with defined market positions. Qubetics, however, is stepping into the market with a purpose-built Layer 1 focused on interoperability, an area where many chains struggle. With a working ecosystem, confirmed top 10 exchange listing, and a final presale rapidly closing, the opportunity lies in timing. As the top crypto presale now reaches its final days, Qubetics gives community members a pathway to enter before the market adjusts. The listing is near. The scarcity is absolute. The demand is building. Early buyers are already up over 3000%. Those entering today are securing access while the price remains below projected market value. Act now before the final presale stage ends. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics/ Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics/ Frequently Asked Questions What is the current Qubetics presale price? The current price is $0.3370 per $TICS in Stage 37 of the presale. When does the Qubetics presale end? The final phase concludes on June 30 at 8:00 a.m. UTC, with the listing scheduled for 11:00 a.m. UTC. What makes Qubetics different from Cosmos or Hedera? Qubetics is designed for native interoperability, enabling cross-chain operations without the need for external bridges. What exchange will Qubetics list on? Qubetics will list on a verified top 10 global cryptocurrency exchange. How many tokens will $4500 buy, and what is the potential value? At $0.3370, $4500 buys 13,356 $TICS. At $10 per token, that becomes $133,560. Summary: Qubetics is closing its final top crypto presale stage at $0.3370 before listing on a top 10 exchange. With fewer than 9 million $TICS left, early buyers are targeting a 20 percent surge by June 30. The project’s core strength lies in its blockchain interoperability, solving a major pain point across ecosystems. Cosmos (ATOM) is strengthening with IBC expansion and upgrade voting, while Hedera (HBAR) builds toward ETF approval and institutional use. Qubetics offers real-time relevance, strong fundamentals, and limited availability—making it the top crypto presale to watch right now.

Related Reading: TRUMP Token In Trouble? Over $4 Million Liquidity Exit Sparks Crash Fears Those numbers show how much these tokens fuel trades, loans and cross-border transfers. Yet questions about whether they really count as “money” are now front and center. Stablecoin On-Chain Traffic Based on reports, stablecoins have become the workhorses of crypto trading. Volume hit 35 trillion in the last 12 months. At the same time, their circulating supply stayed at 194.6 billion. That steady supply suggests tokens like USDC and USDT are parked, ready for the next move. Traders shift them in and out of Bitcoin and altcoins. Payment platforms weave them into digital rails. The scale is hard to ignore. IMF Deputy MD Raises Money Question According to IMF Deputy Managing Director Bo Li, the big challenge is classification. Are stablecoins part of M0, M1 or a new category altogether? He posed those questions at the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos. Getting that wrong could reshape how banks set reserves and how regulators cut red tape. Li also pointed out that policy experiments are popping up all over. Some of them may not survive a real stress test. Key Takeaways: IMF’s Bo Li said regulatory uncertainty around stablecoins persists, especially regarding classification and enforcement. Global financial bodies are working to align frameworks but… https://t.co/V75hFYV5pX #Stablecoin #Cryptocurrency #IMF #Regulation #Finance — Entrepreneur_cm (@entrepreneur_cm) June 25, 2025 National Rules Diverge Based on policy outlines, the US is moving ahead with the GENIUS Act. Europe has drafted its own rulebook. Over in Asia, Hong Kong plans to roll out its Stablecoin Ordinance in August 2025. Those efforts show a strong push to make rules more clear. But they also underscore a lack of global unity. Businesses could face one set of rules in New York, another in Brussels and a third in Hong Kong. That patchwork approach risks adding costs for firms and confusion for users. Global Bodies Seek Cooperation According to Bo Li’s remarks, fragmented rules carry real risks. He warned that gaps in enforcement might let bad actors slip through. To avoid that, the IMF is teaming up with the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee. Their goal is to craft more consistent guidance. If they pull it off, regulators in different countries might follow a shared playbook rather than compete by cutting corners.

Expert Picks Revealed,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/which-crypto-presales-should-investors-target-for-maximum-roi-by-2025-expert-picks-revealed/,"As the crypto market gears up for its next breakout cycle, early-stage tokens are gaining serious traction among investors. Presales are proving to be some of the most lucrative opportunities, especially for those who act before exchange listings. According to experts, three names continue to dominate investor discussions— MAGACOIN FINANCE , Ruvi AI, and Qubetics. Why Analysts Say MAGACOIN FINANCE Is a 2025 Power Play MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the conversation in the 2025 presale market. Crypto analysts are calling it one of the most undervalued altcoins right now. The project has a fully audited smart contract by HashEx and a capped supply of 170 billion tokens—making it structurally built for scarcity. This fixed model limits risk from inflation and favors early buyers looking for long-term value. The project has been gaining non-stop momentum. Each presale stage has sold out fast, with thousands of participants joining ahead of the exchange listing. With no VC unlocks and growing analyst support, this token is now viewed as a serious candidate for 27x returns. Experts also point to the transparent roadmap and utility-based design as signs of staying power. All signals suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE is entering a high-growth phase, with investor interest reaching new highs. Ruvi AI and Qubetics Catching Investor Attention Ruvi AI is gaining speed in Phase 2 of its presale, offering early buyers a price of $0.015. That price is expected to rise to $0.07 when the presale ends, giving investors an early 5x advantage. VIP tiers are also available, with bonuses up to 100%, which increases potential gains even further. Qubetics ($TICS) is being called a game-changer in the Web3 space. Its focus on cross-chain finance and blockchain connectivity is solving a real pain point. The total token supply was cut from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, making each token more valuable. The final presale phase ends on June 30, 2025, with fewer than 10 million tokens left at $0.3370. Final Thoughts: MAGACOIN FINANCE Leads the Way for ROI Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become the top pick among expert traders and early investors alike. With a hard supply cap, full audit, and rising investor interest, it’s already attracting serious capital flows. Among all current presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its potential to generate major growth and high ROI in 2025. For those targeting real gains, this is the project to keep at the top of the list.

They’re bringing tech, utility, insane community growth, and jaw-dropping upside potential. If you thought 2021 was the peak of joke coins, wait until you see what comes next. LILPEPE, PEPE, and BONK are the three best meme coins of 2025. They could easily beat Shiba Inu and take over this year’s meme-fueled bull run. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme King in the Making If there’s one meme coin that’s making billionaires bite their nails in anticipation, it’s Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . This isn’t just another frog-themed token—it’s an absolute rocket loaded with community power, serious funding, and its own Layer-2 chain. Numbers Don’t Lie: Current Presale Price: $0.0012 Next Stage Price: $0.0013 Listing Price: $0.003 Presale Progress: 75.78% filled USD Raised: $1,871,019 / $2,525,000 Tokens Sold: 1.7 billion+ out of 2.25 billion Stage 3 is flying—in less than 5 days, 75% of the allocation has been snapped up. Deep-pocketed investors are pouring in fast, and every new buyer is adding fuel to the fire. Once the presale hits 100%, the price instantly jumps to $0.0013. Buying now at $0.0012 means you’re locking in a 150% gain right off the bat when it launches at $0.003. And here’s the real kicker: LILPEPE is forecasted to hit $0.97 before the end of 2025. That’s an 808x return for early believers. If you invested during stage 2 at $0.0010, you’re already sitting on a tidy 20% gain—and this is just the beginning. To supercharge its community, LILPEPE has launched a jaw-dropping $770,000 giveaway . Ten lucky winners will each walk away with $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. It’s community-driven, hype-heavy, and wild. It’s not just about hype—LILPEPE is building its own Ethereum Layer-2 to support lightning-fast, zero-fee transactions and host meme projects, NFTs, and dApps. This gives it serious real-world value beyond the laughs and memes. PEPE: The OG Meme Coin Still Has Legs You can’t talk about meme coins without mentioning the iconic Pepe (PEPE). After shaking the market in 2023, PEPE is back with renewed strength in 2025. On-chain data shows that whales have quietly been accumulating PEPE. Whenever the whales make moves, smart traders follow. With a deflationary tokenomics model and token burns in place, scarcity could drive its price to new highs. Analysts predict that PEPE could surge to as high as $0.00003 by Q4 2025, resulting in 68–150% growth from current levels. PEPE remains a fan favorite, and its army is growing stronger by the day on Reddit, Telegram, and Twitter. PEPE has history, visibility, and meme dominance in its DNA. Its potential as a long-term hold remains massive, especially if the meme market experiences a full parabolic surge this year. BONK: Solana’s Barking Beast Say hello to BONK—Solana’s first dog-themed meme coin and the underdog turned overachiever. BONK isn’t just barking—it’s biting into real use cases. It’s being used in Solana-based casinos for NFT purchases and has even been integrated into Solana DeFi protocols. With BONKSwap and potential DAO governance on the horizon, it’s built for longevity. With forecasts placing BONK’s price between $0.000065 and $0.000093 by year-end, investors could see gains of 300–400%, depending on market sentiment and Solana’s momentum. It’s got exchange listings, growing use cases, and one of the fastest blockchain ecosystems behind it. BONK may not have the froggy meme charm, but it’s got bite—and it’s not slowing down. Final Thoughts: Who Will Be the Next SHIB? All three meme coins bring something powerful to the table: LILPEPE is redefining what a meme coin can be, blending deep meme energy with cutting-edge blockchain technology and early gains that signal “bull run incoming.” PEPE holds onto its throne as a beloved meme veteran, and with whales backing it, it’s still a force to reckon with. BONK is making moves on Solana, combining real-world functionality with grassroots community love. But if we’re talking potential 808x gains, explosive community growth, Layer-2 innovation, and a killer presale that’s sprinting to the finish line—LILPEPE is looking like the next SHIB and possibly more. Don’t say you weren’t warned. Buy LILPEPE Now at $0.0012 Before the Price Jumps. Enter the $770,000 Giveaway The next meme coin king is rising—and its name is LILPEPE.

Pi App Studio, New Features Go Live for Pi2Day Leading the announcements is the launch of Pi App Studio, an AI-powered, no-code development platform. This tool enables users to create Pi applications easily, regardless of their technical background. By combining blockchain with artificial intelligence, Pi App Studio is designed to support real-world problem-solving through scalable app creation. The second major feature is Ecosystem Directory Staking, another platform-level utility. This allows both Pioneers and businesses to stake Pi to boost the visibility and ranking of apps within the Ecosystem Interface by staking Pi on the Mainnet blockchain. Major Pi Network Updates, But Pi Coin Price Under Pressure Additional updates include a new version release for Pi Nodes, integration with a third-party onramp aggregator, an extension of the .pi Domains Auction, and several enhancements to the Mainnet migration process. To engage the community, Pi Network has also launched the Pi2Day Ecosystem Challenge, where participants can explore new features and earn digital prizes. Full details are available in the Pi mining app. The Pi Browser now allows full account management , including KYC and dApp access, all in one place. These follow the KYC sync feature launched on June 19 to ease onboarding. Despite the progress, Pi coin has failed to rally. Many in the community were hoping for big announcements like a major exchange listing, AI integration, updates on transition to Pi’s Open Mainnet, or at least a clear timeline. The Open Mainnet launched in February 2025, but most pioneers still can’t access it due to pending KYC and migration delays. Will the Pi Coin Price Go up? Dr. Altcoin weighed in on the Pi2Day update and called it underwhelming. While the Core Team rolled out an AI tool to help build apps, the market was not impressed. In his view, Pi could be heading toward the $0.40 range in the coming days. So, what’s the Pi Day 2 update from the Pi Core Team? An AI support tool to help build new apps. The result? The market has already reacted negatively. Pi will likely hit in the $0.4 region in the coming days! @PiCoreTeam @nkokkalis @Chengdiao pic.twitter.com/caxVjum9Dh — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) June 28, 2025 He had predicted yesterday that if the Pi Core Team shares a noteworthy update, the price might spike to around $0.7–$0.9, but then return to the $0.5 range within a day or so. Pi coin is currently trading at $0.5444, down 1.8% in the last 24 hours. It is down over 26% this month and trading more than 80% below its all-time high of $2.99. The trend remains bearish, with most moving averages showing sell signals. If it fails to hold the key support around $0.50, it could drop further.

The move, which effectively ends one of the crypto industry’s most-watched court cases, pushed the token to its current price of $2.18 as investors cheered the news. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed the news on social media, saying, “We’re closing this chapter once and for all and focusing on what’s most important – building the Internet of Value.” The SEC is also expected to withdraw its appeal soon, effectively bringing an end to one of the crypto industry’s most closely watched court cases.

Just as this legal twist grabbed headlines, XRP jumped 4.5% in the last 24 hours and is now trading around $2.18. With so much happening, many are now asking — is XRP a good investment in 2025, or is it still too early to tell? XRP Legal Clarity One of the biggest reasons investors have stayed cautious about XRP was the ongoing lawsuit with the SEC . But things are changing. The court has now made it clear that XRP itself is not a security when sold on open markets — only direct sales to institutions were flagged. With Ripple dropping its cross appeal and the SEC expected to do the same, the legal cloud is finally clearing. This is helping restore investor trust, especially among institutions. ETF Approvals Could Push XRP Price $27 Another major boost is coming from Wall Street. Three futures ETFs were approved, and CME plans to list XRP futures soon. At the same time, Polymarket, a prediction platform, says there’s a 78% chance that a Ripple ETF will be approved by the end of 2025. Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto also shared his view, saying that if an XRP ETF gets approved, the price could jump to between $20 and $27. Whale Accumulation XRP Behind the scenes, big money is moving in. A new report shows that the number of wallets holding over 1 million XRP has hit a record high of 2,850. Also, wallets with more than 10,000 XRP have grown by 6.2% this year, now totaling around 306,000.. But Caution Still Matters Meanwhile, crypto analysts, like Arthur Hayes, suggest waiting for the XRP price to dip, perhaps around $1.30, to enter. However, the current resistance around $2.20–$2.24 could lead to short-term pullbacks.

Riding high on ETF optimism and explosive trading volume, PENGU has gained nearly 20% in the last 24 hours. As of writing, the price hovers around $0.01111, with market capitalization climbing to $699.85 million and 24-hour volume zooming 226% to $278.63 million. Investor sentiment appears bullish amid speculation that institutional entry may be on the horizon. So, how far will the PENGU price surge? Is a Dogecoin rally on the cards? Read this price analysis for potential price targets. Canary PENGU ETF: A Memecoin Meets Wall Street The CBOE BZX Exchange has officially submitted a regulatory filing with the U.S. SEC to list and trade the Canary PENGU ETF. This marks a potential first-of-its-kind fund bringing together memecoins and NFTs. According to the filing, the ETF will allocate 80-95% of its portfolio to the PENGU token, while the remaining share will consist of Ethereum-based Pudgy Penguin NFTs. Sponsored by Canary Capital Group LLC, the ETF is structured as a Delaware statutory trust, but will not be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This move is seen as a major step in merging meme assets with traditional financial vehicles. If approved, I believe, the ETF could bring institutional exposure to PENGU, possibly legitimizing the memecoin in the eyes of retail and institutional investors alike. PENGU Price Analysis: On the 4-hour chart, PENGU has broken above the critical resistance zone at $0.01187, with price now targeting the next resistance at $0.01255. Bollinger Bands show widening volatility, while the RSI has surged to 78.12, cautioning overbought conditions but also strong bullish momentum. Volume metrics support the rally, with a 226% rise in daily trading volume signaling significant accumulation. The recent bounce off the support near $0.00960 aligns with historical demand zones, and price action above the 20-SMA currently at $0.00984 further confirms the upward trend. That being said, if buying pressure persists, PENGU could test $0.01255 soon. However, a near-term correction is possible given the overheated RSI.

PENGU Coin is a Solana-based memecoin inspired by the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection, which brings together crypto humor with community-driven value and utility. Will Pengu Coin reach $1? The $1 would require massive market cap growth. While possible in the long term, it’s unlikely anytime soon without major adoption, utility expansion, or ETF-driven demand. Where to buy Pengu Coin?

Meanwhile, the PI token continues its slide, losing another 5% in the past 24 hours. PI and AI Citing the fundamental principles of the blockchain industry, including aiming to solve all fundamental human issues, the Core Team’s announcement outlined the incorporation of AI as the industry is at a “pivotal” moment in its development. They added that the world has several problems that are yet to be solved, which are as follows: The infancy of the AI application layer between AI infrastructure and real production. A lack of clarity regarding the role of human labor and intelligence; and Lingering questions on human well-being in an AI-pervasive world, where AI could generate an unprecedented amount of production, and how the resulting benefits are distributed to human beings in a way that maintains an acceptable or improved level of equality and equity. However, with the implementation of AI into blockchain, the team believes it has found a way through, as the two technologies could be “a scalable and accessible solution for societal distribution and redistribution.” In order to become a viable solution, though, the combination of the two needs to address several factors, including establishing authenticity, creating “a flourishing and prolific AI application layer,” a large and vocal social network, and being able to leverage blockchain’s intrinsic features. The team believes they have the answer to all of these, as the project has developed a native KYC network, it has over 13 million migrated users, and a global network of more than 60 million participants. To provide AI features to its growing user base, the Core Team has launched Pi App Studio, which is supposed to be a new model for app creation in the AI era. “In addition to its GenAI capability, important aspects that differentiate Pi App Studio from other current GenAI vibe programming platforms are its guided app-creation workflows, access to millions of potential creators, and users for these generated apps, which provides for an efficient iteration process that we believe is necessary for real product building,” explained the post. While the final version of the Pi App Studio will have numerous functions that allow users to create various online products, as the team described them, it is still under development and is currently in a beta phase with limited options. Ecosystem Directory Staking The second main takeaway from the Core Team’s statement is the introduction of Ecosystem Directory Staking – “a new platform-level utility that introduces a decentralized way for Pioneers and businesses to actively support and promote the ranking of Pi apps and utilities in the Ecosystem Interface.” It launches today and will be accessible through the Pi Browser. As the name suggests, it will allow users to stake their PI tokens on the Mainnet to apps of their choosing, which will boost their ranking and visibility. Despite these updates and new features, the aforementioned underlying asset experienced another sharp drop in the past 24 hours, losing over 5% of value and slipping back down to $0.52.

Despite tracking different markets, IBIT and IVV show comparable levels of volatility. IBIT’s price swings closely reflect Bitcoin’s, fueling concerns over how emerging cryptocurrencies might influence future performance. IBIT’s rapid success has also turned heads. Launched less than a year ago, it has already been hailed by industry analysts as the most successful ETF debut in history, shattering records that stood for decades. BlackRock’s IBIT exhibits significant victories in the crypto space Analyst Nate Geraci highlighted another milestone for BlackRock’s flagship Bitcoin ETF — this time in trading fee revenue. His analysis revealed that the iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) generates more fees for BlackRock than its largest fund, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV). IBIT pulls in roughly $186 million in annual revenue, managing nearly $75 billion in assets with a 25 basis point fee. Meanwhile, IVV earns around $183 million annually despite overseeing a massive $609 billion in assets, thanks to its much lower three basis point fee. Remarkably, IBIT achieved this in just 18 months. In other words, BlackRock is seeing greater activity on a Bitcoin ETF than on one based on the traditional stock market. This is a gradual success but a consistent achievement, and it is certainly impressive. Despite several recent setbacks for Bitcoin, IBIT has been a leader among ETFs. Although the sentiment in the asset class was mixed in May, IBIT recorded gains and was the leader when new inflows came into the space this month. While BlackRock’s altcoin-buying interest has been evident recently, the company’s BTC purchases indicate an ongoing commitment to IBIT. However, some ongoing doubts have been raised. This has addressed the fact that while IBIT outperforms IVV, BlackRock’s S&P 500 ETF, in fee revenue, they are converging in another way. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas compared IBIT’s 60-day volatility to that of the S&P 500 (SPX), noting a dramatic shift over the past year. He pointed out that IBIT was 5.7 times more volatile a year ago, but that ratio has now dropped to just above 1, indicating Bitcoin’s volatility is currently nearly equal to that of US stocks. Analysts raise concerns about the relationship between ETFs and Bitcoin Data shows that the entire Bitcoin ETF sector has mirrored Bitcoin’s volatility over recent months. In this context, BlackRock’s IBIT isn’t an exception; it’s a leader within a highly turbulent space. But that leadership comes with its concerns. In simple terms, ETF inflows are now playing a major role in shaping the crypto market. Some analysts worry that this influx of institutional capital permanently alters Bitcoin’s historical price behavior. Since Bitcoin ETFs were approved, BTC’s price has consistently stayed above pre-approval levels, a first for an asset class known for extreme volatility. Despite macroeconomic pressures like the halving cycle, recession fears, and political opposition, Bitcoin has only seen mild corrections. While IBIT isn’t breaking records for rapid growth anymore, it continues to dominate headlines, not for price action, but for the remarkable trading fees it’s generating.

Analysts reviewing fund-raise data, audits and liquidity mechanics now highlight three projects— MAGACOIN FINANCE , Neo Pepe Coin and Ruvi AI—as the cycle’s most potent reward-to-risk plays. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Viral Narrative Meets Hard-Capped Scarcity MAGACOIN FINANCE has surged to the front of the presale pack by pairing a “Make America Great Again” meme engine with disciplined tokenomics. A fixed 170 billion-token supply, ratified by a HashEx audit that cleared critical issues, removes the inflationary leakage common in low-cap hype coins. Daily micro-rounds push the offering price higher every few hours, a tactic that has already driven the raise past eight figures while selling out allocations minutes after each tranche opens. Analysts credit this blend of enforced scarcity, transparent security and viral branding for forecasts of 25x plus upside once centralized-exchange listings land later in 2025. Neo Pepe Coin and Ruvi AI: Engineered Pathways to 2025 Gains Neo Pepe Coin has raised more than $2 million as it enters Stage 4 of its 16-phase presale, driving the token from $0.05 toward $0.08 on a path to $0.16 and a $50 million cap. A 2.5% auto-burn liquidity fee, dual CertiK/Coinsult audits, scheduled Binance and Uniswap listings, and on-chain governance that lets holders vote on future moves. On the other hand, Ruvi AI has sold 165 million tokens for roughly $2 million at $0.015, with a guaranteed post-sale floor of $0.07 (~5x) and analyst targets near $1 (≈66x) if its July–December Web3 rollout lands. VIP bonus tiers, CyberScope audits, WEEX liquidity, and an AI platform spanning marketing, finance and entertainment support its long-term demand story. Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE eclipses its presale peers by pairing a culturally magnetic “Make America Great Again” brand with some of the tightest tokenomics of the year: a hard-capped supply, audited contracts and micro-round pricing that turns every fresh tranche into a demand event. While Neo Pepe’s staged climb and Ruvi AI’s guaranteed floor both promise healthy multiples, neither matches MAGACOIN FINANCE’s raw promotional reach or its ability to ignite FOMO with sell-outs that close in minutes. For investors seeking maximum narrative heat—and a community already proving it can dominate the news cycle—MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the most compelling blend of scarcity, security and viral momentum, positioning it as the standout bet for outsized 2025 returns.

This comes amid a growing bullish sentiment among participants and adoption news in the US. It was just a few days ago that US District Judge Analisa Torres dealt a blow to Ripple and the SEC, denying their joint motion for a quicker lawsuit resolution once again. In response, XRP’s price slumped by over 3%. While that price decline might have been anticipated, since the lawsuit technically continues months after Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that it had effectively ended, what was more surprising was the community’s reaction. Data shared by Santiment revealed that the crowd became significantly more bullish on XRP following Judge Torres’s decision, with positive comments outnumbering negative ones in the highest manner in over two weeks. Moreover, XRP surpassed BTC and ETH on this metric. Now, though, this sentiment seems to be paying off as Ripple’s cross-border token has soared by almost 5% in the past 24 hours and has tapped $2.2 for the first time in days. Additionally, XRP is the top performer from the 50 largest altcoins, marking bigger gains than ETH and BTC, both of which are essentially at the same levels as yesterday. Another possible reason behind the token’s impressive gains today is the adoption news coming from the US. As recently reported , Coinme has added XRP to over 28,000 locations in the country where people can buy and sell the asset with cash.

Larsen said he worked with a group of “really, really smart people” to build a digital currency that was faster, more efficient, and less energy-consuming than Bitcoin. While he praised Bitcoin’s conservative foundation, he felt XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, could improve upon its limitations without sacrificing its core values. Larsen Took a Jab at Competitors Larsen didn’t shy away from criticizing rival projects that lack consistency. Without directly naming it, he took a swipe at Stellar, co-founded by former Ripple exec Jed McCaleb, which famously burned over half its token supply in 2019. He described such moves as chaotic, arguing that constant changes, airdrops, and burn events make a project look unstable. According to Larsen, successful currencies are built on predictability, not impulsive shifts in direction. Praising XRP Community, Questioning Ethereum Larsen praised the XRP community for sticking with the project through ups and downs, likening their loyalty to that of Bitcoin supporters. However, he appeared less confident in the Ethereum community’s long-term commitment, subtly questioning whether it would demonstrate similar resilience. His comments added a touch of rivalry to the broader altcoin debate while reaffirming Ripple’s vision of XRP as a long-term, stable digital asset. Concerns Over U.S. Public Listings Switching gears, Larsen also criticized the current environment for companies looking to go public in the U.S. He called the process “very bureaucratic” and warned about the influence of short-sellers, who he claimed spread misinformation to drive down stock prices. His remarks align with Ripple President Monica Long’s earlier statement that the company has no plans to go public anytime soon, hinting at broader frustrations with U.S. regulatory hurdles. Moreover, there might be a bullish turn in XRP prices if XRP ETFs are approved this year. Since Bitcoin is getting overpriced, investors are looking for other alternatives to mitigate the risk factor. In all, Larsen’s comments showcase XRP as a purpose-built, sustainable alternative to Bitcoin, backed by a loyal community and designed for the long haul.",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-28 07:16:34

According to Ryan, the funds that police seize from these Bitcoin ATMs belong to Atlanta, the Georgia-based provider of these machines. This update is coming after news filtered into the space last week involving authorities in Texas retrieving $32,000 from a Bitcoin Depot kiosk using brute force. According to an update by the Bitcoin Depot COO Scott Buchanan, because law enforcement cut open the actual body of the kiosk, the machine will have to be completely replaced. Ryan said that law enforcement is liable for damages to these machines, despite trying to return large sums to users who have been scammed. Bitcoin Depot CLO sheds light on the repercussions of seeing cash from Bitcoin ATMs According to the firm’s website, a Bitcoin Depot kiosk costs around $14,000 under a profit-sharing program . “You’ve got these rogue law enforcement officers thinking that they’re doing the right things by these consumers,” Ryan said. “What they’re actually doing is creating another victim, which is us, with the damage of our property and seizing of our funds.” According to Buchanan, in most cases where something like this happens, the Bitcoin ATMs are always destroyed. He also added that if authorities are trying to seize funds from a Bitcoin Depot kiosk, the company will always unlock the machine. Ryan added that if the Bitcoin Depot’s property is damaged, the company is within their right to seek a refund from law enforcement, but the municipalities are always unable to foot the bill. “It’s not the norm that we would get anything back,” he said. Ryan added that Bitcoin Depot feels for the people being scammed through Bitcoin ATMs, but the company is entitled to keep the cash. He added that cops don’t understand the company’s business model or the fact that it is the customer’s Bitcoin that has already been stolen. “Once that transaction is completed, when the user inserts their cash and their crypto is funded into the wallet of their choosing, that ends our involvement in the transaction,” Ryan said. Bitcoin ATM scams kick up in the United States Scammers have been using Bitcoin ATMs and the fact that transactions carried out using the machines are irreversible to default people out of their money. These criminals have increased their activities in the United States in the last few months, impersonating the government, law enforcement, or banks. In 2024, Americans lost at least $247 million to crypto scammers through crypto kiosks, up 31% from 2023, according to an FBI report. Once a scammer receives a victim’s Bitcoin in their wallet, it is difficult to recover the funds. When a customer uses a Bitcoin ATM, they insert cash into the machine. According to Bitcoin Depot, it then sells an amount of Bitcoin directly to the user. To complete the transactions, the user needs to provide a wallet to receive the Bitcoin. In this case, the users always provide wallets belonging to the scammers, thereby sending the Bitcoin directly to the bad actors. There has also been confusion in court when authorities present warrant requests that show that the victims lost cash as part of the proceeds of crime and not the Bitcoin that scammers ran away with. Ryan also stressed that law enforcement will seize funds from Bitcoin Depot in a year, noting that most of these actions don’t involve brute force. “You have another subset that just doesn’t go through the warrant process at all,” Ryan added. “They’ll call us and they’ll say, ‘We’re about to break into your machine.’” While each state has their laws when it comes to issues like this, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled in two cases this year that Bitcoin Depot was entitled to cash paid by the victims for their Bitcoin transactions. That is mainly due to the terms and services of the company, where depositors are only allowed to present wallets that belong to them.

One DeFi project gaining rapid traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new crypto still in presale that many are calling a hidden gem. Mutuum Finance official presale has the token set at $0.03 in Phase 5. Mutuum Finance will launch at $0.06, giving current buyers a minimum return on investment of 100%. Mutuum Finance has surged past $11.2 million in funding at a price of $0.03, backed by CertiK audit, a stablecoin initiative, and a gamified rewards system. If ETH breaks out, early-stage altcoins like Mutuum Finance could benefit from exponential liquidity inflows, and some projections suggest it could deliver up to 10,000% upside as the DeFi sector accelerates. Ethereum Eyes Breakout as Support Holds Near $2,300 Ethereum (ETH) is priced at $2300 after experiencing some relatively low trading in the past days around $2110 as a result of the unstable geopolitical tensions and risk off mood. According to analysts, a move through the 20‑day might trigger an uptrend to the area of $2700-$2,800, whereas a fall below the lower support might cause a selloff to the levels below 2,000. Structural support by institutional inflow via Ethereum ETFs is ongoing, and network upgrades, such as that recently experienced in Pectra, and the ever-growing stablecoin issuance, are giving additional support to long-term fundamentals. With the major part of the DeFi sector resetting itself, market observers are also monitoring new projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Took Up Pace as Investor Mania Rocks The project is currently at Phase 5, selling tokens at $0.03. The phase also brings with it the potential 16.67% return on investment for investors since the price will increase in the next phase. Over 12,500 investors have already joined the presale so far, injecting over $11.2 million, unequivocal proof of growing trust in Mutuum Finance’s vision and future prospects. With its game-changing dual-lending platform and upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin, Mutuum Finance stands out in the crypto market, not through hype, but through actual utility and security at scale. The future is rosy, and the new features have enormous potential where Mutuum Finance will be part of the best altcoin investment options. Smart Tokenomics Make Mutuum Finance Stand Out Mutuum finance is intended to be long-term. Its Buy-and-Distribute feature will purchase tokens from the market every so often and redistributes them to the stakers. This rewards long-term holding, domesticates volatility in the market, and makes the token’s value, so long-term dedicated investors enjoy a stupendous advantage in the long run. Stablecoin Release and CertiK Auditing Grant Institutional Legitimacy Mutuum Finance’s much-anticipated launch of a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum is one of the steady solid pillars in this vision. It’s designed to endure market cycles and provide a stable alternative to failed algorithmic stablecoins that destabilized previous DeFi ecosystems. Mutuum Finance has even had a rigorous deep smart contract audit performed by CertiK, one of the most highly regarded cybersecurity firms in the blockchain ecosystem. $100K in Leaderboard & Giveaway Prizes Up for Grabs Mutuum Finance is celebrating its fast-paced growth and thanking early bird fans by creating a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. In addition, the project has also introduced a live leaderboard, and the top 50 MUTM token holders will be awarded special bonus rewards, adding a gamified touch to the presale and making it more fun to join. Ethereum’s potential move to $10,000 is sparking renewed interest in high-upside altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Priced at $0.03 in Phase 5 of its presale, MUTM has already raised $11.2 million from over 12,500 investors. With a 2x ROI locked in at launch and up to 10,000% projected gains, the token offers major upside. Join now before the next phase hits.

Wedson noted that the Altcoin Season Index is providing signals of opportunity, but current data suggests that we are still in a Bitcoin-heavy period. Wedson stated that the last 60-day data showed that Bitcoin outperformed altcoins. Stating that this situation should not be interpreted as a negative development, the CEO said, “This period, when altcoins are still lagging, may be a window to make savings.” Related News: Bitcoin Bull Michael Saylor's Company Strategy Hit with Multiple Lawsuits - Here's the Critical Date Stating that altcoins have remained weak against BTC in the last 48 hours, Wedson said, “However, history repeats itself; these cycles always repeat, a reaction movement may come soon.” In the analysis conducted by Alphractal, it was stated that the Fear and Greed Index was at the level of 65, indicating that investor sentiment is still neutral or slightly optimistic.

Their latest obsession is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending protocol that combines the thrill of fast growth with real DeFi utility. This time, it’s not about hoping a meme catches fire—it’s about locking in steady returns from a system that rewards participation, utility, and smart timing. Meme coins made millionaires early on—but only for the lucky few who timed their exit perfectly. The majority? They were left holding the bag, victims of pump-and-dump cycles, watching 10x hopes fade into -70% losses. That’s exactly why serious investors from SHIB, DOGE, and FLOKI communities are now migrating toward value-based tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Unlike hype-driven projects, MUTM is built on actual use cases: a beta-ready DeFi lending platform, real income through peer-to-peer and pool-based lending, and a CertiK audit score of 95 backing its legitimacy. Early believers who entered at $0.01 in Phase 1 have already gained 200%, and some have turned $1,500 into $4,500. We’re now in Phase 5 at $0.03, but that price won’t last long. By Phase 11, tokens will cost $0.06—double today’s price. Miss this phase, and you’ll be buying from those who paid less and are already earning yield. If MUTM hits $0.40 post-listing (as analysts predict), your $1,500 today could grow to $20,000+. P2P Lending for Meme and Niche Tokens Is Changing the Game What’s drawing attention isn’t just Mutuum’s low price point—it’s the structure of the protocol itself. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is pioneering both peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-contract (P2C) lending models in one ecosystem. This dual approach gives users flexibility and control—something meme coin holders rarely get from traditional DeFi platforms. P2C lending offers depositors a way to earn passive yield by placing tokens like ETH and DAI into non-custodial smart contract pools. Borrowers, on the other hand, take loans against overcollateralized positions, generating returns for liquidity providers without the need for active management. But what truly sets Mutuum apart is its P2P lending model, which allows users to create custom loan agreements using tokens that are often unsupported in typical DeFi systems. That includes coins like SHIB, PEPE, and DOGE. These assets can now be collateralized or borrowed against through tailor-made agreements between users, unlocking liquidity where most platforms see only volatility. For early SHIB investors, this is more than just flexibility—it’s leverage. Instead of waiting for SHIB’s next bull run, holders are putting their assets to work, negotiating deals with fellow users directly on Mutuum’s smart contract system. The result is a completely new earning engine, with terms that adapt to the user, not the other way around. Earning Systems That Grow Value Automatically Alongside this dual lending architecture is the introduction of mtTokens—Mutuum’s internal representation of deposited assets that not only reflect a user’s stake but also accrue value passively. Whenever a user deposits into the protocol’s lending pools, they receive mtTokens in return. These tokens grow in value as interest is collected from borrowers, meaning users can watch their holdings increase over time without lifting a finger. Those mtTokens can also be staked to earn dividends in MUTM tokens, which will be bought by protocol revenue and buybacks from the open market. It’s a closed-loop system that rewards long-term users and strengthens the platform’s economic foundation. Mutuum’s larger roadmap is only adding more fuel to the fire. A $100,000 giveaway is underway to reward early participants and incentivize adoption during the presale. Looking forward, Layer-2 integration is already on the table, aimed at reducing fees and boosting scalability. A decentralized stablecoin is also under development, backed by protocol assets and overcollateralized for stability. These additions point to a serious, long-term vision—one that includes real-world usability and enhanced treasury management. This isn’t just about launching a token; it’s about building a self-sustaining financial ecosystem with lending at its core. For the SHIB community and early altcoin investors looking for their next breakout, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just a bet—it’s a move toward a more intelligent kind of DeFi participation. One that uses meme profits to enter a yield-generating, revenue-sharing, utility-rich protocol before it gains full market traction. The project is still in Phase 5 of its presale, with the token currently priced at just $0.03 but that won’t last. As of now, only 50% of Phase 5 tokens remain, and prices are set to increase with each phase. Timing isn’t just important here—it’s everything. SHIB investors know what it feels like to buy early. Now, they’re doing it again—only this time, with a system designed to reward both belief and utility.

Crypto expert Vincent Van Code has provided clarity on the matter, breaking down the court decisions and Ripple’s remaining options moving forward. XRP Is Not a Security, But Only on the Open Market In a detailed post on X, Van Code reminded the community that Judge Analisa Torres ruled in July 2023 that XRP, when traded on exchanges or in programmatic sales, is not a security. “XRP, as a digital token, is not in and of itself a ‘contract, transaction, or scheme’ that embodies the Howey requirements of an investment contract,” stated Judge Torres. However, the court did label Ripple’s direct institutional sales of XRP as unregistered securities offerings, mainly because sophisticated investors bought it expecting profits tied to Ripple’s efforts. Ripple Has Paid the $125M Fine, What’s Next? According to Van Code, Ripple has already paid the $125 million penalty, which is currently held in escrow, waiting for final resolution. Despite the injunction that restricts Ripple from making direct institutional sales, the company is still allowed to sell XRP on open markets without legal issues. Can Ripple Still Sell to Institutions? Yes, but with restrictions. Van Code outlines two legal pathways Ripple can take to resume institutional XRP sales: Register the offering as a security under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933. Use exemptions like Rule 506(b) or Rule 506(c). If these are used, Ripple must file a Form D with the SEC within 15 days of the sale. These are standard practices for private placements and don’t imply wrongdoing, but they do come with strict compliance rules. [post_titles_links postid=”476018″] XRP Price Forecast: What Lies Ahead? Despite legal hurdles, XRP’s price action remains bullish : Up 361.6% in the past year Up 3.5% in the last 7 days Up over 5.1% in the last 24 hours Van Code believes institutional investors are still interested, seeing XRP as a long-term bet. He warns that short-term dips are often traps that push inexperienced traders out before a rally. “Ripple is operating legally and selling XRP in compliant ways,” Van Code concludes. “Don’t let short-term price volatility shake your confidence.” Final Thoughts The Ripple-SEC lawsuit may be nearing its conclusion , but institutional restrictions still exist, at least for now. XRP continues to show strength in the market, with rising investor confidence and growing legal clarity. As Ripple explores compliant sales routes, the token could see broader adoption and stronger institutional inflows in the coming months.

XRP itself is not a security, nor are programmatic sales or those on exchanges. However, Ripple’s direct institutional sales of XRP were deemed unregistered securities offerings due to investor profit expectations. What are Rule 506(b) and Rule 506(c) in relation to crypto sales? These are SEC exemptions allowing private placements. Rule 506(b) permits sales to accredited investors with limited non-accredited investors. Rule 506(c) allows public solicitation but requires verification that all investors are accredited. How high can XRP price go in 2025? Analysts have diverse predictions for XRP’s price in 2025. Some conservative estimates range from $2.50-$6, while more bullish forecasts suggest it could reach $8-$15, or even potentially $20-$30, especially with the likely end of the SEC lawsuit and potential spot XRP ETF approvals.",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-28 07:38:13

Current data shows that the global gaming industry continues to orbit around the gravitational pull of U.S. tech giants. They build the platforms. They control the rails. They dictate how games are built, sold, and played. But behind the industry’s glossy exterior lies a stagnant model—one that is centralized, extractive, and weighed down by legacy systems designed more for control than creativity. You might also like: The web3 gaming knowledge gap and how to bridge it | Opinion And while much of the world looks to Silicon Valley for the next big innovation, something else is quietly happening in Europe. A new generation of European developers, studios, and builders has emerged. Not just to play the game differently, but to put players and creators first, and rewrite the rules in their favour. These pioneers aren’t here to disrupt for the sake of buzz. They’re building something sharper, leaner, and fairer, line by line, system by system. The revolution won’t come with fireworks. It will come with tools that serve creators, platforms that reward players, and ecosystems that finally make sense. If gaming is truly going through a renaissance, then Europe is its Florence. And ignoring it would be a fatal mistake. The industry is broken: Europe is fixing it Let’s call it what it is: the traditional gaming industry is broken. Major platforms like Steam and Epic have defined the digital distribution model for years. But they’ve also become gatekeepers, taxing developers, siloing audiences, and locking value inside walled gardens. Players grind for hours and walk away with nothing. Developers pour years into games and take home scraps. Publishers chase visibility through outdated systems ruled by opaque algorithms. It’s a system that no longer serves the people who matter most: the gamers, the creators, and the communities. But Europe sees this decay for what it is: an opportunity. Not to slap a new interface on a tired model, but to rebuild gaming’s foundations entirely. European studios are leading the charge with a deeper focus on user experience, ownership, and transparency. They’re not chasing hype cycles or replicating web2’s worst habits in web3 wrappers. They’re designing platforms that empower instead of extract. These aren’t just new platforms. They’re creator-led, player-empowering, and built for the people the old system left behind. Europe’s strategy: Building better, building fundamentally different Here’s the thing—Europe never had the luxury of playing the industry’s game. For years, it lived in the shadow of bigger U.S. studios and funding giants. But that underdog status became its superpower. Without legacy systems to prop them up, European teams were forced to operate lean. Smaller budgets, tighter teams, and stricter regulations didn’t slow them down. Innovation in Europe wasn’t about making noise, but making things work. While the U.S. doubled down on ad-driven discovery and centralised control, Europe built with intent. It fostered a culture of experimentation, resilience, and creative risk-taking. Where others saw regulation as a burden, Europe saw standards to build against. That’s why its alignment with user rights, data transparency, and blockchain utility is no accident. It’s embedded in the culture. Developers outside of the U.S. aren’t chasing headlines. In overlooked corners of the industry, they’re reimagining what gaming can be: faster, fairer, more interoperable and creator-owned, and more human. Innovation beyond the game Europe’s gaming revolution isn’t obsessed with graphics or gimmicks. The real action? It’s under the hood. Here, innovation doesn’t stop at gameplay. It extends to the very rails of gaming from ownership models, distribution infrastructure mechanics, and cross-game economies. European builders are treating blockchain as it should be: an invisible muscle. It is not a gimmick slapped on for marketing but a silent engine driving fairness, interoperability, and speed. Players don’t just play—they own; developers don’t just publish—they profit. This isn’t a tweak. It’s a teardown of the economics of play. In this future, grinding isn’t wasted effort—it’s an investment. Game assets are no longer stuck in one title. They’re part of a broader, user-driven economy. And revenue doesn’t flow to gatekeepers. It flows to those who create value. This isn’t play-to-earn. This is play with purpose. The new platform power The centre of gravity is shifting. Where traditional US platforms hoarded power, Europe is decentralising it. Control is moving from platforms to players, from middlemen to makers. New European platforms aren’t building ecosystems for passive consumption. They’re creating tools for active participation. Developers get early access to infrastructure. Players get frictionless experiences and real ownership. Communities get governance, rewards, and say. This is more than just a new game store. This is a new operating system for gaming—a “gaming OS” that ties together experiences, players, and publishers into one interoperable universe. Ignore Europe, and you miss the future Yes, the U.S. still dominates headlines. But it’s Europe that’s laying the groundwork for gaming’s next chapter. Not with billion-dollar marketing budgets. But with better code. Better platforms. Better outcomes. A bolder vision. The revolution won’t be televised. It’ll be quietly deployed, patched, and scaled by European creators who are tired of the old game and ready to build a new one. This next frontier isn’t just about entertainment. It’s about equity, ownership, and agility. And it’s being built right now, block by block, inside the heart of Europe. The future of gaming is player-led. Creator-powered. Europe-built.

According to predictions from Google’s AI model, Gemini , XRP could experience substantial price growth once the lawsuit formally ends. Current Status of the Ripple Lawsuit The lawsuit is in its final stages. On June 27, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that Ripple is withdrawing its cross-appeal . The SEC is also expected to drop its appeal. This development follows a decision by Judge Analisa Torres on June 26 to deny a joint motion seeking to reduce Ripple’s penalty and eliminate the injunction related to institutional sales of XRP. The appeals process is currently paused until at least August 15, 2025 , while both parties work towards finalizing the settlement. A formal ruling from the District Court is pending and expected soon. Gemini’s XRP Price Forecasts Post-Lawsuit Based on Gemini’s projections, the end of the SEC lawsuit is expected to serve as a significant price catalyst for XRP. Gemini outlines multiple price stages depending on time horizons and market conditions following the resolution of the case. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In the short term, which refers to the first one to three months after the lawsuit concludes, Gemini predicts that XRP could rise to a range of $2.50 to $3.50. This forecast assumes that the removal of legal uncertainty will drive increased demand, especially from U.S.-based market participants who were previously sidelined due to regulatory concerns. In the medium term, defined as three to six months following the lawsuit’s conclusion, Gemini expects the price to stabilize at a higher range of $4 to $6. This target range represents a new all-time high and assumes the return of U.S. institutional liquidity. The potential approval of a spot XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) . It also depends on Ripple’s continued growth in cross-border payments, tokenized assets, and partnerships with financial institutions. For the long term, extending six to eighteen months after the settlement, Gemini forecasts that XRP could appreciate further to a price range of $6 to $10. This scenario assumes multiple successful spot ETFs, significant institutional adoption, and Ripple expanding its footprint in tokenized financial systems. The AI model notes that in an extremely bullish outcome, XRP could temporarily reach up to $12, contingent on broader crypto market growth.

For those invested in the future of digital assets and decentralized technologies, understanding the legal precedents set for artificial intelligence is paramount. This week, two prominent AI powerhouses, Meta and Anthropic, secured pivotal early victories in court, signaling a potential shift in the legal framework surrounding artificial intelligence and its interaction with creative works. Generative AI Fair Use: A Landmark Moment? The core of these recent rulings revolves around the controversial practice of training AI models on vast datasets, often including copyrighted material , without explicit permission. Federal judges sided with Meta and Anthropic in separate lawsuits, marking the first substantial legal validation of the AI companies’ argument that such training can indeed be considered ‘fair use.’ This is a monumental step for companies building generative AI fair use technologies. It suggests that the legal system might be leaning towards supporting the innovative development of AI, even when it leverages existing creative works. While these decisions do not yet establish a binding precedent, they certainly set a compelling tone for the numerous lawsuits still awaiting resolution. Unpacking the Impact on Publisher Lawsuits and AI Model Training The implications of these rulings are far-reaching, particularly for the many publisher lawsuits currently in motion against AI developers. Publishers have long argued that their intellectual property is being exploited without compensation, threatening their very business models. However, these early court victories provide a counter-narrative, suggesting that the transformation of copyrighted data into new AI models could fall under fair use. The Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast recently delved into these critical rulings, with hosts Max Zeff and Anthony Ha joined by Sean O’Kane. They highlighted that while appeals are anticipated, these initial decisions could ultimately shape how AI companies engage with entire industries in the future. The debate over how AI model training intersects with intellectual property rights is far from over, but these wins offer a crucial insight into the evolving legal perspective. Beyond Copyright: Other Innovations Shaping the Digital World While the spotlight is firmly on the AI legal battles , the Equity podcast episode also touched upon other fascinating developments shaping our digital and financial landscapes. These included: Kalshi’s significant $185 million funding round, highlighting the burgeoning yet legally complex world of prediction markets. The emergence of startups focused on reusable satellites, attracting attention from entities like the Department of Defense. Tesla’s continued push into autonomous vehicles with its robotaxi rollout in Austin, and how its strategy compares to competitors like Waymo. These diverse topics underscore the rapid pace of innovation across various sectors, all of which often face their own unique legal and regulatory challenges. The early legal victories for Meta and Anthropic represent a significant moment in the ongoing discourse between technological innovation and established copyright law. By affirming the ‘fair use’ argument for AI model training , these rulings provide a degree of legal validation for the generative AI industry. While the path ahead will undoubtedly involve more appeals and broader challenges, these decisions offer a glimpse into a future where AI development might have a clearer, albeit still contested, legal foundation. For creators, publishers, and AI developers alike, understanding these shifting sands is crucial as we navigate the exciting, yet complex, intersection of AI and intellectual property.

According to a report by the central bank in Bolivia, residents in the country are now embracing digital assets amid a rise in inflation and continuous US dollar shortages. The central bank report comes after a recent Reuters report citing that residents are now relying more on digital assets than the country’s currency. For instance, in the district of the Bolivian city of Cochabamba, some ATMs allow shoppers to swap their coins for digital assets, beauty salons offer discounts to customers if they pay in Bitcoin and people use Binance accounts to buy fried chicken. Bolivians embrace digital assets as inflation continues to rise The country has been facing a rising economic crisis , with its reserve of dollar near depletion, inflation at 40-year highs, and fuel shortages causing long lines at the pump. The country’s currency has also lost half its value on the black market since the beginning of the year, with the government holding the official exchange rate steady using artificial means. These events have pushed some Bolivians to crypto exchanges like Binance, digital assets like Bitcoin, and stablecoins like Tether as a hedge against inflation. While official data remains patchy and digital assets were banned in Bolivia until last year, the previous central bank figures showed transactions tied to digital assets at around $24 million in October. However, according to the new figures published by the central bank, transactions carried out using Electronic Payment Channels and Instrument for Virtual Assets (VA) rose more than 530% from about $46 million in the first half of 2024 to $294 million in the same period in 2025. “These tools have facilitated access to foreign currency transactions, including remittances, small purchases, and payments, benefiting micro and small business owners across various sectors, as well as families nationwide,” the bank said in a statement. Digital asset transactions were unbanned in June last year, and since that period, transaction volumes reached $430 million with more than 10,000 individual transactions recorded, the bank said. The Bolivian government is also working on a comprehensive framework for financial technology companies, a move that aligns with the international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) of Latin America. “This (crypto uptick) isn’t a sign of stability,” said former central bank head Jose Gabriel Espinoza. “It’s more a reflection of the deteriorating purchasing power of households.” Espinoza noted in a previous statement that daily USDT volumes are around $600,000, a fraction of the $18 to $22 million in the formal financial sector and the $12-$14 million in the black market. “While crypto is growing, it’s still a nascent market,” he said at the time. Binance has been the most popular platform for local users due to its low transfer fees and peer-to-peer trading features. The exchange has also not gone without its fair share of regulatory issues after it agreed to pay a fine of over $4.3 billion in 2023 after pleading guilty to violating anti-money laundering laws in the United States. In Cochabamba, some outlets allow users to pay using their Binance account or through a Bitcoin ATM linked to Blink, a wallet developed in El Salvador—which made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021. “If you go to the banks today, they don’t have dollars,” Unzueta said. He also explained how the ATMs work. “The idea is to move away from the piggy bank and instead use this technology.” According to outlets accepting digital assets, they have been able to attract majorly younger customers, who prefer to hold digital assets compared to the elderly ones who prefer to hold cash. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino also hailed the rise in USDT usage in the country, noting that it could open the gates for stablecoin usage in the retail market. He shared a picture of goods being quoted in USDT alongside his statement.

With this, the market participants, bulls and whales are collectively optimistic about the next price action, as the star token is primed to mark a new ATH in the coming weeks. With the growing bullish sentiments, here are the top trending topics within the markets that need to be closely watched in the second half of 2025. The data from Santiment has listed top trending keywords across the social media platforms and the potential reasons behind them. BTC This word is trending due to extensive discussions about Bitcoin’s role in crypto investment, market behavior, and comparisons with other tokens. Besides, significant financial activities such as large institutional purchases, bullish market trends, and Bitcoin’s influence in the crypto ecosystem contribute to its prominence. JULY This word is widely searched and talked about due to multiple significant upcoming events and developments in the crypto space. Key highlights are Bitcoin’s ATH, Coinbase launching perpetual-style crypto futures, various crypto events & giveaways, token unlocks, and legal hearings rescheduled to July. Besides, the anticipated signing of the GENIUS ACT & the Clarity ACT is moving to the Senate. Hence, July is positioned as a critical month for market movements. YAPYO YAPYO is trending due to its association with an on-chain ecosystem and community activity on the Arbitrum blockchain. It is preparing for a presale and has a growing follower base. It could also include community engagement, leaderboard competitions, and rewards for participation, indicating a strong crypto & blockchain context. Bakkt Recently, Bakkt Holdings filed for a billion-dollar shelf offering with the SEC, indicating plans to raise capital, probably to acquire Bitcoin & expand its digital asset treasury strategy. TIME This word is trending due to frequent discussions related to trading strategies, investments and holding periods in crypto. JUDGE The word “judge” is trending due to multiple legal developments involving Judge Analisa Torres in the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit. Recently, the Judge denied settlement motions for both parties, rejected requests to reduce penalties and upheld a permanent injunction against XRP institutional sales. These rulings have garnered significant attention from the cryptocurrency community and the media. USE This word is trending due to the discussions on various ‘use-cases’ of Bitcoin and related crypto wallets. The term is frequently mentioned in the context of evaluating Bitcoin’s functionality and relevance in financial and crypto ecosystems. BHUTAN Bhutan is trending because it has quietly mined 12,000 BTC since 2020, accumulating a Bitcoin reserve worth nearly $1.3 billion. This represents nearly 40% of Bhutan’s GDP, making it the world’s third-largest sovereign holder of Bitcoin behind China and the US. XRP XRP is trending due to Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC over whether XRP is a security. Additionally, XRP is gaining attention through technological integrations like cross-chain solutions and partnerships for a merchant payment system, contributing to cautious optimism about its price potential and future case in the markets. Ripple Ripple is also trending due to a similar reason of its ongoing lawsuit with the US SEC.

For those deeply entrenched in the cryptocurrency space, understanding the broader implications of emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their governance is paramount. A controversial federal proposal is now threatening to reshape the future of AI regulation in the United States, potentially blocking states and local governments from enacting their own AI laws for a decade. This move could have profound effects on innovation, consumer protection, and the very structure of governance, echoing the complex regulatory challenges often seen in the crypto industry itself. Understanding the Proposed AI Moratorium : A Decade-Long Freeze? Imagine a world where your state or local government is barred from addressing new technological challenges for ten years. That’s the core of the proposed AI moratorium , a federal provision that aims to prevent states and local entities from regulating AI models, systems, or automated decision systems. This measure, dubbed the “AI moratorium,” was controversially inserted into a budget reconciliation bill, known as the “Big Beautiful Bill,” in May. Key figures like Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) are pushing for its inclusion in a significant GOP legislative package, with a critical July 4 deadline looming. The proponents of this moratorium, including tech giants like OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Anduril’s Palmer Luckey, and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen of a16z, argue that a “patchwork” of diverse state AI laws would stifle American innovation. They contend that a unified federal approach is essential for the U.S. to maintain its competitive edge against global rivals like China in the rapidly accelerating AI race. The Debate: Is This a Boost for AI Innovation or a Threat? The proposed moratorium has ignited a fierce debate, dividing stakeholders across political lines and industry sectors. On one side, advocates for unbridled AI innovation argue that fragmented state regulations would create an untenable compliance burden for AI companies, slowing down development and deployment. Their concern is that a mosaic of differing rules across states would make it exceedingly difficult for companies to scale their services nationwide, thereby hindering the U.S.’s ability to lead in AI development. However, a broad coalition of critics stands firmly against the measure. This group includes most Democrats, some Republicans, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, labor organizations, AI safety nonprofits, and consumer rights advocates. They warn that such a provision would effectively disarm states, preventing them from passing crucial laws to protect citizens from potential AI harms. This could leave powerful AI firms largely unchecked, operating with minimal oversight and accountability, raising significant concerns about consumer safety, privacy, and algorithmic bias. How This Impacts Existing State AI Laws and Future Protections The reach of the proposed AI moratorium is extensive, threatening to preempt not only future regulations but also existing state AI laws that have already been enacted. Consider these examples: California’s AB 2013: This law mandates that companies disclose the data used to train AI systems, a crucial step for transparency. Tennessee’s ELVIS Act: Designed to safeguard musicians and creators from AI-generated impersonations, protecting intellectual property and artistic integrity. Public Citizen has compiled a comprehensive database illustrating the vast array of AI-related laws that could be nullified by the moratorium. Interestingly, this database reveals instances where multiple states have passed similar laws, which, contrary to the “patchwork” argument, could actually simplify navigation for AI companies. For example, Alabama, Arizona, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Montana, and Texas have all established criminal or civil liability for distributing deceptive AI-generated media intended to influence elections. Furthermore, the moratorium imperils significant AI safety bills awaiting signature, such as New York’s RAISE Act, which would compel large AI labs nationwide to publish detailed safety reports. The potential loss of these protective measures underscores the deep concerns of those who believe the moratorium prioritizes corporate freedom over public safety. The Intricate Dance of Federal AI Policy : What’s Next? The path to incorporating the AI moratorium into a budget bill has been a masterclass in legislative maneuvering, highlighting the complexities of establishing cohesive federal AI policy . Initially, provisions in budget bills must demonstrate a direct fiscal impact. Senator Cruz revised the proposal in June, making compliance with the moratorium a condition for states to receive funds from the $42 billion Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program. A subsequent revision on Wednesday aimed to tie the requirement only to a new $500 million pot of BEAD funding within the bill. However, a closer examination of the revised text suggests it could still jeopardize already-obligated broadband funding for non-compliant states. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) has sharply criticized Cruz’s language, arguing that it “forces states receiving BEAD funding to choose between expanding broadband or protecting consumers from AI harms for ten years.” This puts states in a difficult position, potentially sacrificing consumer safeguards for essential infrastructure development. Currently, the provision faces a standstill. While Cruz’s initial revision cleared procedural review, recent reports indicate that discussions have reopened, and the language of the AI moratorium remains a subject of ongoing negotiation. Sources suggest that the Senate is preparing for heavy debate this week on amendments to the budget, including one that would aim to strike the AI moratorium entirely, followed by a “vote-a-rama” – a rapid series of votes on all proposed amendments. Navigating the Complexities of AI Regulation : Industry Perspectives Industry leaders themselves present a mixed picture on the best approach to AI regulation . Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer, expressed concerns that the “current patchwork approach to regulating AI isn’t working and will continue to worsen,” potentially hindering the U.S.’s race for AI dominance. He even invoked Vladimir Putin’s quote about AI determining the world’s direction to underscore the urgency. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman echoed these sentiments, suggesting that while some adaptive regulation for existential risks is beneficial, a state-by-state “patchwork” would be “a real mess” for service providers. He also questioned policymakers’ ability to regulate AI effectively given the technology’s rapid evolution, fearing that lengthy legislative processes might be outpaced by technological advancements. However, a closer look at existing state laws tells a nuanced story. Most current state AI laws are not broad, stifling regulations. Instead, they are targeted measures designed to protect individuals from specific harms: deepfakes, fraud, discrimination, and privacy violations. These laws often focus on AI use in sensitive areas like hiring, housing, credit, healthcare, and elections, incorporating disclosure requirements and algorithmic bias safeguards. Bitcoin World has sought clarification from OpenAI, Meta, Google, Amazon, and Apple regarding specific state laws that have genuinely hindered their progress or made navigation overly complex, but has not yet received responses. The Case Against Preemption: A Matter of Oversight Critics, including Emily Peterson-Cassin of Demand Progress, argue that the “patchwork argument” is a long-standing tactic used by corporations to avoid oversight. “Companies comply with different state regulations all the time,” she stated. “The most powerful companies in the world? Yes. Yes, you can.” For many, the core issue isn’t about fostering AI innovation but rather about sidestepping accountability. Nathan Calvin, VP of state affairs at the nonprofit Encode, highlighted that while a strong federal AI safety law that preempts states would be welcomed, the current proposal “takes away all leverage, and any ability, to force AI companies to come to the negotiating table.” Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, a prominent voice against the moratorium, described it as “far too blunt an instrument” in an opinion piece for The New York Times. He stressed AI’s rapid advancement, predicting fundamental changes within two years and complete uncertainty in ten. Amodei advocated for collaboration between government and AI companies to establish transparency standards for sharing information about practices and model capabilities, rather than a prescriptive approach to product release. Interestingly, opposition to the AI moratorium isn’t confined to one political party. Some Republicans, including Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), are concerned about states’ rights and protecting citizens from AI harms, despite the provision being crafted by prominent Republicans like Cruz. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) has even threatened to oppose the entire budget bill if the moratorium remains. What Do Americans Want for AI Regulation ? While Republicans like Senator Cruz and Senate Majority Leader John Thune advocate for a “light touch” approach to AI governance, public sentiment appears to lean differently. A recent Pew Research survey revealed that approximately 60% of U.S. adults and 56% of AI experts are more concerned about the government not going far enough in regulating AI than they are about over-regulation. Furthermore, Americans largely lack confidence in the government’s ability to regulate AI effectively and remain skeptical of industry-led responsible AI initiatives. This public demand for robust AI regulation adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing legislative battle. The Crucial Juncture for AI Governance The debate surrounding the proposed federal AI moratorium represents a pivotal moment for AI governance in the United States. It pits the desire for streamlined AI innovation against the critical need for consumer protection and state autonomy. As lawmakers grapple with this complex issue, the outcome will significantly shape how AI develops, how it is deployed, and how citizens are safeguarded from its potential downsides for the next decade. The implications extend far beyond the tech sector, touching upon fundamental principles of federalism and public trust. The unfolding “vote-a-rama” in the Senate will be a defining moment in this crucial legislative battle, determining whether states retain their power to respond to AI’s evolving challenges or if a federal freeze will take hold.

For those deeply invested in the decentralized future of cryptocurrency and blockchain, understanding the foundational rules governing AI is paramount. A federal proposal, aiming to halt states and local governments from enacting their own AI regulation for a decade, is on the brink of becoming law. This move could reshape the very foundation of how AI is developed, deployed, and overseen in the United States, impacting everything from data privacy to the digital assets market. The Looming Federal AI Law: What’s at Stake? A contentious federal proposal is currently making its way through Congress, threatening to prohibit states and local governments from regulating AI for the next 10 years. Spearheaded by Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and other lawmakers, this provision seeks inclusion in a significant GOP budget bill ahead of a crucial July 4 deadline. The core of the debate centers on a fundamental tension: should the pursuit of rapid AI innovation be prioritized over localized consumer safeguards? Proponents’ View: Supporters, including OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Anduril’s Palmer Luckey, and a16z’s Marc Andreessen, argue that a ‘patchwork’ of differing state regulations would stifle American innovation. They emphasize the urgent need to maintain a competitive edge against nations like China in the global AI race. Critics’ Concerns: A diverse group, including most Democrats, many Republicans, Anthropic’s CEO Dario Amodei, labor groups, AI safety nonprofits, and consumer rights advocates, vehemently oppose the measure. They warn that this provision would effectively disarm states, preventing them from passing laws to protect citizens from AI-related harms and allowing powerful AI firms to operate with minimal oversight or accountability. The provision, dubbed the ‘AI moratorium,’ was quietly inserted into the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ in May. It is designed to prevent states from ‘enforcing any law or regulation regulating [AI] models, [AI] systems, or automated decision systems’ for a full decade. This far-reaching measure could even preempt state AI laws that have already been enacted. Why Some Advocate for a Unified AI Innovation Approach The primary argument put forth by proponents of the federal preemption is the fear of a ‘patchwork’ of regulations hindering AI innovation . They suggest that navigating disparate laws across 50 states would create an unbearable burden for AI developers, slowing down progress and making it difficult to deploy new technologies nationwide. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has publicly expressed concerns that a fragmented regulatory landscape would be ‘a real mess’ for offering services. He also raised questions about the agility of policymakers to regulate AI effectively when the technology is advancing so rapidly. ‘I worry that if…we kick off a three-year process to write something that’s very detailed and covers a lot of cases, the technology will just move very quickly,’ Altman stated. Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer, echoed these sentiments, stressing that the current approach isn’t working and could have ‘serious implications’ for the U.S. in its race for AI dominance. Protecting Citizens: The Battle for State AI Laws While the federal proposal aims for uniformity, a closer look at existing state AI laws reveals a different story. Many states have already taken proactive steps to safeguard their citizens from specific AI-related harms. For example, California’s AB 2013 mandates companies to disclose data used to train AI systems, and Tennessee’s ELVIS Act protects musicians and creators from AI-generated impersonations. Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, has compiled a database of AI-related laws that would be affected by the moratorium. This database highlights that many state laws focus on tangible consumer protection , addressing issues like deepfakes, fraud, discrimination, and privacy violations. They target AI use in critical sectors such as hiring, housing, credit, healthcare, and elections, often including disclosure requirements and algorithmic bias safeguards. For instance, several states, including Alabama, Arizona, and Texas, have criminalized or established civil liability for distributing deceptive AI-generated media intended to influence elections. Critics argue that these state-level efforts are crucial for addressing immediate harms and providing a necessary layer of accountability. Emily Peterson-Cassin, corporate power director at Demand Progress, challenged the ‘patchwork’ argument, stating, ‘The fact is that companies comply with different state regulations all the time. The most powerful companies in the world? Yes. Yes, you can.’ The Intricate Dance of Legislation: Funding and Preemption Getting the AI moratorium into a budget bill has required intricate legislative maneuvering, as budget provisions must demonstrate a direct fiscal impact. Senator Cruz revised the proposal in June, tying compliance with the AI moratorium to states receiving funds from the $42 billion Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program. A subsequent revision on Wednesday claimed to link the requirement only to a new $500 million in BEAD funding included in the bill. However, a detailed examination of the revised text suggests that the language could also threaten to pull already-obligated broadband funding from states that do not comply with the new federal AI law . Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) criticized Cruz’s language, asserting that the provision ‘forces states receiving BEAD funding to choose between expanding broadband or protecting consumers from AI harms for ten years.’ This legislative tactic underscores the high stakes involved, as it leverages critical infrastructure funding to push through a broad federal preemption on AI governance. A Unified Front? The Unexpected Opposition to Federal Preemption Opposition to the AI moratorium is not confined to one political party. While crafted by prominent Republicans, the provision has faced notable resistance from within the GOP itself. This includes Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO), who is concerned about states’ rights and is reportedly working with Democrats to strip the measure from the bill. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) has also voiced criticism, arguing that states need to protect their citizens and creative industries from AI harms. Even Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) has stated she would oppose the entire budget bill if the moratorium remains. Beyond politics, industry leaders like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have also spoken out. In an opinion piece for The New York Times, Amodei called a ’10-year moratorium far too blunt an instrument.’ He argued that AI is advancing too quickly, suggesting that ‘in 10 years, all bets are off.’ Instead of prescribing product releases, Amodei believes the government should collaborate with AI companies to establish transparency standards for sharing information about practices and model capabilities. This broad opposition highlights the complex nature of effective AI regulation , where concerns about innovation, safety, and governance intersect. What Do Americans Really Want from AI Regulation? The debate in Congress over a ‘light touch’ approach to AI governance, advocated by figures like Senator Cruz, contrasts sharply with public sentiment. A recent Pew Research survey found that a majority of Americans desire more regulation around AI. Approximately 60% of U.S. adults and 56% of AI experts expressed greater concern that the U.S. government would not go far enough in regulating AI, rather than going too far. This public sentiment indicates a strong desire for robust consumer protection in the face of rapidly advancing AI technologies. Furthermore, the survey revealed that Americans largely lack confidence in the government’s ability to regulate AI effectively and are skeptical of industry efforts towards responsible AI. This skepticism underscores the challenge for lawmakers attempting to balance the promotion of AI innovation with the public’s demand for safety and accountability. The disconnect between congressional proposals and public expectations adds another layer of complexity to this pivotal legislative battle. The Path Forward for AI Regulation Currently, the provision faces an uncertain future. While an initial revision passed procedural review, recent reports suggest that discussions on the AI moratorium’s language have reopened. The Senate is expected to engage in heavy debate this week on amendments to the budget, including one that could strike the AI moratorium entirely. This will be followed by a ‘vote-a-rama,’ a series of rapid votes on the full slate of amendments, with an initial vote on the megabill slated for Saturday. The outcome of this legislative struggle will have profound implications for the future of AI development and deployment in the United States. It will determine whether a centralized federal AI law dictates the pace and scope of innovation, or if states retain the autonomy to craft tailored safeguards for their citizens. The ongoing debate underscores the urgent need for a balanced approach that fosters technological advancement while ensuring robust protections for individuals in an increasingly AI-driven world.

The financial world is abuzz with the news that KraneShares, an asset management firm renowned for its innovative approaches to alternative investments, has taken a significant step towards bridging traditional finance with the burgeoning digital asset market. Their recent SEC filing for a “Coinbase 50 Index ETF” could reshape how investors gain exposure to the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, offering a streamlined and diversified pathway. What is the Proposed Coinbase 50 Index ETF? At its core, the proposed Coinbase 50 Index ETF aims to track the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market capitalization, as reported by The Block. This isn’t just another fund; it’s a strategic move to provide investors with broad exposure to the cryptocurrency market without the complexities of direct ownership. Think of it as a diversified basket of the most prominent cryptocurrencies, meticulously selected and managed. Unlike single-asset ETFs, which focus on one specific cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum, an index-based ETF offers instant diversification. This approach is designed to mitigate some of the inherent volatility associated with individual digital assets, spreading risk across a broader spectrum of the market’s leading players. For many, this represents a significant leap forward in making crypto investments more accessible and less daunting. KraneShares’ Strategic Vision and the SEC Filing KraneShares , known for its focus on global and thematic ETFs, is no stranger to pioneering new investment avenues. Their decision to pursue a Coinbase 50 Index ETF underscores a growing confidence in the long-term viability and institutional acceptance of digital assets . This SEC filing is a critical milestone, signaling a formal request for regulatory approval, which is often the most significant hurdle for any new financial product in the crypto space. The firm’s reputation for navigating complex markets, particularly in areas like China-focused investments, lends considerable weight to this initiative. Their expertise in structuring regulated investment products could be key to bringing this innovative crypto ETF to fruition. The very act of filing sends a strong signal to the market: traditional finance is increasingly recognizing and seeking regulated ways to engage with cryptocurrencies. The Unparalleled Benefits of a Diversified Crypto ETF For both seasoned investors and newcomers, a Coinbase 50 Index ETF offers compelling advantages that could revolutionize crypto portfolio management. Consider these key benefits: Instant Diversification: Instead of researching and buying multiple individual cryptocurrencies, investors can gain exposure to 50 top assets in one go, significantly reducing idiosyncratic risk. Ease of Access: Trading an ETF is as simple as buying stocks through a traditional brokerage account, removing the need for crypto exchanges, digital wallets, or understanding complex blockchain mechanics. Regulatory Clarity: An SEC-approved ETF operates within a regulated framework, potentially offering greater investor protection and peace of mind compared to unregulated crypto platforms. Professional Management: The fund would be managed by experienced professionals, handling rebalancing, custody, and other operational complexities. Liquidity: ETFs are generally highly liquid, allowing investors to buy and sell shares throughout the trading day at market prices. This approach democratizes access to a diversified portfolio of digital assets , making it easier for a broader range of investors, including institutions, to participate in the crypto market’s growth story. Navigating the Challenges: The Road Ahead for Crypto ETFs While the prospect of a Coinbase 50 Index ETF is exciting, the path to approval and market success is not without its challenges. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically been cautious regarding cryptocurrency-related products, citing concerns about market manipulation, custody, and investor protection. Key hurdles for this crypto ETF include: Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC will meticulously review the fund’s structure, custody arrangements, valuation methodologies, and measures to prevent fraud and manipulation. Custody Solutions: Safely storing a diverse basket of 50 digital assets requires robust, secure, and regulated custody solutions, which can be complex to implement. Market Volatility: While diversification helps, the underlying digital assets market remains highly volatile. The ETF’s value will fluctuate significantly, requiring investors to have a high-risk tolerance. Index Methodology: The specific rules for selecting and weighting the ‘top 50’ assets, and how often the index is rebalanced, will be crucial and subject to SEC approval. The success of this SEC filing by KraneShares will depend heavily on their ability to address these concerns comprehensively and transparently, aligning with the SEC’s stringent requirements for investor protection. Comparing the Coinbase 50 Index ETF with Existing Crypto Investment Vehicles How does this new proposal stack up against what’s already available? Investors currently have several options for crypto exposure: Direct Cryptocurrency Purchases: Offers full control but requires technical knowledge, managing wallets, and dealing with exchanges. Single-Asset Bitcoin/Ethereum ETFs: Like spot Bitcoin ETFs, these provide exposure to one specific asset but lack diversification. Crypto Trusts (e.g., Grayscale Bitcoin Trust): Often trade at premiums or discounts to their net asset value (NAV) and may have higher fees. Blockchain Equity ETFs: Invest in companies involved in blockchain technology or crypto mining, offering indirect exposure to the crypto ecosystem. The Coinbase 50 Index ETF stands out by offering diversified, direct exposure to a broad range of leading digital assets within a regulated ETF wrapper. This blend of diversification and accessibility is a powerful combination that current products often lack. The Broader Impact on Digital Assets and Institutional Adoption The potential approval of KraneShares’ Coinbase 50 Index ETF could have a profound impact beyond just investment products. It signifies a maturation of the digital assets market and a growing acceptance by mainstream financial institutions. Such an ETF could: Attract New Capital: Open the floodgates for institutional investors, wealth managers, and retail investors who prefer regulated, traditional investment vehicles. Increase Market Liquidity: Greater participation can lead to deeper markets and potentially reduced volatility over time. Legitimize the Asset Class: An SEC-approved, diversified crypto ETF lends significant credibility to cryptocurrencies as a legitimate and investable asset class. Spur Innovation: May encourage other asset managers to develop similar or even more sophisticated crypto-related financial products. This development is a testament to the persistent efforts of firms like KraneShares to innovate and provide investors with structured access to emerging markets, further cementing the role of digital assets in the global financial landscape. Actionable Insights for Investors While we await the SEC’s decision on the Coinbase 50 Index ETF , what should potential investors consider? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on SEC announcements and news regarding the ETF’s approval process. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Even diversified crypto products carry significant risk. Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your comfort level for volatility. Understand the Underlying Index: Familiarize yourself with how the Coinbase 50 Index selects and weights its assets. Consult a Financial Advisor: Discuss how a crypto ETF might fit into your broader investment portfolio. The advent of such a product could be a truly transformative moment for investors seeking broad exposure to the crypto market through a familiar and regulated structure. A Glimpse into the Future of Crypto Investment The proposed Coinbase 50 Index ETF by KraneShares represents more than just a new financial product; it symbolizes a growing convergence between traditional finance and the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies. This SEC filing is a bold step towards making digital assets a more integral part of mainstream investment portfolios, offering a diversified and regulated entry point for countless investors. As the regulatory landscape evolves and the market matures, products like this crypto ETF are crucial in shaping the future of investment, offering clarity and accessibility in a space that has often been perceived as opaque. The journey is far from over, but the direction is clear: digital assets are here to stay, and innovative vehicles like the KraneShares Coinbase 50 Index ETF are paving the way for broader adoption.

Medicaid cuts and SALT deduction changes reflect intra-party negotiations on key provisions. A $25 billion fund is set for rural hospitals, with the bill vote scheduled before July 4. U.S. Senate Republicans have released a revised $4.2 trillion tax and spending bill, a move that comes as President Trump’s July 4 deadline for passage draws near. The 940-page draft , released late Friday night, marks a huge step in the Republican-controlled Senate’s push to overhaul the nation’s tax and spending policies before the Independence Day holiday. What Are the Key Compromises in the Bill? The newly revised bill reflects a series of major compromises aimed at reconciling different factions within the Republican Party. Among the most notable provisions is a temporary increase in the cap on State and Local Tax (SALT) deductions. The bill proposes raising the current $10,000 limit to $40,000 for five years, a key demand from lawmakers in high-tax states.

Ripple, the company behind the XRP token, has announced a significant move that could finally bring an end to its long-standing legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This isn’t just another twist in the tale; it’s a potential breakthrough that could redefine regulatory clarity for the entire cryptocurrency market. Ripple SEC Case: A Turning Point for Digital Assets? In a recent announcement that sent ripples (pun intended) through the crypto community, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed via X that the company is formally ending its cross-appeal in the ongoing legal saga with the SEC. This isn’t a unilateral move; Garlinghouse also noted that the SEC is expected to withdraw its own appeal, a possibility that the agency had previously hinted at. For years, the Ripple SEC case has cast a long shadow over the crypto space, particularly for XRP holders and projects seeking regulatory certainty in the United States. This latest development suggests that both parties are finally ready to put the contentious litigation behind them, paving the way for a clearer future. XRP Lawsuit Update: What Does Ending the Appeals Mean for Investors? For anyone following the tumultuous journey of XRP, this XRP lawsuit update is undoubtedly significant. The legal battle, initiated by the SEC in December 2020, accused Ripple of conducting an unregistered securities offering through its sale of XRP. While Ripple secured a partial victory in July 2023, with the court ruling that programmatic sales of XRP on exchanges did not constitute unregistered securities offerings, the institutional sales remained a point of contention. The appeals from both sides meant continued uncertainty. The withdrawal of these appeals, if it proceeds as expected, effectively closes the book on this particular chapter, potentially removing a major overhang for XRP’s price and its wider adoption, especially within the U.S. market. So, what are the key implications of this expected resolution? Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: A definitive end to the lawsuit could provide much-needed clarity for XRP and other digital assets regarding their classification in the U.S. Potential for Renewed Growth: With the legal cloud lifted, XRP could see renewed interest from institutional investors and financial platforms previously hesitant to engage. Market Sentiment Boost: A positive resolution for Ripple could improve overall market sentiment towards cryptocurrencies, signaling a move towards clearer regulatory frameworks. Ripple Cross-Appeal: Why This Strategic Move Now? The decision to drop the Ripple cross-appeal is a strategic one, indicating a strong belief within Ripple that the core legal arguments have been sufficiently addressed and that further litigation would be unproductive. It’s a move towards closure, rather than prolonging a battle that has already spanned years. It’s worth recalling that earlier this year, there was an attempt at a settlement. The SEC had proposed a significantly reduced financial penalty of $50 million (down from an initial demand of $770 million) and even requested the removal of the injunction on Ripple’s institutional XRP sales. However, the court rejected this joint effort to conclude the case at that time, pushing both parties back to the drawing board. The current situation, where both sides appear willing to drop their appeals, suggests a more fundamental shift in their approach, possibly recognizing that the existing court rulings provide sufficient ground for moving forward without further legal wrangling over specific aspects of the previous judgments. SEC vs Ripple: The End of a Defining Legal Battle? The SEC vs Ripple lawsuit has been more than just a dispute between a regulator and a company; it has become a defining case for the entire crypto industry. It tested the boundaries of existing securities laws against the innovative nature of digital assets. The SEC’s aggressive stance against what it deemed unregistered securities offerings has been a major point of friction for many crypto projects operating in the U.S. The potential end of this case could set a crucial precedent, offering insights into how U.S. courts interpret digital assets under existing securities laws. This outcome is not just about Ripple or XRP; it’s about the future regulatory landscape for all cryptocurrencies. Crypto Legal News: Broader Implications for the Industry Beyond the immediate impact on Ripple and XRP, this piece of crypto legal news carries significant weight for the broader digital asset ecosystem. A resolution to such a high-profile case could: Influence Future Enforcement Actions: The SEC might adjust its approach to future enforcement actions based on the outcomes and precedents set by the Ripple case. Encourage Innovation: With greater clarity, blockchain companies might feel more confident in developing and launching new projects in the U.S. without the constant threat of regulatory ambiguity. Pave the Way for Legislation: A clear judicial outcome could spur lawmakers to accelerate the creation of comprehensive crypto legislation, moving beyond relying on outdated laws. While the full ramifications will unfold over time, the anticipated conclusion of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit marks a pivotal moment. It signifies a potential shift from protracted legal battles towards a more defined regulatory environment, fostering growth and innovation within the U.S. crypto market. The journey has been long and arduous, but the finish line appears to be in sight. For XRP holders and the wider crypto community, this potential resolution is not just a sigh of relief but a beacon of hope for greater regulatory clarity and stability in the future. It underscores the resilience of the crypto industry in navigating complex legal challenges and continues to push for a future where digital assets can thrive under clear, fair regulations.

It is currently taking support from April lows, and breaking short-term EMA bands would trigger a rise. However, if the bearishness takes control and breaks $1.8 support, then a fall to $1 is likely. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) NEAR Crypto Price Prediction July 2025 1.0 2.75 3.50 NEAR Price Prediction 2025 After reaching a $9 peak in Q1 2024, NEAR dropped to $3.5 due to selling pressure in Q2 and consolidated in Q3. Donald Trump’s election win in Q4 boosted the altcoin sector, raising hopes for a new all-time high and crossing the $10 mark. However, NEAR only rose to $8.2 before facing a strong supply level. This supply level hindered price action in Q1 2025, causing the breach of the $3.5 multi-month support, which turned into resistance, leading to a low of $1.8. In Q2, a brief recovery occurred but ended in mid-May due to a “support-turned-resistance block.” Currently, in the fourth week of June, NEAR has found support at $1.8, close to April’s swing low. If NEAR falls from this level, $1.8 will serve as its short-term defense line. A break below this could heighten investor fears, potentially targeting the $1.0 mark. However, in July, if bullish factors resurface, a short-term rise could occur, pushing for a retest of the $3.5 resistance. Meanwhile, current tools like MACD and AO are turning bullish in the short term, with a bullish cross in the MACD tool. And, RSI is gaining strength, flipping the 14-SMA smoothed line from oversold territory, and money flow is rising with CMF recovering from a negative region to the zero line. Additionally, increased adoption and institutional interest, along with improved geopolitical conditions, could benefit the entire altcoin market. There is a strong possibility that NEAR may aim to retest the $8 to $9 supply range by the end of 2025. For this to happen, it must achieve a weekly close above $3.5 in June or July and register a Change of Character (ChoCh) above $4.345 in the following months for long-term bullish confirmation.

Jefferies Chief Market Strategist Explains,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-will-happen-if-fed-chairman-jerome-powell-steps-down-jefferies-chief-market-strategist-explains/,"Speaking on the Power Lunch program on CNBC, Jefferies chief market strategist David Zervos said that a possible power struggle at the Fed could have positive effects on the stock market. According to Zervos, changes in the Fed's structure could result in a president who advocates lower interest rates, which could create a positive environment for markets. Zervos noted that the term of current FED Chair Jerome Powell will end in the spring of 2025, and that President Trump could appoint at least two new members during this period. In this case, he noted that four members of the FED's seven-member board would have been appointed by Trump. Zervos argued that this majority is likely to support a more “pro-growth” economic agenda. Related News: Whales Are Active Today: They Made Massive Bitcoin and Altcoin Transactions Zervos, who said the new FED chairman could adopt lower interest rates, gave the example of Alan Greenspan's low interest rate policies in the 1990s. “The risks Greenspan took at that time were ultimately proven right. The new chairman may be inclined to take similar risks,” said Zervos, adding that this situation could support risky assets such as technology and growth stocks. The program also noted that markets’ interest in Jerome Powell’s rhetoric has begun to wane. Zervos said that the fact that markets have not shown a significant reaction despite Powell signaling an interest rate hike at his latest press conference is evidence of this. “Markets are now starting to focus on who the next president will be and what he will do,” he said. Zervos also noted Trump's strategy of neutralizing figures he didn't like during his time in office, suggesting that Powell was gradually being sidelined in this way. However, he noted that markets were not making any significant distinctions between the new presidential candidates at the moment, and that these names were only seen as potential for now. *This is not investment advice.

CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that Ripple is dropping its cross-appeal, with the SEC expected to do the same, effectively bringing the case to a close, he said in an X post on June 28. “Ripple is dropping our cross appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they’ve previously said. We’re closing this chapter once and for all, and focusing on what’s most important – building the Internet of Value. Lock in,” he said. This move comes just days after U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres rejected a joint motion from Ripple and the SEC that sought an indicative ruling to reduce a $125 million civil penalty. The motion also aimed to overturn a prior finding that Ripple’s institutional XRP sales constituted unregistered securities offerings. XRP non-security status unchanged Judge Torres issued a nuanced decision, partially granting the SEC’s request for an injunction and penalty while raising concerns about Ripple’s prior conduct regarding court-imposed limits. Despite the outcome, Ripple’s leadership maintains that the legal status of XRP remains unaffected by the latest ruling. With this, the ball is back in our court. The Court gave us two options: dismiss our appeal challenging the finding on historic institutional sales—or press forward with the appeal. Stay tuned. Either way, XRP’s legal status as not a security remains unchanged. In the meantime,… https://t.co/edHNbMzYbZ — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) June 26, 2025 The SEC originally sued Ripple in December 2020, alleging it raised $1.3 billion through unregistered XRP sales. Although Ripple was not fully exonerated, Garlinghouse previously described the $125 million penalty, imposed in August 2024, as a strategic win, significantly lower than the SEC’s initial demand of $2 billion. If the SEC proceeds with withdrawing its appeal, as expected, it will mark the end of one of the most significant regulatory enforcement cases in the history of the cryptocurrency industry.

Company profits and the stock price have been behaving that way. COIN started in 2012 as a bitcoin exchange and since then has added more coins to its trading repertoire and a lot more capabilities for its users. But the company has bigger visions. It says crypto is “eating financial services” and that it’s number one in crypto. That’s big talk, but the world seems to be evolving in COIN’s favor. Stablecoin, a crypto pegged to a non-crypto asset (usually the dollar) unites the blockchain with ordinary commerce. That paves the way for a big disintermediation wave (like others we’ve seen in the past) that bypasses costly, time-consuming middlemen. My “Buy” For COIN reflects this, not the next move in crypto prices. I’m undecided… Pastrami (piled high) with a bit of mustard, and grease moistening the bread. Or perhaps, a thick hot bagel with cream cheese and blueberry jelly. It’s a good thing I’m not running things at Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN) . Brian Armstrong has different and more decisive tastes. He’s the CEO and Co-Founder of COIN. He shared his food craving with analysts on the company’s 5/8/25 earnings call . He said: I think in 5 to 10 years, our goal is to be the number one financial services app in the world across those customer segments because we believe that crypto is eating financial services, and we are the number one crypto company …. (Emphasis added.) So, he didn’t directly say COIN is eating financial services. But he sure as heck implied it. The story is quite old. But his verbiage is new… and cool. I remember such behavior described using a much bigger word… disintermediation. It came of age… in 1966 when Regulation Q interest rate ceilings prevented banks and savings institutions from competing effectively with non-depository institutions, such as brokers, disrupting the banks' ability to lend. The double-digit inflation of the late 1970s… caused many consumers to put their liquid assets in short-term money funds…. Finally, in 1980, federal legislation unleashed deposit interest rates. That let banks credibly compete with interlopers who had been disintermediating them. This doesn’t only happen in finance. Consider how easy it was to shop for air travel bargains? Pre-internet, you’d have worked with your favorite travel agent. Do these even exist today? Even now, nearly 60 years after regulation Q, disintermediation, bypassing middlemen, is still a huge finance topic. It’s so huge, that the author of a 3/30/25 letter to the Financial Times may at some point wish the editors hadn’t published his missive : Crypto is no more an investment than investing in a horse race at the bookmakers. Call it what it is: speculation or gambling. COIN is playing a leading role in working to make sure that letter ages dismally. To be sure, I’m a recent convert. As recently as 5/9/25 , I’d been justifying Bitcoin as a digital collectible. I struggled to see it as commercially useful. Digging into COIN has been making me expand my thinking. The company’s business, already complicated, is getting more so. The numbers are volatile to the point of mocking forecasts. The stock’s valuation… I’ve seen worse, but this isn’t for Graham & Dodd or Warren Buffett disciples. But COIN is a change-the-word company. There can never be an assurance of success. But COIN is proceeding… let’s say racing ahead… sensibly. And having been in stock analysis since late 1979, I’ve often seen how these companies, despite scary numbers early on, can turn into wealth-creation machines for shareholders. The COIN Basics The firm launched in 2012. It was a platform through which people could buy and sell Bitcoin. Based on what we know of stockbrokers (old-time brick-and-mortar and now online), that sounds sparse. We’ve seen how stockbrokers added ancillary capabilities over time. They now trade many types of securities beyond stocks. They spread beyond the U.S. They perform bank-like functions. They offer advice. You know the drill. Responding to the needs of its growing user base, COIN pursued an analogous path. Over the years, COIN has added such things as: More kinds of crypto to the product it trades Different platforms for new or casual users versus advanced traders Custody services to hold its customers’ crypto Wallets for its customers Institutional services Crypto derivatives Capabilities beyond the U.S. A credit card that lets users buy things with their crypto Subscription services New offerings make it easier to attract more users. More customers give COIN the wherewithal to add more offerings. It looks like COIN is enjoying a virtuous cycle. How COIN ranks relative to rivals depends on what you count. According to a 5/7/25 source, COIN isn’t close to being the trading-volume top dog. Binance is tops with a 38.0% market share . COIN, with a 6.9% share, is sixth. For assets under management, a 2/8/25 source quotes COIN CEO Armstrong as follows: If you think of Coinbase as a bank, we now hold about $0.42T in assets for our customers, which would make us the 21st largest bank in the US by total assets, and growing. If you think of us more like a brokerage, we’d be the 8th largest brokerage today by AUM. Details aside, I think we can agree that COIN is big in terms of AUM. That’s especially so given how young COIN and the crypto industry are and despite COIN’s relatively high trading costs and fewer tradable crypto coin types. Generally, you can easily drive yourself crazy trying to specify more detailed item-for-item comparisons between COIN and rivals. (If you want to try with Binance, you can start here .) An investor looking for a sense of how COIN compares versus its many rivals (including Binance), would do well to simplify this: For cheapest pricing, maxing out on features, and something akin to wild-west type freedom, COIN would not be the platform of choice. For a more establishment-/compliance-friendly, easier-to-use platform, COIN is likely to have the most appeal. For as rapidly as COIN has been growing, it remains the conservative choice in the context of the crypto world. That doesn’t mean it's always smooth sailing. Growth Patterns For one thing, growth has been breathtakingly choppy. That shouldn’t surprise anyone, given how volatile crypto prices have been. This is still a very new asset class. And many still do not accept its legitimacy. (See, for example, the above-quoted letter to the ft.com editor. And for a chuckle, check the “ me know that's not real money ” bit I described on 5/9/25.) So, nothing in COIN’s data resembles the straight or even straight-ish growth patterns investors cherish. Here’s the historical information for COIN’s Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs). Analyst compilation based on data from company 10K documents Speaking like an equities technical analyst, I might say that after an initial surge, MTUs have corrected, found, and bounced off of a support level, and are now rallying towards the last peak. What’s next? Can MTUs break through the old high? Or will it run into “resistance?” I think it will break through. We know anecdotally that crypto acceptance is expanding. It’s even becoming a respectable treasury asset. Meanwhile, the public took note of our newly elected pro-crypto administration… On 11/24, COIN’s new customer additions jumped 704%. That receded to 476% in 12/24. We can’t yet know how many of these newbies will eventually become MTUs. Nor do we yet know how much longer COIN’s super-normal user growth will persist. But the ears-to-the-ground perception of evolving attitudes toward crypto augurs well for future growth. So, too, do new directions in which COIN has been pointing its business (see below). Toward a More Constructive Legal/Regulatory Framework The SEC recently tried to accuse COIN of trading in securities outside the agency’s standard framework. Securities? Is crypto that sort of asset? That posed intriguing questions for federal courts. Ultimately, though, in January 2025, with a new pro-crypto administration entering Washington, the SEC abandoned its efforts. (See generally, here .) That doesn’t mean regulators will turn blind eyes to crypto. Instead… It suggests that regulatory agencies are acknowledging the need for a more modern and tailored approach…. (amid the likelihood that) Congress must also step in and set a clear course for the cryptocurrency industry. Beyond the legislature, the SEC’s evolving stance may also encourage further collaboration between regulators and industry participants, paving the way for regulation that balances consumer protection with innovation. I expect COIN to be deeply involved in any such collaboration. That’s the sort of compliance-friendly culture through which COIN differentiates itself from rivals. Beyond the Basics Let’s consider here two crypto-centric aspects of COIN’s business. You won’t find these in traditional financial services. Staking Staking is a way COIN (and/or similar entities) and its users can make money by helping to manage the blockchain. The blockchain is “ the official Bitcoin public ledger .” You can imagine it being crypto’s answer to the Federal Reserve. Both are the bosses, the authorities that control things within their respective domains. The Fed rules conventional money (fiat currency). The blockchain rules cryptocurrency. (Each type of crypto has its own blockchain. Similarly, each fiat currency has its own Fed-like king.) So much for similarities. Now come the differences. The Fed is a centralized authority staffed by appointed humans. How do you get to be a Fed governor? You have to know and be liked by somebody, like a head of state. How do those folks decide what to do? Don’t we all wish we knew. If we did, we wouldn’t keep pouring gobs of cyber-ink into never-ending analyses and predictions. The blockchain is a centralized authority staffed-so to speak, by computer stuff (data, code). How does the computer stuff get into (hired by) the blockchain? It has to be logically legit. Put another way, it has to be validated. That’s done by validators . These entities… Verify transactions, propose new blocks, and participate in consensus mechanisms to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the blockchain…. (They) work by verifying transactions, securing the network against attacks, and making sure that only legitimate transactions are added to the blockchain ledger. Instead of relying on traditional mining methods, crypto validators put up a stake as collateral, which can be forfeited if they behave maliciously or fail to perform their duties properly . (Emphasis added.) You (the entity, like COIN) do this by computer. There’s no fiat here. You get to be a validator through a selection process. It gives heavy emphasis to how much skin you have in the game… in other words, how much crypto you post as collateral. COIN can post its own crypto as collateral. But its chances of being chosen rise if its users help by chipping in some or all of the crypto they hold at COIN. When users do that, we say they are staking their crypto. They never lose custody of their crypto. It all stays in their wallets. They do, however, give up the right to withdraw the crypto for as long as they leave it staked. Now here’s the good part… COIN and its users get paid for staking crypto and serving as validators . The network pays COIN by awarding it crypto coins. And COIN shares its reward with the users who staked (in proportion to how much each staked). Potential income to users is not trivial. As of this writing , COIN was suggesting they could earn up to a 14% APY. I call out staking here for two reasons. First, I want to demonstrate an interesting income source available to COIN and its users. Second, I want to expand on what I previously wrote about the important role of the blockchain. Note, in particular, how broadly decentralized it is… no fiat, no political appointees, no media pressure. This will help crypto eat financial services. Now, let’s look at another recipe item… Stablecoin So, what exactly determines prices for crypto coins? That’s easy… supply and demand. So, what determines supply and demand? How many hours, days, etc. do you have to consider all the opinions on these topics? That’s why crypto has been so darn volatile! So, what exactly determines the price for stablecoin? That’s easy… each is worth one dollar (or is priced in terms of another asset… though 99% are presently dollar-based). Huh? Does that mean supply and demand are in equilibrium when stablecoin trades for one dollar? No. Stablecoin is specifically and by definition pegged to the dollar, one-to-one. Then what’s the point? Why not just use dollars? Because stablecoin lives (is stored and exchanged) on the blockchain. If you want to join COIN in eating financial services, consider this your set of utensils. Stablecoins are primarily used for trading crypto assets, transacting in goods services, insulating against local currency instability, and sending payments across borders…. Investors increasingly use stablecoins rather than cash to buy into and out of crypto asset investment positions, since many exchanges make it quicker and easier to trade with crypto assets than with real-world assets. ( Source .) This is how we can join crypto with regular commerce. (The key isn’t in crypto fluctuations. It’s about the blockchain.) There’s also an interesting here-and-now-and-growing angle to this. COIN is like a stablecoin banker. It issues USDC, a type of stablecoin (together with 50-50 partner Circle Internet Group), and holds dollars in reserve. Dollar reserves equal the value of the stablecoins. (Regular banks hold much smaller percentages of asset value in reserve.) COIN and Circle earn interest (50-50) by investing the dollars in U.S. Treasury Bills or equivalent interest-earning assets. And COIN gets 100% of interest earned by investing reserves relating to stablecoins owned by users but held on COIN. That is turning into a nice and growing income stream for COIN. Salivating Over the Chez Financial Services Dinner Menu (a/k/a Progressing Toward Disintermediation) One reason why I discussed staking and stablecoin is, obviously, to explain the nice business opportunities COIN is enjoying today. But blockchain plus stablecoin equals one heck of a way to revolutionize commerce. (Hence the change-the-world investment case for COIN). Before going on, I should add one more point. Each crypto coin has its own blockchain. Each such chain has unique characteristics in how it works. Speed variations are important. And the Ethereum chain can record smart contract terms. These are self-executing… As soon as “A” is verified, then “B” automatically happens. Much of this would relate to verifications of ownership, rights, liabilities, etc. That sounds like a breathtakingly dull topic. It is. And as a result, it’s seldom discussed (aside from cybercrime and the angst that brings). But verification is CRITICAL. If you want a sense of how critical, check out The Mystery of Capital by Hernando de Soto. In sum, de Soto argued that developing countries haven’t been stunted by a lack of assets. Instead, he says, it’s been about property ownership being “secured informally, which prevents the use of property as collateral. The inability to convert assets into capital keeps the developing world from benefiting from capitalism.” I didn’t get a chance to look into whether the economies he discussed improved since the book’s 2000 publication . Either way, I found it eye-opening. I always understood authentication is important. But I never realized how important it is until I read de Soto’s work. The blockchain, as a penultimate super-verified set of records, opens up new possibilities. The idea is to eliminate intermediaries, cut costs, and boost speed, all with unprecedented reliability. We’re already starting to see early implementations. For example, BitPesa uses blockchain to facilitate cross-border payments in Africa. Traditional methods are slow and costly. BitPesa slashes transaction times and costs. Companies like AXA have implemented smart contracts for ﬂight delay insurance. They automate claim processing, ensuring quick payouts. Walmart uses blockchain to track food products. Working with IBM, it set up a decentralized real-time database of product origins. That helps with traceability and assuring safety. Pharmaceutical companies like Pﬁzer use blockchain to track the entire supply chain. That lets it verify medication authenticity and ward off counterfeiting. Ubitquity provides title management solutions using blockchain. That makes property transfers more efficient and secure. Energy companies like LO3 Energy use it for peer-to-peer energy trading. Consumers can directly buy and sell excess energy through a secure network. MovieCoin uses cryptocurrencies to finance and distribute ﬁlms. That benefits both investors and producers. Today, such things seem minor. Might any of them amount to a portion of the EPS of any company that, expressed as two decimal places, would round to more than $0.00? I doubt it. But imagine ahead. Old-timers like me might have an edge here. We’ve seen much in terms of how extensively, boldly, and rapidly tech can evolve. (Many believe teens and 20-somethings can better use new tech. I think that’s an open question. But we 60 and 70 or more somethings have seen and experienced a lot. Don’t underestimate our ability to visualize future potential! Perhaps that’s why, as I aged, I became more of a growth investor.) In sum, I believe crypto and COIN really will wind up eating financial services. The Numbers Warning… You’re going to see a lot of volatility here. So far, it’s been… as goes crypto prices, so goes COIN (the company and its stock). That will account good and bad things you’ll see. The investment case here can be about crypto’s next big move… if you are trading-oriented and want to approach it this way. I’m not. My case for COIN is based on my belief it’ll progress beyond all these numbers as it swallows and digests financial services. So now, let’s start with the quarterly revenue and EPS trends. Analyst Compilation based on Data from Seeking Alpha Earnings and Financials Presentations Analyst Compilation based on Data from Seeking Alpha Earnings and Financials Presentations How ‘bout those roller coaster EPS comparisons! Try summing the quarters and comparing your answers to the annual figures. These are completely independent data items computed by Seeking Alpha’s data provider. They don’t depend on one another. When the annuals are so far off from the sums of the quarterlies, that, to me, indicates that analysts collectively do not have a handle on their numbers. I’ve done time in the analysts’ places. So I understand. There’s often much less science and a lot more guessing than many realize. For COIN, I expect it's mainly the latter. Now, take a look at the historic and expected forward growth rates. (I compare COIN to medians among companies in the Financial Exchanges and Data industry and in the portfolio of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ). I use medians since these aren’t impacted by wild distortions often caused by unusual data items.) Analyst's computations and summary from data displayed in Seeking Alpha Portfolios Analyst's computations and summary from data displayed in Seeking Alpha Portfolios Here are the financial statement highlights. Be sure to check the footnote explaining how I tried to make sense of the operating margin! Analyst Compilation based on Data from Seeking Alpha Financial Presentations Here’s a breakdown of COIN’s revenue sources. Analyst Compilation based on Data from Company 10K and 10Q documents This next table, core fundamentals, is interesting. Analyst's computations and summary from data displayed in Seeking Alpha Portfolios These numbers tend to not vary wildly based on short-term fluctuations. That’s why I like these data points so much. They tell a bigger-picture story. For COIN, considering how volatile things can get in the short term, I’m very pleased to see these numbers. They tell me that for all the near-term uncertainties, management has a good firm grip on the corporate reigns. Risk To get detailed here, I’d have to present the sort of verbal monstrosities attorneys force companies to stuff into their SEC documents. Do you really want that? If so, you can download the latest 10K and have at it… and hope somebody wakes you up in time to do what you have to do tomorrow. I prefer to keep it simple. The risk here is that crypto, the blockchain, and COIN’s vision will flop badly. That’s how change-the-world investing is. If the world decides it doesn’t want to change, all who back change will wind up with eggs on their faces and losses in their portfolios. What to do About COIN Stock Here’s my usual valuation table. Analyst's computations and summary from data displayed in Seeking Alpha Portfolios Make sure you read the bigger-than-usual footnote. Clearly, there’s little use for these numbers. Let me put it this way… if the world changes as COIN (and I) expect, the company will likely blow past everybody’s forecasts and the stock will, in retrospect, look to have been bargain-priced. If not, it’ll be tears all around. Here are the price charts for COIN and bitcoin (as a proxy for crypto in general) respectively. StockCharts.com StockCharts.com The messages are clear. Sentiment around crypto, and COIN, has been bad at times in the past year (more so for crypto). But things look pretty good now for both. If you understand market timing and think both are due for correction, act on your views. Give COIN a chance to settle down. But that sort of thing is outside my skill set and inconsistent with my approach. If I see a stock riding what strikes me as a megatrend, I turn bullish. Strictly speaking… When it comes to rating stocks, I think in terms of probable future stock performance relative to the market, rather than literally buying, holding, or selling. And since I’m not rating based on a quant model, I’ll eschew “Strong …” extremes. Absent an exceptional degree of conviction, I think “Buy,” Hold”, or “Sell” are enough. For the reasons discussed above, I see COIN as likely outperforming the broader 3- to 5-year (and then some) market. I translate that to the Seeking Alpha rating taxonomy by rating COIN as a “Buy.”",COIN,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-28 09:07:50

For customers in the European Union, the door has just opened to a new form of investment: tokenized stocks. This groundbreaking development, announced by Gemini on X, commenced with tokenized shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), a company famously known as one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders. This isn’t just about offering another trading option; it’s a pivotal moment that could redefine how investors interact with both traditional and digital assets across the continent. Gemini EU: A New Era for European Investors? Gemini’s expansion into tokenized stock trading in the European Union marks a strategic step in bridging the gap between conventional finance and the burgeoning digital asset economy. By starting with MSTR, Gemini is not only offering access to a well-known company but also subtly nodding to the crypto community, given MicroStrategy’s significant Bitcoin (BTC) reserves. This initial offering is just the beginning, with Gemini promising to roll out additional tokenized stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the coming days. For European investors, this means a potential broadening of investment horizons, offering new avenues for portfolio diversification and accessibility to global markets through a regulated crypto platform. What Are Tokenized Stocks and Why Do They Matter? Tokenized stocks are digital representations of traditional shares that are issued and managed on a blockchain. Think of them as a blockchain-powered certificate of ownership for a fraction or whole of a traditional stock. This innovative approach brings several compelling advantages: Fractional Ownership: Investors can buy a small fraction of a high-priced stock, making investing more accessible to those with smaller capital. 24/7 Trading: Unlike traditional markets with fixed trading hours, tokenized stocks can potentially be traded around the clock, reflecting the always-on nature of cryptocurrency markets. Increased Liquidity: By opening up trading to a global, always-on market, tokenized assets can potentially benefit from enhanced liquidity. Transparency: Blockchain technology offers a transparent and immutable record of transactions, which can foster greater trust and reduce fraud. Reduced Costs: The streamlined nature of blockchain transactions may lead to lower fees compared to traditional brokerage services. For the average investor, tokenized stocks offer a novel way to gain exposure to traditional equities without navigating complex international brokerage accounts, all within the familiar environment of a crypto exchange. MSTR Trading: The Strategic Debut The choice of MSTR for the debut of tokenized stock trading is highly strategic. MicroStrategy, under the leadership of Michael Saylor, has become synonymous with corporate Bitcoin adoption, holding over 200,000 BTC. This makes MSTR’s stock performance often closely tied to the movements of Bitcoin itself. By offering MSTR tokenized shares, Gemini provides European investors with an indirect, yet significant, exposure to Bitcoin’s price action through a regulated stock. This allows even traditional investors who might be hesitant to directly buy BTC to participate in the broader digital asset ecosystem. The availability of MSTR trading on a platform like Gemini could also attract existing Bitcoin holders looking for alternative ways to manage their exposure or diversify within the digital asset space. The Role of a Crypto Exchange in Bridging Traditional Finance Gemini’s foray into tokenized stocks underscores a growing trend where crypto exchange platforms are evolving beyond mere cryptocurrency trading venues. They are becoming crucial bridges connecting the established world of traditional finance with the innovative realm of digital assets. This move by Gemini is not just about expanding its product offering; it’s about pioneering a new model for global investment. By integrating regulated securities onto a blockchain, Gemini is demonstrating the practical applications of distributed ledger technology (DLT) beyond just cryptocurrencies. This integration promises a more efficient, accessible, and potentially more inclusive financial system, benefiting both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. Implications for Bitcoin Holders and the Digital Asset Landscape For existing Bitcoin holders, Gemini’s tokenized MSTR offering presents an interesting dynamic. While it doesn’t replace direct BTC ownership, it offers another layer of financial product that reflects Bitcoin’s influence. It could also lead to increased institutional interest in the broader digital asset space as traditional assets become more intertwined with blockchain technology. This development validates the long-held vision of a tokenized economy where virtually any asset, from real estate to art, can be represented and traded on a blockchain. Challenges remain, including regulatory clarity across different EU member states and ensuring robust liquidity for these new instruments. However, Gemini’s initiative signals a strong belief in the future of integrated financial markets, where digital assets play a central role. A Glimpse into the Future of Investment Gemini’s launch of tokenized stock trading in the EU, starting with MSTR, is more than just a new product offering; it’s a testament to the ongoing evolution of global finance. It represents a bold step towards a future where traditional and digital assets coexist seamlessly, offering unprecedented access and flexibility to investors. As more tokenized assets are introduced, the lines between traditional stock exchanges and crypto platforms will continue to blur, creating a more interconnected and potentially more efficient investment landscape for everyone. This move by Gemini is a powerful indicator of the transformative potential of blockchain technology in reshaping how we perceive, own, and trade assets.

The candidate representing the Democratic Party, Zohran Mamdani, will be facing a field of candidates in November, including those who have taken a firm stance on crypto and blockchain in the past. Mamdani defeated former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday, with 43.5% of the vote in New York City’s Democratic primary, snatching the flag to represent the party. The victory put the former New York State Assembly member in competition with Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, current NYC Mayor Eric Adams, and Cuomo, who is expected to run as an independent candidate following his loss in the primary. Aside from Mamdani, all the major candidates have previously taken a favorable stance on the crypto industry. Crypto voters could decide New York mayoral election Current New York City Mayor Eric Adams first ran for mayor as a Democrat in 2021. During his campaign, he said he would accept his first three paychecks in Bitcoin . He has gone on to speak at crypto conferences, propose Bitcoin-backed municipal bonds, and hold a digital asset summit at the mayoral residence. Sliwa is expected to fall behind Mamdani in the pecking order, according to polls also ran against Adams in 2021. During his campaign, Sliwa also made many pro-crypto promises, appealing to the crypto population that was just opening up in the country. He promised to open more crypto ATMs in New York City and create a reward-based program for local businesses to accept digital assets. Cuomo, on the other hand, worked as an adviser for crypto exchange OKX in 2021 as United States authorities were investigating the company for operating a licensed money-transmitting business. According to a Bloomberg report at the time, the former New York City governor took up the job in August 2021 when he resigned as New York governor. “He spoke with company executives regularly and counseled them on how to respond to the criminal investigation,” the Bloomberg report said. Mamdani has also criticized Cuomo’s involvement with the exchange. “Andrew Cuomo could’ve spent the years since his resignation making amends and helping New Yorkers,” his April 2 post on X said. “Instead he hounded the women who spoke out about his serial harassment, fought to keep his book deal millions … and advised a foreign exchange that broke US law.” Popular crypto figures oppose Mamdani Since his win at the primaries, Mamdani has faced opposition from prominent figures in the industry, including Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss. Tyler Winklevoss also hinted at “get[ting] involved in the NYC mayor race,” suggesting the financial backing of a candidate that could defeat Mamdani. The Winklevoss brothers were also involved in the United States presidential election in 2024, pledging millions of dollars to eventual winner Donald Trump’s campaign. Aside from those two, Bitcoin proponent and CEO of Professional Capital Management, Anthony Pompliano has also called on New Yorkers to oppose Mamdani. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman also suggested that he was interested in backing any candidate with a chance of defeating Mamdani. “There are hundreds of millions of dollars of capital available to back a competitor to Mamdani that can be put together overnight … so that a great alternative candidate won’t spend any time raising funds. So, if the right candidate would raise his or her hand tomorrow, the funds will pour in,” he said. Whoever emerges as the winner in the mayoral election could have a significant impact on New York City’s crypto policies. New York City is one of the biggest business centers in the United States . It houses several crypto firms, including Gemini crypto exchange, payments company Moonpay, and stablecoin issuers Paxos and Circle. “If you’re in the crypto, blockchain, Web3, or the fintech space, New York City is open for business,” said Mayor Adams on May 12.

The analyst and trader pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 108,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is in a “transitional period” that could result in a price correction preceding a rally. According to the pseudonymous analyst, Bitcoin could first reclaim a major support level before an uptrend ensues. “So in the short term, maybe we could still see a bit of that downside deviation. But right now, the key level to reclaim is at least $104,400. That’s the level to reclaim as a support. We held this level for six, really, almost seven full weeks in total.” Rekt Capital says that if the $104,400 support level holds, Bitcoin could then attempt to flip the current range high and resistance level of around $109,000 into a support zone. According to the pseudonymous analyst, the new support zone, if confirmed, could act as a springboard for another leg up. “[Reclaiming] this level [around $109,000] as a support and doing that successfully would see it actually transition into that next uptrend…. If we do break out here, and once we’ve confirmed that breakout, then multiple weeks of upside should emerge from that… So it’s going to be really important for price to finally confirm its breakout. And once it’s done that, we’re going to have a bit of time to enjoy that upside into new all-time highs.” Bitcoin is trading at $106,710 at time of writing.

For anyone deeply involved in the cryptocurrency space, whether as a trader, investor, or simply an observer, news of significant regulatory milestones is always met with keen interest. Today, we delve into one such pivotal development that is set to reshape the landscape of digital asset trading across an entire continent: the recent acquisition of a MiCA license by the Amsterdam-based crypto exchange, Bitvavo . Bitvavo’s Pivotal MiCA License: A Game Changer for European Crypto In a move that marks a significant leap forward for the regulated crypto industry, Bitvavo has been officially granted a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). This isn’t just another regulatory approval; it’s a landmark achievement that underscores a growing maturity within the digital asset sector. The MiCA framework, set to be fully implemented across the European Union by the end of 2024, is the first comprehensive regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies globally. Its aim is to provide legal certainty, foster innovation, and protect consumers within the volatile crypto market. So, what exactly does this MiCA license signify? Essentially, it means that Bitvavo has met the stringent requirements set forth by European regulators concerning operational integrity, consumer protection, financial stability, and anti-money laundering (AML) protocols. For users, this translates into a much higher degree of confidence and security when engaging with the platform. It signals that Bitvavo operates under a harmonized set of rules designed to prevent market abuse and ensure fair trading practices. Unlocking the European Economic Area: Bitvavo’s Expansive Reach The most immediate and impactful benefit of this MiCA license for Bitvavo is its newfound ability to offer services across all 30 countries within the European Economic Area (EEA) . This includes the 27 European Union member states, alongside Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. Previously, crypto exchanges often had to navigate a patchwork of national regulations, obtaining separate licenses or registrations in each country they wished to operate in. This fragmented approach created significant hurdles for expansion and often led to inconsistencies in consumer protection. With the MiCA license, Bitvavo gains a ‘passporting’ right, allowing it to seamlessly extend its operations and services across this vast economic bloc. This expansion is not merely about geographical reach; it’s about providing millions of potential users with access to a regulated, trustworthy platform for their crypto needs. Imagine the ease for users moving between EEA countries, knowing their preferred crypto exchange remains compliant and accessible. This unified approach is poised to accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrencies among both retail and institutional investors who have, until now, been hesitant due to regulatory uncertainties. Elevating Standards: Bitvavo as a Regulated Crypto Exchange The transition to operating as a fully regulated crypto exchange under MiCA is a testament to Bitvavo’s commitment to compliance and user trust. For a platform like Bitvavo, this means adhering to a new set of rigorous operational standards. These include: Enhanced Consumer Protection: MiCA mandates strict rules around disclosure, marketing, and the handling of client funds, ensuring greater transparency and safeguarding user assets. Operational Resilience: Exchanges must demonstrate robust IT systems, security measures, and contingency plans to prevent outages and cyberattacks. Market Integrity: Rules are in place to prevent market manipulation, insider trading, and other illicit activities, fostering a fairer trading environment. Capital Requirements: Exchanges are required to hold sufficient capital to cover potential operational risks, adding a layer of financial stability. For users, choosing a regulated crypto exchange like Bitvavo offers significant advantages. It provides peace of mind, knowing that the platform is subject to ongoing oversight by a reputable financial authority like the Dutch AFM. This regulatory stamp of approval can be a critical factor for individuals and institutions looking to enter the crypto market responsibly. The Road to Regulatory Compliance: Lessons from Bitvavo’s Journey Achieving this significant milestone wasn’t an overnight process. Navigating regulatory compliance in the nascent crypto industry is a complex and often challenging endeavor. Bitvavo’s journey involved extensive collaboration with the Dutch AFM , demonstrating a deep understanding of the evolving regulatory landscape and a willingness to adapt its operations to meet stringent requirements. This process typically involves: Comprehensive Application: Submitting detailed documentation outlining business models, security protocols, governance structures, and financial health. Operational Overhaul: Implementing new systems and processes to comply with AML, KYC (Know Your Customer), and consumer protection mandates. Ongoing Dialogue: Maintaining continuous communication with regulators, providing updates, and addressing any concerns. Bitvavo’s success story serves as a blueprint for other crypto entities seeking to legitimize their operations within Europe. It highlights the importance of proactive engagement with regulatory bodies and a long-term vision for operating within a structured legal framework. As the industry matures, such rigorous adherence to regulatory compliance will become a non-negotiable standard for credible players. Shaping the Future: MiCA’s Impact on the European Crypto Landscape Bitvavo’s MiCA license is more than just a win for one company; it’s a significant step forward for the entire European Economic Area crypto ecosystem. The full implementation of MiCA is expected to bring unprecedented clarity and stability to the market, attracting new capital and fostering innovation within a secure environment. We can anticipate: Increased Institutional Adoption: Banks, asset managers, and other traditional financial institutions will likely feel more comfortable engaging with regulated crypto service providers. Enhanced Consumer Trust: A unified regulatory framework builds confidence among retail investors, potentially leading to broader participation. Fairer Competition: By leveling the playing field for regulated entities, MiCA will push out non-compliant actors, improving the overall quality of services. Innovation with Guardrails: While regulating, MiCA also aims to allow for innovation, ensuring that new technologies can flourish within defined boundaries. The success of MiCA in Europe could also serve as a model for other jurisdictions globally, potentially inspiring similar comprehensive frameworks and fostering greater international cooperation in crypto regulation. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitvavo and European Crypto The granting of a MiCA license to Bitvavo by the Dutch AFM represents a monumental achievement, not just for the exchange itself, but for the broader European crypto industry. It signifies a pivotal shift towards a more mature, regulated, and secure digital asset landscape. As Bitvavo expands its services across the European Economic Area crypto market, it sets a new standard for operational excellence and consumer trust within the realm of crypto exchange regulation . This development promises to unlock new opportunities for growth, innovation, and widespread adoption, paving the way for a more confident and accessible future for digital assets.

From courtroom setbacks to bold state-level Bitcoin bets, the past few days saw a mix of strong signals and deeper tensions. Big names like Coinbase, Tether, Mastercard, and Trump Media all made headlines – for very different reasons. While regulators in the U.S. debate the future of crypto laws, state governments are moving faster. And behind the scenes, institutions are starting to quietly step in. If you’ve struggled to keep track, I’ve got you. Here’s everything that mattered this week. Dive in. #1 Coinbase helps recover $225M in crypto fraud case One of the biggest crypto fraud recoveries ever happened! The U.S. Secret Service seized $225 million in USDT tied to pig butchering scams, with Coinbase helping trace funds and identify over 130 victims. The operation uncovered a global web of fake investment platforms and romance scams, many linked to trafficked individuals. Tether froze the assets, later burning and reissuing them to a wallet under government control. Coinbase’s blockchain analysis and subpoenas played a key role and now, it’s urging affected users to file claims. #2 Trump Media Moves to Buy Back $400M in Shares Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the parent of Truth Social and Truth+ announced a $400 million stock repurchase plan. The board’s approval signals strong confidence, with CEO Devin Nunes saying the company now has “flexibility to take bold steps to create shareholder value.” The buyback will include both shares and warrants, and all repurchased securities will be retired. But the real gem? This won’t change the company’s $2.3 billion commitment to Bitcoin. With $3 billion in reserves, TMTG seems ready to play big on Wall Street and on-chain. #3 Texas Becomes 3rd U.S. State to Back Bitcoin with Reserve Law Texas has signed off on a bold new law: a Bitcoin reserve for the state’s finances. Governor Abbott just approved SB 21 – the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act – which lets the state hold Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and market volatility. Only assets with a $500B market cap qualify, and right now, that means just one player: Bitcoin. A five-member advisory panel will oversee it, and a companion bill ensures legal safeguards are already in place. The law kicks in September 1, 2025. #4 Chainlink Powers Fiat-to-Crypto with Mastercard This could change crypto onboarding for good! Mastercard and Chainlink are teaming up to let 3.5 billion cardholders buy crypto directly on-chain. Powered by Swapper Finance and ZeroHash, the integration enables instant fiat-to-crypto conversions on Uniswap, backed by Mastercard’s global rails and fraud protection. BUT fees still bite. And oddly, USDC isn’t supported (yet), while USDT, PYUSD, and USDe make the list. #5 SEC and Ripple Tried to Settle – But the Court Said No A federal judge has thrown out a joint attempt by the SEC and Ripple to settle their long-running XRP lawsuit. The deal would’ve reduced Ripple’s penalty from $125M to $50M and scrapped a permanent injunction but Judge Analisa Torres wasn’t having it. “The parties do not have the authority to agree not to be bound by a court’s final judgment,” she wrote. Her ruling leaves Ripple’s legal future hanging, with no confirmed next steps from the company or the SEC. #6 Banks Free to Serve Crypto Clients, Says Jerome Powell In a rare moment of clarity, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell confirmed that banks are free to provide banking services to the crypto industry as long as they manage risk properly. Speaking on June 24, Powell made it clear: “Banks get to decide who their customers are.” The statement offers long-awaited reassurance to traditional institutions that have tiptoed around digital assets for years. Crypto services like custody and trading may now expand, but capital, liquidity, and compliance rules aren’t going anywhere. #7 Tether Aims to Dominate Bitcoin Mining by End of 2025 Tether isn’t mining Bitcoin for profit – it’s doing it to protect what it already owns. CEO Paolo Ardoino revealed that with over 100,000 BTC on its books, valued at $10 billion+, the stablecoin giant is now building mining infrastructure as a form of strategic defense. He explained that anyone chasing pure profits would be better off simply buying Bitcoin, not investing in infrastructure. Tether has already invested $2M+ across energy and mining projects, backing renewable power sources and local mining sites in a push to become the largest miner by 2025. #8 Schiff Targets Trump’s Crypto Profits with COIN Act U.S. Senator Adam Schiff has introduced the COIN Act – a bold bill designed to block top government officials from cashing in on crypto while in office. The move comes just as Donald Trump’s digital asset ventures hit headlines, with over $57 million reportedly earned from token sales alone. If passed, the bill would ban presidents, vice presidents, and senior officials from creating or promoting coins, NFTs, or stablecoins with penalties including forfeited profits and jail time. Schiff calls it a necessary guardrail against blurred ethical lines. Hard to argue with the logic. #9 Solana, XRP, DOGE ETFs? Analysts Say It’s Likely Bloomberg’s James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas are putting the odds at “90% or greater” for the approval of major crypto ETFs. Their updated forecast points to Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, and Litecoin getting ETF treatment, backed by what they call “constructive conversations” with the SEC. This shift could mean altcoins are now being viewed as commodities, placing them outside the SEC’s toughest grip. But don’t expect instant action – Seyffart notes final approvals could still be months away, possibly beyond October. #10 Two Crypto Bills Must Pass in 2025, Says Senator Lummis Senator Cynthia Lummis is done waiting. In a firm message on CNBC this week, the Wyoming lawmaker urged Congress to pass two major crypto bills in 2025: the GENIUS Act and the long-awaited market structure bill. “I’m not saying combine them, but they both need to pass this year,” she told Squawk Box’s Joe Kernen. Her comments come as lawmakers try to merge House and Senate proposals into a unified crypto framework with stablecoin clarity now a critical piece of the puzzle. In the Spotlight Here’s a few quick hits you shouldn’t miss! WazirX Avoids Liquidation After $234M Hack: Singapore’s High Court granted WazirX more time to revise its recovery plan after last year’s hack. The exchange is betting on tokenized repayments, but user trust and court approval remain shaky. Kraken Drops ‘Krak’ to Take On Global Payments: This is a cross-border payments app enabling instant international transfers across 300+ assets in 110 countries. The app also offers up to 10% yields on select digital holdings and rewards on USDG balances. Coinme Fined $300K in California’s First Crypto ATM Crackdown: Regulators say Coinme broke state rules by exceeding daily transaction limits and omitting key disclosures at its kiosks. The company will pay $300K in penalties, including restitution to a scam victim. Arizona Advances Bitcoin Reserve Bill: Arizona’s assembly has passed HB2324, a bill to create a Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund using seized crypto assets. If signed, it would mark the state’s second crypto reserve law and signal growing momentum after Texas. CZ Flags Phishing Attacks: Hackers breached CoinMarketCap and Cointelegraph websites with fake wallet pop-ups, tricking users into exposing private data. CZ warned users to avoid wallet connections, as nearly $18,600 was stolen from 39 victims. What’s Next for Crypto? Major shifts to expect ahead The U.S. could finally clear the air. With Senator Lummis doubling down on the need to pass both the GENIUS Act and a market structure bill, 2025 may be the year the U.S. defines its crypto rulebook. But there’s a narrow window and plenty of political friction ahead. The altcoin ETF wave is gathering speed but timing is still unclear. The SEC’s softer stance signals progress, but a formal green light likely won’t come before October. Bitcoin reserves are no longer just a talking point. Texas is in. Arizona is close. Expect more governments and corporates to follow suit. Hacks and scams continue: user confidence is still fragile. Jerome Powell’s green light for banks to engage with crypto was big, but rate decisions still loom large. With inflation softening and rate cuts on the table, risk appetite could return fast Big shifts are happening in crypto. We’ll be here every week to break them down.

Bitcoin Consolidates Around $107,000: Weekend Watch",https://cryptopotato.com/calm-before-the-storm-bitcoin-consolidates-around-107000-weekend-watch/,"The broader cryptocurrency market remains relatively calm and for the past 24 hours there haven’t been any major movements. Bitcoin continues trading in a more or less narrow range between $106,000 and $108,000, begging the question if this is the calm before the storm and if a major move is just around the corner. Bitcoin Price Consolidates at $107K Bitcoin’s price didn’t go through any major moves during the past day and continues consolidating at around $107,000. The absence of volatility is also seen in the level of liquidations, which has declined by 4% on the daily, currently standing at around $200 million, according to Coinglass. The majority of them are short positions, meaning that the bulls are defending this area successfully, at least so far. As seen in the chart below, the price has managed to recover from the losses endured last weekend following the US strike of strategic Iranian nuclear bases. That said, as CryptoPotato reported, the number of larger wallets, holding 10 BTC or more, hit 152,280, which is the highest since March. This signals that deep-pocketed investors show a lot of confidence and might be positioning themselves for an incoming rally. Source: TradingView Altcoins Trend Flat but Leaning Bullish The majority of large-cap altcoins are trading in the green. They are not charting any significant gains, but the heatmap is obviously leaning bullish. Notably, Ripple’s XRP is charting gains of more than 4% on the day, being the best-performing altcoin from the top 10 by means of total market capitalization. Bitcoin’s market dominance is down by around 0.5% in the past 24 hours, which shows that the altcoins are attempting to capitalize on its flat trend. It’s interesting to see if this will continue. The best performer today is Quant (QNT), which is up 6.5%, followed by SPX6900 and Jupiter (JUP), both of which are up by 5.3% and 4.8%, respectively. On the other hand, Aptos, Pi Network, and SEI are today’s worst performers, down by 7.7%, 3.8%, and 3.6%. Source: Quantify Crypto The post Calm Before the Storm?

For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token.

However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on JTO news SOL Strategies has announced the launch of a new initiative to support critical infrastructure within the Solana ecosystem. The Canada-based public company revealed on June 26 that it has established a Strategic Ecosystem Reserve (SER), starting with a purchase of over 52,000 Jito (JTO) tokens, valued at more than $100,000. Jito price prediction June 2025 Over the last few days, JTO coin prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a hold above $110K this month, we might see a solid surge in the JTO price. According to technical analysis, the JTO price might record a maximum level of $2.9 and a minimum of $1.3, with an average value of $2.1 throughout June. Jito price prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high Jito Price Prediction June 2025 $1.3 $2.1 $2.9 Jito price prediction 2025 According to JTO tokenomics, additional Jito tokens will be released at the start of 2025 and will continue throughout the year.

Meanwhile, a rising altcoin is quickly taking center stage. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making headlines as it surges through its presale phase, drawing attention with a utility-focused DeFi model. The project is priced at $0.03 today in phase 5 of its presale that has sold out over 45%. MUTM has raised over $11.2 million and brought on board over 12,500 investors in its ongoing presale. Buzz around MUTM is intensifying across social channels and trackers, as buyers searching what crypto to invest in now shift toward smaller-cap tokens showing early momentum. Cardano in Consolidation Mode Around $0.59 as RSI Stabilizes Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at about $0.59, marking a roughly 8% gain over the past 24 hours after bouncing off its recent dip from the mid-$0.60s. On-chain data and volume trends suggest a stabilizing technical setup, as the network digests developments like the upcoming Leios upgrade and the recent surge in staking participation. While ADA remains range-bound between near-term resistance in the $0.60–$0.62 band and support around $0.56, traders are watching for a decisive break to define its next directional move. Meanwhile, attention is also turning to up-and-coming altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Stage 5 Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up some serious traction as it reaches Stage 5 of its presale. With more than 12,500 early adopters and more than $11.2 million raised, it’s clear to see this isn’t a flash in the pan wave of sentiment, Mutuum Finance is taking big steps as a key player in the DeFi. Whereas tokens are founded on ephemeral mania for the most part, Mutuum is founded on usability and sustained scalability with sound fundamentals backing it. Phase 5 investors will be rewarded with up to 2x ROI, when the token launch price of $0.06 is hit. Stable, Audited, and Future-Proof: A USD-Pegged Token on Ethereum In its strategic efforts to deepen its DeFi platform, Mutuum Finance is launching a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Unlike highly volatile algorithmic stablecoins, this token is crafted to hold its value even in extreme market fluctuations, earning it a solid store of value and medium of exchange. Security and integrity are central to the project. The Mutuum Finance platform was audited completely by CertiK, one of the most established blockchain security firms. This audit again testifies to the platform’s commitment to transparency, reliability, and long-term sustainability. Early Investors Reward as Community Grows To celebrate the presale action and express gratitude to early adopters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a $100,000 giveaway . Ten of these winners will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens for being one of the early backers of the project. While the community expands rapidly, the early supporters are being rewarded, not only with the possibility of future upside, but with concrete, real-time rewards. Cardano’s recent rally lost steam at key resistance, leaving ADA range-bound as investors reassess opportunities in the Layer 1. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to dominate headlines, surging through Phase 5 of its presale with over $11.2 million raised and a growing base of 12,500+ investors. Priced at $0.03, MUTM offers early buyers the potential for 2x ROI before launch and long-term upside driven by its audited platform, real utility, and a soon-to-launch USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum. The momentum is real, and so is the opportunity. Join the presale today and become part of one of 2025’s most promising DeFi projects.

If so, you’re likely familiar with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This fascinating tool offers a snapshot of the collective emotional state of crypto investors, providing valuable insights into potential market movements. As of June 28, the index remains unchanged at 65, firmly entrenched in the ‘Greed’ zone. But what does this persistent ‘Greed’ signal truly mean for your crypto strategy, and how can you leverage this information to make more informed decisions? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Core Metric for Market Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , developed by Alternative.me, is more than just a number; it’s a sophisticated barometer designed to gauge the prevailing emotions driving the cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 represents ‘Extreme Greed,’ this index helps investors understand if the market is overly optimistic or excessively pessimistic. Historically, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ often present buying opportunities, while ‘Extreme Greed’ can signal an impending correction, as investors might be getting ahead of themselves. But how does this index arrive at its daily reading? It’s not a simple guess. The index meticulously compiles data from six different key factors, each weighted to reflect its impact on overall crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): This factor measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often indicates a fearful market, while stable, upward movement can suggest growing confidence. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component assesses the current volume and market momentum. High buying volumes in an upward trending market contribute to a ‘Greed’ reading, indicating strong buying pressure and investor enthusiasm. Social Media (15%): The index analyzes various social media platforms for crypto-related hashtags and keywords. It counts posts and checks for the speed and quantity of interactions. A surge in positive sentiment and discussions about specific coins can push the index towards ‘Greed.’ Surveys (15%): While less frequent, surveys allow direct polling of investors. These polls can offer a snapshot of individual investor sentiment, contributing to the overall score. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin dominance measures Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to the entire cryptocurrency market. A rising Bitcoin dominance often indicates a shift from altcoins back to Bitcoin, which can be a sign of fear (as investors flock to the perceived safer asset) or, conversely, a sign of confidence in Bitcoin leading the market. Google Trends (10%): This factor analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Google Trends. For instance, a surge in searches for ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ might indicate fear, while ‘buy Bitcoin’ could suggest greed. Why the ‘Greed Zone’ Matters for Crypto Market Sentiment The current reading of 65 places the market squarely in the ‘Greed’ zone. While it hasn’t tipped into ‘Extreme Greed’ (above 75), a sustained period in this range suggests that investors are feeling confident, perhaps even overly optimistic. This collective confidence can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it reflects a healthy, growing market with positive momentum. On the other, prolonged periods of high ‘Greed’ can lead to irrational exuberance, where prices become detached from fundamental value due to FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and speculative buying. Historically, significant market corrections often follow extended periods of ‘Extreme Greed.’ When everyone is optimistic, and prices are soaring, many investors tend to throw caution to the wind, leading to overleveraged positions and unsustainable rallies. This is where understanding the Greed zone becomes crucial. It’s a signal to exercise caution, rather than a green light for reckless investment. Think of it this way: when the index is high, it means many people are already ‘in’ the market and feeling good about it. This leaves fewer new buyers to push prices higher, making the market more susceptible to profit-taking or negative news events. Conversely, when the index is low (in the ‘Fear’ zone), it suggests many potential buyers are on the sidelines, waiting for a clearer signal, which can fuel a rally once confidence returns. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Trends and Bitcoin Dominance The index’s reliance on factors like Bitcoin dominance and broader Market trends offers a holistic view of the crypto ecosystem. When Bitcoin dominance is high, it often indicates that capital is flowing into Bitcoin, sometimes at the expense of altcoins. This can happen during times of uncertainty (investors seeking the ‘safest’ crypto) or during strong bull runs where Bitcoin leads the charge. In a ‘Greed’ environment, Bitcoin’s performance often sets the tone for the rest of the market. If Bitcoin is performing strongly, it instills confidence across the board, pulling altcoins up with it. However, if Bitcoin starts to show signs of weakness while the index is in ‘Greed,’ it could be an early warning sign that the overall market sentiment is becoming fragile. The current stability of the index at 65 suggests that while optimism is high, it hasn’t yet reached a frenzied, unsustainable level, indicating a somewhat mature bullish trend. Beyond the index, broader market trends are also influenced by macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and institutional adoption. For instance, increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs or positive regulatory clarity can contribute to sustained optimism, even if the index is already high. It’s about combining the sentiment data with a deeper understanding of the underlying forces at play. Actionable Insights: Strategies for Investors in a ‘Greed’ Market So, what should you do when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals ‘Greed’? It’s not a call to panic, but rather an invitation to re-evaluate your strategy with a healthy dose of prudence. Here are some actionable insights: For New Investors: If you’re just entering the market, consider starting with smaller positions. Avoid the temptation to go all-in based on current euphoria. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) can be a powerful strategy, allowing you to invest a fixed amount regularly, smoothing out your entry price over time. For Experienced Traders: This might be a good time to review your portfolio for assets that have seen significant, rapid gains. Consider taking some profits, especially from highly speculative altcoins. Setting stop-loss orders can help protect your capital from sudden downturns. Rebalancing your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation is also a smart move. Risk Management is Key: Regardless of your experience level, avoid over-leveraging. High leverage in a ‘Greed’ market can amplify both gains and losses, and a sudden correction can lead to rapid liquidations. Diversification: While a ‘Greed’ market might make you want to chase the next big pump, remember the importance of diversification. Spreading your investments across different assets and sectors can mitigate risk. Focus on Fundamentals: Don’t let sentiment overshadow fundamentals. Research the projects you invest in. Do they have strong teams, clear roadmaps, and real-world utility? Strong fundamentals can help an asset weather market volatility. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: If you are a long-term investor, daily fluctuations in the index might be less critical. However, it can still inform your decision to accumulate during periods of fear or to trim positions during extreme greed. For short-term traders, the index can be a useful tool for timing entries and exits, but it should always be combined with technical analysis. Limitations and Nuances of the Index: Is it a Perfect Oracle? While incredibly useful, it’s important to remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a sentiment indicator, not a crystal ball. It reflects the current emotional state of the market, which can be fickle and influenced by numerous factors. It doesn’t predict the future with certainty, nor does it account for every potential black swan event or unexpected regulatory change. For example, a sudden positive news development (like a major company announcing Bitcoin adoption) could push the market higher even from a ‘Greed’ zone, while a negative event could trigger a rapid descent from a seemingly stable position. The index is a valuable piece of the puzzle, but it should always be used in conjunction with your own technical analysis, fundamental research, and understanding of global macroeconomic factors. Moreover, the index is primarily focused on Bitcoin’s sentiment, given its dominance. While it generally reflects the broader crypto market, altcoins can sometimes decouple, experiencing their own unique cycles of fear and greed. Therefore, always consider the specific assets in your portfolio. Conclusion: Empowering Your Crypto Journey with Informed Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an indispensable tool for any crypto enthusiast or investor. Its continued presence in the ‘Greed’ zone at 65 is a clear signal of ongoing market optimism. By understanding its components and implications, you can gain a deeper insight into the collective psychology driving prices. It serves as a powerful reminder that emotions play a significant role in financial markets, and being aware of these emotions – both your own and the market’s – is crucial for making rational decisions. While the ‘Greed’ signal suggests a buoyant market, it also whispers a word of caution: vigilance is paramount. Use the index not as a definitive buy or sell signal, but as a supplementary guide to inform your risk management strategies, assess market frothiness, and ultimately, empower your crypto journey with a more nuanced understanding of market trends and investor behavior.

His name is Charles Shrem, the guy behind the Blockchain Backer channel on YouTube. He’s been bullish on XRP for years. Now he’s saying outright that the altcoin is a threat to Bitcoin. That claim comes at a time when the altcoin is still trailing behind Bitcoin’s recent rally. Related Reading: TRUMP Token In Trouble? Over $4 Million Liquidity Exit Sparks Crash Fears XRP’s Rise And Fall Against Bitcoin According to charts, XRP jumped over 200% against Bitcoin from November 2024 to January 2025. That was an eye-popping move. Then things went south. Since February 2025, XRP lost about 30% against Bitcoin. Bitcoin, on the other hand, set new all-time highs after February. The crypto mostly hovered around $2. That big swing shows how fast fortunes can change in crypto markets. If it isn’t clear yet, XRP actually is a threat to Bitcoin. — Blockchain Backer (@BCBacker) June 26, 2025 Analyst Calls XRP A Serious Challenger Based on reports, Shrem has hinted at this view in the past. But he never put it so bluntly until now. He says Bitcoin fans feel threatened by XRP’s potential. He even pointed to online fights where Bitcoin maximalists blasted XRP and its backers. Shrem argues that those attacks prove it has real muscle behind it, at least in the minds of some big players. Trump’s Digital Asset Stockpile Debate In January 2025, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order asking a team to study a “digital asset stockpile.” It didn’t name Bitcoin or XRP. But the move sent shockwaves through crypto circles. The funny thing is… XRP was never mentioned in the executive order. But, the Bitcoiners have always known it’s the threat for the crown. That’s why the attack is on. They know. — Blockchain Backer (@BCBacker) January 24, 2025 Some Bitcoin supporters blamed XRP and Ripple’s boss, Brad Garlinghouse, for pushing to include the altcoin. That blew up into a heated online conflict. Shrem sees that clash as more proof of XRP’s rising profile. Bitcoiners are openly advertising that XRP may be a threat to overthrow Bitcoin. — Blockchain Backer (@BCBacker) January 24, 2025 Market Cap Gap Remains Wide XRP still has a long way to go. It trades at about $2.19 and boasts a market cap of $129.4 billion. Ethereum sits second with $295 billion. The crypto would need a 135% rise to hit $5. To match Bitcoin’s $2.125 trillion, the altcoin’s price must surge about $1,620% to $36. Back in October, analyst Dark Defender said XRP could reach $36. That call sounds bold today.

Its ties to banks and quick payments give it a story that’s very different from Bitcoin’s. But displacing Bitcoin means overcoming a huge lead in adoption and mind share. For now, Shrem’s claim makes good headlines. Whether XRP can turn that talk into market gains is another question. For crypto fans, it’s one of the storylines to watch in the months ahead.

SEC case and its implications for XRP adoption. According to SMQKE, once the case reaches a final settlement, it will provide a clear seal of approval for central banks and financial institutions to begin utilizing XRP through the XRP Ledger. SMQKE shared this view along with a visual that explicitly stated that the resolution of the lawsuit would offer the necessary regulatory clarity for banks to proceed confidently with XRP integration. WHEN THE RIPPLE V. SEC CASE IS SETTLED, CENTRAL BANKS WILL HAVE THE GREEN LIGHT TO USE XRP THROUGH THE XRP LEDGER This is documented. pic.twitter.com/8QCDZGTN8v — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 26, 2025 Ripple Legal Milestone and Its Significance The post emphasizes that the conclusion of the lawsuit between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission represents a pivotal regulatory milestone. The statement highlights that a settlement outcome would not only resolve a long-standing legal uncertainty but also serve as a formal endorsement, allowing central banks and financial institutions to consider XRP for cross-border payments and other financial services through the XRP Ledger. SMQKE’s assertion is presented as a documented position, reinforcing the idea that regulatory clarity will be the key turning point for widespread institutional use. The emphasis is placed on the notion that this outcome is less speculative compared to instances like Tesla’s sudden Bitcoin purchase, suggesting that the XRP use case is fundamentally more aligned with institutional frameworks. Community Reactions Reflect Confidence Kansas Liberty, a user responding to SMQKE’s post, agreed with the statement and pointed out that the critical question is not whether the settlement will happen but when. They expected this resolution since 2020 and personally set December 31, 2025, as their timeframe for this outcome, expressing patience and confidence in the process. Another user, Max Strange, responded by claiming that the case is effectively already settled, with the SEC and Ripple having reached an agreement. According to Max, the remaining procedural steps involve dismissing the appeals, after which banks could fully proceed with XRP adoption. Max further asserted that XRP has already been clarified as not being a security .

On June 26, 2025, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres officially denied the joint motion filed by Ripple and the SEC for an indicative ruling. This ruling was confirmed by ex-Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett. The motion, filed under ECF No. 987, requested the court’s guidance on whether it would consider dissolving the permanent injunction and reducing Ripple’s financial penalties. Judge Torres declined the motion and ordered that it be terminated. This recent denial indicates that certain aspects of the case still require formal resolution, particularly concerning the appeals process and remaining enforcement actions. However, it does not change the belief in the community that legal decisions have already confirmed XRP is not a security when sold on secondary markets. SMQKE’s post highlights the growing expectation that the end of the Ripple v. SEC litigation will serve as a green light for central banks and financial institutions to adopt XRP via the XRP Ledger .

The network’s performance of The Graph can be assessed by its growth in the volume of queries and the accrual of query fees. Recently, a report from Messari showed that query volume shot upto 6.1 billion in Q1 2025, and the updated Q2 2025 query volume per its official website highlights that it has reached 11.5 billion, reflecting robust developer adoption. Also, the Graph protocol’s on Dune highlights that since their network has migrated to Arbitrum, their network is growing fast in 2025. The query fees generated by data consumers of The Graph have reached an all-time high on Arbitrum at 6.2 million. Meanwhile, the network holds 168,560 delegators who are contributing to securing the network and 6,921 active curators who signal useful subgraphs that should be indexed by the graph network. Overall, the Dune metrics show the growing ecosystem, which directly means strength increasing on fundamental levels, which is the core element for mass adoption to come in the future. Apart from fundamentals, the GRT token’s price has been on a muted journey, from the 2024 peak, it is down 82%, but from the 2021 peak, it is 97% down, which has become a topic to discuss as its fundamentals are doing well, yet the price stays below. On breaking it down, its daily chart highlights key findings that represent a significant trend it is following. It is observed that in the past years after the 2021 crash, it has been in a range of $0.08 to $0.49, where after every multi-month period of correction, the breakout is strong every time it reaches $0.08 while correcting. This time also, the GRT price has been spending a lot of months in correction, also the price action in Q2 2025, the GRT price has reacted to the $0.08 level again, which is the same support block that has shown strong demand before. If in June or July of 2025 GRT price succeeds in breaking a declining trendline, representing the current multi-month correction, then a humongous surge is awaiting that could lead to a parabolic rise to $1, but a $0.55 high is a must for its price to reach that level. If not, then only consolidation would continue in its price action.

Quant recently partnered with the BIS, a milestone move to integrate blockchain into central banking systems, fostering global Distributed Ledger Technology and CBDC frameworks. Meanwhile, Jupiter crossed an impressive $1 trillion in Solana DEX trading volume, signaling its growing dominance in the DeFi ecosystem. These catalysts have sparked renewed investor confidence, fueling notable price surges for both assets. Quant (QNT) Price Analysis Quant price surged 6.35% in the past 24 hours to trade at $105.35, hitting a high of $105.64 while bouncing off from a low of $98.76.

A recent landmark ruling serves as a stark reminder of these risks, as Dwayne Golden, a central figure behind the infamous Cryptocurrency Ponzi Scheme known as EmpowerCoin, has been handed an eight-year prison sentence. This development underscores the ongoing efforts by authorities to crack down on illicit activities within the digital asset space and protect unsuspecting investors. What Was the EmpowerCoin Cryptocurrency Ponzi Scheme? At its core, a Cryptocurrency Ponzi Scheme operates by paying returns to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors, rather than from actual profits generated by legitimate business activities. This unsustainable model inevitably collapses, leaving the majority of participants with significant losses. EmpowerCoin, co-founded by Dwayne Golden, allegedly followed this classic blueprint, but with a modern twist: leveraging the allure and perceived complexity of cryptocurrencies to ensnare its victims. Golden, who established three crypto firms including EmpowerCoin, meticulously crafted a facade of legitimacy. He reportedly siphoned off a staggering $40 million in customer funds, diverting money meant for investment into his personal coffers. The scheme promised high, consistent returns, a common red flag for any fraudulent operation, preying on the excitement and lack of understanding many new investors have about the volatile crypto market. The Gravity of the Dwayne Golden Sentence: A Warning to Others? The legal repercussions for Golden’s actions have been severe. Indicted in 2022 on serious charges including fraud and money laundering, his recent sentencing to eight years in prison marks a significant victory for law enforcement in the fight against financial crimes in the crypto realm. The Dwayne Golden Sentence sends a resounding message to would-be fraudsters: the digital frontier is not a lawless one, and those who exploit it will face justice. This sentencing highlights the increasing capability of regulatory bodies and judicial systems to understand, investigate, and prosecute complex financial crimes involving cryptocurrencies. It demonstrates a growing maturity in how governments worldwide are addressing the darker side of digital asset innovation, moving beyond initial uncertainty to decisive action. Dissecting the EmpowerCoin Fraud Mechanics: How Did It Operate? The mechanics of the EmpowerCoin Fraud were designed to appear sophisticated and exclusive, drawing in individuals eager to capitalize on the crypto boom. Investors were likely presented with glossy marketing materials, vague whitepapers, and testimonials that painted a picture of a revolutionary investment opportunity. Key elements often include: Unrealistic Promises: Guarantees of high, fixed, or quick returns that are inconsistent with market realities. Complex Jargon: Use of technical cryptocurrency terms to confuse and impress, making it difficult for average investors to understand the underlying operations. Recruitment Incentives: Encouraging existing investors to recruit new ones, often through multi-level marketing structures, which fuels the Ponzi scheme’s growth. Lack of Transparency: Obscure financial statements, refusal to provide audited reports, and vague explanations of how profits are generated. Golden’s alleged siphoning of $40 million illustrates the direct financial devastation such schemes inflict, leaving victims with little to no recourse once the operation collapses. Are We Seeing More Crypto Fraud Cases? Understanding the Trend Unfortunately, the EmpowerCoin incident is not an isolated case. The digital asset landscape has seen a concerning rise in Crypto Fraud Cases , ranging from sophisticated rug pulls and phishing scams to elaborate investment schemes. The anonymity, global reach, and rapid value fluctuations inherent in cryptocurrencies can make them attractive targets for malicious actors. The trend indicates a critical need for enhanced investor education and robust regulatory frameworks. While the innovative potential of blockchain technology is undeniable, it also presents new avenues for exploitation that require constant vigilance from both authorities and individual participants. Recent high-profile collapses and arrests serve as stark reminders that due diligence is paramount. How Can You Protect Yourself from Digital Asset Scams? Actionable Insights As the digital asset market continues to mature, so do the tactics of fraudsters. Protecting yourself from Digital Asset Scams requires vigilance and a proactive approach. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Research (DYOR): Thoroughly investigate any project or investment opportunity. Look for credible teams, clear whitepapers, and verifiable use cases. Be Skeptical of Unrealistic Returns: If an investment promises guaranteed high returns with little to no risk, it’s likely a scam. Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Check for Regulatory Compliance: Verify if the platform or project is registered with relevant financial authorities in your jurisdiction. Secure Your Wallets: Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. Beware of Social Media Scams: Impersonators, fake giveaways, and direct messages offering investment advice are common tactics used by scammers. Understand the Technology: A basic understanding of how blockchain and cryptocurrencies work can help you identify red flags. Consult Professionals: If unsure, seek advice from trusted financial advisors who specialize in digital assets. Your financial security in the crypto space largely depends on your ability to identify and avoid these predatory schemes. Conclusion: A Step Towards Accountability in Crypto The sentencing of Dwayne Golden for his role in the EmpowerCoin Cryptocurrency Ponzi Scheme is a crucial step towards fostering greater accountability and trust within the digital asset ecosystem. It sends a clear message that justice will be pursued, even in the complex and often nebulous world of cryptocurrencies. While the crypto space offers unparalleled opportunities, it also demands heightened awareness and caution from all participants. By learning from cases like EmpowerCoin and adopting robust security practices, investors can better navigate the landscape and protect themselves from falling victim to similar devastating schemes.

SHIB’s burning and PEPE’s hype are fading, and analysts predict that SHIB will only increase by 32% to 45% by the end of the year, while PEPE is expected to rise by 470%. Seven meme coins— Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) , Bonk ($BONK), Floki ($FLOKI), Dogwifhat ($WIF), Pengu ($PENGU), Fartcoin ($FART), and Dogecoin ($DOGE)—are also ready to make huge profits, and they could even beat $SHIB and $PEPE in 2025. Supported by new technology, popular online communities, and small market caps. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Layer 2 Meme King Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is showing significant momentum in its presale stage, having sold out Stage 3 and raised $1.2 million. It is now in Stage 4 of the presale, with a price of $0.0013. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) differs from SHIB’s burn-driven approach and PEPE’s hype-driven model because it utilizes a Layer 2 blockchain for memecoins, which reduces gas expenses and accelerates transactions. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) will launch on two of the best centralized exchanges (CEXs). Insiders say the team is also preparing for a possible listing on the world’s largest exchange. This may make Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) a meme celebrity like OG Pepe never thought possible. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is already set to be listed on two of the best centralized exchanges (CEXs) at launch, providing it with significant visibility and trading access from the outset. The crew also has specific intentions to get Little Pepe listed on the world’s largest exchange, which shows that the meme’s goals extend far beyond the meme pond; it’s trying to take over the meme world. To get in on Little Pepe’s ($LILPEPE) Stage 4 presale before prices go up, you need to download a crypto wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Use the ERC-20 network to add ETH or USDT to your wallet. After that, go to littlepepe.com and buy your Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) tokens right there. You can get your tokens from the same page after the presale is over. Don’t miss out—get your share before the subsequent price rise. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Meme Champion Bonk does well in Solana’s environment at $0.00001, which is better than $SHIB’s Ethereum limits. Its community-driven DeFi and NFT integrations help it get more users. The team’s primary goal is to increase the liquidity of Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs). The developers aimed to create a genuine community token that all dApps on Solana could utilize. They wanted everyone to have a chance to be part of the ecosystem, “where everyone gets a fair shot.” Analysts predict that by the end of 2025, the price will have increased tenfold to $0.0001. A $1,000 investment might grow to $100,000, which is much more than $PEPE’s 470% upside. BONK is a top contender because it has an edge over Solana and a low market capitalization. Floki (FLOKI): The Education and Entertainment Star Floki (FLOKI) is the cryptocurrency for the people and the utility token of the Floki Ecosystem. It is a digital currency created by fans and members of the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community. Floki’s name and concept originate from Shiba Inu, Elon Musk’s dog. The group gave itself the name “Floki Vikings” after Musk’s canine, Floki, who was named after a Viking. Floki has made promises to take community work seriously, and he is one of the top 10-ranked social engagement leaders in LunarCrush. Floki has also collaborated with top crypto projects, including Chainlink, Trader Joe, and ApeSwap, to develop its FlokiFi Locker digital asset locker system. Floki ($FLOKI) is worth $0.00006 and combines education (Floki University) with games, making it superior to SHIB’s old ecosystem. Analysts predict that by the end of the year, it will be worth $0.0005, which is eight times its current value. Dogwifhat ($WIF): The Solana Meme Powerhouse Dogewhich is worth $0.76, is more valuable than PEPE’s waning momentum. It leverages Solana’s speed and community buzz. Analysts expect the price to increase 3 to 4 times, reaching $2 to $3 by the end of 2025. However, X postings say the cost would increase 100 times, to $76, if Solana reaches $500. A $1,000 investment might grow to $100,000, which is much more than $PEPE’s upside. The emergence of $WIF is fueled by its integration with the Solana blockchain. Pengu (PENGU): The NFT-Driven Meme Pudgy Penguins is now one of the most well-known names in crypto, due to one of the most powerful communities in the business. The Penguin has become a cultural icon, with big firms wearing it, appearing in ETF ads, and garnering millions of followers and over 100 billion views. PENGU is now the world’s social money. Pengu ($PENGU) is worth $0.009 and is part of the Pudgy Penguins NFT ecosystem. It has more uses than $SHIB’s Shiboshis. Analysts predict the price will rise to $0.05 by the end of the year, representing a 5x increase. If you invest $1,000, it may increase to $100,000, which is more than SHIB’s current growth rate. The NFT synergy of $PENGU makes it a trendy selection. Fartcoin (FART): The Absurdly Viral Newcomer Fartcoin (FART) is doing well at $0.99, due to silly jokes and community hype. $PEPE’s buzz is fading. Analysts predict that by the fourth quarter of 2025, the price will increase by 3 to 5 times, to $3 to $5. A $1,000 investment may grow to $100,000, which is more than PEPE’s returns. The low-cap volatility of $FART will change the game in 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE): The OG Meme Coin The logo of Dogecoin has a Shiba Inu, which is the same as the meme “doge”. Dogecoin was created to make it more fun compared to Bitcoin, and it is gaining popularity among a wider audience, rather than just those who supported Bitcoin. They also used a famous dog meme as the base for their new cryptocurrency. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and a frequent tweeter who has expressed a desire to help Dogecoin grow, has claimed that he loves Dogecoin. Dogecoin remains the most popular meme coin, currently trading at $0.16. This is because an increasing number of people are using it to pay for things. Experts believe that by the end of the year, the price will rise to $0.50–$1, which is three to six times its current value. However, analysts are looking for a $16 (100x) rise. If you invest $1,000, it may increase to $100,000, which is greater than the value of SHIB and PEPE, and is sustained by high demand from people like those of DOGE. Conclusion $SHIB and $PEPE are losing value, while Little Pepe ($LILPEPE), $BONK, $FLOKI, $WIF, $PENGU, $FART, and $DOGE are the hottest meme coins for 2025. They might turn $1,000 into $100,000. Little Pepe’s Layer 2 blockchain and $777K prize are at the top of the list, with a goal of $0.15. Join the presale at littlepepe.com and use these tokens to outperform $SHIB and $PEPE in the bull run. Do extensive research—crypto is quite risky.

With a potential surge, Ondo crypto price may hit $9.30 by 2030. After an impressive surge that saw the ONDO price reach $1.10 before retreating to $0.91, investors are now closely eyeing its future potential. In Q2 2025 alone, ONDO gained 70% from its lows of $0.66, and despite a recent cooldown, it’s still holding onto gains of over 40%. With such resilience, ONDO price prediction 2025 has become a hot topic among analysts and retail investors alike, especially as the token continues to build credibility and momentum through high-profile developments. With more than $250 million in TVL and growing institutional interest, ONDO has solidified itself as a major player in the Real World Asset (RWA) space . But how far can it go from here?

However, if the box is breached, then the support level at $0.62 to $0.66 could be crucial. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Ondo Coin Future Forecast July 2025 0.62 0.90 1.20 Ondo Price Prediction 2025 The biggest rise in the ONDO price was when donlad trump won the election last year, hitting $2.148 by mid-December on Coinbase. Since then, it has continuously declined, and by April 2024, it fell to a low of $0.70. In the entire Q2, it has seen its price action trapped in a range, despite being a leading performer in tokenized RWA’s based on Coingecko’s report recently. In Q2, many were anticipating that this altcoin could gain significant traction like last year’s first half movement, but met with a strong supply level mid-May and declined. By the third week of June, it fell 35% due to geopolitical uncertainty, but in the fourth week, a ceasefire immediately bounced the market, which developed a fake breakdown from its multi-month support. On zooming out to the weekly macro chart, it shows a key finding that highlights that the longer it coils in a range, the longer the breakout becomes. Year 2024’s fascinating price action is evident of that, and also the chart shows the key support is strong. This makes the situation optimistic ahead, as institutional collaborations increased, so has retail adoption. However, the external factors like the FOMC decision and the ongoing geopolitical situation are assumed to be suppressing the current momentum. Once the situation eases and the ONDO price shows a reversal in the short term by clearing the 50-day EMA band and $0.90 mark, then a target of $1.20 could be within reach by June or July. Also, in the long term,if short-term makes a daily close above $1.20, then in the long term it would lead towards the retest of $2.05 by year-end. However, if the macro range lower border, which also aligns with multi-month support, is breached, then support would be $0.66 and $0.45, where bulls could join.

I’m going to put somebody that wants to cut rates. There are a lot of them out there,” Trump said on Friday. Trump’s public attack on current Fed Chair Jerome Powell is getting more and more agitative. He once again called Powell “a stubborn mule and a stupid person” over the Fed’s repeated decisions to hold rates steady. When asked if he wants Powell out, Trump responded, “I’d love him to resign if he wanted to.” The tension between the two men, which has been building for years, is now boiling over. Trump is openly planning for Powell’s replacement, saying he already has “three or four” people in mind. He didn’t name anyone specifically or provide a timeline. Powell’s current term ends in May 2026, but Trump is clearly not waiting around. Trump pushes for 2.5-point rate cuts despite Fed resistance Trump said earlier this month that a list of potential replacements for Powell will be revealed “very soon.” Behind the scenes, speculation has picked up. Reports from The Wall Street Journal say Trump is considering announcing his pick sooner than planned. That news came just as the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index dropped by 0.2% in early Thursday trading, with the US dollar weakening against every major global currency, clearly reacting to Trump’s comments. Some names are floating in the background. Trump allies have reportedly suggested Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, although a senior official inside the administration denied that claim. Trump has spoken positively about Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, calling him “very highly thought of.” But again, Trump is keeping any final decision under wraps, only saying the replacement will be someone who fully supports cutting rates. The president has been pushing for a full 2.5 percentage point cut to the federal funds rate. That’s way beyond what the Fed has even hinted at. Just last week, Powell and his fellow policymakers left rates untouched, keeping them between 4.25% and 4.5%, where they’ve been sitting since the beginning of the year. The Fed also indicated they might lower rates by only 0.5 percentage points by the end of 2025, far less than what Trump wants. Trump slams Powell’s policies and leans into tariff deadline Trump has gone after Powell repeatedly. On social media, he labeled Powell “Too Late,” mocking his caution. He’s gone back and forth about firing Powell, sometimes suggesting he might, other times claiming he wouldn’t. Last week, Trump posted again, writing, “Regardless, his Term ends shortly!” The comment came after Powell testified before the House Financial Services Committee, where the chair defended the Fed’s policies and urged caution, saying the bank would wait to see how Trump’s economic policies, especially his tariffs, would affect inflation before making any rate decisions. Powell’s wait-and-see approach doesn’t sit well with Trump. The president blames Powell for keeping borrowing costs high for the government and believes the Fed’s rate strategy is working against his broader fiscal agenda. As Trump continues to adjust the specifics of his tariff programs, he’s also trying to finalize trade deals before a July 9 deadline. Those deals could lower or eliminate some high import duties that are scheduled to go into effect. Powell has said the Fed wants to see how those moves play out before changing policy. Trump, on the other hand, wants faster decisions and fewer excuses. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

As the markets are heading towards the end of the month, the upcoming weekend trade appears to be extremely pivotal. The traders now think, will the BTC price stay within a range-bound around $107K or display major price action? The price is currently trading between $105,000 and $108,000, a range it has defended throughout the week. The token has shown resilience this week, bouncing back from the recent lows below $100K, fueled by ETF inflows and continued whale accumulation. Why This Week Could Be Different One of the biggest short-term catalysts is the options expiry event, with over $40 billion in BTC options set to expire. The max pain point—the price at which most options lose value—is estimated around $102K, suggesting that BTC could be pulled toward this level as traders unwind positions. Historically, such expirations often lead to short-term volatility, especially during the weekends when liquidity is lower. Secondly, the current chart patterns suggest the price is expected to form a CME gap during the weekend. A popular analyst, Daan Crypto Trades , does not look out for any price action during the weekend. The analyst says that the price could remain around the $107K region, which it traded around for most of the week. After a strong consolidation, the BTC price is believed to trigger a breakout at the start of the upcoming weekly trade. With this, the price may form a significant CME gap that may attract a significant pullback after marking local highs. Therefore, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is believed to undergo a Sunday drop, followed by a notable rebound and end the monthly trade on a bullish note.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-28 09:45:06

Right now, a crucial indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , is signaling a clear trend: we are firmly in what’s known as Bitcoin Season. This isn’t just a technical reading; it has profound implications for every cryptocurrency investor, from seasoned traders to curious newcomers. Let’s dive deep into what this means for your portfolio and the broader market. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: What Does 19 Really Mean? When the Altcoin Season Index, a widely tracked metric by cryptocurrency price data platform CoinMarketCap (CMC), registers a low number like 19 (as it did at 00:30 UTC on June 28), it’s a powerful signal. This index serves as a barometer for the overall health and direction of the crypto market, specifically indicating whether Bitcoin or altcoins are leading the charge. Here’s how the Altcoin Season Index works: Top 100 Coins Analyzed: The index rigorously compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to ensure a true reflection of market sentiment and innovation. 90-Day Performance Window: It looks at the price performance of these assets over the past 90 days, providing a medium-term view rather than just daily fluctuations. Defining Altcoin Season: For the market to officially enter ‘Altcoin Season’, at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over that 90-day period. This indicates a broad-based rally in alternative cryptocurrencies. Defining Bitcoin Season: Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ is declared when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. A score of 19, as we see now, clearly falls into this category, indicating a strong Bitcoin dominance. A score of 19 means that a significant majority of altcoins are lagging behind Bitcoin’s performance. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly changes the investment landscape and requires a different approach to cryptocurrency investments . Decoding Bitcoin Season: Why Bitcoin Dominates the Crypto Market? The current state, where the Altcoin Season Index is at 19, unequivocally points to a Bitcoin Season . But what does this period truly entail, and why does Bitcoin often take the lead in the crypto market trends ? During Bitcoin Season, we typically observe: Capital Flight to Safety: In times of uncertainty or consolidation, investors often move capital from riskier, more volatile altcoins back into Bitcoin, perceiving it as a safer, more established asset. Bitcoin acts as the ‘reserve currency’ of crypto. Dominance Growth: Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance (its percentage of the total crypto market cap) tends to increase. This is a key indicator of its strength relative to altcoins. Liquidity Concentration: Trading volume often concentrates more heavily in Bitcoin, leading to tighter spreads and more efficient price discovery compared to many altcoins. Institutional Preference: Institutional investors, who are increasingly entering the crypto space, often prioritize Bitcoin due to its larger market cap, higher liquidity, and perceived regulatory clarity, especially with the advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Historically, crypto markets move in cycles. Periods of Bitcoin accumulation and dominance often precede broader altcoin rallies. Bitcoin’s strength can act as a foundation, pulling the entire market up before altcoins then embark on their more explosive, speculative runs. Factors Influencing Altcoin Performance in a Bitcoin-Led Market In a period dominated by Bitcoin, the overall altcoin performance tends to be subdued. Many altcoins might even see their value decline against Bitcoin, even if they hold relatively stable against fiat currencies. Understanding the factors that impact altcoin performance during such times is crucial for making informed decisions. Key influences on altcoin performance include: Bitcoin’s Price Action: Bitcoin’s movements often dictate the broader market sentiment. A strong, stable Bitcoin provides a foundation, while sharp corrections can trigger even larger percentage drops in altcoins. Project-Specific Developments: Even in a Bitcoin-dominated market, altcoins with significant news – major upgrades, successful mainnet launches, strong partnerships, or unexpected institutional adoption – can buck the trend and show independent strength. Narrative Shifts: New trends or narratives (e.g., AI, GameFi, Real World Assets, Layer 2 solutions) can temporarily boost specific sectors of altcoins, drawing in speculative capital despite overall Bitcoin dominance. Macroeconomic Conditions: Broader economic factors like inflation rates, interest rate decisions by central banks, and geopolitical events can influence investor appetite for risk, impacting altcoins more severely than Bitcoin. While the index points to Bitcoin Season, it doesn’t mean all altcoins are dead. It means that finding those outperformers requires more diligent research and a higher risk tolerance. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends: Strategies for Investors Given the current Altcoin Season Index reading and the prevailing Bitcoin Season , how should investors approach the market? Adapting your strategy to the current crypto market trends is key to protecting your capital and positioning for future gains. Here are some actionable strategies: Prioritize Bitcoin (and potentially Ethereum): During Bitcoin Season, focusing on the market leaders can be a prudent move. They tend to be more resilient and recover faster. Ethereum, as the second-largest crypto and the backbone of DeFi and NFTs, often follows Bitcoin’s lead but can show relative strength due to its ecosystem. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consistently investing a fixed amount at regular intervals can reduce risk and average out your purchase price, especially during periods of consolidation. Research & Due Diligence: This is always important, but even more so during a Bitcoin-dominated phase. Look for altcoins with strong fundamentals, active development, clear use cases, and solid community support. Avoid highly speculative or meme-driven assets unless you have a high risk appetite and clear exit strategy. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential downside, especially on your altcoin positions. Diversification, even within a Bitcoin-heavy portfolio, can also help mitigate risk. Patience is a Virtue: Market cycles take time to play out. Altcoin Season will likely return, but rushing into highly speculative plays during Bitcoin Season can lead to significant losses. Understanding these trends helps you make more informed decisions rather than reacting emotionally to market fluctuations. Making Informed Cryptocurrency Investments During Bitcoin Season The current Altcoin Season Index at 19 presents a unique landscape for cryptocurrency investments . It’s a time when strategic planning and a deep understanding of market dynamics are paramount. Rather than despairing over lagging altcoin performance, view this as an opportunity to refine your investment approach. Consider these points for your investment strategy: Rebalance Your Portfolio: If your portfolio is heavily weighted towards altcoins, this might be a good time to rebalance. Shifting some capital into Bitcoin or stablecoins can help preserve value and provide dry powder for future opportunities when altcoins show signs of recovery. Look for Accumulation Opportunities: For long-term investors, Bitcoin Season can present excellent accumulation opportunities for quality altcoins that have seen significant pullbacks. Identify projects you believe in for the long haul and consider buying them at lower prices. Stay Informed on Fundamentals: Pay close attention to project roadmaps, developer activity, and ecosystem growth. Strong fundamentals are what will ultimately drive an altcoin’s success, regardless of short-term market cycles. Monitor On-Chain Data: For advanced investors, tracking on-chain metrics for Bitcoin and major altcoins can provide insights into accumulation/distribution patterns and network health, offering clues about potential shifts in the market. The transition from Bitcoin Season to Altcoin Season often happens when Bitcoin has established a new higher base or completed a significant rally, and capital then begins to flow into altcoins seeking higher percentage gains. Keeping an eye on the Altcoin Season Index itself will be your best guide for when that shift might occur. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Crypto Market Cycles The Altcoin Season Index currently at 19 is a clear indicator that the crypto market is in a period of Bitcoin Season . This doesn’t mean the end for altcoins, but rather a strategic phase where Bitcoin consolidates its position, often setting the stage for future market-wide growth. Understanding these cycles, whether it’s Bitcoin Season or the highly anticipated altcoin rallies, is fundamental to successful cryptocurrency investments . By focusing on robust projects, practicing sound risk management, and staying informed about crypto market trends and the factors influencing altcoin performance , investors can navigate these periods with confidence. The crypto market is dynamic, and adapting your strategy to its ever-changing rhythms is the key to long-term success. Keep a close watch on the Altcoin Season Index; it’s your compass in this exciting, volatile landscape.

In a recent post on X, he called silver “the best asymmetric buy today,” meaning it offers big potential gains with relatively low risk. So, while most eyes are on Bitcoin and gold, Kiyosaki is betting on silver to steal the spotlight. Let’s break down why he’s so bullish. REMINDER: Rich Lesson: “Your profits are made when you buy…. Not when you sell.” Silver is the best “asymmetric buy” today. That means more possible upside gain with little down side risk. Silver price will explode in July, Everyone can afford silver today… but not… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 27, 2025 Why Silver Could Be 2025’s Best Asset Kiyosaki has been vocal about silver for a while now. Just days ago, he called it “the best investment” in June 2025, highlighting how much cheaper it is compared to gold and Bitcoin. And that’s exactly why he’s urging people to pay attention. Silver is in high demand for things like solar panels, electronics, and medical devices. That gives it a strong foundation not just as an investment, but also as a key industrial material. “Today, everyone can buy silver… but that may change tomorrow,” Kiyosaki cautioned, urging investors to respond quickly. By combining industrial usefulness with investment attractiveness, silver emerges as an essential asset for individuals looking to broaden their portfolios. Bitcoin and Gold: Waiting for the Dip While Kiyosaki backs silver, he’s no stranger to Bitcoin and gold, both of which he expects to skyrocket long-term. However, he waits patiently, looking for a price crash to dig up more of these assets at a discount. He predicts Bitcoin could rocket past $1 million by 2035 and gold could exceed $30,000 per ounce. Yet, silver’s lower entry point makes it a compelling choice for investors looking to ride the wave of precious metals without breaking the bank. Is July Silver’s Time to Shine? Kiyosaki’s track record in financial predictions has earned him a loyal following, and he’s confident that silver is about to take off. He sees July 2025 as a possible turning point, driven by rising demand and shifting market conditions. So, could silver outperform Bitcoin and gold this year? According to Kiyosaki, the answer might be yes.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-28 09:51:18

While recent developments suggest both parties are ready to walk away from further appeals, one key step remains before the case is officially closed. According to former SEC official Marc Fagel, the lawsuit is still technically active, and a final court dismissal has not yet occurred. Ripple and the SEC Drop Their Appeals On June 27, 2025, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the company would withdraw its cross-appeal in the long-running lawsuit. This came after the SEC, on March 19, 2025, signaled its intent to drop its appeal. These actions were seen by many in the crypto space as the definitive end of a case that has lasted more than four years and shaped the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the U.S. No, that didn’t happen. The SEC presumably still has to vote to drop the appeal. Which they will 100% do, but nothing’s been dismissed yet. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) June 28, 2025 Crypto influencer Jungle Inc captured the sentiment on X, posting: “It’s all over, red rover. The SEC dropped its appeal on March 19, 2025. Ripple dropped its cross-appeal on June 27, 2025. One of the biggest legal fights in crypto history is DONE.” However, that interpretation may have been premature. Marc Fagel Sets the Record Straight Responding directly to Jungle Inc’s statement, Marc Fagel, a former SEC enforcement lawyer, clarified that the appeals haven’t been officially dismissed yet. He wrote, “No, that didn’t happen. The SEC presumably still has to vote to drop the appeal. Which they will 100% do, but nothing’s been dismissed yet.” Fagel’s insight highlights a critical legal nuance: while parties can signal their intent to end a case, an actual court order is required to finalize dismissal. The SEC must first hold a formal internal vote to withdraw the appeal, and only then can the court process the dismissal. A Look Back at the Turning Points The case began in December 2020 when the SEC alleged that Ripple’s sale of XRP amounted to an unregistered securities offering. The pivotal moment came in July 2023 when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP was not a security in programmatic sales on exchanges , though Ripple’s institutional sales were found to violate securities laws. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The SEC initially sought $2 billion in penalties during the remedies phase, but eventually reduced the demand to $105 million. In early June 2025, both parties submitted a joint settlement proposal. However, Judge Torres denied it . Ripple’s decision to drop its cross-appeal was seen as a strategic move to clear the path for resolution, placing the final responsibility on the SEC. What Happens Next? According to Fagel, the SEC is still expected to vote to drop the appeal, a move he believes is inevitable. Once that internal process is completed, the court will be able to officially dismiss the case, closing one of the most significant legal chapters in crypto history. Until then, the case remains technically open, even if all signs point toward its imminent conclusion. For now, the crypto industry watches closely, awaiting the final signature on a lawsuit that has tested regulatory boundaries and redefined how digital assets are treated under U.S. law.

They have had partnerships, long histories, and strong followings. But even now, they have not made crypto payments a normal part of everyday life. Ripple is still dealing with legal issues, and Stellar has not gained the adoption many expected. Now, SpacePay is stepping in with a better and simpler solution. It is already working in real stores with real users, and it is built in a way that solves the problems XRP and XLM have not. What Makes SpacePay Different SpacePay is a crypto payment platform that lets people pay with crypto the same way they pay with cards. It connects to regular card machines and supports over 325 wallets. This means users can spend Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, and other cryptos with a quick scan, while stores do not need any new hardware to accept it. Transactions are fast and secure. Everything settles right away. There are no long waits or extra steps. Businesses get paid immediately, and customers do not have to deal with delays. SpacePay also charges very low fees – just 0.5% per transaction – and there are no hidden charges. One big issue with crypto is price swings. SpacePay fixes that with volatility protection. When someone makes a payment, the store still receives the exact amount in fiat money, even if the crypto price moves. That makes crypto much safer for businesses to accept. Another key point is control. SpacePay is decentralized, so users pay straight from their own wallets. They do not give up their private keys, and everything is protected with strong encryption. It is simple, secure, and built to work for everyone. The SPY Token and What It Does SPY is the token that powers the SpacePay system, and it is not just something to hold; it gives real benefits. People who hold SPY can earn passive income from revenue sharing. They will also receive loyalty airdrops every month if they are active on the platform. SPY holders can vote on new features and changes to the project. They also get early access to new tools and updates. SpacePay even plans to match SPY holders’ donations to select charities, so the token helps give back, too. Clock is ticking pic.twitter.com/toIsIP2VF2 — SpacePay (@SpacePayLtd) February 17, 2025 There are also quarterly webinars where SPY holders get updates from the team, learn about new plans, and get to ask questions directly. It helps build a strong and informed community. The presale is live, and it is growing fast. Over $1 million has already been raised. The current price of SPY is $0.003181, and it is expected to go up as more people join. SPY has a total supply of 34 billion tokens. The distribution is spread across public sales, development, partnerships, rewards, and a reserve fund. Everything is planned to support long-term growth. Why SpacePay Might Be the One to Lead Crypto Payments The biggest edge SpacePay has over Ripple and Stellar is how close it is to everyday usability. It is already built for POS systems, already works with hundreds of wallets, and already has protections in place for things like crypto volatility. If a merchant accepts SpacePay and the price of Bitcoin drops, the merchant still gets paid the exact fiat amount they expected. That is a huge deal. It is also not just a vision; it is working tech. SpacePay has already built its MVP, secured funding from private investors, and won the “New Payment Platform of the Year” award. It is regulatory compliant in all unsanctioned countries, which opens up global market access. All of this means that SpacePay is not just promising to solve the problems; it is actually doing it. With the crypto market heating up again, people are paying attention to platforms that offer real, usable products. The fact that so many investors have already joined the presale shows that SpacePay is striking a chord. Here Is How to Join the Presale If you want to get in on the presale and buy SPY tokens, it is pretty straightforward. Start by connecting your wallet to the website . MetaMask and most popular crypto wallets are supported. Once connected, you can swap ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX, USDC, USDT, BASE, or even use a bank card to buy SPY directly. Just make sure your wallet is funded before you start, and be sure to leave a little extra for network fees when swapping. SpacePay might just be building the future of payments, and the SPY token could play a big part in that journey. If XRP and XLM are yesterday’s stories, SpacePay is shaping up to be tomorrow’s headline.

Trump Eyes New Fed Leadership Amid Rate Clash,https://coinpedia.org/news/jerome-powell-to-resign-trump-eyes-new-fed-leadership-amid-rate-clash/,"The post Jerome Powell to Resign? Trump Eyes New Fed Leadership Amid Rate Clash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News US President Donald Trump is frustrated with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s resistance to cutting interest rates, and the impact could ripple through the entire financial and crypto markets. Why Is Trump Pushing for Interest Rate Cuts? Since returning to the office in January 2025, President Trump has repeatedly called on the Fed to slash interest rates , arguing that: Lower rates will stimulate economic growth Cheaper borrowing can boost business investments and job creation The US needs competitive rates in line with other major economies But Fed Chair Jerome Powell isn’t budging. The central bank has taken a “wait-before-act” stance despite mounting political pressure. Fed Holds Steady Despite Trump’s Demands The current federal interest rate stands at 4.25%-4.50%, and no cuts have been made since December 2024. Why the delay? Inflation is creeping back up: May 2025 saw the annual inflation rate rise to 2.4%, breaking a four-month downtrend. Labour market remains strong: Jobless claims dropped from 246K to 236K, signaling economic resilience. The Fed argues that rate cuts right now could overheat the economy and fuel inflation, risking long-term instability. Will Trump Replace Jerome Powell? President Trump cannot directly fire the Fed Chair , whose term ends in May 2026, but he’s already publicly demanded Powell’s resignation. Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and known policy dove, is rumored to be Trump’s preferred replacement for someone more aligned with his views on rate cuts. [post_titles_links postid=”476095″] A change in leadership could reshape Fed policy, possibly triggering major financial shifts. What It Means for the Crypto Market Trump’s push for lower interest rates could turn bullish for crypto. Here’s why: Lower rates = cheaper money: This can drive more capital into risk-on assets like Bitcoin and altcoins If inflation spikes, Bitcoin could act as a hedge, strengthening its narrative as digital gold A dovish Fed could increase liquidity, pushing crypto prices higher However, the power struggle between Trump and the Fed may also lead to short-term volatility and investor uncertainty. Final Take: Political Drama, Market Opportunity? Trump’s aggressive push for rate cuts and potential reshaping of the Federal Reserve could create the perfect setup for a crypto rally, but not without turbulence.If Powell stays firm, rate cuts may come slowly. But if Trump replaces him with someone more dovish, expect faster policy shifts and possibly a surge in crypto investor confidence.

Cutting rates now risks reigniting inflation, as the May 2025 annual rate rose to 2.4% and the labor market remains strong (jobless claims dropped). The Fed fears overheating the economy and jeopardizing long-term stability. What could be the consequences for the broader economy if rates are cut too soon or too aggressively? Cutting rates too soon or aggressively could lead to a resurgence of inflation, erode savers’ returns, encourage excessive risk-taking in markets (like real estate), and potentially weaken the national currency, making imports more expensive. How do interest rate cuts typically affect the prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? Interest rate cuts generally benefit crypto prices by increasing market liquidity, making borrowing cheaper, and prompting investors to move capital into “risk-on” assets like Bitcoin and altcoins, which offer potentially higher returns than bonds. How does U.S. interest rate policy compare with other major economies, and why does Trump see this as important? The U.S. Fed is holding rates steady (4.25%-4.50%), while central banks like the ECB and Bank of Canada have been cutting theirs. Trump views this divergence as a disadvantage, arguing it makes U.S. exports less competitive and complicates his trade goals.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-28 09:55:21

But while BTC consolidates, early investors are zeroing in on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi contender currently priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5, with nearly half the supply already sold. According to recent reports, prominent crypto investors have already secured significant positions—one buyer purchased 1.2 million tokens, anticipating a powerful breakout. Why? Because the presale started at $0.01, and early participants are already up 200%. With the final presale price set at $0.06, anyone entering now at $0.03 could lock in a 400% gain if the token hits just $0.15 post-listing. A $2,000 investment today could potentially return $10,000 or more, and with the beta platform launching at the time of listing, momentum is only gaining strength. Investors watching BTC’s next move are also preparing for what could be the year’s most aggressive DeFi upside. Two Models, One Ecosystem—Lending That Matches User Intent Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch with two distinct lending frameworks: peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). Each has been designed to serve a different market need without compromising on protocol stability. P2C lending will offer users a way to passively earn on well-known assets such as ETH, BTC, USDT, or SOL by depositing into smart contracts. These deposits will be pooled and offered to borrowers who must overcollateralize their loans. Interest rates in this model will automatically adjust based on pool utilization, creating an efficient feedback loop where rising demand raises interest rates, attracting more lenders and stabilizing pool activity. Depositors will receive mtTokens—fully compliant ERC-20 tokens representing their share of the pool and any earned interest. These mtTokens will not only reflect the accrued value in real-time but also serve as collateral within the ecosystem, enhancing capital efficiency. mtTokens will be redeemable directly for the underlying asset plus interest, pending liquidity availability, with no need for manual compounding or claims. For users seeking more control or exposure to high-volatility tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer a P2P lending route. This model will support direct agreements between lenders and borrowers on assets like meme coins, enabling customized interest rates, flexible durations, and optional partial fills. Since P2P loans operate independently of the core liquidity pools, risk exposure will be isolated, allowing the platform to serve both conservative and aggressive lending strategies without overlap. All loans—whether through P2C or P2P—will follow strict overcollateralization rules enforced through the Stability Factor system. When a borrower’s collateral value drops too low, the platform will automatically initiate liquidation, protecting lenders and maintaining systemic solvency. A Self-Regulating Stablecoin Is in the Works Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also building a decentralized stablecoin that will only be minted against collateralized loans. This stablecoin will always target a $1 peg and will only be created when users borrow against digital assets such as ETH. Its supply will be reduced whenever loans are repaid or liquidated, ensuring that it remains fully backed at all times. Issuance will be strictly limited to approved smart contracts and whitelisted users with set caps, reducing overexposure. What makes this stablecoin structure unique is its dynamic interest-rate control mechanism. If the price ever strays above $1, interest rates on borrowing will be lowered; if it falls below $1, rates will be raised. This approach will keep price deviations minimal while giving the protocol the tools to regulate supply-demand mismatches. Arbitrage will play a key role in maintaining the peg. Traders will naturally buy or sell the stablecoin in response to price fluctuations, locking its value back to $1 without requiring manual intervention. Combined with automated liquidations on undercollateralized loans, this will create a stable and transparent borrowing environment. Token Utility and Entry Window The utility of the MUTM token spans the full platform. Users will be able to stake mtTokens in designated contracts for passive dividend rewards in MUTM tokens. As the system accumulates revenue, it will use part of that capital to buy MUTM tokens from open markets and redistribute them to contributors who stake mtTokens, supporting both price strength and engagement. With a total token supply of 4 billion and current pricing at $0.03, entry at Phase 5 still offers a direct path to 400% ROI based solely on scheduled presale pricing—culminating at $0.06 in Phase 11. The beta launch of the platform will coincide with token activation, further aligning the roadmap with token release to maximize momentum. With 50% of Phase 5 already sold, this is a narrow window for investors seeking deep exposure to DeFi before broader awareness drives the price upward. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not following trends—it’s building a layered, structured DeFi system that reflects real lending activity, balances risk across asset types, and reinforces long-term value through a self-balancing stablecoin and mtToken-based capital flow. At $0.03, this project is priced to move.

This astonishing surge signals a significant shift in investor sentiment towards digital assets and highlights Coinbase’s pivotal role in the evolving financial landscape. Coinbase Stock’s Explosive June Performance June proved to be an extraordinary month for Coinbase stock, which recorded an astounding 43% increase. This impressive gain firmly positioned it at the top of the S&P 500, outperforming hundreds of established companies. For investors, this wasn’t just a fleeting moment of success; it marked the third consecutive month of gains for COIN, a rally not seen since late 2023. This sustained upward trajectory underscores growing confidence in the platform’s fundamentals and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. What factors contributed to this exceptional run? Understanding the S&P 500 Performance Context To truly appreciate Coinbase’s achievement, it’s crucial to understand the broader S&P 500 performance . The S&P 500, a benchmark for the U.S. equity market, comprises 500 of the largest U.S. publicly traded companies. Outperforming this diverse index is no small feat, especially in a month where market dynamics can be unpredictable. Coinbase’s dominance suggests a unique confluence of company-specific catalysts and a renewed optimism for sectors traditionally seen as high-risk. This performance challenges conventional investment wisdom and signals a maturation of the digital asset space within mainstream finance. What’s Fueling the Crypto Market Rally? The impressive surge in Coinbase stock is intrinsically linked to a broader crypto market rally . Several key drivers appear to be at play: Regulatory Clarity: Progress on regulatory frameworks in various jurisdictions, particularly in the U.S. with potential spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, has significantly reduced uncertainty. Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions are increasingly exploring and investing in digital assets, bringing substantial capital and legitimacy to the market. Bitcoin’s Resilience: Bitcoin, as the market leader, has shown remarkable resilience, often leading the charge for altcoins and the broader crypto ecosystem. Its stability provides a foundational confidence for exchanges like Coinbase. Technological Advancements: Ongoing innovations within blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) continue to attract developers and users, expanding the utility and potential of digital assets. Halving Event Anticipation: While not directly in June, the anticipation of future Bitcoin halving events often creates bullish sentiment in the crypto market, impacting related stocks. Implications for Coinbase Investment For current and prospective investors, Coinbase investment presents a fascinating case study. The recent performance validates the long-term bullish thesis for those who believe in the future of digital finance. However, it’s also important to consider the volatility inherent in the crypto sector. Benefits: Exposure to the rapidly growing crypto economy without direct ownership of volatile cryptocurrencies, potential for significant capital appreciation, and a strong brand presence in a nascent industry. Challenges: Regulatory risks remain, intense competition from other exchanges, and the inherent volatility of the underlying crypto assets can still impact stock performance. Actionable Insights: Diversification is key. While Coinbase offers a compelling growth story, it should be part of a balanced portfolio. Investors should also stay informed about regulatory developments and broader crypto market trends. Broader Digital Asset Trends and Future Outlook Coinbase’s stellar June performance is more than just a company success story; it’s a barometer for broader digital asset trends . It suggests a growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The increasing integration of digital assets into traditional financial systems, the rise of tokenized assets, and the ongoing innovation in Web3 applications all point towards a future where digital assets play a more central role. While challenges persist, particularly around scalability and global regulatory harmonization, the momentum is clearly building. Coinbase, as a regulated and publicly traded entity, is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these trends, potentially solidifying its role as a bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized future. Coinbase stock’s phenomenal ascent in June, culminating in its position as the S&P 500’s top performer, marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. This remarkable rally, fueled by a confluence of positive crypto market trends and increasing institutional confidence, underscores the growing maturity and mainstream acceptance of digital assets. While the path forward will undoubtedly have its own set of challenges, Coinbase’s recent success provides a compelling testament to the enduring potential of the digital economy and its key players. It’s a clear signal that cryptocurrencies are no longer on the fringe but are increasingly becoming an integral part of the global financial dialogue.

It’s bringing in $186 million a year, which is even more than BlackRock’s popular S&P 500 ETF (IVV), which makes $183 million. This shows how much interest there is in Bitcoin , especially through safe and regulated investment options like ETFs. IBIT only launched earlier this year, but it was a massive success right from the start. It broke records for how fast money flowed into it, making it the most successful ETF launch in history. Even when the market slowed down a bit in May and Bitcoin’s price didn’t move much, investors kept pouring money into IBIT. It has become one of the top ways big investors get exposure to Bitcoin. From Explosive to Stable—IBIT’s Shrinking Volatility IBIT’s strong earnings come with a notable shift in its market behavior. Once highly volatile, the ETF now moves almost in sync with BlackRock’s S&P 500 ETF (IVV). Analyst Nate Geraci highlighted that BlackRock’s IBIT has become its top-performing ETF in terms of trading fee revenue. iShares Bitcoin ETF now generates more fee revenue for BlackRock than its largest ETF, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF… IBIT annual revenue = $186mil IVV annual revenue = $183mil IBIT w/ nearly $75bil AUM at 25bps. IVV $609bil at 3bps. Only took 18 months. h/t @bespokeinvest — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) June 27, 2025 A year ago, it was over five times more volatile. Analyst Eric Balchunas points out this isn’t unique to IBIT. Since spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved, Bitcoin itself has become more stable. Large institutional inflows are softening the sharp price swings that once defined the crypto market . [post_titles_links postid=”476117″] Concerns Over Bitcoin’s Institutional Shift This unusual stability in Bitcoin prices has raised concerns. As IBIT takes over a larger share of Bitcoin demand, some experts fear that Bitcoin’s wild, independent price swings could be fading. Even with major events like the halving, economic uncertainty, and political pressure, Bitcoin has held steady above its ETF approval levels. Will IBIT Keep Dominating? BlackRock’s strong push into Bitcoin is paying off, at least financially. IBIT now leads in both investor activity and revenue generation. However, the broader impact on Bitcoin’s market character remains uncertain, as the rise of regulated institutional products continues to reshape the landscape of crypto investing.

The legal dispute dates back to December 2020, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple Labs, co-founder Chris Larsen, and Garlinghouse. The SEC accused Ripple of raising $1.3 billion through unregistered securities sales of XRP. Garlinghouse had previously described the $125 million fine imposed in August 2024 as a ""victory,"" emphasizing that it was a 94% reduction from the $2 billion the SEC had initially requested. If the SEC ultimately abandons its appeal, it will mark the official end of a four-year conflict that has affected the regulatory landscape of crypto assets in the United States. Although the XRP price surge was short-lived, XY Mining cloud mining continues to provide crypto investors with $3,000 daily returns What is Cloud Mining? Cloud mining refers to remote mining.

A significant development in Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has ignited fresh speculation about the imminent approval of a spot XRP ETF . Could this be the pivotal moment the digital asset community has been waiting for? Understanding the Latest Turn: Ripple’s Strategic Decision The recent announcement from Nate Geraci, the respected President of the U.S.-based wealth management firm The ETF Store, has sent ripples of excitement through the market. Geraci, known for his insights into the ETF landscape, revealed on X that Ripple is strategically ending its cross-appeal in the protracted legal dispute with the SEC. This isn’t just a minor procedural step; it’s a move that could profoundly impact the regulatory trajectory for XRP and, by extension, the broader crypto market. For context, the legal tussle between Ripple and the SEC has been a defining narrative for XRP over the past few years. The SEC initially accused Ripple of conducting an unregistered securities offering through its sale of XRP. While Ripple secured partial victories, particularly regarding programmatic sales not being deemed securities, certain aspects of institutional sales remained under scrutiny. The cross-appeal was Ripple’s response to parts of the court’s ruling, seeking further clarity or a different outcome. What Does Dropping the Cross-Appeal Mean for an XRP ETF ? Ripple’s decision to drop its cross-appeal is widely interpreted as a signal of confidence in the current legal standing or a strategic move to clear regulatory hurdles. By doing so, Ripple effectively streamlines the legal process, potentially removing a major obstacle that could have deterred traditional financial institutions from pursuing an XRP ETF . Reduced Legal Uncertainty: A lingering appeal adds a layer of regulatory risk that major financial players, like BlackRock, are typically hesitant to navigate. Removing this uncertainty makes XRP a more attractive underlying asset for an ETF. Clearer Regulatory Path: With less legal ambiguity, the path for the SEC to consider and potentially approve a spot XRP ETF becomes clearer. The SEC has historically cited ongoing legal disputes as reasons for delaying or rejecting crypto ETF applications. Market Maturation: This move suggests a maturation of the XRP market and its legal framework, making it more palatable for mainstream financial products. The Significance of a Spot XRP ETF The concept of a spot ETF for cryptocurrencies gained significant traction following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. A spot ETF allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of the underlying asset (in this case, XRP) without directly owning or storing the cryptocurrency. This offers several compelling advantages: Benefits for Investors and the Ecosystem: Benefit Explanation Accessibility Opens XRP investment to a broader range of traditional investors, including those in retirement accounts and brokerage platforms, who might be hesitant to navigate crypto exchanges. Liquidity Increased institutional investment can significantly boost XRP’s market liquidity, potentially leading to more stable price discovery. Regulatory Clarity An SEC-approved ETF would confer a significant level of legitimacy and regulatory acceptance on XRP, distinguishing it further from other digital assets. Security & Custody Investors don’t need to worry about self-custody or the security risks associated with holding cryptocurrencies directly; the ETF provider handles it. The potential for a spot XRP ETF is not just about convenience; it’s about integration into the traditional financial system. This integration is crucial for the long-term growth and adoption of any digital asset. The Role of Key Players: Nate Geraci and BlackRock Nate Geraci’s commentary carries significant weight within the ETF industry. As the President of The ETF Store, his insights are closely watched by both institutional and retail investors. His statement, “Also Ripple is way for BlackRock to jump in,” hints at the immense potential for institutional interest. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has already made a monumental impact on the crypto space with its highly successful spot Bitcoin ETF. Their involvement signals serious institutional validation and typically leads to significant capital inflows. If BlackRock or other major players like Fidelity, Grayscale, or ARK Invest were to file for an XRP ETF, it would be a game-changer for the asset. Their rigorous due diligence and compliance standards would lend immense credibility to XRP as an investable asset class. Could the SEC Lawsuit Finally Conclude? The original content mentions a previous attempt at settlement where the SEC proposed lowering the financial penalty to $50 million and requested the removal of the injunction on Ripple’s institutional XRP sales. However, the court rejected this joint effort. This highlights the complexities and the court’s desire for a definitive resolution rather than a partial settlement. Ripple’s decision to drop the cross-appeal suggests a shift in strategy towards a more conclusive end to the legal saga. While the lawsuit’s final chapters are still being written, this move significantly reduces the legal overhead and potential for further protracted litigation, paving a clearer path for regulatory clarity and, ultimately, an XRP ETF . Challenges and Remaining Hurdles for an XRP ETF While optimism abounds, it’s important to acknowledge that the path to a spot XRP ETF is not entirely clear of obstacles. The SEC’s stance on crypto assets remains cautious, and each application is scrutinized individually. Market Manipulation Concerns: The SEC’s primary concern for rejecting spot crypto ETFs in the past has been the potential for market manipulation in the underlying spot markets. Applicants will need to demonstrate robust surveillance-sharing agreements. Regulatory Nuances: Despite Ripple’s partial legal victory, the SEC could still argue that XRP, under certain circumstances, behaves like a security. This ongoing debate, though diminished, could still influence their decision. First-Mover Advantage: While there’s a strong case for XRP, the SEC might prefer to observe the performance and regulatory implications of existing spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs before expanding to other altcoins. However, the current sentiment, fueled by Ripple’s strategic legal move and the increasing institutional appetite for crypto exposure, suggests these hurdles are becoming less insurmountable. Actionable Insights for Investors For those considering XRP as an investment, the potential for an ETF introduces new dynamics: Stay Informed: Closely monitor official announcements from Ripple, the SEC, and major asset managers regarding ETF filings and legal proceedings. Understand the Risks: While an ETF can legitimize an asset, cryptocurrency markets remain volatile. Do not invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider Diversification: Even with an XRP ETF, a diversified portfolio across various asset classes remains a prudent strategy. Evaluate Your Investment Horizon: ETF approvals can be catalysts for price action, but long-term value is driven by utility and adoption. A Compelling Future for XRP? The dropping of Ripple’s cross-appeal is a monumental step that could redefine XRP’s position in the financial landscape. Nate Geraci’s foresight regarding a potential BlackRock involvement further solidifies the bullish outlook for a spot XRP ETF . While regulatory scrutiny remains, the momentum is clearly shifting towards greater acceptance and integration of digital assets into traditional financial products. This strategic move by Ripple not only signals confidence in its legal standing but also proactively clears the runway for institutional adoption, potentially unlocking a new era of growth and stability for XRP.

With all 15 presale stages completed and the Bonus Round now live, the project is steadily gaining traction where it counts—among those who act before the hype hits. Lightchain AI’s architecture, built around a purpose-driven AI virtual machine and a consensus model that rewards real computation, is resonating with forward-looking traders and builders. As the July 2025 mainnet launch approaches, Lightchain AI isn’t just a topic—it’s becoming the quiet frontrunner in smart money conversations. Solana and Ethereum Dominate Public Market Headlines Solana versus Ethereum are the two chains leading the charge in the public markets with separate strategies. Ethereum is still the most popular decentralized application platform in the world, with more than 8,800 active development projects and a thriving ecosystem for DeFi (decentralized finance) apps, NFTs, smart contracts and more. Its new Pectra upgrade launches with the goal of increased scalability and decreasing transaction costs, strengthening its current place as a building block of the crypto ecosystem. In contrast, Solana’s high throughput and low fees have propelled it to the forefront and into the sights of traditional financiers. Recent developments include a partnership between the Solana Foundation and R3 to allow major banks like HSBC and Bank of America to utilize Solana’s blockchain to tokenize assets, which offers sign of a public blockchain allowance in finance. Moreover, Solana’s presence in the decentralized exchange (DEX) trading sector is felt significantly with it contributing 52% of all on-chain trades in January 2025, it speaks not only to its growing weight in the cryptosphere as well. Ethereum’s mature infrastructure and developer network makes a powerful base line, but with Solana’s rapid adoption and transaction scalability, fifty meters down that street is a contender to reckon with on the change landscape. Lightchain AI Builds Momentum Behind the Scenes With Key Buyers Lightchain AI is building strong momentum behind the scenes as key buyers quietly accumulate during its fixed-price Bonus Round at $0.007. Unlike hype-driven projects, Lightchain’s appeal lies in its robust foundation. Its governance integration empowers token holders to vote on major protocol decisions, ensuring a decentralized, community-led trajectory. Technically, the platform delivers low-latency AI task execution through its parallelized architecture—an essential feature for real-time dApps and intelligent automation. Adding to the excitement is the upcoming Memecoin Launchpad, which provides developers with native tools, grant support, and liquidity incentives to launch meme-based tokens on a secure, scalable framework. As these components come together, informed buyers are moving early—recognizing that Lightchain AI is quietly positioning itself as a leading Layer 1 with staying power. Quiet Storm Rising—Lightchain AI Gains Strength Where It Matters Most A quiet revolution is brewing as Lightchain AI gains traction where it truly matters—among builders and serious traders. In a bold, community-first move after Stage 15, the full 5% Team Allocation was reallocated to fuel development grants, ecosystem incentives, and protocol growth. This decision has not only driven innovation but also deepened community trust. With GitHub repositories set to go public at mainnet launch, Lightchain AI is proving its dedication to transparency, cutting-edge infrastructure, and real-world AI integration. This isn’t just hype—it’s real momentum built on substance.

POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction June 2025 $0.17 $0.28 $0.35 POL price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $0.15. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

This week’s most notable news is that World (formerly known as Worldcoin) has taken a significant step toward the future of digital identity by announcing the launch of its program “Build LATAM” throughout Latin America, beginning with Mexico. Venezuela, on the other hand, has arrested Alejandro Antonio Blanco Gamez, 59, in Monagas for his alleged involvement in a cryptocurrency fraud scheme tied to the platform HV IJEX. World boosting innovation with identity tech World, formerly known as Worldcoin, has officially begun its Build LATAM campaign in Latin America, beginning with Mexico. This program seeks to develop the decentralised technology ecosystem by concentrating on human verification and digital identification solutions. The world will support 15 businesses with a fund of 1 million WLD tokens, providing mentorship, enhanced tools, and access to a worldwide network of innovators. The World’s footprint in Latin America expands in tandem with the demand for secure and decentralised identity verification. Build LATAM provides companies in the region with not only financial support but also valuable exposure to global markets. Despite the dip in WLD token value, the long-term aim remains strong: create a universal digital identification standard based on blockchain technology. Crypto scam uncovered in Monagas, Venezuela The Venezuelan investigative body CICPC arrested Alejandro Antonio Blanco Gamez , 59, in Monagas for his involvement in a cryptocurrency fraud operation linked to the website HV IJEX. According to director Douglas Rico, the arrest was made by intelligence officers and the local delegation. Blanco is accused of using social media and local relationships to entice victims into investing modest sums with promises of quick and big profits, only to discontinue all contact after receiving the money. The authorities seized phones, computers, cameras, and branded HV IJEX clothing, which will be used as evidence in the case before the Public Ministry. HV IJEX allegedly functioned as a Ponzi scheme, promising 20% monthly returns with capital doubling in less than 40 days. Victims were recruited through personal encounters and messaging services such as WhatsApp and Telegram. The Venezuelan Attorney General’s Office is now widening its inquiry to include comparable platforms in the area.

Crypto ATMs enabling shoppers to swap coins for Bitcoin, beauty salons accepting digital assets at a discount, and Binance accounts getting you meals. Bolivia is facing one of its most serious economic crises in decades. Dollar reserves in the country are nearly depleted. The result is the highest inflation in 40 years. According to a Reuters story, the city is congested with gas station lines due to a lack of fuel. The official exchange rate is more detached from reality, with the boliviano losing half of its value on the illegal market this year alone.

Despite this impressive recovery, ETH still sits roughly 98% below its all-time highs, leaving significant room for growth if bullish momentum accelerates. Market sentiment is shifting, with many analysts and investors eyeing Ethereum as the leading candidate to spark the long-awaited altseason. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forms 4-Year Inverse H&S Pattern – Neckline Break Could Send It Parabolic Top analyst Ted Pillows recently shared a technical view suggesting that Ethereum has once again retested its lower channel — a pattern that has historically preceded explosive rallies in previous market cycles. In both 2017 and 2021, this same setup led to massive gains, and some believe this cycle could be no different. With macro conditions still uncertain but risk appetite growing across crypto markets, Ethereum’s price action is being closely watched. If the pattern holds, ETH could be on the verge of a powerful breakout that pulls the broader altcoin market along with it. Whether this becomes a historic launchpad or another consolidation phase remains to be seen, but for now, Ethereum is clearly at the center of attention. Ethereum Holds Key Support As Historic Pattern Signals Bullish Potential Ethereum is trading at a crucial technical level after reclaiming the $2,400 mark, where bulls and bears are locked in a tug-of-war. Buyers have managed to defend the key support zone, but upward momentum remains muted as broader market sentiment remains cautious. Geopolitical tensions and tightening macroeconomic conditions continue to shape risk appetite, making many investors hesitant to fully commit to high-beta assets like Ethereum. Still, the long-term setup is attracting attention from seasoned analysts. Pillows points to a recurring historical pattern that could define Ethereum’s trajectory in the coming months. According to his analysis, ETH has retested its lower trend channel once in each major market cycle, and each retest has preceded extraordinary rallies. In 2017, Ethereum surged 300x from this setup. In 2021, it delivered a 50x return. If history even partially repeats itself, a conservative 6x move would send ETH above the $10,000 mark. The setup is technically sound and aligns with the broader sentiment that Ethereum could lead the next altcoin rally, especially if Bitcoin breaks into price discovery. While uncertainty remains, ETH’s current position is a pivotal zone. If bulls manage to maintain structure and push toward range highs, the conditions for a breakout may soon align. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Record High: 29.02% Of Supply Locked Signals Long-Term Conviction ETH Holds $2,400 Level But Faces Resistance Ethereum is consolidating around $2,422 after reclaiming the $2,400 support zone, but the chart shows that bulls face significant resistance just above current levels. On the 12-hour timeframe, ETH has struggled to break above the 50- and 100-period simple moving averages, currently sitting at $2,518 and $2,536, respectively. This cluster of resistance has capped every recent attempt to move higher, reinforcing it as a short-term barrier that bulls must overcome to regain momentum. ETH’s failed breakdown below $2,200 earlier this week now looks like a bear trap, as buyers stepped in aggressively to reclaim lost ground. Still, without a decisive break above $2,530, Ethereum remains vulnerable to another retest of the $2,300–$2,200 support zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Fakes Out Bears – Altcoin Rally Depends On Key Level Breakout The 200-period SMA near $2,160 remains a key downside level to watch — if price fails to hold above it on future dips, bears could regain control. For now, Ethereum appears to be range-bound, caught between macro uncertainty and bullish hopes for an altseason. A breakout above $2,550 would confirm renewed strength and open the door for a push toward $2,800.

After a period of fluctuating sentiment, these investment vehicles have just delivered a powerful signal to the market: a significant resurgence in investor interest. On June 27, these innovative financial products collectively attracted a remarkable $77.5 million in net inflows, marking a strong reversal from the previous day’s outflows and injecting a fresh wave of optimism into the digital asset space. What’s Fueling This Renewed Interest in Spot Ethereum ETFs? The latest data from Farside Investor paints a compelling picture of a shift in market dynamics. The $77.5 million in combined net inflows on June 27 for U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs demonstrates a clear return of capital and confidence after a brief dip. This substantial figure isn’t just a number; it represents a tangible commitment from investors, both institutional and retail, who are increasingly comfortable with the regulatory framework and the long-term potential of Ethereum as an asset class. Breaking down the inflows, it’s evident that some key players are leading the charge: BlackRock ETHA : Leading the pack, BlackRock’s ETHA fund saw a robust $48.1 million in inflows. This significant contribution from one of the world’s largest asset managers underscores the growing institutional embrace of cryptocurrency investments. Fidelity FETH : Not far behind, Fidelity’s FETH garnered an impressive $28.9 million. Fidelity’s strong performance further solidifies the trend of major financial institutions entering and expanding their presence in the crypto ETF market. 21Shares CETH : Adding to the positive momentum, 21Shares’ CETH recorded a modest but important $0.5 million. While smaller, it still contributes to the overall positive sentiment across the ETF ecosystem. The fact that the remaining ETFs reported no change in holdings for the day suggests a concentrated flow into these specific, well-recognized funds, indicating a preference for established and trusted issuers. Understanding the Significance of ETH Inflows Why are these ETH inflows so important? For one, they provide a real-time gauge of investor sentiment. When money flows into an asset, it signals demand, belief in its future value, and a willingness to take on exposure. In the context of Ethereum, which is undergoing significant technological upgrades and continues to be the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, consistent inflows through ETFs can provide crucial price support and stability. Moreover, the approval and launch of Crypto ETFs , particularly those tracking spot prices, represent a maturation of the digital asset market. They offer traditional investors a regulated, accessible, and familiar pathway to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the underlying assets. This bridging of traditional finance with the crypto world is a monumental step towards broader adoption and integration. The Role of Institutional Giants: BlackRock ETHA and Fidelity FETH The prominent roles played by BlackRock ETHA and Fidelity FETH cannot be overstated. These firms bring immense credibility, vast distribution networks, and sophisticated risk management frameworks to the crypto space. Their active participation, especially in leading the inflow charts, sends a powerful message to the wider investment community that Ethereum is a legitimate and viable investment. Their involvement often de-risks the asset in the eyes of more conservative investors, potentially paving the way for even larger capital allocations in the future. The competition between these major players also benefits the market by fostering innovation and potentially driving down fees, making these investment vehicles even more attractive to a diverse range of investors. What’s Next for Crypto ETFs and Ethereum? The positive inflow trend for Crypto ETFs , particularly those focused on Ethereum, suggests a growing appetite for diversified exposure to digital assets. While market volatility remains a constant factor in the crypto space, the increasing institutional participation through ETFs can help absorb some of the shocks and contribute to more stable growth patterns over time. For Ethereum specifically, these inflows could translate into: Increased Liquidity: More capital flowing into the market can enhance liquidity, making it easier for large trades to occur without significant price impact. Price Support: Consistent buying pressure from ETFs can act as a floor for Ethereum’s price, potentially reducing downward volatility. Mainstream Adoption: As more traditional investors gain exposure to ETH via ETFs, it deepens the asset’s integration into the mainstream financial ecosystem. However, it’s crucial for investors to remain vigilant. The crypto market is still relatively young and subject to regulatory changes, technological advancements, and macroeconomic shifts. While the recent inflows are a positive sign, they are part of a larger, ongoing narrative. Actionable Insights for Investors For those considering exposure to Ethereum or already invested, these inflows offer several insights: Monitor ETF Performance: Keep an eye on the daily inflow/outflow data for various Spot Ethereum ETFs. This can provide real-time indicators of market sentiment. Understand the Underlying Asset: While ETFs offer convenience, a basic understanding of Ethereum’s technology, use cases, and development roadmap is crucial for informed decision-making. Consider Diversification: As with any investment, diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Stay Informed: The crypto landscape evolves rapidly. Regularly consume news and analysis from reputable sources to stay ahead. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Ethereum Investment The $77.5 million in net inflows into U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs on June 27 marks a significant and encouraging development for the entire cryptocurrency market. Led by the impressive contributions from BlackRock ETHA and Fidelity FETH , these figures underscore a renewed investor confidence and the increasing maturity of digital asset investment vehicles. As ETH inflows continue to demonstrate the growing institutional appetite for this innovative asset, the future looks brighter for Ethereum’s integration into mainstream finance. This positive momentum for Crypto ETFs is not just a win for Ethereum, but a testament to the evolving landscape of global investment.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. In a recent feat, Solana has signed an MoU with Kazakhstan to launch Central Asia’s first Solana Economic Zone. Talking about numbers, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 49.97% from its ATH of $ 294.33. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Will Solana Go Back Up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our latest Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030. We’ll address these queries using our analyses, market sentiments, and regular updates from the crypto world.

With RSI at 48.76 and price trading below the 20-day SMA at $148.56, SOL shows consolidation signs. The Bollinger Bands indicate a potential range, with the lower bound at $132, suggesting a potential low of $130. If bulls reclaim the 20-day SMA, the average price may hover around $150, and in a bullish breakout, the potential high could reach $165. Overall, price action remains range-bound barring major volume inflows. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $130 $150 $165 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.14 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $460M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

Max Keiser Predicted $1M Bitcoin in 2010 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News When Bitcoin was worth just cents and barely on anyone’s radar, Max Keiser made a bold call: it could hit $1 million someday. Now, in 2025, with Bitcoin trading around $107,383 , that early prediction is making headlines again especially since Keiser made it back when Satoshi Nakamoto was still active. And of course is was on “Keiser Report” Stacy first mentioned Bitcoin in 2010 at $0.30 We were the first to mention Bitcoin on international TV and we were the only ones covering Bitcoin for years. Here’s one of the hundreds of classic, “Keiser Report” Bitcoin clips. https://t.co/y998XVPuFC — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) June 28, 2025 Bitcoin at $0.30: The Keiser Report’s Early Belief in Crypto Keiser and his wife, Stacy Herbert, were among the first to talk about Bitcoin on TV. Their show The Keiser Report , which aired on BBC and RT, started covering Bitcoin in 2010 – when BTC was just $0.30. In a 2013 episode recently shared by Bitcoin historian Pete Rizzo, Keiser called Bitcoin “the currency of the resistance” and “the seed of revolution.” He believed it could help struggling nations like Greece, which was hit hard after the 2008 financial crisis, build independent economies, free from the control of “kleptocrats” in the U.S. and U.K. Back then, Bitcoin had just reached $200. Keiser predicted it would climb to $1,000, $5,000, $10,000 and possibly as high as $100,000 to $1 million , if it captured even a small share of the global forex market.

Earlier today, Whale Alert reported a massive transaction: 7,999 BTC, worth around $858 million, was bought on Coinbase and moved to an unknown wallet, likely for cold storage. Moves like this show Bitcoin’s growing role as a store of value, echoing Keiser’s early belief in its long-term potential. 7,999 #BTC (858,017,366 USD) transferred from #Coinbase to unknown new wallet https://t.co/0vcYEWQ4u1 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) June 27, 2025 Bitcoin’s Global Impact Keiser’s impact reaches El Salvador, where Bitcoin is recognized as legal tender under Bukele’s governance. With the rise in institutional adoption , Keiser’s prediction of $1 million seems increasingly like a goal rather than a fantasy. With the ‘Keiser Report’ still supporting cryptocurrency, Keiser and Herbert’s Satoshi-era vision is still inspiring and shows how Bitcoin might be a significant player in world finance.

This shows that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is now seeing more action than its flagship stock market ETF. IBIT also recently became the fastest ETF ever to hit $70 billion AUM , in just 341 days. It crushed the previous record set by SPDR Gold Shares, which took nearly 5 times longer. Eric Balchunas says IBIT could even surpass Satoshi in size by next summer. IBIT has jumped from 47th to 4th place in U.S. ETF inflows for 2025. In just three months, it’s surged past big names like SPLG and is now catching up to giants like Vanguard’s VT and iShares SGOV. IBIT’s Growth Slows as Volatility Drops Despite IBIT’s lead in fee revenue, analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out that IBIT’s volatility has dropped to nearly the same level as IVV. Just a year ago, it was 5.7 times more volatile, which helped fuel its explosive growth. But it is now losing its edge as it is barely over 1. As Bitcoin and its ETFs grow more stable, experts worry that massive ETF inflows are altering BTC’s natural market cycles. On Friday, Bitcoin ETFs saw over $500 million in net inflows.

But where is Polkadot now? Crypto trader and analyst Nonzee (@0xNonceSense) just dropped a thread on X that’s making waves. It’s a 13-point postmortem on why Polkadot is fading fast. “Polkadot is dead. Raised $500M. Promised a revolution. Now? No users. No devs. No future.” Harsh? Yes. But the thread dives deep into how one of the biggest names in crypto lost momentum and why even brilliant tech doesn’t always survive. Join us as we break it down. It Started With Massive Hype Back in 2017, Polkadot raised $144M in its ICO in minutes. Another $43M came through later rounds. By 2021, it looked unstoppable. DOT hit $55. Its market cap pushed $50 billion. Everyone was calling it the next big thing, in fact it was called the Ethereum killer. And with parachains, shared security, and advanced design, it looked like the future of Web3. But Users Never Came Despite the tech, Polkadot struggled to get real users. “No killer app, no sticky users,” Nonzee wrote. Parachains launched, but none took off. The network stayed empty. By 2025, total daily users across all chains had dropped below 5,000. Developers Left Too Building on Polkadot wasn’t easy. It used Rust and Substrate – powerful tools, but hard to learn. Compared to Ethereum’s dev-friendly ecosystem, it felt like work. Devs slowly moved on. In 2022, Polkadot had around 2,400 active devs. By 2024, that number had nearly halved. Parachain Auctions Backfired Locking DOT for two years to win a parachain slot? It sounded innovative but it drained momentum and locked up capital. Projects slowed down. Users pulled back. It was too complex to keep up energy and growth. Governance Got Messy Polkadot had a bold vision for on-chain governance. But according to Nonzee, it ended up controlled by whales. In 2024 alone, over $129M from the treasury was spent with little to show. Voter turnout dropped. So did trust. Tech Upgrades Came But No One Noticed Polkadot 2.0 launched with big improvements: faster consensus, agile scheduling, better scalability. But it was too late. “It was fast. Scalable. Efficient. But the world had already moved on.” What’s Left Today? The architecture still works. Shared security. Interchain messaging. It’s all still there but barely anyone’s using it. DOT trades under $5. Most of the hype is gone. As Nonzee puts it: “Polkadot proves tech doesn’t equal traction.” A tough truth in crypto: building great systems isn’t enough. Without users, narrative, and momentum – even the best chains may not survive.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|DOT|ETH|MARKET|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-28 11:07:26

A significant development is currently making waves, signaling robust investor confidence in the future of decentralized technology. We are witnessing a pivotal moment for the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network, or DePIN, sector, as a key player announces substantial financial backing. This is not just about money; it’s about validating a vision for a more distributed, efficient, and accessible digital future. Let’s dive into the details of how DePIN project dKloud has successfully secured a vital funding round, setting the stage for its ambitious plans to bridge the gap between traditional enterprise applications and the cutting-edge world of cryptocurrencies. The dKloud Funding Breakthrough: What Does $3.15 Million Mean? The cryptocurrency space is no stranger to large funding rounds, but when a project like dKloud, focused on tangible infrastructure, garners significant investment, it highlights a maturing market. According to Odaily, the dKloud funding round successfully raised $3.15 million. This isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to the potential investors see in dKloud’s unique approach to decentralized infrastructure. The capital injection comes from a notable roster of participants, including industry giants and strategic blockchain entities: Animoca Ventures: Known for its extensive portfolio in blockchain gaming and metaverse, their involvement signals a belief in DePIN’s foundational role in the broader Web3 ecosystem. Blizzard Fund: A fund associated with Avalanche, indicating support from a major layer-1 blockchain. This suggests potential synergies and a recognition of DePIN’s scalability needs. The Telos Foundation: A key player in the Telos blockchain, emphasizing the importance of high-performance and scalable infrastructure for decentralized applications. TPS Capital: Their participation underscores the broader venture capital interest in innovative Web3 solutions that promise real-world utility. And others: The collective strength of these investors provides dKloud with not just capital, but also invaluable industry connections, expertise, and strategic guidance. This funding is earmarked for a crucial objective: developing a deployment solution for enterprise applications that seamlessly integrates both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. This hybrid approach is a game-changer, addressing a significant hurdle for mainstream enterprise adoption of blockchain technology. Understanding Decentralized Infrastructure: Why Is It So Important? At its core, dKloud is building a piece of the puzzle that makes up decentralized infrastructure . But what exactly is that, and why should you care? Imagine a world where the digital services you use – from cloud storage to computing power – aren’t reliant on a few massive, centralized data centers owned by tech giants. Instead, these services are powered by a global network of independent participants, pooling their resources. That’s the promise of decentralized infrastructure. Here’s a quick breakdown of its advantages: Resilience and Redundancy: No single point of failure. If one node goes down, the network continues to function. Cost Efficiency: By leveraging idle resources globally, decentralized networks can often offer services at a lower cost than traditional providers. Censorship Resistance: Without a central authority, it’s much harder for any single entity to control or shut down services. Data Sovereignty: Users and enterprises have greater control over their data, rather than entrusting it entirely to third parties. Economic Incentives: Participants are often rewarded with tokens for contributing resources, creating a robust, self-sustaining ecosystem. dKloud’s work in this domain is particularly exciting because it aims to make this powerful, distributed infrastructure accessible and usable for established businesses, bridging the gap between nascent Web3 technologies and the demanding requirements of enterprise-grade applications. Driving Web3 Enterprise Solutions: Bridging Crypto and Fiat The vision of Web3 is expansive, but its practical application for traditional businesses has often been hampered by complexities, especially regarding payments and financial integration. This is where dKloud’s focus on developing a deployment solution for Web3 enterprise solutions , supporting both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, becomes incredibly significant. For businesses, the transition to blockchain-based systems needs to be smooth, secure, and compliant with existing financial regulations. Consider the typical enterprise: Existing Financial Systems: Most businesses operate primarily with fiat currencies (USD, EUR, etc.) and traditional banking infrastructure. Regulatory Compliance: Strict rules govern how businesses handle money, process transactions, and report finances. User Familiarity: Employees and customers are accustomed to fiat-based transactions. Volatility Concerns: The price volatility of many cryptocurrencies can be a deterrent for business operations and accounting. dKloud’s solution aims to provide a flexible framework that allows enterprises to leverage the benefits of decentralized networks (like enhanced security, transparency, and efficiency) while still operating within their familiar financial paradigms. This could involve: Hybrid payment gateways that accept both crypto and fiat. Stablecoin integration for business transactions to mitigate volatility. Automated conversion mechanisms between crypto and fiat at the point of transaction or settlement. Compliance tools built into the deployment solution to meet regulatory requirements. By addressing this critical integration challenge, dKloud is paving the way for a broader spectrum of businesses to adopt decentralized technologies, from supply chain management and data storage to content delivery and AI processing. The Broader Landscape of Blockchain Funding: A Vote of Confidence In a period where the overall cryptocurrency market has experienced its share of volatility, the substantial blockchain funding secured by dKloud is a powerful signal. It demonstrates that despite market fluctuations, venture capitalists and strategic investors continue to see immense long-term value in foundational Web3 technologies. While some sectors of crypto might be experiencing a ‘crypto winter’, the infrastructure layer – particularly DePIN – is attracting significant capital. This trend suggests a shift in investor focus from speculative assets to projects with tangible utility and clear business models. Investors are looking for: Real-World Application: Projects that solve actual problems beyond just financial speculation. Scalability: Solutions that can handle large volumes of users and data. Sustainability: Projects with robust tokenomics and long-term viability. Strong Teams: Experienced teams capable of executing complex technical roadmaps. dKloud’s success in attracting this level of funding validates the growing belief that decentralized physical infrastructure is not just a niche concept but a fundamental building block for the next iteration of the internet. It’s a vote of confidence in the sector’s ability to deliver on its promises of efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and enhanced security. Why DePIN Projects are Gaining Tremendous Traction The term DePIN projects has become a buzzword in the Web3 space, and for good reason. These projects represent a paradigm shift in how we build and manage physical infrastructure. Instead of relying on centralized corporations to deploy and maintain everything from cell towers to data centers, DePIN leverages blockchain technology and token incentives to decentralize these efforts. Here’s why DePIN is gaining such tremendous traction: Democratization of Infrastructure: Anyone can contribute resources (e.g., storage, compute power, wireless connectivity) and earn rewards, democratizing access to and ownership of infrastructure. Cost Reduction: By pooling distributed resources and eliminating centralized overheads, DePIN can significantly reduce the cost of services. Enhanced Security and Privacy: Decentralized networks are inherently more resistant to single points of failure and attacks, and can offer stronger privacy guarantees. Community Ownership and Governance: Token holders often have a say in the development and direction of the network, fostering a strong, engaged community. Scalability and Global Reach: Networks can scale organically by adding more contributors globally, reaching areas underserved by traditional infrastructure. Examples of DePIN applications span various sectors: Decentralized Storage: Filecoin, Arweave (competing with centralized cloud storage like AWS S3). Decentralized Compute: Render Network, Akash Network (offering distributed computing power). Decentralized Wireless: Helium (building community-owned wireless networks). Energy Grids: Projects aiming to decentralize energy distribution and trading. dKloud fits squarely into this exciting category, focusing on the critical area of enterprise application deployment, a segment ripe for decentralization and innovation. Challenges and the Road Ahead for DePIN While the future for dKloud and the broader DePIN sector looks promising, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges that lie ahead. No revolutionary technology comes without its hurdles. For DePIN projects, these often include: Technical Complexity: Building robust, scalable, and secure decentralized physical infrastructure is incredibly complex, requiring sophisticated engineering. Adoption Barriers: Educating potential users and enterprises about the benefits of DePIN, and overcoming inertia from established systems, can be difficult. User experience (UX) needs to be seamless. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for blockchain and crypto is still evolving, which can create uncertainty for projects dealing with physical assets and real-world services. Incentive Alignment: Designing tokenomics that effectively incentivize participants to contribute high-quality resources over the long term is crucial. Competition: Both from traditional centralized players and other emerging DePIN projects. dKloud’s success will depend on its ability to navigate these challenges, delivering on its promises of a robust, hybrid deployment solution. The $3.15 million funding will undoubtedly provide the resources needed to tackle these issues head-on, focusing on product development, talent acquisition, and market penetration. Actionable Insights for Investors and Builders For those looking to engage with the DePIN sector, dKloud’s funding offers several key takeaways: For Investors: DePIN is a high-growth sector with tangible utility. Look for projects with clear use cases, strong teams, robust technology, and a viable path to enterprise adoption. The involvement of reputable VCs like Animoca Ventures is often a good indicator. For Developers/Builders: The demand for decentralized infrastructure is growing. Focus on creating solutions that solve real-world problems for businesses and consumers, emphasizing ease of use and interoperability. The hybrid crypto-fiat approach is a strong differentiator. For Enterprises: Explore how DePIN solutions can enhance your existing operations. Consider pilot programs for decentralized storage, compute, or network services. dKloud’s focus on enterprise-ready deployment solutions makes it a project to watch closely. The success of projects like dKloud is not just about their individual growth but about validating the entire DePIN narrative, proving that decentralized networks can indeed power the physical world.

Key Takeaways: Gemini has launched tokenized Strategy stock for EU investors. The service promises 24/7 trading, lower fees, and easier access compared to traditional stock markets. Platforms like Robinhood, Kraken, and Coinbase are also moving to offer tokenized US equities. The launch was announced on Friday, with Gemini touting tokenized stocks as a solution to the limitations of traditional equity markets. “Traditional financial rails are hard to access and in need of modernization,” Gemini said in its statement . Tokenized Stocks Offer 24/7 Trading, Lower Fees for Global Investors “Tokenized stocks solve this problem by giving investors greater access with fewer restrictions,” the company added, highlighting benefits like 24/7 trading and reduced fees for international investors. The platform said its onchain trading system lets users hold both crypto and equities seamlessly without switching between different platforms. Gemini is working with US securities provider Dinari to power the tokenization model. The exchange said the service offers investors the same economic rights as the underlying shares where permitted, along with greater liquidity and transparency. While MSTR is the first tokenized stock available on Gemini, the company plans to add more tokenized equities and ETFs in the coming days. Shares of Strategy, a company known for amassing over 200,000 BTC on its balance sheet, have climbed 3.84% over the past month, trading at $383.88 according to Google Finance. Gemini’s move comes as other crypto platforms race to bring tokenized US stocks to European investors. Earlier in May, reports emerged that Robinhood is developing a blockchain network to enable European retail trading of US equities. Kraken announced plans soon after to offer tokenized US stocks to non-US customers. Tokenized stocks have arrived. Our customers in the EU can now buy tokenized Strategy (MSTR) on Gemini and take it anywhere onchain. We are starting with MSTR and will be rolling out more tokenized stocks and ETFs in the coming days. pic.twitter.com/uSJx9NRIok — Gemini (@Gemini) June 27, 2025 Meanwhile, Coinbase is exploring similar services in the US, with chief legal officer Paul Grewal confirming the exchange is seeking approval from the SEC to offer tokenized equities. Industry figures like STOKR CEO Arnab Naskar see the sector’s potential as a “bigger trillion-dollar market,” underscoring the growing enthusiasm for bridging crypto and traditional finance through tokenization. MSTR Has High Chance of Qualifying for S&P 500 Financial analyst Jeff Walton noted this week that MSTR has a high chance of qualifying for the S&P 500 if Bitcoin remains above $95,240 through the end of Q2. Strategy has posted losses in the last three quarters, and with its massive Bitcoin holdings, currently 592,345 BTC, its earnings for Q2 heavily depend on the crypto asset’s fair market value. Strategy adopted new accounting standards (ASU 2023-08) at the start of 2024, allowing unrealized gains and losses on its Bitcoin stash to be reflected in net income. The change significantly impacts its financial statements and S&P 500 eligibility. In May, Walton also said Strategy may one day rise to become the top publicly traded company in the world.

In his statement, Trump said that the move was a “very bad and very dangerous” practice that was instigated by the Biden administration and it still remains a problem in the country. “There is a lot of debanking,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday evening, in response to a question from the media. “Those people are very bad and very dangerous, and they shouldn’t be doing it.” Debanking is an alleged practice where banks deny customers services based on their affiliation with industries like crypto or their political choices. Crypto industry leaders have argued that during the Biden administration, they were denied standard banking services. Conservative public figures, including Donald Trump and his family, have also made similar claims. Donald Trump blames the Biden administration for debanking Speaking about his previous experience under the tenure of former US President Joe Biden, Trump said, “I can tell you, because I’ve been a victim myself because of my politics, that big banks were very nasty to us.” He added that he feels Biden’s people were the major influence in the decision, noting that the banks were always afraid of regulations. The president said he does not blame the big banks for such practices, noting that it was the fault of federal agencies overseeing the industry. “I’ve seen the biggest banker, I can tell you—you see him on television all the time. If a regulator walked into the room, he gets all nervous and crazy,” Trump said. “The regulators control the banks. It’s not the president of the bank. The president of the bank is far less important to a bank than a regulator, and a regulator can put that bank out of business.” Trump was asked whether he intends to sign an executive order targeting debanking. Such an order expected to instruct federal bank regulators, including the Federal Reserve, not to deny services to certain groups or individuals. The Trump administration planned to sign an executive order addressing the issue back in March, however, the plan was shelved, at least temporarily. According to reports, the proposal may be back in action, with a report from the Wall Street Journal noting that officials are discussing the issuance of an executive order that will focus on addressing debanking. When asked about such plans, the president did not confirm them, but he did say that the problem of debanking persists in the United States, even since he was sworn in for his second term. Since Trump’s inauguration, federal banking agencies under his control have released documents appearing to confirm the existence of previous orders from the same regulators discouraging member banks from offering crypto services. “The documents that we are releasing today show that requests from these banks were almost universally met with resistance,” Travis Hill, the acting chairman of the FDIC at the time said. “These and other actions sent the message to banks that it would be extraordinarily difficult—if not impossible—to move forward,” he added. In one letter, an FDIC appointee mentioned that a bank’s board of directors had closed all the deposit accounts belonging to an entity. While the firm in question was not specifically mentioned, it was referred to as an entity with crypto affiliation. The letter also asked for additional information on the bank’s internal authorization to engage with up to three additional crypto firms. The documents were released shortly before Senate lawmakers began a scheduled hearing on debanking.

33767162,[object Object],1751109621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Best Altcoins Wall Street Might Chase After BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Breakout,https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-wall-street-might-chase-after-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-breakout/,"BlackRock just made headlines by flipping the script: its spot Bitcoin ETF, iBIT, is now generating more fee revenue than its own S&P 500 ETF, IVV. That’s a major milestone – and a wake-up call. When the world’s biggest asset manager starts earning more from Bitcoin than from traditional stocks, you know the tide is turning. The crypto space isn’t just surviving the bear market anymore. It’s evolving, maturing, and starting to win over serious money. And while Bitcoin might be leading the charge, it’s unlikely to stay alone at the top. As institutional interest expands, the best altcoins with real potential could be next in line. Institutions Are Warming Up to Crypto – Fast In a development few could have predicted a year ago, BlackRock’s iBIT ETF is now generating $186M in annual fees – surpassing the $183M earned by its S&P 500 ETF, IVV. That’s not just a win for Bitcoin – it’s a bold signal that institutional interest in crypto is growing rapidly and with conviction. With billions in capital at stake, traditional finance is no longer ignoring digital assets. This shift suggests a structural change in how institutions view crypto – no longer as a fringe speculation, but as a legitimate, fee-generating investment class. As Bitcoin becomes normalized on Wall Street, the door opens for altcoins to follow. New crypto projects that show promise, utility, and strong community backing may soon attract serious attention from the same institutional investors who once wouldn’t touch crypto at all. Wall Street’s appetite is growing, and the smart money is looking for what’s next after Bitcoin. 1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – The DeFi Gateway Wall Street Didn’t Know It Needed Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the powerhouse utility token behind Best Wallet , a next-gen DeFi platform redefining what a crypto wallet can be. Designed to challenge outdated giants like MetaMask, Best Wallet is gaining serious traction thanks to advanced features, intuitive design, and a growing user base (50% monthly growth and 72K followers on X ). At the core of its ecosystem, $BEST unlocks real benefits: reduced transaction fees, early access to new crypto projects, higher staking rewards, and exclusive perks through iGaming partnerships. It also enables access to Upcoming Tokens – a secure, in-app crypto presale hub that helps users dodge scam sites and buy early, safely. Security is no afterthought either. The wallet is powered by Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP tech, giving users full control without compromising safety. So far, $BEST has raised $13.6 million in its presale phase, with the current price sitting at just $0.025245. It’s still early, but clearly not under the radar, especially with forecasts predicting a potential high of $0.072 in 2025 and up to $0.82 by 2030. Wall Street might want to start paying attention. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – When the TikTok Brain Meets Crypto SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is where AI agent , influencer culture, and crypto collide. It’s not just riding the wave of viral content, it’s helping creators own it. Built as the first AI-powered content and monetization platform, $SUBBD empowers creators to generate income directly from their audience while automating the behind-the-scenes work that usually eats up their time (and profits). Think of it as a blockchain-native alternative to Patreon and OnlyFans, but with smarter tools. Creators get an AI assistant to handle chat, editing, scheduling, and monetization. Fans can interact via AI-generated photos, videos, and avatars – all approved by the original influencer. Payments are instant, low-fee, and borderless, with crypto or fiat options. $SUBBD already boasts a combined reach of 250M+ followers through its ecosystem of creators and ambassadors. With $702K raised and $SUBBD currently priced at $0.055775, it’s still early – but not unproven. If Wall Street’s next bet is on the creator economy, $SUBBD may be one of the few projects that actually understands what Gen Z wants, and how to monetize it. 3. Ondo Finance ($ONDO) – Bridge Between Wall Street and DeFi $ONDO is the token behind Ondo Finance, a project that’s bringing traditional assets like U.S. Treasuries onto the blockchain in a way that institutions can actually get behind. Ondo Finance is all about making real-world financial tools – like bonds and short-term government debt – accessible on-chain, with full compliance and transparency. Right now, $ONDO is trading around $0.7554. Holding $ONDO gives you a say in how the project evolves, including decisions around new products and the development of Ondo Chain – their own upcoming Layer 1 blockchain. One of Ondo Finance’s standout products is $OUSG – a token that gives accredited investors access to short-term U.S. Treasuries, with 24/7 minting and redeeming via RLUSD (Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin). It already has hundreds of millions in supply and runs on Ethereum, Solana, and the XRP Ledger. As institutions look beyond Bitcoin for yield and stability, $ONDO is well-positioned to be part of that next move. Altcoin Season Might Just Be Institutional This Time If BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF success proves anything, it’s that institutions are diving into crypto. As Wall Street looks beyond Bitcoin, projects like Best Wallet Token , SUBBD Token , and Ondo Finance offer real utility – from DeFi access to creator monetization to tokenized Treasuries. These three could be next on the institutional radar. Before investing in crypto, make sure to do your own research (DYOR).

Legal expert and prominent commentator Bill Morgan marked the conclusion by highlighting four key victories that Ripple has secured through this landmark case. Programmatic Sales Are Not Investment Contracts One of the most significant moments in the case came in July 2023, when U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP, those conducted on public exchanges, did not constitute securities transactions. This was a major blow to the SEC’s theory and a huge win for Ripple. As Bill Morgan noted, “commonsense has prevailed.” The court found that purchasers in the secondary market had no reasonable expectation of profits based on Ripple’s efforts, which disqualified such transactions under the Howey Test. The SEC v Ripple lawsuit is finally, finaly, OVER. Commonsense has prevailed. Programatic sales are not investment contracts. Ripple has found other ways to sell XRP to institutions XRP itself is not a security https://t.co/myX2lazO3S — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 27, 2025 XRP Is Not a Security Judge Torres also ruled that XRP itself is not a security. This ruling was crucial because it established that the token, on its own, is not inherently an investment contract. The SEC’s attempt to label all XRP as a security was unequivocally rejected by the court. Morgan rightly emphasized this point in his summary, reinforcing the fact that the ruling brings clarity to how XRP is classified going forward. The Lawsuit Is Now Officially Over On June 27, 2025, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that the company will drop its cross-appeal , and that the SEC is expected to do the same, finalizing the lawsuit for good. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While the SEC had initially sought to appeal certain parts of the 2023 ruling, it has promised to withdraw the appeal. With both sides stepping back, the case is now fully closed. Morgan’s statement that it’s “finally OVER” is not just celebratory, it’s legally accurate. Ripple Has Established Compliant Institutional Sale Methods While Ripple did lose on the issue of institutional sales, which the court ruled did violate securities law, the company has since adapted. Ripple faced a proposed $125 million civil penalty, which it moved to settle for $50 million. Although Judge Torres initially rejected that settlement, both sides have signaled their willingness to bring the matter to a close. In the meantime, Ripple has found compliant avenues to continue institutional sales of XRP, demonstrating resilience and adaptability. A Clearer Path for Crypto The conclusion of this case removes a major source of regulatory uncertainty hanging over XRP and the U.S. crypto market. Ripple’s legal victory sets a precedent that could influence other token-related cases and gives the industry a clearer understanding of what constitutes a security. XRP has responded positively in the markets, gaining 4.26% in 24 hours. This reflects renewed investor confidence. Bill Morgan’s summary captures what many in the crypto world feel: four decisive victories that not only clear XRP’s name but pave the way for a more defined regulatory future.

With Ripple officially dropping its appeal against the SEC , many industry analysts believe the road is now wide open for a U.S. spot XRP ETF, possibly even from asset management giant BlackRock. As optimism floods the market, XRP’s price is already reacting, climbing over 3.5% in a matter of hours. Closed chapter on this clears way for spot XRP ETF… Also clears way for BlackRock to jump in. https://t.co/t3f8ycOeEx — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) June 28, 2025 Lawsuit Ends, XRP ETF Approval Talk Begins Last Friday, Ripple made a decisive move by dropping its cross-appeal in the XRP lawsuit. This marked the true end of a legal fight that has stretched since 2020. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called this a major turning point, saying it clears the way for a spot XRP ETF. With Ripple out of legal soup, BlackRock and other big players may now feel confident enough to explore launching an XRP-backed ETF. BlackRock XRP ETF Could Be Next? BlackRock hasn’t confirmed anything yet, but speculation is running hot. Earlier rumors in April and May 2025 about BlackRock launching a spot XRP ETF weren’t based on facts. In reality, BlackRock has consistently said they’re not interested in altcoins like XRP right now, mainly because of the legal issues Ripple was facing with the SEC. [post_titles_links postid=”476018″] However, based on last month’s hype, Bloomberg analysts raised the odds of an XRP ETF approval to over 95%, noting that the SEC is engaging more positively with altcoin ETF filings. According to Polymarket , there’s now a 78% chance we’ll see a spot XRP ETF approved before the year ends, and while the denial game is still on, there are hints that BlackRock would be the most likely player to take the lead. XRP Price Pops, Whales Accumulate As news of the dropped appeal broke, XRP surged to $3.18, gaining over 3.5%. This jump was accompanied by $5.5 million in liquidations, especially from short sellers who bet against the rally. Legal experts like Fred Rispoli and Bill Morgan praised Ripple’s strategic decision, pointing to increasing signs of institutional accumulation, large wallets loading up on XRP, even before the lawsuit ended. While the U.S. is still warming up to XRP ETFs, Canada has already launched one. The 3iQ XRP ETF recently debuted and quickly hit $32 million in assets under management, showing strong early demand. Now, all eyes are on the U.S. and whether BlackRock is ready to make the next big move.

However, despite its established dominance, fresh capital appears to be rotating into emerging altcoins with higher upside potential, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most closely watched names in that category. The project has already attracted over 12,500 investors who have raised $11.2 million while the presale is ongoing. Investors participating in the Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale will enjoy a 100% return on investment when it goes live at $0.06. Some analysts are suggesting its short-term growth could lag behind newer, more agile projects entering the market during a potential altcoin season. For investors scanning the market for the next crypto to explode or what cryptocurrency to invest in today, Mutuum is starting to stand out as a serious coin. Solana Steadies Near $145 as Network Activity Builds Up Solana (SOL) is currently trading around $145, showing a measured rebound following a recent dip to the $135–$140 area amid macroeconomic uncertainty. Technical indicators suggest consolidation around the 20-day EMA near $147, a critical level whose breach could pave the way toward higher resistance in the $150–$155 zone. On-chain metrics remain strong, with network throughput holding stable, hinting at underlying demand despite price volatility. Longer-term forecasts remain varied, short-term models predict moderate 5–7 % gains, while bullish narratives point to $300+ by late 2025 as institutional interest continues to grow. Overall, Solana appears to be in a stabilizing phase, threading the needle between consolidation and a potential breakout. Amid this backdrop, attention is also turning to emerging DeFi players like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Game-Changer: Mutuum Finance Disrupts DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is revolutionizing a new generation lending platform where users retain full ownership of their assets and passively diversify to optimize the earning potential using a flexible safe system. The system is an effective dual-lending system that combines the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model uses a smart contract to control lending pools whose interest rates are floating. The system is made responsive to real-time market conditions, a factor that makes returns to lenders more certain and borrowers financially sound. In the meantime, there are also the P2P model which completely excludes middlemen and allows the user to agree on terms among themselves. That sort of setup of direct lending is particularly helpful with less stable assets such as meme coins since flexibility and control take priority there. Phase 5 of the Mutuum Finance Presale Is Underway, $11.2 Million Raised Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) presale became a record by raising over $11.2 million, attracting over 12500 token holders. It is currently on Phase 5 investor confidence continues to grow as the platform distinguishes itself from short-term meme coins. Mutuum Finance Stablecoin Launch and CertiK Audit In yet another step to further build its ecosystem Mutuum Finance is soon to launch a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Contrary to algorithmic stablecoins which have been challenged by price stability problems Mutuum Finance’s stablecoin is to be backed by real assets. The platform has also undergone a security audit by CertiK one of the most known names in blockchain security. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a potential outperformer in the next altcoin season, possibly even outpacing Solana (SOL). While SOL holds strong around $145 with steady network activity, Mutuum’s Phase 5 presale at $0.03 offers a 2x return at launch ($0.06), backed by a disruptive DeFi lending model, a forthcoming USD-pegged stablecoin, and a CertiK audit. Over $11.2 million raised and 12,500+ investors show growing momentum.

46950231,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=756859,1751110253,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46950231.jpeg,South Korea pushes the US for fair trade deal during Washington visit,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/south-korea-mutually-beneficial-trade-deal/,"South Korea’s new Trade Minister, Yeo Han-koo, landed in Washington this week with one mission: to stop the United States from reimposing steep tariffs and to lock in a trade deal that benefits both nations. The visit wrapped up on Friday, just ahead of a looming July 9 deadline, when President Donald Trump’s paused 25% tariffs could come roaring back. According to a government statement from Seoul, Yeo met with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, and multiple U.S. lawmakers to push for a fresh agreement. During those meetings, Yeo also laid out President Lee Jae Myung’s trade policy, doubling down on the administration’s interest in long-term cooperation. “The ongoing negotiations are not merely for tariffs but also an opportunity to establish a new framework for future cooperation,” Yeo said. “We will fiercely engage in the discussions to ensure the two countries’ momentum for cooperation won’t be undercut by the tariffs, and to turn the current crisis into an opportunity.” Korean economy faces pressure as U.S. targets tech, trade The urgency is real. If Trump’s across-the-board tariffs are reinstated, they could cripple Korea’s key industries. The country is a major manufacturing partner to the U.S., supplying semiconductors, vehicles, and batteries—all sectors exposed to tariff risks. On top of that, the Bank of Korea recently downgraded the country’s 2025 GDP forecast to 0.8%, down from 1.5%, signaling the fragile state of its domestic economy. Yeo also flagged growing concerns from Korean companies about the U.S.’s tightening export control policies, especially as Washington moves to block high-end tech from reaching China. Those restrictions are already affecting supply chains and slowing down production timelines for Korean manufacturers. Yeo made clear that these trade and tech challenges are connected—and must be addressed together. Meanwhile, Lutnick went on Bloomberg Television and announced that the U.S. is working to wrap up 10 new trade agreements in the next two weeks, aiming to finalize terms before the tariff freeze expires. He did not say which countries were on that list. “We’re going to do top 10 deals, put them in the right category, and then these other countries will fit behind,” Lutnick said. He added that some partners might get more time, depending on Trump’s call, but gave no confirmation. Trump plans tiered deals and “letters” to holdouts Trump’s approach is binary; deal or penalty. Countries that don’t reach agreements by July 9 will receive formal “letters” laying out U.S. demands. “Those who have deals will have deals, and everybody else that is negotiating with us, they’ll get a response from us and then they’ll go into that package,” Lutnick said. He noted that Trump could still allow more time for talks, but once tariffs return, they’ll be locked in. India and Japan are also in the scramble. On Thursday, Trump hinted that India is close to a deal. Rajesh Agarwal, India’s chief negotiator, is leading a team in Washington this week to close gaps with U.S. officials. Japan’s chief negotiator Ryosei Akazawa is also heading into another round of meetings. Before leaving, he told reporters that Japan “can’t accept” the 25% car tariff. But in Tokyo, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi declined to comment directly on Lutnick’s remarks, saying only that talks are ongoing and the matter remains a priority. As for China, the situation is complex. A new trade understanding is technically in place, covering terms discussed earlier this year in Geneva and London, but it’s still full of conditions. Both sides have blamed each other for violating previous handshake agreements. This latest deal, pending sign-off from both Trump and Xi Jinping, includes a provision that China must resume exporting rare earth materials before the U.S. lifts countermeasures. Lutnick explained that U.S. trade limits on products like ethane (used in plastics), chip design software, and jet engine tech will remain until China follows through. This isn’t a full trade deal either—it leaves out thorny issues like fentanyl smuggling and market access for American exporters. But it’s part of the broader set of “packages” the Trump administration wants done before the tariff clock runs out.

Recall that the asset was mostly ignored by legacy investors for its initial years, then became the laughing stock of many, before it finally started to capture the attention of previous doubters. As prominent names like Paul Tudor Jones III , Kevin O’Leary , or even former critic Ray Dalio started to enter the ecosystem, their general advice was that people should look to invest no more than 5% in the cryptocurrency. However, the adoption curve has completed a 180-degree turn, and some financial advisors are now recommending bigger percentages. A lot bigger. 40% in BTC? As reported by CNBC, Ric Edelman, head of Digital Assets Council of Financial Advisors, noted that a lot has changed since his initial take on the matter, which was four years ago. At the time, he advised investors, especially the more conservative ones, to allocate around 1% of their portfolios to BTC. “Today I am saying 40%, that’s astonishing. No one has ever said such a thing,” he said now. The reason for this monumental increase in his recommendation is the global status of Bitcoin (and some other cryptocurrencies). Most were ridiculed several years ago when it was unknown whether countries, such as China, or even the US, might move to ban them in some form. Now, the situation is entirely different as the US and a few others have presented plans on how to accumulate BTC as a reserve asset. Old-School 60/40 Doesn’t Work One of the most popular theories for investing is allocating 60% of a portfolio into stocks and 40% into bonds. While this classic split may have worked in the past, the landscape is different now, and it requires more risk and a greater exposure to stocks, according to Edelman. “If you’re a financial advisor and you had a 30-year-old client who was saving for their long-term future, you would tell them to put 100% of their money in stocks, because they have 50 years to go. Today’s 60-year-old is kind of like yesterday’s 30-year-old. You need to get better returns than you can get from bonds, and you need to hold equities longer than ever before.” Instead of such solid exposure to stocks, though, he said people should diversify with crypto and BTC in particular, which is a “wonderful way to improve modern portfolio theory statistics.” “The crypto asset class offers the opportunity for higher returns than you’re likely to get in virtually any other asset class,” Edelman concluded.

Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), confirms the number on his Telegram channel. “A major milestone, which confirms the strengthening of economic ties and the growing role of the association in the formation of a new architecture of global economy. We continue strengthening business ties, including through the BRICS Business Council, as requested by Russian President Vladimir Putin.” BRICS held its first summit in 2009 and was originally known as BRIC, representing its four founding members: Brazil, Russia, India, and China. The acronym became BRICS after South Africa joined the group in 2010. In 2024, it expanded membership to other nations, including Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. Indonesia joined in early 2025. Brazil also claims that Saudi Arabia is part of the bloc, but the Middle Eastern country has reportedly eschewed formal membership in the intercontinental economic alliance to avoid antagonizing the US. The economic alliance also includes 10 “partner countries,” including Belarus, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. Partner countries aren’t full-fledged members but are invited to participate in the BRICS summit and can endorse the alliance’s declarations. Brazil says current BRICS priorities include “facilitating economic transactions between bloc countries, such as the use of local currencies; the development of international payment platforms; cooperation in government procurement; and the promotion of trade facilitation measures, among others.” In 2023, the alliance reportedly began working on creating a common currency backed by gold and potentially additional precious metals and assets to circumvent international reliance on the US dollar, though officials from several of the bloc’s member countries claimed earlier this year that they weren’t pushing for de-dollarization.

Once a vocal critic of Bitcoin, Trump has now emerged as a champion of the digital asset economy, crediting crypto for creating jobs and strengthening America’s financial system. His recent remarks mark a sharp pivot from his earlier stance and add fuel to the growing narrative that the U.S. is racing to become the world’s crypto capital. Trump: “Bitcoin Is Amazing” Speaking at the White House Conference on Friday, Trump made headlines by praising Bitcoin, even going as far as to claim credit for its rise: “I got involved with it a couple of years ago, and before the second term,” Trump said. “It’s become amazing. I mean, it’s the jobs that it produces, and I notice more and more of you pay in Bitcoin.” He also referred to himself as the one who “built the crypto industry” and suggested that crypto adoption had eased pressure on the U.S. dollar. From “Scam” to “Savior”: Trump’s U-Turn on Crypto Back in 2021, when El Salvador announced Bitcoin as legal tender , Trump called it a “scam” and a threat to the U.S. dollar. Fast forward to 2025, Trump has rolled out a set of pro-crypto regulations, launched a crypto venture with his family , and rebranded himself as a digital asset pioneer. The shift comes as Trump gears up to make the U.S. a crypto powerhouse, overseeing a massive policy shift to accommodate blockchain startups, ETFs, and even crypto payments. His new stance includes praising Bitcoin for job creation, innovation, and monetary evolution. [post_titles_links postid=”476121″] U.S. vs. China: The Crypto Arms Race Trump didn’t stop at praising Bitcoin. He framed crypto as a geopolitical tool, stating that if the U.S. hadn’t embraced it, “China would’ve taken it.” According to him, the crypto industry is America’s to lead—and to lose. While Trump backs widespread crypto adoption, China has outlawed private crypto ownership, pushing instead for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The contrast between the two global powers underscores the geopolitical stakes of crypto leadership.

With a regulatory framework in place, America is rapidly becoming the center of the digital asset world.Whether you see it as political rebranding or visionary leadership, Trump’s endorsement of Bitcoin could be the defining moment that pushes crypto into mainstream global acceptance.

After a long period of slow movement, some analysts now believe ADA could be gearing up for a major run — but not before a possible dip. Here’s why Cardano could hit $1. Cardano could hit $1, But! According to popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Cardano has been stuck inside a downward price channel for most of 2025. Right now, it’s trading around $0.56. But based on Martinez’s chart, there’s a chance it could fall toward $0.47 — a key support zone before it bounces back. However, if ADA holds that level and gains strength, Martinez believes the price could climb back toward $1 in the months ahead. Bigger Breakout to $2.60? Adding more excitement, crypto trader Smith has pointed out a pattern forming on Cardano’s chart that looks similar to a past breakout, one that gave ADA a 240% boost. If history repeats, he says ADA could target $2.60, a huge jump from its current price. Cardano Growing On-Chain Strength Cardano’s growth isn’t just relying on charts; its network is growing stronger too. Its layer-2 Hydra solution recently showed the ability to handle nearly 1 million transactions per second. Meanwhile, DeFi apps are also growing on Cardano, with fewer failed transactions than rival platforms like Solana. Cardano ETF Approval Odd Surge Excitement is also building over a possible Cardano ETF. Prediction market Polymarket shows a 76% chance of SEC approval by late 2025. Experts like Eric Balchunas put the odds even higher, above 90%. An approved ETF could bring in big investors and push ADA prices higher.

According to the firm, the new initiative, the Economic Futures Program, will support research on the impact of AI on the labor market and the global economy. Silicon Valley has shared opinions on the promise of generative AI to forge new career paths and economic opportunities, with banks and analysts also talking about the potential of AI to boost GDP. However, those gains are unlikely to be distributed equally in the face of what many expect to be the widespread job losses due to artificial intelligence. Anthropic claims that it plans to develop policy proposals to prepare for the shift with its new initiative. Anthropic launches initiative to track AI impact Speaking about the new initiative , the head of policy programs and partnerships at Anthropic, Sarah Heck, said the company came up with the initiative because people were asking questions about the positive and negative economic impacts of artificial intelligence. “It’s really important to root these conversations in evidence and not have predetermined outcomes or views on what’s going to [happen],” she added. Over the last few months, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has been one of the vocal voices discussing the impact of AI on the economy. In May, he predicted that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and increase unemployment to as high as 20% in the next five years. When asked if one of the goals of the Economic Futures Program was to reduce job losses related to AI, Heck was cautious, noting that the AI shift could be both bad and good. “I think the key goal is to figure out what is actually happening,” she said. “If there is job loss, then we should convene a collective group of thinkers to talk about mitigation. If there will be a huge GDP expansion, great. We should also convene policymakers to figure out what to do with that. I don’t think any of this will be a monolith,” she said. The program looks to build on Anthropic’s Economic Index initiative that was launched in February, with open-source aggregated data to analyze the effects of AI on the economy over time, some of the data its competitors do not reveal. The program will focus on three main areas According to Anthropic, the program is expected to focus on three main areas, which will include providing grants to researchers investigating AI’s effect on labor, productivity, and value creation. Other aspects include the creation of forums to develop and evaluate policy proposals to prepare for AI’s economic impacts and build datasets to track AI’s economic impacts and usage. The company will kickstart the program with some action items. The firm has also opened applications for its rapid grants of up to $50,000 for research on AI’s economic impacts, as well as evidence-based policy proposals for symposia events hosted by Anthropic in Washington D.C. and Europe in the fall. Anthropic said it is open to partnering with independent research institutions and will provide partners with Claude API credits and other resources to support research. Heck mentioned that Anthropic is looking for individuals, academics, or teams that can come up with quality data in a short period. These teams will be the major beneficiaries of the grants. “We want to be able to complete it within six months,” she said. “It doesn’t necessarily have to be peer-reviewed.” For the symposia, the firm wants policy ideas from different backgrounds and perspectives, with Heck noting that the policy proposals are expected to go beyond labor. “We want to understand more about the transitions,” she said. “How do workflows happen in new ways? How are new jobs being created that nobody ever contemplated before?… How are certain skills remaining valuable while others are not?” She also added that Anthropic hopes to study the effects of AI on fiscal policy. For example, what happens if there is a shift in the way that enterprises see value creation? “We really want to open the aperture here on things that can be studied,” Heck said. “Labor is certainly one of them, but it’s a much broader swath.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

However, there’s also the upside, which suggests that this rally is not driven by retail investors and they are not necessarily needed to push BTC further north. Back to Ghost Town? CryptoQuant’s take on the matter indicates that the active addresses on the world’s largest blockchain have failed to recover after the massive drop experienced in late March and early April when the underlying asset slumped below $75,000 amid Trump’s tariff threats. Although the price has recovered and even managed to break the previous ATH, the retail interactions have remained minimal , with few signs of improvement. The network activity index, which shows the overall usage of Bitcoin’s blockchain by combining factors like active addresses, transaction counts, total UTXOs, and number of bytes per block, has also remained low, CQ’s CryptoMe said. Lastly, the analyst brought up the BTC mempool, which shows very few pending transactions. “Sometimes, the mempool can be low because of technologies like SegWit or batching. But when we also see a drop in Active Addresses and low Network Activity, it clearly shows that the reason is a lack of interest.” This is far from the first such occasion this year. The network activity slumped in early February as well, and the price followed suit, which showed a clear correlation between the two. Retail Not Needed? The fact that the network activity is low can be concerning. However, there’s also the opposite view on the matter. As mentioned above, BTC already managed to recover after a steep pullback and tap a new record while the activity remained low. At the same time, reports emerged that this impressive rally that drove the cryptocurrency from under $75,000 to over $110,000 was primarily driven by institutions accumulating the asset via ETFs or OTC deals. Consequently, this raises the question whether retail is indeed necessary for BTC’s price to head north once again. They were needed during past cycles, but times have changed, and Bitcoin is a globally recognized asset now that attracts a different class of investors, not only the retail crowd that came when it was pumping and disappeared when the bear markets took over.

That’s after the high flying altcoin grew 74.6% in 15 days from May 27 to an all time high price of $1.61 on Jun. 11, according to data compiled by CoinMarketCap. That’s pacing for an almost unbelievable average annualized ROI of 1,815%. But is support for that kind of growth in SPX6900’s currency exchange rate against the US dollar sustainable over a longer period? Or was this just a come-and-go flash in the pan? Ethereum Meme Coin SPX6900 12-Month Returns: +9,000% SPX6900 is one of 2025’s hot new 100x altcoin gems for crypto market ROI hunters. In the trailing 12-month period, ot gained over 9,000% in value. Trading for about a penny exactly one year ago, the top 5 crypto meme coin exchanged hands at a $1.17 on Thursday, Jun. 26, for an incredible 9,000% return on investment. Taking the trailing one year view, SPX6900’s performance compared to Bitcoin and the US stock market is even more impressive. During the same time, Bitcoin’s price gained 76%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 gained it’s usual 12%. That’s 2% gains to cover your average yearly US dollar consumer inflation rate, plus 10% growth in your portfolio. But it’s nothing like the growth crypto markets have pumped into an Ethereum parody of the S&P 500 stock benchmark. Source: X At its record high price on this Jun. 11, SPX6900 had delivered buyers on Jun. 27, a year ago, an opportunity to cash out ROIs of 12,384%. SPX6900 $1,000 into $123,840 in Under 12 Months That means every $1,000 spent buying this funny little meme coin just one year ago bought a sum of tokens that could be sold earlier this month for $123,840. For the average US individual and household finances, that is a life-changing investment. Very soon in the U.S. you will be able to buy a house with #SPX6900 or #Fartcoin . It can’t get anymore bullish than this pic.twitter.com/A4QWk37zSg — Grey BTC (@greybtc) June 26, 2025 One long-term SPX6900 bull, Nansen researcher Bledi GMI, pumped the meme coin’s previous gains in a post on Wednesday: “Believe in something; The real definition of long-term growth, long-term support, and a long-term mindset: Imagine where we can go in the next 1year.” Furthermore, it is interesting and appears very bullish for SPX6900 that it bounced back so quickly from selling off its peak price level on Jun. 11, making a 21% leg up the charts to $1.33 on Jun. 24 after finding market support at $1.04 on Jun. 22. That was a swift 35% correction over 11 days followed by a decisive breakout of buyers for this relatively new meme coin. These kind of technical market signals a healthy currency economy for SPX6900 and a strong center of gravity for continued growth, according to many analysts. What Is Going On With SPX6900? Like many other similar examples in cryptocurrency, this meme coin sounds too good to be true. The literal stock market, representing actual ownership in US businesses, gained 12% in 12 months, and something called a meme coin, that didn’t exist until a couple years ago, and is simply named after the real SPX 500 gained 12,300%. How can this be real? Crypto’s detractors, like the investing legends Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, say the reason is groupthink, greed, stupidity, and immorality. But other than making a questionable comparison of cryptocurrency to online gambling, they have yet to give any more serious an answer than that. They also both have long admitted they just steer clear of high tech investments because they don’t understand the Internet, and have done well enough sticking to the economy’s other sectors. So what’s really going on with these markets? Here is CMC #Altcoin season Index Top 100 performance over 90 days. $SYRUP 390% $HYPE 179% #SPX6900 132% pic.twitter.com/CS4Dctoe1n — Raajeev Anand (@rajeevanandspur) June 27, 2025 There is an enormous profit incentive to investing in newer, smaller liquidity pools adjacent to the base layer blockchain platforms’ currencies, like Ethereum and Solana. The so-called beta plays. Why? Ultimately, because the financial, capital, and currency markets are the foundation of the entire global economy— and in these markets the thing lacking most of all is saving. The Global Cryptocurrency Macro Hedge American businesses and consumers were especially unhappy with the inflationary rising prices of the Biden and pandemic years. That was likely an important factor in Trump’s 2024 election victory. But rising prices could have been much worse if it weren’t for the cryptocurrency sector tying up the dollar supply in a multi-trillion dollar Internet currency market. The demand for savings products that beat inflation and reward savers with competitive ROIs for their money is so great that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and, forgive me for saying it – SPX6900, have consistently outperformed most US stock gains for years. The yearly and four-year ROIs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, however, have been declining as they have grown to mass global scales. That’s simply because the first dollars in make the most ROIs. So, to incentivize on-ramping more savings as currency investments in the Internet financial system, and park that money right next to the biggest ecosystems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, where it will be easiest for currency holders to use, developers issue new currencies. So What Exactly Is SPX6900? It’s one of these newer meme coins, built on Ethereum and compatible with the BNB Chain. With a $1.17 billion market cap, the currency ranks #61 for size out of all cryptocurrencies in June 2025. It is also already the fifth most capitalized meme coin, at least at the time of this writing, after DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and TRUMP. Pepe may make an instructive comparison for SPX6900’s forward outlook. They are both Ethereum meme coins with big support from the same community of supporters— edgy, anti-Wall Street, pro-Internet freedom types of people. Today, Pepe’s market cap is $3.89 billion vs. SPX6900’s $1.17 billion market cap.

This rise displays that Aave remains in a bullish structure despite a correction from the recent swing high. The lending platform’s native token is indicating the potential of a macro-level breakout on the horizon. This optimism has risen as AAVE’s integration with Chainlink’s SVR has activated phase 3 after successful earlier phases. The phase 3 now covers 75% of AAVE’s total Ethereum value secured (TVS), which accounts for 95% of AAVE’s OEV-relevant TVS. This move is extremely beneficial as this expansion is basically a risk-adjusted move to pump AAVE’s utilization of SVR. This move makes it a bullish indication for its ecosystem’s long-term sustainability and the native token’s price. Moreover, its ecosystem growth is reflected in on-chain data, and experts’ opinions are rising on the AAVE crypto price to rise soon. Keep reading to know more.

Bitcoin is trading at $107,375, up 0.3% in the last 24 hours. Altcoins like XRP, BNB, Solana, Dogecoin, SUI, and Cardano are also in the green, posting modest gains of 1–4%. Bitcoin’s Bull Cycle Just Getting Started? According to analyst Michaël van de Poppe , Bitcoin is showing an extremely bullish setup that could lead to new all-time high as early as this week. Bitcoin recently swept liquidity above $108K and pulled back, and is now consolidating just below major resistance. The analyst highlights $110.5K as the crucial breakout level. If BTC clears this, it could accelerate toward new all-time highs, similar to the previous breakout above $106.5K. On the downside, he points to $105.5K–$104K as strong dip-buying zones, with a deeper support option around $98.5K–$100K. A shakeout into these areas could lead to a bullish rebound, just like last week’s setup. Analysts Eye $110K Breakout for New ATH Although Bitcoin’s momentum has slowed, analysts say that the bull market is not over yet. The MVRV ratio is at 2.2, well below the peak levels, which suggests there is more room to grow. A rise in MVRV momentum, combined with strong ETF inflows could push Bitcoin beyond $112K, with some analysts eyeing even $165K. Bitcoin’s next big move depends on breaking through the resistance between $108K and $110K . Analyst AlphaBTC says it will take serious momentum to flip this zone into support. Final Resistance at $108K? A pullback to around $104K–$105K could help Bitcoin grab liquidity and fuel a stronger push upward. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital calls the $108K level the “final major weekly resistance” standing in the way of new all-time highs. Analyst Scott Melker notes that Bitcoin has been resilient despite short-term volatility and macro uncertainty. He explains that Bitcoin’s stability reflects strong underlying demand, particularly from institutions. Over the past 12 days, spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded net inflows of $4 billion, highlighting robust investor confidence. Despite global tensions, Bitcoin’s upward trajectory remains intact.

The S&P 500 closed at 6,173.07 and the Nasdaq Composite hit 20,273.46, bolstered by progress in U.S.–China trade talks and optimism across global risk markets. The crypto market reacted in tandem with this bullish sentiment. Bitcoin has held above $107,000 for most of the week, gaining roughly 3.8% over the past seven days. The rally coincides with positive remarks from U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who hinted at finalized trade agreements with China and ten other countries.

BTC weekly gain: 3.8% Nasdaq, S&P 500 hit new all-time highs BTC trades within a $100K–$110K range Inflation Risks and Fed Policy Keep Bulls in Check Despite the broader market rally, Bitcoin’s upward momentum faces macroeconomic headwinds. The U.S. core PCE inflation rate , the Federal Reserve’s favored gauge, climbed to 2.7% annually in May, just above the 2.6% estimate. Monthly core inflation also rose 0.2%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell doubled down on a cautious, data-dependent approach, reiterating that rate cuts are far from guaranteed. Trump’s tariff rhetoric has further added to inflation concerns, which in turn keep the Fed hesitant.

Even as Bitcoin maintains support above $105,000, the upside appears capped until a strong inflation cooldown or monetary pivot emerges. Bitcoin Volume Drop and Technicals Suggest Consolidation Bitcoin’s recent price action indicates signs of consolidation, rather than expansion. Spot trading volumes have declined, with Glassnode reporting a decrease in daily transfer volume from $76 billion in May to $ 52 billion. Meanwhile, futures data also indicates a cooling market, on a 3-month rolling basis, and funding rates are both down. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Technically, a bullish Bitcoin price prediction is likely once it manages to break through the $108,250 resistance level. It appears to be a symmetrical triangle or bullish pennant on the 4-hour chart. The 50-EMA at $105,970 provides near-term support, while the MACD has turned flat, signaling caution. Key Technical Levels to Watch: Resistance: $108,250, $109,257, $110,448 Support: $105,970, $104,991 (Fib 0.382), $103,984 (Fib 0.5) Trade Setup: Buy above: $108,300 breakout Targets: $109,257 and $110,448 Stop-loss: Below $105,970 Alternative Entry: Pullback to $104,991 zone for dip-buy For now, traders are advised to monitor volume and await a decisive breakout. Without a surge in participation, Bitcoin’s path to $112,000 remains a challenging uphill climb. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.4M Hard Cap as Presale Enters Final Hours With Bitcoin trading near $105,000, investor focus is shifting toward BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , a rising altcoin that is nearly fully allocated during its presale. As of today, the project has raised $7,438,492.88 of its $8,397,441 target, leaving under $1 million to be raised before the token price moves to the next tier. Currently priced at $0.00258, early buyers have a limited time to enter before the subsequent price increase takes effect. Bitcoin-Linked Tokenomics and Burn Mechanism BTCBULL ties its value directly to Bitcoin’s price through two smart systems: BTC Airdrops: Distributed to holders, with priority for presale participants. Supply Burns: Triggered automatically when BTC rises in $50,000 increments.

Typically, alt season is defined as a period when altcoins outperform Bitcoin, both in USD terms and when measured against Bitcoin itself. Historically, this has only occurred after a significant drop in Bitcoin dominance, something that hasn’t been seen in the current cycle. This kind of rally was clearly seen in 2017 and again from late 2020 to early 2021. But since then, no true alt season has taken place as Bitcoin has been dominating the market. Infact, this time, Bitcoin has been gaining strength, and most altcoins have been slowly dropping, both in USD and especially when measured against Bitcoin. 2017 vs 2021 vs Now, What Has Changed? The analyst used a key chart to track this, comparing the total altcoin market (without Bitcoin and stablecoins) to Bitcoin’s market cap. In both the 2017 and 2021 alt seasons, this chart dropped to 0.25 before altcoins began to rally. Right now, it’s still around 0.31, which means that altcoins are still too high compared to Bitcoin. So a full altseason is unlikely to start just yet. Also its important to note that during past cycles, rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and the end of quantitative tightening (QT) played a major role in kickstarting alt season. But this time, fewer rate cuts have been made, and QT is still ongoing, although at a slower pace. As a result, less risk is being taken in the market and altcoins are struggling to gain attention and liquidity. Bitcoin’s Dominance Is Crushing Altcoins Also, many altcoins were seen declining even while Bitcoin has been rising . Some short-term rallies have happened, but most altcoins are far below their highs from earlier this year. So, even though a few coins have done well, the overall altcoin market is still weak. [post_titles_links postid=”476305″] This cycle has often felt different, but the same pattern is playing out, just more slowly. Altcoins still have not fallen to the usual bottom level compared to Bitcoin. Until that happens, a proper alt season is not expected. It is possible that the bottom could be reached by September or November, based on past trends. The Fed’s Moves Could Make or Break Alt Season For altcoins to truly rally, more rate cuts and a full stop to QT will probably be needed. Monetary conditions have remained tight, and market liquidity has continued to favor Bitcoin. Until the broader economic and policy environment shifts, and until altcoins drop further in value relative to Bitcoin, the arrival of alt season will likely continue to be delayed.

Bitcoin is trading around $107,327, while some altcoins like XRP have seen gains. What is altcoin season in the cryptocurrency market? Altcoin season is a period when altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) significantly outperform Bitcoin, both in their USD value and when compared directly against Bitcoin. It often occurs after Bitcoin’s dominance decreases. What typically happens when altcoin season occurs? During altcoin season, capital rotates from Bitcoin into altcoins, leading to rapid and significant price increases for a majority of alternative cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s market dominance usually declines as altcoins gain market share and investor interest. Will Bitcoin’s price fall during an altcoin season? Bitcoin’s price doesn’t necessarily fall during altcoin season; it often consolidates or rises more slowly. The key is that altcoins outperform Bitcoin, meaning their gains are much larger, and Bitcoin’s dominance decreases as money flows into them.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-28 12:39:58

As of today, the market is witnessing some notable movements, with tokens like Solana (SOL) and Mantra (OM) seeing price fluctuations and a surge in interest from both early adopters and seasoned participants alike. Amid these shifts, one emerging project that stands out in the crowded crypto space is Qubetics ($TICS), which is in its final public presale phase. With the rise of blockchain technology, Qubetics is solving real-world challenges that its predecessors couldn’t tackle—making it one of the best tokens to invest now. With Solana experiencing some price declines and Mantra holding steady despite challenges, Qubetics offers a compelling presale opportunity. The Qubetics presale stage is now entering its final phase, where community members have a chance to secure $TICS tokens before they list at a 20% higher price. The crypto market’s current landscape underscores the importance of investing in projects like Qubetics, where real utility and long-term growth potential meet. Let’s explore how Qubetics could be your next big opportunity and why it’s considered the best token to invest now. Qubetics Application: A Game-Changer in Web3 Technology Qubetics is revolutionizing the Web3 ecosystem with its non-custodial, multi-chain wallet. By uniting leading blockchains, Qubetics is providing individuals and businesses with a seamless and secure way to store, manage, and transfer their digital assets across multiple chains.

For businesses, Qubetics can simplify transactions, ensuring that their operations run smoothly, regardless of the blockchain they interact with. A tech startup in the crypto space, for example, could utilize Qubetics to handle transactions across Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and other networks without the headache of managing multiple wallets. Similarly, individuals can consolidate their crypto holdings in one secure location, reducing the complexities of navigating different wallets and platforms. In this rapidly growing blockchain environment, Qubetics is positioning itself as a must-have tool for both casual crypto enthusiasts and serious blockchain users. Whether you’re a new entrant to the Web3 space or an experienced crypto participant, Qubetics provides a safe, user-friendly platform that ensures control over your digital assets. With its innovative multi-chain functionality, Qubetics is clearly one of the best token to invest now for anyone seeking to be at the forefront of Web3 technology. Qubetics Presale: A Limited-Time Investment Opportunity Qubetics is currently in the final phase of its public crypto presale , and with the listing price set to rise by 20%, this is the best time for early adopters to buy in. The presale has already raised over $18.1 million, with more than 516 million $TICS tokens sold to date, and over 28,300 community members now holding tokens. At the current price of $0.3370, Qubetics offers a great opportunity to buy in before the price increase upon listing. A $30,000 investment at the current price of $0.3370 could potentially yield significant returns. If $TICS reaches the projected $5 to $10 price point post-mainnet launch, your $30,000 investment could transform into $150,000 to $300,000. This makes Qubetics one of the best tokens to invest now, especially for those looking for high growth potential in the crypto space. The presale ends soon, and with a confirmed listing on one of the top 10 global exchanges, it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for early adopters to maximize their gains. Qubetics $TICS Token Set for Major Growth: Top 10 Exchange Listing Confirmed on 30 June Qubetics has secured a groundbreaking milestone with the official confirmation of its native token, $TICS, being listed on one of the world’s top 10 centralized exchanges. While the name of the exchange remains confidential under an NDA, the listing is locked in, and further details, such as trading pairs and timing, will be announced in tandem with the exchange’s official release. This exciting news is timed perfectly with the upcoming mainnet launch, which has analysts predicting a price surge of $10-15. The listing alone is expected to push the token’s price up by 20%, igniting even more excitement and anticipation within the community. As Qubetics moves closer to these pivotal events, all eyes are on this fast-rising project, anticipating its next big move. Solana (SOL): A Strong Player Despite Recent Price Dips Solana (SOL), currently ranked #6 in the cryptocurrency market, has experienced some downward pressure on its price, down 1.96% in the past 24 hours. With a market capitalization of $76.5 billion, Solana’s position remains strong, and it continues to be a key player in the blockchain space. Solana’s total supply of 603.87 million SOL tokens and circulating supply of 534.32 million SOL reflect the growing adoption of its blockchain, despite recent price fluctuations. The recent decline in price could be seen as a buying opportunity for those looking to enter the market at a lower price point. Solana’s all-time high of $294.33, achieved earlier this year, highlights its growth potential, and even at its current price of $143.17, analysts predict a potential for strong recovery. Solana’s robust infrastructure, high throughput, and scalability make it a top choice for decentralized applications (dApps) and projects seeking high-performance blockchains. Mantra (OM): Stability Amidst Market Challenges Mantra (OM) is another token worth mentioning in today’s crypto landscape. Currently ranked #182, it has a market cap of $198.4 million. Although it has seen a 6.12% decline in the past 24 hours, Mantra maintains a steady presence in the market. The current price of $0.2032 is far from its all-time high of $9.04, which was achieved earlier this year. Despite this, the 1079.66% increase from its all-time low of $0.01728 shows that Mantra has room for growth. With a circulating supply of 976.3 million OM and an unlocked market cap of $198.13 million, Mantra remains a solid token with potential for long-term growth. Its current volume of $43.99 million and the total supply of 1.67 billion OM tokens indicate that Mantra has been well-received by the crypto community. Conclusion: Why Qubetics is the Best Crypto Presale Opportunity When comparing Qubetics to other tokens like Solana and Mantra, the potential for significant growth in the near future is clear. While Solana and Mantra have had their share of price fluctuations, Qubetics offers an exciting opportunity for early adopters looking for a fresh, innovative blockchain solution. With a confirmed listing on a top 10 exchange and a projected 20% price increase at listing, Qubetics is undoubtedly the best token to invest now . By joining this crypto presale, participants have the chance to capitalize on the current low presale price of $0.3370 before it increases. With over $18.1 million raised, strong tokenomics, and the promise of a decentralized future, Qubetics is a smart investment for those looking to get involved in the next big Web3 movement.

New 13F filings show that as of Q1 2025, Druckenmiller allocated about $146 million to DocuSign and Flutter Entertainment. Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Family Office purchased 1.07 million shares of DocuSign, a digital platform that enables users to electronically sign, send and manage documents securely, streamlining workflows and reducing paper-based processes. It appears the high profile investor moved to buy the dip as the stock slid from a high of $97.70 in January to a low of $74.70 in March. The stock is now $76.47 at time of publishing. Meanwhile, Druckenmiller dramatically increased the firm’s stake in Flutter Entertainment, acquiring 351,200 shares valued at $72.225 million, along with call options worth $8.203 million, for a total allocation of $80.428 million. Flutter is a global sports betting and gaming company, operating popular brands like FanDuel, Paddy Power, and Betfair, which offer online and retail betting services across multiple markets Druckenmiller’s investment also appears to capitalize on a pullback, as Flutter’s stock fell from a high of $240.60 in February to a low of $194.50 in March.

Currently at the value of $0.5813, ADA is on its way to hit the $1 mark, with a strong trading volume and ecosystem updates packed into the latter overall. In the meantime, a potentially successful altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is entering the market with presale at the price of 0.03 dollars. Mutuum Finance has achieved an attractive DeFi solution through the sale of more than 570 millions tokens to 12,500 holders on a $11,200,000 raise. The two projects are primarily attractive and indicate a good potential that will attract investors of the next big step. These are tokens that are about to make big moves as the market heats up and therefore they are important players to watch in the event. The bullish momentum of Cardano CHAD-PDO-Cardano is showing its muscles as the price rose overnight from $0.5308 to $0.5932. This 10% shot represents a swelling confidence among investors supported by a 12 percent incline in the volume of trading towards 1.17 billion dollars. The $0.60 resistance presents a huge challenge, but clearing will put ADA on a path to reach toward $0.70 leading to a $1 goal in 2025. The integration of the Lace Wallet using Bitcoin also raises the optimism and increases the usefulness of Cardano. Such an upgrade is a hint of more integrations in the future, such as XRP, which might cement its ecosystem. As a result, technical and core developments of Cardano serve as its distinguishing aspects in the crypto market that can potentially obtain huge returns.

46953894,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=756896,1751115127,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46953894.jpeg,Ethiopians question demand and power consumption despite crypto mining boom,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ethiopia-power-concerns-crypto-mining-boom/,"Ethiopia has seen a rise in power concerns attributed to crypto mining activities amid the boom in the country’s cryptocurrency industry. According to reports, the crypto mining and data center industry in the country is expected to consume a third of the country’s electricity supply in 2025. This forecast has raised issues about the allocation of energy in a country where half of the population still lacks access to reliable power supply. According to the newly released Ethiopian Energy Outlook 2025, electricity demands from crypto-related data centers will exceed eight terawatt hours (TWh) this year, which is equivalent to about 30% of the total national demand. The report was created by the state-owned firms and the Petroleum and Energy Authority in the country, questioning whether such usage is appropriate. Ethiopia’s energy outlook for 2025 report raises concerns While crypto mining operations have been seen as a means of foreign exchange and digital infrastructure, the massive energy footprint they generate has sparked debates over equity and efficiency. There has also been slower progress in electrifying Ethiopia despite the numerous targets and large-scale infrastructure programs carried out in the country. “Since the demand and supply balance is tight, it remains an open question whether the power could be better used for export, general electrification or other productive uses, like pumping of water in the water and agriculture sector, where diesel generators are used to a wide extent,” it reads. According to the report , under the National Electrification Program (NEF), about 2.2 million households were connected to the grid in the last five years, leading up to 2024. But still, nearly 50% of the population does not have access to reliable electricity, with only 22% having legal metered grid connections. The report also warns that the slow expansion of electricity access has been one of the factors hindering economic development, reducing the potential benefits of other sector reforms. ”Addressing this issue requires increased infrastructure investment and innovative solutions to extend energy access to underserved areas. The respective tariff and exchange rate reforms are expected to alleviate the lack of materials for electrification, one of the main barriers to its progress,” the report said. While the current distribution only covers 25% of Ethiopia’s land area, about 68% of the population resides less than five kilometers from the grid. “This highlights the potential to triple the number of household connections within the footprint of the existing grid. Implementing cost-reflective tariffs will provide EEU with resources for new connections, making widespread electrification more feasible,” the outlook reads. Critics urge the government to consider essential services The report also mentioned that while Addis Ababa enjoys an electrification rate of about 93%, regions like Afar and Somali remain below 12%. There have also been talks of increasing electricity tariffs by up to 400% by 2028 under the new cost-reflective pricing regime under the NEP 3.0. Analysts expect the price increase to reduce crypto mining activities, which currently benefit from below-market power rates and tax regulations. While crypto mining offers direct foreign investment opportunities and taps into Ethiopia’s 98% renewable energy, critics have argued that its expansion during the national electrification crisis could affect broader development goals. According to the report, about 15 million households are still waiting for their first grid connections. Ethiopia made a shift to embrace Bitcoin mining after the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) banned crypto trading in 2022. The following year, the government started registering mining firms quietly through its cyber security agency INSA, showing a move towards monetizing digital infrastructure. According to critics, a country that struggles to provide clinics with reliable electricity and farmers dependent on diesel pumps for irrigation should reassess energy allocation. They also urged policymakers to consider trade-offs between digital infrastructure growth and essential services.

The SEC is widely expected to withdraw its appeal as well, allowing Judge Analisa Torres’ landmark rulings from 2023 to stand unchallenged. #Ripple officially ended its #SEC legal fight yesterday — but this May 2025 filing still matters. It reaffirms: #XRP is not a security. pic.twitter.com/ubgLZpwbcI — RippleXity (@RippleXity) June 28, 2025 In her final judgment , Judge Torres maintained that Ripple’s institutional XRP sales violated securities laws but confirmed that exchange-based sales did not. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse wrote on X: “We’re closing this chapter once and for all.” Legal experts, including Bill Morgan, hailed the moment as a victory for common sense and the broader crypto market. Although Ripple and the SEC proposed reducing the penalty from $125 million to $50 million and lifting a permanent injunction, the judge rejected these changes. With the appeals now abandoned, the $125 million fine remains, and Ripple is permanently barred from future unregistered institutional XRP sales. Key Legal Outcomes: XRP ruled not a security in public exchange sales Institutional sales remain restricted $125M civil penalty confirmed Ripple can now focus on growth and partnerships Market Reacts to Legal Closure The resolution has lifted sentiment in the XRP community, with traders bidding the token higher by 4.4% in the past 24 hours to $2.19. Ripple’s legal chief Stuart Alderoty confirmed that XRP’s classification remains unchanged, which reinforces the asset’s utility in institutional finance and cross-border payments. This legal clarity provides Ripple with the opportunity to expand strategic use cases for XRP, particularly in tokenized finance and enterprise payments. Analysts believe this finality could reignite institutional interest, especially as spot ETF conversations around XRP continue in parallel. XRP Technical Setup Hints at Breakout XRP’s 4-hour chart reveals a symmetrical triangle pattern, with price coiling under key resistance at $2.21. A series of higher lows from the $1.99 level has formed a rising support trendline, while the descending upper boundary continues to cap upside attempts. XRP Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A golden cross between the 50-EMA and 200-EMA confirms a bullish bias, and the MACD histogram has turned green with a signal line crossover—early signs of bullish momentum. A bullish marubozu candle printed at resistance indicates that buyers are testing supply levels. Trade Setup: Entry: Long above $2.215 (confirmed breakout) Target 1: $2.288 Target 2: $2.338 Stop-loss: Below $2.139 (EMA confluence + trendline support) If resistance holds, a retracement toward $2.14 could present a second opportunity for bulls to re-enter with a favorable risk-to-reward ratio. A confirmed breakout could accelerate toward the psychological $2.50 level, with $3.50 possible in a broader rally. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surges Past $1.6M—Layer 2 Just Got a Meme-Sized Boost Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has smashed through the $1 million mark in its public presale, raising $1,673,470 out of a $1,904,052 million target. With just hours left before the price jumps to the next tier, buyers can still lock in $0.01205 per HYPER. As the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper brings fast, low-cost smart contracts to the BTC ecosystem. It merges Bitcoin’s security with SVM’s scalability, enabling high-speed dApps, meme coins, and payments—all with cheap gas fees and seamless BTC bridging.

His comments come even as the crypto asset struggles just above the $2 support level, trading sideways for most of the week. “XRP, will it go to the $24 that I once talked about? Possibly, there is a good chance,” Jeremie stated in a Thursday video. “ Why? Because you know there are a lot of people in the US government that are pushing XRP, and so we could see possibly XRP do something crazy.” However, despite his optimistic price prediction, the investor opposed the cryptocurrency, cautioning viewers against investing in what he termed a “banker coin.” “ Now, do I suggest you invest in XRP? NO. Because it is a banker coin. Do you want to continue to support the banking system that gets free money on your behalf that steals from you when they screw you up? No. So why buy XRP? Sell your XRP, buy Bitcoin. In the long run, it’ll do better anyways.” He added. This isn’t the first time Jeremie has expressed this bullish sentiment despite his previous criticism of XRP. At one point, he called it a “stablecoin” and predicted its imminent crash to zero. Back in February, he made a similar prediction about XRP potentially reaching the “mythical $24 milestone” in the next bull market cycle. Meanwhile, XRP has grappled with significant headwinds amid a broader market downturn. According to a Tuesday tweet by analyst Ali Martinez, whale addresses have offloaded more than 370 million XRP since the start of the month, signaling a wave of large-scale selling pressure. However, data from Glassnode indicates that XRP has emerged as a “new retail favorite” this cycle, with active addresses increasing by an impressive 490% since the 2022 cycle low, compared to Bitcoin’s modest 10% increase. Despite these developments, industry experts remain cautiously optimistic about the long-term prospects for the crypto market, including XRP. In its monthly market outlook newsletter published Thursday, Coinbase noted a steep 41% decline in the total crypto market capitalization (excluding Bitcoin) since December 2024. “We think this warrants taking a defensive stance on risk for the time being, though we believe that crypto prices may find their floor in mid-to-late 2Q25 – setting up a better 3Q25,” the exchange reported, suggesting XRP could continue facing low volatility until around July. At press time, XRP was trading at $2.19, reflecting a 5.06% surge in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-28 12:56:02

This thing is volatile! The fundamentals of the company have changed little in the last three months, but the technical charts show a lot of promise still. I break down and annotate a chart fully, and discuss both the short- and medium-term outlooks for IREN stock. While I am not personally adding more to my position, I am not trimming, and believe that we could see more gains ahead. www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppo.asp Introduction It's only been a few months since I gave a buy rating to IREN Limited ( IREN ), a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner and AI cloud provider, that focuses on renewable energy infrastructure built alongside their facilities. Welcome to investing in 2025, that's what's on the menu now: a mid-cap company whose description includes the words: AI, cloud, Bitcoin miner, renewable energy, and who evokes the idea of energy autarky as a means of being a profitable mining operation. Well, since I gave the company a buy rating back in March, it's up over 90%. Seeking Alpha Look, I don't make the rules about what makes money in today's market. If it were up to me, we'd all be investing in dividend stocks like good little investors should. It's not up to me, and I just have to tell it like it is; I'm an arbiter of the market, not a director of it. It doesn't matter how easily comparable it is to the Dot Com Bubble; I'm here to make money. We'll talk about the downside later. Don't worry. For now, what I have to say is that IREN has a literal business on the ground that is impressive despite the absurdity of the description, and for serious investors (not just traders looking to make a buck on a stock), I recommend taking a look at this article from my colleague First Principles Partners that discusses the micro of the business with more up-to-date data that I went over it in my first article on IREN back in March. I don't have much of an update on IREN's story from my first coverage back in March, other than that the growth is hitting targets, which is a good thing. Instead, I thought I'd review what I see in IREN's chart, as the technical outlook on these kinds of stocks is one of the ways in which I direct my personal investments, and make decisions on when to add or shed stocks. After the significant run-up, IREN has been on, it's only fair that we check in on it to see what the chart tells us may happen next. IREN Technical Analysis I'm taking the same format here as I used in this article on Nebius N.V. ( NBIS ). To borrow from that article, here is some context on technical analysis: Here is the chart I'm looking at, daily candles going back [six] months... See the legend at the top of the chart for the other indicators I employ. Before we get to the chart, two things for context: I like to use this to forecast for a [30-60 day] period ahead, but I tend to watch charts like these weekly or during big moves... These discussions can be helpful for longer-term investors if they are trying to time their buys and sells for re-allocations, or time the pricing of options (e.g., buying protective puts at low prices, selling calls at highs, etc.). I recommend opening this image in a second window and half-screening each of them to be able to have both the image and annotation explanations side-by-side. There's a lot of info in this one image. Okay — show me the chart already! Author Annotations in Red (Barchart) Here's a run-down of what I'm looking at in the chart, corresponding to the numbers in the annotations above: I slapped a light gray psychological resistance line around the last high. I see an inverse head and shoulders pattern in the drop and bounce IREN had over the last few months, as it responded to political catalysts, but I also see it across most high-beta stocks right now, just like NBIS . Here is ""the textbook image"" of the pattern from Investopedia to compare to below. It's not perfect, but they never are. Let me know if you see something different in the comments. Investopedia Just like in the example above, we're seeing elevated volume as we break out through the Bollinger bands (white lines) shown by #5 and toward the point in #1, which the stock is now very close to. If I am correct here, and we see a new high with the breakout, we could expect this high to become a new resistance for the stock or around $14 in IREN's case. I am not a huge volume chaser, so beware that it could reverse quickly, especially if we get a secular catalyst that pulls down stocks in general. This corresponds to those four circles, which highlights the various ""crossover"" events in the exponential moving averages. The blue line (20-day EMA) has very bullishly crossed over the yellow (50-day EMA), purple (100-day EMA), and maroon (200-day EMA) lines on this run-up and is solidly above them. While the 20-day movement is bullish, the largest circled event is what piqued my interest here. We are also seeing a bullish crossover of the yellow line over the purple and maroon, and now the purple over the maroon as well. These are bullish indicators on their own, but together and in such quick succession typically imply that there is more ""gas in the tank"", and that gas can be measured as the distance between these indicators. While the blue line is so high up, over 10, and the maroon line down at 8.85, there is a healthy lead so far that implies the momentum can continue without more positive catalysts. Here is where we hit our first ""woah moment"" in the chart. Breaking out of the Bollinger bands (white lines) shows a break from standard deviation, which can cause odd movements in stock price, like sudden falls at market open or close as the candles tend to be ""shunted"" so to speak, back into the white bands. It is not to say that the stock has to fall when it breaks these bands, but there are only two ways this scenario ends, and we can see historically in the chart that it ends one of two ways every time: The stock price is shunted back down and a large red candle forms. The bands expand and give more room for the stock, which results in consolidation. Either way, both of those outcomes are bearish for current investors and could give a reason to ""let it play out"" for investors considering opening a position now. Since I already have a position and do not want to add (I am happy with my current position size), I am taking this into consideration, but not letting it sway my buy rating. The Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) momentum gauge is our second yellow flag, as it is very high, nearing oversold levels (80), and trending in that direction. This could be another sign of momentum running out, although it is notable that IREN has traded at a high RSI before, and done so for an extended period of time. That was also the last time it notably broke out of the bands, and was punished in early June with a pullback. I'm not kidding about the stocks getting shunted in by these bands. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator ( MACD ) just flashed a bullish signal, with the crossover of the signal lines (circled). A positive reading on the histogram is bullish, but it is dull. This is common across a lot of high-beta stocks currently. The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) is also bullish, but dull. The crossover (circled) is bullish, and so is the positive histogram reading, indicating the potential for momentum to continue picking up as the price breaks out to new (recent) highs. Let's take a look at the longer term, pulling back to the one year. This gives more perspective about breaking out above $14.15, as that became a heavy resistance point back in December. Barchart I didn't move the gray line from #1 earlier, so you can see how it was effectively the top for a while post-break-out-fake-out in November-December 2024. If I'm right about the pattern we're seeing, this could become heavy support for the stock moving forward around the $14 mark. This view also makes the breaking out of the Bollinger bands more noticeable and pronounced. Expect a pullback, likely sooner rather than later, or a rapid expansion of the bands that could signal far more ""gas in the tank"" and room to go. They work in extremes in these cases, but of course, they do — they're reacting to extreme movements in the stock price. Quick Word About Managing Risk IREN is very volatile, and even though I'm bullish about it based on these charts, I could be very wrong. There are a lot of risks with IREN, namely: Correlation to Bitcoin, meaning if Bitcoin falls, IREN will too in sympathy. High beta, meaning if the market crashes, IREN will too in sympathy. Small-cap risk, as it can be thinly traded at times and ""gap up and down,"" meaning it can be hard to get consistent entry and exit points. Take positions prudently, and with precision as much as possible with these kinds of stocks; they are not market order stocks. One should consider managing their risk in a few ways like position sizing to ensure that if the stock gets cut in half again, you aren't out too badly, or employing options to protect your downside like a collar strategy . Conclusion IREN Limited ( IREN ) is still chugging along since my last review back in March when I covered the fundamentals of the company, but I can only use ""chugging"" in response to its physical business growth. Since then, in the stock market, it has had a huge sell-off and massive run-up, demonstrating just how volatile these kinds of small-cap, cutting-edge companies are, and how risky they can be for one's portfolio. The stock operates in a niche that is prone to bubble behavior, but the chart itself shows that the run-up isn't over yet. While the technicals are not 100% aligned in this, they never are, and I believe that the overall picture is still bullish for IREN. We may actually be finding a floor if the pattern I'm seeing forming in the stock comes true; I've been seeing this pattern in a lot of high-beta stocks lately, which may suggest a pattern among these tech companies, reinforcing the idea that the biggest risk to IREN is currently the pull of the market and less of its fundamentals.

Polygon didn’t rise just because of top-tier tech. It grew fast because it backed solid infrastructure with smart promotion: hackathons, builder support, and big community events. These moves attracted both developers and capital faster than other Layer 1s could react. BlockDAG (BDAG) appears to be using the same strategy, only faster. Its presale has already crossed $325 million. And, as part of its GLOBAL LAUNCH release, users unlock $0.0017 BDAG after three initial purchases at the current price. This isn’t a concept stage project. BlockDAG is already onboarding users and developers before its official coin launch. The plan is simple: merge real marketing with working tools, and then expand from there. Airdrop System Designed for Real Activity & User Growth While most projects use airdrops as simple rewards, BlockDAG uses its 100 million BDAG airdrop to power user activity. This isn’t just about social likes. It includes testnet use, content creation, referrals, and presale actions. Tasks fall into four key areas: Testnet: Users explore the live platform, report bugs, and test smart contracts. Presale: Rewards for purchases, referrals, and using the X1 miner app . Social: Engage in Telegram, post original content, and spread updates. Referrals: Bring new users to earn BDAG coins. It’s designed for real engagement, not passive gains, which appeals to active crypto participants more than casual airdrop hunters. Builder Tools, Mining Hardware, and Expanding User Base Polygon built early traction by helping builders directly. Grants and live support brought in developers before prices jumped. BlockDAG is doing something similar. It has released a no-code contract builder, launched its testnet, and opened dApp tools. More than 18,150 mining rigs across X10, X30, and X100 types have been sold. Shipments begin July 7 for X30 and X100 and August 15 for X10 units. This early hardware use invites both small users and larger groups to join before the coin even trades. The X1 mobile app adds to this push. It’s a tap-to-earn miner already used by over 2 million people. This simple app is growing BlockDAG’s base from the ground up. Strategic Sponsorships Fuel Global & U.S. Market Reach The Inter Milan partnership was not random. It marked the beginning of a larger push. Inter gave BlockDAG visibility across Europe and Asia through football. That was only the beginning. An American sponsorship plan is in the pipeline. While exact details are still unknown, a U.S. media collaboration is expected. This hints at a push into the U.S. market before BlockDAG’s Q4 2025 exchange debut. This mirrors how projects like Avalanche and Coinbase gained traction early. They used wide-scale media, not just for hype, but to build real demand. With $325 million already raised and 23.3 billion coins sold, BlockDAG now aims for a $600 million finish. That would rank it alongside Polkadot and Filecoin in presale history. Here’s the key difference: no VCs, no inside allocations, and no lockups that crash prices post-launch. Instead, nearly 200,000 holders have joined through public access. The current coin price is $0.0080. The launch price is locked at $0.05. If it meets these targets, early buyers could gain massive profits that could reach 4,900%. And, under the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, users can make three purchases at $0.0080 and then buy at $0.0017 for all orders until August 11, bringing back batch 1’s pricing. Real Progress Before the First Trade Among many Layer 1 chains making big promises, BlockDAG stands out by delivering early. It has a live testnet, builder tools, 2M+ miner app users, over 18,150 miners sold, and an active 100M coin airdrop . This project isn’t waiting for momentum; it’s already building it. With a marketing strategy similar to Polygon, Binance, and Avalanche, BlockDAG’s progress feels less like a hope and more like a working plan. Seasoned users know real networks form before a coin launches. BlockDAG is showing that clearly. With the $600 million goal and a U.S. sponsorship media wave coming, the next growth phase is underway. For those looking to back a project that’s doing the real work, BlockDAG could be one of the strongest crypto plays today.

Several analysts pointed to the buy market volume facing downward, signaling caution. However, bulls interpreted the data as a recipe for a stable recovery with the backing of larger miners’ reserves. 5,000 BTC Triggers Halt in Bull Drive Recent miner offloads have paused bullish momentum, lowering retail sentiments for the first time in four weeks. Data shows miners moved 5,000 BTC to exchanges after caving behind the resistance level. The $515 million worth of Bitcoin transferred to exchanges caused flash sales from retail investors while institutional traders remain stable. Historically, outflows from miner reserves to centralized exchanges point to imminent sales. These occur when miners plan to recoup losses over an extended period after a recovery. In the last three weeks, crypto prices have recorded an uptick with trades advancing toward the all-time high. These levels can spur profit-taking from lower reserve miners and traders. “ A significant miner-to-exchange flow was observed around 14:00 UTC on May 15, with the transfer amount exceeding 5,000 BTC. The total amount of BTC transferred from a mining pool to exchange wallets may suggest either the preparation of BTC-collateralized long positions or a potential capitulation by smaller miners,” CryptoQuant wrote. While retail outflows spiked, whale volumes remained almost unchanged. Demand soared in spot Bitcoin ETF products in the same period, as well as an increase in miner reserves. These factors point to growing greed among investors after cooling macro tensions. Last week, exchange outflows added to bullish sentiment as the top crypto closed in double-digit gains. Bitcoin price trades at $102,997, moving sideways today due to recent bear pressure. Is A Reversal On The Horizon? For most traders, jitters in retail markets are temporary or in the natural course of the Bitcoin price cycle. The stability in whale sentiments can be linked to institutional accumulations globally. This month, Chinese textile giant Addentax announced an $800 million foray into digital assets. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has recorded $906 billion, taking the realized capitalization to a new all-time high. Accumulation in the past 10 days makes the next key resistance at $107k before a push beyond the all-time high. On-chain factors backed by increased global adoption can usher in a healthy gain to projected levels.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-28 13:04:34

Judge Annalisa Torres recently rejected the joint motion filed by Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), causing a sharp reaction from traders. XRP’s market cap dropped by almost $5 billion, but the asset quickly recovered. It remained above the $2 support level, suggesting that investors had anticipated this negative outcome and did not panic. Rather than remaining fixated on the lawsuit, market participants are now adjusting their focus toward XRP’s technical position, upcoming token unlocks, and overall sentiment within the crypto space. These factors are expected to play a larger role in determining XRP’s near-term price movement as July 1 approaches. Evaluating XRP’s Current Standing XRP is currently valued at $2.18, with a market cap of $128.91 billion. It has risen 3.85% from yesterday, and shows a 24-hour volume of $3.11 billion. XRP’s dominance sits at 3.97%, up 1.34% from yesterday. This shows its continued relevance despite recent challenges. While some analysts believe XRP is ready to pick a direction , its current technical outlook remains mixed. XRP continues to trade below its 200-day simple moving average, signaling a degree of bearish pressure. Furthermore, recent trading sessions have demonstrated inconsistent momentum, with fewer than half closing in positive territory over the last month. This inconsistency highlights the absence of a clear directional trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A key event to expect is the scheduled release of one billion XRP from Ripple’s escrow, set for July 1. While this recurring release has become a standard feature of XRP’s tokenomics, the influx of new supply still holds the potential to influence price action. Experts believe the escrow system benefits XRP’s price . The digital asset’s inflation rate currently sits at 6.45%, and the upcoming unlock could contribute to selling pressure, especially if market investors remain cautious. XRP Short-Term Direction Investor sentiment toward XRP has improved, with data from Santiment showing the highest positive sentiment in over 17 days. This follows uncertainty around Ripple’s unresolved lawsuit settlement with the SEC. While Bitcoin and Ethereum face declining retail interest, XRP is attracting renewed attention , partly due to expectations tied to DEX growth on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Technically, the RSI sits at 60.48, indicating neutral momentum alongside low trading volume. Heading into July 1, XRP is likely to trade between $2 and $2.2. Upcoming escrow unlock and market activity are serving as key factors influencing price direction. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In fact, there are not many platforms that support mining cryptocurrencies on mobile phones. But in addition to mining cryptocurrencies themselves, some platforms also provide similar functions that meet the needs. Let's explore the Bitcoin mining apps that support Android and IOS in 2025, focusing on the evaluation of each platform and the free promotional rewards that may be provided. This article is personally tested by the author, but some of the evaluations of the community or forum are referenced, and then summarized.

Pros Global facilities with virtual tours NVIDIA-powered mining chips Investment-grade infrastructure Cons Mixed user reviews on support responsiveness 7. Luxor Mining Luxor provides detailed pool statistics across coins like BTC, LTC, DOGE, and ZEN. Its interface supports API integrations and advanced user metrics. Evaluation: Generally positive reception in mining communities, known for higher-than-average payouts and good API support, though less popular among beginners. Recommendation: Use its fixed-reward pools if seeking predictable returns, but monitor hashrate and earnings regularly. Pros Hourly payouts Up to 1,000 subaccounts 2FA and security tools Cons Not as widely known outside the U.S. 8. F2Pool F2Pool supports over a dozen PoW coins and displays real-time difficulty, volume, and price rankings. It also integrates staking options for Solana and ETH. Evaluation: Regarded as a reliable, long-standing mining pool with consistent payouts and strong educational resources. Recommendation: Ideal for long-term miners seeking stable BTC payouts, especially with large-scale operations. Pros Wide variety of coins Daily payout estimates Educational tutorials Cons No rental rig marketplace 9. Binance Bitcoin Mining Binance Bitcoin Mining integrates mining contracts into the Binance app. It features FPPS/PPS+ payout models and displays ROI estimates before purchase. Evaluation: Limited community feedback specifically on Binance's mining contracts, but overall trust in Binance’s brand adds credibility. Recommendation: Double-check energy fee structures and jurisdictional restrictions before purchasing any contracts. Pros Integrated with Binance wallet and trading Clear contract details Responsive support team Cons Varying energy fees by provider ⚠️ Binance mining contracts are subject to regional regulations. Always verify terms before proceeding. 10. KuCoin Pool KuCoin Pool offers pay-per-share bitcoin mining options across BTC, LTC, and select altcoins. It includes lower trading fees for frequent users. Evaluation: Sparse public reviews; however, integration with the KuCoin ecosystem and transparent fee structure are seen as advantages. Recommendation: Best suited for KuCoin users already active on the exchange, though longer-term contract flexibility is limited. Pros Fixed pool fees Support for emerging altcoins Loyalty perks via KuCoin platform Cons Limited contract duration flexibility Conclusion Bitcoin mining in 2025 has evolved into a transparent, mobile-accessible, and highly customizable experience. While many apps claim legitimacy, only a few platforms like MiningToken combine clean energy, real-time contract tracking, and an upfront sign-up bonus. However, investors should always approach these opportunities with caution. All contracts carry risks, and returns depend on variable factors such as network difficulty, market price volatility, and energy costs.

When asked if the date was final, he said, “No, we can do whatever we want. We could extend it. We could make it shorter.” That comment threw the entire trade timetable into question, especially since he didn’t directly mention the July 9 date; he seemed to be talking about July 8, which is when a separate deadline is set to expire. According to CNBC, the July 8 date marks the end of a 90-day tariff pause put in place by Trump back on April 9. That executive order temporarily dropped all country-specific tariffs to a flat 10%. But once those 90 days are over, the original, much steeper tariffs—some as high as 50%—automatically come back unless Trump signs a new order. And as of now, that hasn’t happened. The White House hasn’t announced any revisions to the April order, and the clock is ticking with less than two weeks left. Trump’s original order will auto-trigger higher tariffs The tariffs originally went into effect on April 2, which Trump called “ liberation day .” Those sudden import fees hit countries across the board without warning. Some saw tariffs near 50%. Markets reacted immediately. There was volatility, investor panic, and backlash from governments and companies globally. A week later, Trump signed the April 9 order that paused those rates for 90 days, promising the US would use the time to strike deals with individual countries. But with just days left in the 90-day pause, there’s barely anything to show. The White House had suggested in April that dozens of trade agreements were on the table. But so far, the only real progress has been with China and the United Kingdom, and even those aren’t finished deals. China’s Commerce Ministry said Friday that Beijing and Washington have confirmed the details of a trade framework, not a finalized deal. The U.K. agreement is also being described in the same way; more of a draft than a conclusion. Trump, when asked about the overall progress on Friday, said, “We’ve made a deal with probably four or five different countries.” He added, “We have 200 countries, you could say 200 countries plus,” referring to the list of nations targeted by the original tariff plan. His math confirms what the actual results show: the vast majority of trading partners have no deal and are staring down the barrel of high tariffs again, starting July 8. Trump and his team leave timeline open-ended During his remarks, Trump said the administration is preparing to inform each country about the new tariff rates. “At a certain point, over the next week and a half or so, or maybe before, we’re going to send out a letter,” he said. “We talked to many of the countries, and we’re just going to tell them what they have to pay to do business in the United States, and it’s going to go very quickly.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt backed that up Thursday. “Perhaps it could be extended,” she said when asked about the July deadline. “But that’s a decision for the president to make.” That lines up with Trump’s own remarks. He’s not ruling out pushing the deadline forward—or moving it up. The only thing that seems clear is that there’s no certainty for trade partners, businesses, or the market. Legal challenges are hanging over the entire situation too. In late May, a federal trade court struck down the tariffs, arguing that Trump didn’t have the authority under the law he used to impose them. But that ruling hasn’t taken effect because a federal appeals court quickly froze the decision. For now, Trump’s tariffs remain in place. But if the appeals court lifts the freeze, the whole structure could fall apart. If no updates are made to the executive order, the country-specific tariffs will revert to their original high levels on July 8. That would restart the exact same chain reaction that happened in April—only this time with even fewer trade agreements and a legal ruling hanging in the balance.

We’re proud to partner with a team that shares our compliance-first, innovation-driven values, and we’re thrilled to support Gemini’s rollout of real-world assets to Gemini customers.” Final Thought Gemini is one of the major exchanges in the world to pursue tokenized stocks, driven by its compliance-focused jurisdictions. As the platform expands by offering tokenized US stocks, it plans to pave the way for broader integration between blockchain and global equity markets.

Quality Altcoins Will Lead The Pack In a recent livestream with Real Vision’s co-founder, Coutts highlighted the chances of an altcoin rebound this year. He said there will be one more altcoin jump with high-utility assets spearheading the recovery. This will see coins with growing network activity lead the pace as adoption grows. These assets also have higher trading volumes due to decentralized finance gaining momentum. While there are a plethora of altcoins, Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) dominates 55% of altcoins, while Solana, BNB, and Tron make up 6.89%, 5.69%, and 5.2%, respectively. “I think there will be one more breadth thrust from altcoins. The question is, is it a sustained rally that we will see for six to twelve months… At this stage, I am not too sure, but I do believe that quality altcoins where activity returns, and activity drives prices …we will see a recovery in some of these more high-quality names. I’m expecting by June to see altcoins really start to pick up again.” He explained that altcoins will benefit from a similar rally in Bitcoin in mid-2025. This year, the crypto market has struggled due to tightening macro factors. As a result, Bitcoin’s price is down over 22% from its $111k all-time high. A turnaround in the market could see several altcoins notch 50% gains. However, most traders stress caution amid volatility and uncertain markets. Altcoin Season Determined By Volume The year’s first quarter saw heightened optimism for an altcoin season , a phase marked by lower BTC dominance. While expectations grew, altcoins slipped alongside Bitcoin lowering sentiments. Like Coutts, several analysts have stressed that trading volumes will determine the next altcoin season as opposed to higher prices. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju stated that the altcoin season began with select assets due to the fresh liquidity in those coins. Ultimately, specific digital assets with institutional demand and volumes will accumulate major gains, while sideways trading might continue for the rest.",Altcoins|News|BNB|Cardano|Dogecoin|Ethereum News|SHIB|SHIBA INU|SOL|Solana|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|SOL|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-28 13:13:33

Countries like China, Pakistan, and many others have been looking to integrate crypto into their government operations, but the most pro-crypto approach seems to have come from Bhutan, which is both shocking and impressive for a small economy nation. Why This Is a Good Sign For Cryptocurrencies Globally Among smaller economies, Bhutan has taken one of the most deliberate and unexpected steps toward crypto integration. With a reserve now estimated at $1.3 billion in Bitcoin, Bhutan has built a sovereign position that amounts to roughly 40% of its national GDP. Only the United States and China hold more in absolute terms, but few countries have committed to Bitcoin this deeply relative to their economic size. Bhutan has quietly mined 12,000 $BTC worth $1.3B since 2020, now holding nearly 40% of its GDP in Bitcoin, making it the world’s 3rd-largest state holder. pic.twitter.com/HnnWj5MiqK — Christiaan (@ChristiaanDefi) June 27, 2025 This reserve was not purchased in open markets. It was mined. Bhutan began laying the groundwork in 2019 through a state initiative supported by Druk Holding & Investments and executed through Green Digital, a subsidiary involved in a partnership with Bitdeer. The country used its excess hydropower; nearly all of its electricity comes from renewable sources to run mining operations at scale. That approach gave Bhutan both cost efficiency and environmental credibility at a time when energy use remains a major critique of the crypto sector. The real impact, however, is now being seen in policy. Bitcoin-generated income has reportedly funded public sector salary increases and development projects. With tourism revenues under pressure, this has helped the country avoid fiscal tightening and maintain internal economic momentum. What makes Bhutan’s case notable is not just the reserve size, but its execution and application. It shows how crypto, when managed correctly, can operate as part of a broader fiscal strategy. If other energy-rich nations take cues from Bhutan’s model, it could mark the beginning of a new phase in state-level crypto involvement, one that carries weight well beyond the borders of this small Himalayan economy. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Tokens That May Gain Global Popularity Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Bitcoin Hyper is a Layer 2 protocol that brings smart contract functionality and dApp compatibility to Bitcoin, using a high-speed Solana-based infrastructure to do so. At the center is $HYPER, the native token that supports transaction fees, network governance, staking rewards, and developer ecosystem incentives. The presale launched at a price of around $0.012, raising over $1.2 million so far. Early stakers have seen returns approaching ~475% APY, with mechanisms in place to decrease yield as more capital enters the ecosystem. Token supply caps at 21 billion, aligning with Bitcoin’s supply psychology but operating under a different utility model. What makes Bitcoin Hyper different is that it treats Bitcoin as programmable value, not static reserve. In a world where countries like Bhutan are accumulating Bitcoin through sovereign initiatives, the next logical step is activating those holdings, transforming BTC into working capital that can interact with smart contracts, power lending markets, or be used in DeFi applications. Bitcoin Hyper is purpose-built for that shift. Rather than creating a parallel coin economy, Bitcoin Hyper integrates Bitcoin into modern financial tooling, something even major BTC holders haven’t yet achieved. If the future includes state or institutional BTC use beyond vault storage, it will need infrastructure like this to make Bitcoin responsive, flexible, and useful across chains. The project has already gained recognition and endorsements from pages like 99Bitcoins . In that scenario, $HYPER becomes more than a governance token; it becomes a utility gateway into the next version of Bitcoin’s role in the global economy. Snorter ($SNORT) Snorter combines a meme-layer aesthetic with real utility, using $SNORT to power a Telegram-based trading bot that automates common functions like token sniping, limit orders, honeypot detection, MEV protection, and copy-trading. It is initially built on Solana but is expanding across Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, and Base to ensure broader usability. During presale rounds, the token was priced at about $0.094. Early staking rewards have ranged from ~260% to nearly ~700% APY depending on tier and timing, structured to taper gradually as adoption widens. The fixed supply sits around 500 million tokens. What gives $SNORT relevance beyond traders is its actual functionality. It does not rely on trends or social sentiment alone, it offers tooling that retail traders genuinely need, particularly in fast-paced meme environments where delays can erase gains. It combines automation with defensiveness, a rarity in the meme token category. For countries or funds accumulating Bitcoin as a reserve, like Bhutan, smart exposure to tools like Snorter could serve a tactical purpose. They allow traders, institutions, or even governments to interact with crypto markets through intelligent execution strategies without reinventing infrastructure. The idea is to apply token capital, not just hold it. In this view, $SNORT isn’t just a trading aid, but also a bridge between passive reserves and active market participation. And in a maturing crypto economy, that kind of access is becoming essential. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) The Best Wallet Token is the utility and incentive token behind the Best Wallet platform, which combines secure asset storage with Web3 user analytics, transaction summaries, and identity layers. The wallet itself is built for cross-chain compatibility and supports token, NFT, and dApp interactions from a single interface. The token launched with a supply in the tens of millions, with early trading at prices just above $0.01. It rewards wallet users for actions like staking, transacting, and referring others—structured to promote consistent interaction rather than speculative surges. Where $BEST stands out is in how it links utility to user identity. As Web3 grows, reputation and transaction transparency will become critical for access to on-chain credit, curated token lists, and social staking ecosystems. Best Wallet builds that structure early, offering verified activity scores, audit trails, and behavioral metrics tied to wallet use. In relation to Bhutan’s example, which shows how sovereign crypto integration can be built on clean infrastructure and fiscal application, Best Wallet Token speaks to what comes next: a layer of intelligence that makes wallets not just storage devices, but data-rich access points. If institutions or small economies begin distributing digital asset access through wallets, tokens like $BEST could act as the on-ramp; not just to coins, but to credibility in a blockchain-driven environment. SUBBD ($SUBBD) SUBBD is a Web3 platform designed to monetize the creator economy through AI-powered subscriptions, NFTs, tipping, and loyalty rewards. At its core is the ERC-20 token $SUBBD, which grants access to premium content, voting on feature direction, staking for rewards, and curated early releases of new AI tools—all built to align creator and audience incentives. During its presale phase itself, $SUBBD attracted over 2,000 creators and engaged around 250 million users. The token launched with staking features yielding exceptional returns, encouraging long-term participation. The token’s primary utility lies in everyday engagement, not hype: users stake $SUBBD to unlock content tiers, creators receive rewards through tipping and loyalty mechanics, and the community votes on roadmap initiatives. These features reinforce steady value and real-world usage, rather than speculative swings. Relating this back to sovereign digital asset trends, like Bhutan’s Bitcoin reserve, SUBBD embodies a different use case: where digital assets power human interaction and economic exchange rather than financial speculation. For nations building BTC exposure, SPL-compatible platforms like SUBBD offer a means to diversify digital-asset holdings into ecosystems generating social and economic activity. Imagine a future where governments or institutions deploy Bitcoin reserves into platforms that incentivize creativity, learning, and productivity. SUBBD-style token economies could complement reserve assets, distributing value through creators and communities. In this balanced model, BTC provides the secure financial backbone, while utility tokens power dynamic, sustainable ecosystems, creating a holistic entry point into digital-native economic infrastructure. Conclusion As smaller nations like Bhutan show what’s possible with strategic crypto integration, the global perspective is changing. Bitcoin is no longer just a reserve asset. It is becoming a tool of policy and innovation. The projects discussed above reflect this evolution. Each delivers high-utility, application-driven value aligned with the future of digital finance. They are not speculative distractions but practical frameworks for a maturing ecosystem. With accumulation already underway across markets, early participation in such platforms offers real upside. What we’re witnessing may not be another crypto cycle. It may be the early stages of a structural transformation in how value moves.

The lineup features a broad range of digital assets beyond Bitcoin, including XRP, Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and various crypto derivatives. According to Balchunas, spot ETF applications for XRP and Solana are among the most popular in the current wave, with 10 institutions applying for XRP-based ETFs and six for Solana. These numbers suggest rising institutional interest in diversifying crypto exposure beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. The surge in applications shows growing market demand and a shifting regulatory environment in the U.S. Bitcoin ETFs Draw $3B in 13 Days U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen 13 straight days of inflows , pulling in over $2.9 billion as institutional investors ramp up exposure despite Bitcoin trading sideways near $107,374. Tuesday alone brought $588.6 million in fresh capital, marking the biggest single-day inflow for June. BlackRock’s IBIT led with $163.7 million, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB. Analysts suggest most of the inflows come from long-only investors, as basis arbitrage opportunities remain limited. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs are outperforming gold ETFs, with $3 billion in Bitcoin ETF inflows versus $1 billion in gold ETF outflows over five days, highlighting a shift among investors seeking better hedges against traditional U.S. assets. The rising interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs comes as corporate adoption continues to accelerate despite macro uncertainties. Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC acquired 3,724 Bitcoin for $386 million as part of plans to go public through an SPAC merger, while Japan’s Metaplanet raised $517.8 million on the first day of its ambitious “555 Million Plan,” which targets 210,000 Bitcoin by 2027.

In a recent announcement, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that it dropped its cross-appeal against the SEC, and “closing this chapter once and for all.” As soon as the news broke, XRP jumped more than 3%, and the crypto world lit up with one question: what’s next for XRP? Ripple SEC Legal War Finally Over The Ripple vs. SEC battle started back in 2020 and made many people doubt XRP’s future. Now, with both sides dropping their appeals, Ripple has agreed to pay a $50 million settlement, much lower than the earlier $125 million. This deal also removes the court’s restrictions on Ripple’s XRP sales to institutions, opening new business opportunities. Ripple is dropping our cross appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they’ve previously said.

Lock in. https://t.co/ZsRgDfcpLh — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) June 27, 2025 For XRP holders, this brings long-awaited regulatory clarity. Many now believe Ripple can focus fully on its goal of building the “Internet of Value,” helping money move as easily as information does today. Investors Already Showing Confidence XRP’s price quickly jumped as the news spread. In the past few days, big XRP wallets, often called “whales,” added more coins, pushing total large holdings to about 5.8 billion XRP . On top of that, network activity is up 400% since March, showing people are moving, trading, and using XRP more. Some traders say XRP could soon test the $2.60 mark. If momentum keeps building, a push past $3 might not be too far away — but it depends on fresh catalysts. Hopes for an XRP ETF Rise Many eyes are now on the idea of an XRP ETF . Garlinghouse himself hinted that an ETF approval could come by mid-2025. Meanwhile, Prediction market Polymarket gives this an 78% chance. If it happens, big investors could finally jump in, and that could push XRP’s price higher. What’s Next For XRP? Some analysts believe XRP could rise between 100%–200% from here, possibly hitting $6.99 to $10 if an ETF or Ripple IPO happens. Others are more cautious, saying the current rally might cool off if no new news follows. For now, XRP is trading around $2.20, showing a 5.5% rise in the past 24 hours. However, the price is facing strong resistance near $2.60.

According to his blog post, Buterin said the new digital identity system, which he dubbed “pluralistic identity,” could help protect user privacy while enabling fair participation in digital life. In his latest blog post, Buterin discussed the promise and disadvantages of zero-knowledge (ZK) proof-wrapped IDs, warning that even privacy-preserving systems can carry real risks if they are rigid with the enforcement of one identity per person. He added that many new digital ID projects are using zero-knowledge proofs to let users prove they have a valid ID without giving away personal details. Vitalik Buterin discusses the risks of ZK-wrapped IDs In his post, he made an example of World ID , which has seen more than 10 million users. According to a post made in January by World, which was formerly known as Worldcoin, it had verified 10 million users on its digital identity network, using its network of orbs to collect data to establish proof of their personhood, an identifier that verifies them as human. Other projects include Taiwan’s digital ID project and the European Union initiatives increasingly adopting ZK technology. “ZK-wrapping solves a lot of important problems,” he wrote in his post . However, he warned that “ZK-wrapped ID still has risks,” especially because enforcing one ID per person can undermine pseudonymity and expose users to coercion. This means that platforms could force users into one key entity so that they can track and identify them. This way, they would be able to eliminate the possibility of users maintaining numerous pseudonymous profiles. “In the real world, pseudonymity generally requires having multiple accounts,” he said. Buterin argued that without this flexibility, users could find themselves in a world where all of their activity must de facto be under a single public identity,” increasing dangers from government to employer surveillance. He also rejected the idea of using proof of wealth alone as an anti-Sybil measure, saying it excludes people unable to pay and moves power only among the wealthy. “The theoretical ideal is something in the middle, where you can get N identities at a cost of N²,” he said. Pluralistic identity system to eliminate single control To achieve this approach, Buterin proposed the use of a pluralistic identity system, where no single authority controls identity issuance. He mentioned that it is the “best realistic solution” in this scenario. He explained that it could be explicit, using social-graph-based verification like Circles, or implicit, relying on multiple ID providers like government documents, social platforms, and others, so no one ID has a near-total market share. “Any form of pluralistic identity… is naturally more error-tolerant,” he noted. Buterin also said that this flexibility is expected to help stateless individuals and those unable to access traditional IDs. Ultimately, he argued that the best outcome would be to merge one-per-person identity schemes with social-graph systems to bootstrap diverse, global identity networks. “If their market share gets too close to 100%, they shift the world… to a one-per-person model, which has worse properties,” he warned, noting that only pluralistic identity can balance privacy, inclusivity, and resistance to abuse. Users on blogging platforms have also reacted to the latest blog post, with most of them inputting their opinions. Most of them approved his choice of Circle, noting that it could help users. “Vitalik sees @aboutcircles as one of the most important live experiments in decentralized identity. Circles is born to be an alternative to the traditional money system, but might also represent a pluralistic alternative to top-down identity systems,” a user said.

When asked during a White House press briefing whether he was willing to pull away to help multiple crypto-related bills pass speedily through Congress, which have encountered roadblocks from Democrats who oppose his personal crypto ventures, Trump indicated that he was interested in crypto even before deciding to run for re-election in 2022. “I got involved before I decided to run,” he said . “I was in Bitcoin then, not knowing if I was going to do it a third time.” The President contended that under his leadership, America has dominated the crypto space, helping to build a “very powerful industry.” According to Trump, if the US had not embraced the crypto sector, China or another global competitor likely would have filled the void. “I became a fan of crypto, and to me, it’s an industry. I view it as an industry, and I am president. And if we did not have it, China would, or somebody else would, but most likely China would love to, and we have dominated that industry.” In recent weeks, Democrats have threatened to cancel support for key crypto market structure laws, arguing that the president’s myriad lucrative crypto ventures are a deal-breaker and an inappropriate conflict of interest. The Senate recently passed the landmark GENIUS Stablecoin bill in a 68-30 vote, without proposed amendments from Democratic lawmakers striving to limit a US president’s crypto ties. California Senator Adam Schiff introduced the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act earlier this week. The bill would prevent the financial exploitation of any digital assets by public officials, including the president and the First Family. The proposed legislation followed Trump’s disclosure of $57 million in earnings tied to World Liberty Financial (WLF), the decentralized finance platform backed by his sons. “I don’t care about… I have my kids, and they invest in different things. They do believe in it,” Trump asserted at the press briefing. “But I’m president, and what I did do there is build an industry that’s very important. And you know, if we didn’t have it, China would.” Bitcoin Takes Pressure Off The Dollar President Trump further suggested that Bitcoin is playing a key role in supporting the United States dollar. In his opinion, the alpha crypto “takes a lot of pressure” off the dollar, which is a boon for the country. “I notice more and more of you pay in Bitcoin,” Trump asserted. “People are saying it takes a lot of pressure off the dollar, and it’s a great thing for our country.” He also noted that Bitcoin was creating jobs for Americans. “It’s become amazing,” Trump opined. “It’s the jobs that it produces.”",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-28 13:30:01

This decision brought about major debates in the crypto industry. In support of this decision, Anchorage evaluated stablecoins according to criteria such as regulatory oversight and reserve asset management in its “Stablecoin Security Matrix” report. “USDC, AUSD and USD0 no longer meet Anchorage Digital’s long-term durability criteria,” said Rachel Anderika, Head of Global Operations at Anchorage, in a statement, justifying this decision. Anderika said there is a risk of concentration in the issuance structures behind these assets and that this situation should be taken into account by institutional investors. Anderika noted that Anchorage will now only support stablecoins that are “compliant with transparency, independence, security, and future regulatory expectations.” The decision comes at a time when competition in the stablecoin market is rapidly increasing. The GENIUS Act, recently passed by the US Senate, aims to set clear rules for stablecoin issuers. White House crypto advisor David Sacks said the bill could become law in July if it passes the House of Representatives. Related News: One of the United States' Most Renowned Financial Experts, Ric Edelman, Reveals His Major Shift in Opinion on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies - “Now I Tell My Clients...” Anchorage gave USDC a score of 2 out of 5 in terms of regulatory oversight and reserve management. The report noted that Circle kept about 15% of its reserves in cash in banks, which posed a risk. As will be recalled, USDC briefly fell below $1 with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023. In contrast, S&P Ratings gave USDC a “strong” rating, while crypto-focused Bluechip firm gave USDC a B+ rating. Anchorage’s decision has drawn backlash from key industry figures. AUSD issuer Nick Van Eck accused Anchorage of “spreading misinformation” and concealing its trading interests in the Global Dollar (USDG). USDG is issued by Paxos and backed by a consortium in which Anchorage is a partner. “If this was just a business decision I could understand. However, trying to smear USDC and AUSD with false information is both frivolous and strange,” said Nick Van Eck. Coinbase protocol expert Viktor Bunin called the decision a “poorly prepared smear campaign.” Coinbase, along with Circle, launched USDC in 2018. *This is not investment advice.

The president weaved through numerous topics in his response. “Yeah, well it’s a very funny thing, crypto. So I became a fan of crypto, and to me it’s an industry. I view it as an industry, and I’m president, and if we didn’t have it, China would, or somebody else would, but most likely China. China would love to. And we’ve dominated that industry. It’s a big industry, by the way. In fact, when the stock market went down recently, crypto and Bitcoin, and all of that, went down much less than anybody else as a group. And we’ve created a very powerful industry, and that’s much more important than anything that we invest in. We invest in it, but really, that was an industry that wasn’t doing particularly well. I got involved with it a couple of years ago before the second term – I got involved before I decided to run. I only decided to run because I saw what was happening and Biden was incompetent and the administration was crooked and incompetent, and I was in Bitcoin then, not knowing if I was going to do it a third time. So it’s become amazing, I mean the jobs that it produces and I notice more and more you pay in Bitcoin and people are saying it takes a lot of pressure off the dollar, and it’s a great thing for our country, so I don’t care about investing, you know I have kids and they invest in different things, they do believe in it, but I’m president and what I did do there is build an industry that’s very important. And you know if we didn’t have it, China would.” Earlier this week, US Senator Adam Schiff introduced a new bill that aims to prevent Trump and his family members from enriching themselves via crypto. The potential legislation , titled the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, high-ranking executive branch employees, special government employees and members of Congress from issuing, sponsoring or endorsing digital assets. The ban would last from 180 days prior to an individual’s public services until two years afterward, and it would also extend to officials’ immediate family members. Trump’s recent financial disclosure with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics indicated he pocketed more than $57.3 million worth of income from the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI). Income from Trump’s controversial memecoin, Official Trump, wasn’t listed on the disclosure because it was released in 2025. Ethereum ( ETH ) founder Vitalik Buterin said earlier this year that political coins represented “vehicles for unlimited political bribery.” In a February letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Government Ethics, officials at the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen argued that Trump could be in violation of federal law regulating gifts to government officials.

With user activity, total value locked, and open interest all climbing, momentum is on Wormhole’s side—but weakening bridge volume and a bearish shift in funding rates pose looming threats to the rally’s staying power. Wormhole ( W ) rose to $0.076 on Saturday, its highest level since June 11. The token price jumped after the company inked a partnership with Ripple Labs . This integration will enable multi-chain interoperability with XRP Ledger and XRPL EVM Sidechain. The partnership will enable cross-chain messaging, asset transfers, and multi-chain token issuances. This, in turn, will make XRP Ledger a major player in the decentralized finance and real-world asset tokenization industries. Source: CoinGecko You might also like: BTC holds strong amid volatility, but altcoin momentum fades The Wormhole token has also increased in value as the number of transacting users rose this month. Its users rose to 47,600 this month, up from last month’s low of 38,000. It has jumped to its highest point since April. The total value locked on Wormhole has also jumped to $2.8 billion, up from $2.5 billion in March. The Wormhole price has also jumped as open interest rose to $30 million, its highest level since March 24. A rising open interest is a sign of demand from investors in the futures market. However, the ongoing surge faces two key risks. First, its weighted funding rate has turned red in the past two days, a sign that investors anticipate the future price to be lower than the current one. The other risk is that the bridge volume has plunged in the past few months. Its volume dropped to $426 million this month, down from $2.48 billion in December. Wormhole price analysis W price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart indicates that the W token bottomed at $0.051 on June 23 and subsequently rebounded to $0.074. It has formed a double-bottom pattern with a neckline at $0.01180, its highest point on May 14. A double bottom is one of the most bullish patterns in technical analysis. Wormhole is attempting to move above the 50-day moving average, while the Relative Strength Index has crossed the neutral point of 50. The two lines of the MACD have made a bullish crossover. Therefore, the price may continue to rise, with the next target being the double bottom’s neckline at $0.1180. A drop below the year-to-date low of $0.0511 will invalidate the bullish view.

Ripple And SEC To Withdraw Respective Appeals “Ripple is dropping our cross appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they’ve previously said,” Garlinghouse wrote in a post on X . “We’re closing this chapter once and for all, and focusing on what’s most important— building the Internet of Value. Lock in.” Ripple is dropping our cross appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they’ve previously said. We’re closing this chapter once and for all, and focusing on what’s most important – building the Internet of Value. Lock in. https://t.co/ZsRgDfcpLh — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) June 27, 2025 The announcement comes just a day after U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres denied a joint bid from Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission to slash a $125 million penalty and toss out a permanent injunction imposed against the blockchain payments company last year. That decision followed less than two weeks after the SEC and Ripple asked that the court reduce the civil penalty over illegal XRP sales to $50 million, significantly less than the $2 billion sought under former Chair Gary Gensler. The legal drama between Ripple and the SEC has been going on for years since December 2020, when the regulator accused the XRP-linked firm of raising $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering. In 2023, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP on crypto exchanges did not break securities laws. Torres did, however, rule that other direct sales of the token to institutional investors qualified as securities. Ripple was fined $125 million and banned from similar sales. Both Ripple and the SEC agreed to allow $50 million of the initially-imposed $125 million fine to go to the SEC, with the remaining $75 million to be returned to the San Francisco-based company, though they have encountered pushback in court over the past month. Closed Chapter Clears Way For Spot XRP ETFs XRP was changing hands around $2.19 on Saturday, reflecting a 5% increase over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko . The token is up a whopping 358% over the past year. According to Nate Geraci, the President of ETF Store, the conclusion of the case effectively removes the regulatory hurdle blocking the approval of U.S.-listed spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Over nine asset managers have so far filed for XRP ETF products in the US, including major issuers like Bitwise, ProShares, 21Shares, and Franklin Templeton. Despite the growing XRP ETF filing frenzy, BlackRock — issuer of the largest spot Bitcoin ETF — has yet to submit paperwork for an XRP-based investment vehicle. Geraci believes that with no regulatory obstacles in sight, BlackRock could soon apply with the SEC to introduce an ETF tied to the industry’s fourth-largest crypto by market cap.",Cryptocurrency|News|Brad Garlinghouse|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-28 13:38:11

But while SOL’s climb path remains a topic of debate, a much smaller token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is generating bigger returns in the short term. The token sits at phase 5 of presale for $0.03. Having already smashed through more than $11.3 million raised and indicating more than 12,600 investors, Mutuum Finance is starting ripples. With a bold target of $5 and a current price hovering under $0.05, Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as one of the most watched new cryptocurrency projects of the season. Solana holds at $146 as recovery momentum builds Solana (SOL) is priced at $146, consolidating following institutional attention and renewed on-chain action. Indicators are sharply bullish as long term signals indicate a possible move to the region of $155-$160 should the bullish volume support continue to drive the rally higher. Although the macroeconomic situation and the general atmosphere of the crypto market are the most significant variables, the stable increase in the developer activity and adoption of the meme coins in the Solana ecosystem explain its persistent relevance. In the meantime, with investors moving to evaluate the best DeFi bets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is commanding strong attention in the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale gains momentum and exceeds $11.3 Million Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has reached above 12,600 investors in a presale that exceeds more than $11.3 million. Project hype is at its peak and this is certainly a great sign of the future of the project. MUTM tokens are currently priced at $0.03 in phase 5 but will soar 16.67% in phase 6. The demand is becoming exponentially high and the fact that Mutuum Finance is a game-changer in DeFi is all the more valuable considering that it will be amongst the top-trending crypto investments of 2025. Grab free MUTM, $100,000 giveaway Mutuum Finance is attempting to reward the early supporters it has on its platform and has established a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 participants will be chosen and rewarded with $10,000 MUTM tokens. It will be a reward to the quickly expanding community inside the project and gratitude for early investors. But time’s running out. Mutuum Finance doubles down on trust with $50,000 bug bounty program Most DeFi protocols are too much talk and little action but Mutuum Finance is difficult to keep unsuccessful because of its focus on long-term growth. Following its consistent effort to embrace the culture of security and transparency, Mutuum Finance has officially introduced its Bug Bounty Program in conjunction and support with CertiK, where a reward pool of up to 50,000 USDT will be allocated. The reward is split into four categories: critical, major, minor, and low, so it will be guaranteed that all levels of vulnerability will have its reward. This is another step that proves Mutuum has an active attitude to safety and its commitment to the creation of a reliable financial environment. Solana might go to $1000 in the long run but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking actions at this moment. The token is priced at $0.03 in phase 5 and has gained more than $11.3M+ with 12,600+ investors. With a CertiK audit, $50k bug bounty and $100k giveaway, MUTM has an ambitious $5 target. Apply before Phase 6 takes off.

They’re pushing to meet President Donald Trump’s July 4 deadline, but they still don’t have the 50 votes locked in. Even as John Thune, the Senate GOP leader, pushes hard for floor action by Saturday afternoon, several Republican senators are still uncommitted. Lindsey Graham, who chairs the Budget Committee, published the revised text covering nearly every committee’s contribution, except for the part that matters most right now: the Finance section. That’s where the overhaul of Medicaid and the rewritten tax plan sit. Those pages weren’t finalized in time, even though the Finance Committee met with Elizabeth MacDonough, the Senate Parliamentarian, late Friday night. Her previous rulings shaped most of the updated language, but Graham’s team didn’t complete the final edits before releasing the text . Republicans tweak Medicaid cuts and SALT cap to win votes The new version reflects efforts to please multiple factions within the party. For starters, Republicans kept in a tentative SALT deduction deal with the House, raising the cap from $10,000 to $40,000 for five years starting in 2025, before snapping back. After 2025, the cap rises 1% each year. This deal came after internal fights over whether to preserve the tax break, which mostly benefits higher-income states. It’s part of a larger $4.2 trillion tax cut proposition, which Republicans want passed before the holiday to show alignment with Trump’s economic push. To calm moderate senators, the bill now includes $25 billion for rural hospitals to cushion Medicaid cuts. But Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, called that number too low—she had been pushing for $100 billion. Negotiators also added a one-year delay to the 3.5% cap on Medicaid provider taxes, moving the start date from 2031 to 2032. That tax maneuver is a way for states to get more federal matching funds, and delaying it helps states who’ve built their budgets around it. Another section tweaks the timeline for the hydrogen production tax credit, letting it stay in place through 2028 for any project that starts construction before then. The earlier version had it ending in 2025, and energy lobbyists had been pressing to keep the extension. Republicans also added language to raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, a move designed to prevent a government default that could happen as soon as August. Senate bill kills EV credits, drops court restrictions Late Friday night, the same text confirmed the GOP’s move to eliminate tax credits for electric vehicles. The bill ends the $7,500 credit for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs on September 30. The previous proposal gave new car buyers 180 days and used car buyers 90 days after passage. Now the phaseout is sooner and more absolute. Lease deals for EVs that don’t meet North American assembly requirements are also cut under this bill. Meanwhile, the House GOP version keeps the new EV credit until the end of 2025, and through 2026 for automakers who haven’t sold 200,000 units yet. Those differences could complicate reconciliation between the two chambers, especially if House Speaker Mike Johnson struggles to hold his caucus together when the bill comes up for final approval next week. In a separate section aimed at carmakers, the Senate version also kills fines for not meeting federal fuel economy rules, known as CAFE standards. That rollback is meant to give breathing room to automakers that haven’t met rising fuel targets set under the Biden administration. One provision missing entirely from the updated text would have blocked federal judges from issuing nationwide injunctions unless a financial bond was posted. MacDonough ruled it violated the Byrd Rule, which limits what can pass through reconciliation. So it was cut. Still, the GOP didn’t drop the issue completely. The bill now includes funding for a government study into the cost of those broad injunctions, plus training money to help agencies navigate legal slowdowns when district court rulings hit national policy. The Senate text is far from final. More edits can still be made during debate, and leadership has said they’re willing to amend the bill on the floor if that’s what it takes to lock in votes. But time’s running short.

Quoting Chris Larsen, co-founder and former CEO of Ripple, the statement reads: “In the beginning, we wanted to build a better Bitcoin… and we created XRP.” This powerful reflection offers a fresh reminder of Ripple’s founding vision and how it diverged from Bitcoin’s path to address real-world financial needs. Rethinking Bitcoin’s Limits While Chris Larsen was not part of the original team that built the XRP Ledger, he joined Ripple in 2012, shortly after the protocol had been developed by David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britto . Their goal was clear: to overcome Bitcoin’s limitations—particularly its slow transaction speeds, high energy consumption, and scalability issues. Ripple Co-Founder Chris Larsen reveals: ""In the beginning, we wanted to build a better Bitcoin… and we created XRP."" #XRP #Ripple #Crypto #Bitcoin #BTC pic.twitter.com/iwI6zkeyca — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 27, 2025 What Larsen brought to the table was a compelling business vision. He saw the potential to turn this new technology into the foundation of a company focused on modernizing global finance. While the creators of the XRP Ledger had engineered a more efficient blockchain, Larsen was instrumental in turning that innovation into a commercial solution. XRP: Designed for Utility, Built for Speed Unlike Bitcoin, which was envisioned as an alternative to traditional financial systems, Ripple, with Larsen at the helm, took a collaborative approach. The mission wasn’t to replace banks, but to work with them. XRP was positioned as a bridge currency, enabling faster, cheaper, and more reliable cross-border payments. Ripple’s enterprise tools, including xCurrent and xRapid, used the XRP Ledger’s speed and efficiency to facilitate instant settlement across fiat currencies. XRP served as the liquidity solution, moving value between parties in seconds, eliminating the need for pre-funded accounts and costly intermediaries. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This approach allowed Ripple to build real partnerships with financial institutions across the globe, transforming XRP from just another cryptocurrency into a cornerstone of institutional blockchain adoption. A Ledger That Stands the Test of Time Today, more than a decade later, the XRP Ledger continues to deliver on its original promise. It remains one of the fastest and most energy-efficient blockchains in existence. Beyond payments, the ledger now supports stablecoins like RLUSD, asset tokenization, and Ethereum-compatible smart contracts through its EVM sidechain. Ripple’s global presence has also grown. The company has secured regulatory licenses across major financial jurisdictions, expanded into key regions like Europe and Asia-Pacific, and continues to play a central role in blockchain-based financial infrastructure. A Vision That Still Matters Xaif’s resurfacing of Larsen’s quote is more than nostalgia; it’s a timely reminder of XRP’s mission. The idea of “building a better Bitcoin” was never about rivalry; it was about evolution. Thanks to the technical innovation of its creators and the strategic leadership of Larsen, XRP was purpose-built for real-world finance. And over a decade later, that purpose is more relevant than ever. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Many of these projects remain undervalued compared to their global counterparts, presenting compelling investment opportunities. In this context, ChatGPT has identified two standout U.S. cryptocurrencies worth considering now. Stellar (XLM) Stellar ( XLM ), based in San Francisco, focuses on cross-border payments and asset tokenization. It has formed strategic partnerships with major institutions, including MoneyGram and several central banks. Despite strong institutional support and solid fundamentals, Stellar remains undervalued relative to competitors like XRP . Technically, XLM is approaching a bullish order block around the $0.25 level, an area of high-time frame support.

Once a standout performer, the token has lost steam as sentiment shifts and price action turns decisively negative. While some traders are still watching for potential rebounds, many analysts are now calling for a breakdown, warning that the current structure could give way to deeper losses if key support levels fail to hold.

Some investors view the dip as a healthy retrace in a broader uptrend, while others see it as the start of a more extended correction. Top analyst Ali Martinez has added to the cautious outlook, noting that ONDO is breaking out of an ascending channel to the downside—an often bearish signal. This pattern suggests that momentum is weakening and that the token could soon test lower demand zones. With ONDO hovering near key technical levels and volume thinning, the coming days will be critical. If the breakdown continues, the price could revisit earlier consolidation areas. For now, bearish pressure dominates, and bulls must defend support convincingly to prevent further downside. Bulls Struggle To Hold Structure As Risks Grow As the broader altcoin market braces for a decisive move, ONDO remains trapped in a bearish structure, unable to establish clear demand. Bulls have struggled to reclaim momentum or push price above critical supply zones needed to maintain the long-term uptrend. With sellers dominating and key support levels under pressure, ONDO’s technical structure appears fragile. Despite recent weakness, some market participants remain cautiously optimistic about ONDO’s longer-term potential. Macro narratives around real-world asset tokenization continue to support fundamental interest, but short-term price action remains a challenge. The inability to hold above prior consolidation ranges suggests that buyers are not yet stepping in with enough conviction to flip the trend. Ali Martinez has raised alarms by highlighting a concerning technical development: ONDO is breaking out of an ascending channel—this time to the downside. Historically, this pattern signals a shift in market structure and sets the stage for more aggressive downside moves. Martinez’s outlook points to a potential slide toward the $0.29 level, which would mark a significant breakdown from current prices. For now, ONDO trades in a vulnerable position. If bulls fail to reclaim higher levels and restore momentum, the altcoin risks accelerating its decline. However, if sentiment shifts and broader market strength returns, ONDO could still recover in the coming months.

The current price structure on the 3-day chart shows a consistent downtrend, with lower highs and lower lows forming since the March peak. Price has now broken below the prior consolidation zone, signaling growing bearish momentum. The rejection from the $1.00 psychological level earlier this quarter added to downward pressure, and the break of the $0.80 level confirms that bulls are losing control of short-term structure. If ONDO continues to trade below both moving averages, it may struggle to find solid demand in the near term.

A breakdown below $0.70 could accelerate the fall, potentially targeting the $0.60–$0.50 range where previous demand clusters formed in late 2023. For bulls to regain momentum, ONDO must reclaim the 50-day SMA and close above $0.85. Until then, the chart favors the bears, and the trend suggests caution for long positions.

Sharing a detailed weekly chart, Amelie pointed out that XRP is mirroring a price behavior last seen in Bitcoin before its run toward $100,000. According to her, “It’s just a matter of time until XRP breaks out to a new all-time high.” The chart highlights a clear price-to-MACD divergence. Despite XRP’s price remaining mostly stable above the $2 mark for several months, the MACD indicator has remained bearish since early March. Experts are convinced that an XRP breakout is imminent , and this divergence, historically considered a potential reversal signal, suggests that bearish momentum may be weakening even as the price consolidates. #XRP IS MIRRORING A BULLISH PATTERN LAST SEEN IN BTC BEFORE ITS SURGE TO $100K IT‘S JUST A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL XRP BREAKS OUT TO A NEW ALL-TIME HIGH pic.twitter.com/JZpLyAOqnL — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) June 27, 2025 XRP Technical Setup Reflects Historical Patterns The price chart displays XRP forming lower highs while holding above the $2 support level. This horizontal support, paired with a descending resistance line, forms a classic consolidation pattern. The MACD histogram turned bearish in March 2025 and has since flashed red, indicating that momentum has remained negative. However, the price refusing to break down further despite this persistent bearish MACD is significant. This is the same kind of setup seen in Bitcoin before its breakout towards $100,000 , a comparison that Amelie directly referenced. The implication is that XRP might be preparing for a similar move, especially as the MACD divergence signals an underlying shift in momentum that price action has not yet reflected. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Community Eyes a Potential Breakout Amelie’s assertion that “it’s just a matter of time” reflects a growing sentiment among technical traders who are watching this setup unfold. XRP’s ability to hold above $2 despite the bearish MACD is seen as a sign of strength. The asset also remained above this level despite negative developments in Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC . The chart also shows that sellers have been unable to push the price below this key level for several weeks, suggesting that buyers are quietly absorbing supply. Eyes on the Next XRP Move The chart has yet to confirm a breakout, but the setup is drawing interest from technical traders. The price-MACD divergence is a pattern that has often preceded major crypto moves, and XRP holding above $2 despite persistent bearish MACD signals is notable. XRP is currently trading at $2.18, and increasing whale activity suggests that traders are watching for a positive signal, such as an MACD shift or a breakout above the descending trendline, which could validate Amelie’s comparison to Bitcoin’s historic surge.
