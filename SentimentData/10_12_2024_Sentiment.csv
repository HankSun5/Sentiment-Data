Analyzing Bitcoin’s bull market signals,https://crypto.news/from-100k-to-250k-analyzing-bitcoins-bull-market-signals/,"Who would have thought we’d see Bitcoin shoot through the roof this quickly, soaring past $100K, albeit retreating slightly at present? As we move forward into 2025, the main question on our minds is: what lies ahead? Is Bitcoin ( BTC ) a bubble about to burst, or are we on track for $150,000–$200,000 soon? Are there any rational tools to predict its trajectory, or are we left to just play guessing games? From what I’ve observed, the fog starts to lift when you examine on-chain and technical indicators, while also factoring in the macro perspective. Let’s layer these three types of analysis in this article to see what picture emerges for Bitcoin’s next move. Table of Contents Extreme greed, rising active addresses, and record hash rate Weekly Golden Cross signals bull market with $150K-$250K potential RSI signals overbought conditions, hints at pullback or consolidation Fibonacci levels and Bollinger Bands signal key support and potential cooling Visualizing Bitcoin’s market behavior through key indicators Potential crypto space developments in 2025 Closing thoughts Extreme greed, rising active addresses, and record hash rate The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is currently at 78, indicating Extreme Greed, which often signals potential tops in the short term. However, sustained levels of extreme greed during bull markets often align with parabolic price increases before final peaks. This typically precedes short-term pullbacks due to market exuberance, which appears to be what we’re witnessing now as Bitcoin’s price hovers around the $100K level. Crypto Fear & Greed Index | Source: Alternative.me The number of active addresses is increasing and, as of Dec. 8, stands at 855,153, suggesting heightened interest and usage of the Bitcoin network. Number of active BTC addresses | Source: Glassnode As of Dec. 9, 2024, Bitcoin’s hash rate is approximately 850.70 EH/s, reflecting a significant recovery from recent fluctuations but remaining below its all-time high of 949.98 EH/s, recorded on Nov. 26, 2024. While the current hash rate hasn’t yet reclaimed the ATH, this sustained strength reflects miner confidence and network security—long-term bullish signals. Bitcoin’s price tends to follow the hash rate; the more confident miners are about price appreciation, the less likely they are to sell. BTC hash rate | Source: CoinWarz Weekly Golden Cross signals bull market with $150K-$250K potential The weekly Golden Cross, where the 50-week moving average crosses above the 200-week MA, is a highly significant signal for long-term investors because it often marks the start of major bull markets and the conclusion of prolonged bearish phases. The previous instance of this signal occurred when Bitcoin recovered from the 2018 bear market and eventually surged to an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021. Mirroring its behavior in previous bull cycles, this signal reappeared in early 2024 and preceded Bitcoin’s parabolic rise to its recent all-time high of $103,647. Previous bull cycles following weekly Golden Crosses have led to gains of 300%–600%. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin could potentially reach $150,000 to $250,000 before the next major cycle correction. Meanwhile, the next Golden Cross is unlikely until 2026 or 2027, assuming Bitcoin undergoes a complete cycle of price appreciation, correction, and consolidation. BTC Golden & Death Cross pattern | Source: TradingView RSI signals overbought conditions, hints at pullback or consolidation On the weekly timeframe, the Relative Strength Index is at 74.47, consistent with overbought conditions. However, this does not imply a trend reversal right away but rather reflects the possibility of a short-term pullback or a period of sideways price action. In the past, many bull cycles saw similar RSI readings, followed by temporary pullbacks that were then succeeded by renewed rallies to higher highs. In the 2021 bull cycle, the RSI reached similar levels multiple times before peaking above 90, after which Bitcoin experienced a significant correction. Assuming Bitcoin stays in the most recent consolidation range around $100K and the RSI retraces back to a healthier range of 60–65, the next leg upward could occur. A healthy correction of 10%–20% or a sideways period would allow the markets to reset before experiencing sustained growth. For reference, a 10% correction from the all-time high of $103,647 would bring Bitcoin’s price to approximately $93,282. Relative Strength Index | Source: TradingView Fibonacci levels and Bollinger Bands signal key support and potential cooling Fibonacci retracement levels, used in technical analysis to identify potential support and resistance zones, help indicate where a price might retrace before continuing its trend. Based on the chart below: Key Levels: $71,858 (0.618): Major retracement level, acting as a strong support zone (a 30.67% pullback from the all-time high of $103,647). $103,135 (0.786): Significant resistance zone, near the all-time high. Bitcoin’s price is currently trading slightly below the upper Bollinger Band, signaling strong bullish momentum. However, this position also indicates potential overextension, as prices often retrace or consolidate when deviating significantly from the midline (20-week simple moving average, currently at $71,858). A pullback to $71,858 or further consolidation near the current price of $99,249 would represent a normal cooling-off period within the Bollinger Band framework and prepare the market for potential further gains. Fibonacci retracement levels & Bollinger Bands | Source: TradingView Visualizing Bitcoin’s market behavior through key indicators To further visually represent Bitcoin’s market behavior, let’s look at this colored chart below. It includes a color-coded bar at the top that reflects RSI conditions. The currently visible purple and green color blocks suggest periods of oversold or bullish divergence, reflecting bullish momentum and aligning with RSI overbought levels. The second bar shows market structure trends (e.g., ranging, bullish, or bearish). From the chart, we see green blocks that suggest the market is in a bullish phase, confirming breakout behavior. Next, the main oscillator displays the Awesome Oscillator with divergences and pivot points, where the green peaks above zero and brown regions below confirm positive momentum and bullish pivots. The secondary oscillator below the AO displays similar momentum indications, with positive bars (green above zero) suggesting accelerating upward momentum and a strong bullish bias. Bitcoin Rainbow Indicators | Source: TradingView Potential crypto space developments in 2025 Post-halving supply shock, increasing retail and institutional participation, institutional accumulation (companies like MicroStrategy and other corporate treasuries adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset) could push demand for it to new highs. The proportion of institutional investors will likely grow, stabilizing price movements but also making Bitcoin more correlated with traditional markets. Bitcoin’s dominance (currently around 55%) could rise further as investors favor its “digital gold” narrative over altcoins, especially if regulatory scrutiny tightens around smaller tokens. Bitcoin wallet growth will continue as adoption in emerging markets increases, with Bitcoin used as a hedge against local currency devaluation. Major corporations could start settling cross-border transactions in Bitcoin, while in regions with high inflation or de-dollarization trends central banks may increase interest in Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Countries like the U.S., the EU, and the UAE are likely to finalize crypto-friendly regulations , while other jurisdictions may clamp down on decentralized finance and self-custody to maintain control over financial systems. Closing thoughts With a loud explosion of excitement, Bitcoin shattered the $100K barrier, an achievement deemed nothing short of astonishing. Technical indicators, including the weekly Golden Cross and RSI, point toward the possibility of further growth, with projections suggesting a potential climb to $150K–$250K in this bull cycle. However, a healthy period of consolidation or correction would likely provide a stronger foundation for future price action. By 2025, Bitcoin may achieve what was once considered nearly impossible—establishing itself as a major player in the global financial system.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2024-12-09 23:01:13

In a recent X thread, Hougan explained that the regulatory uncertainty is hurting the industry and preventing it from reaching its full potential. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan Stance On Crypto Regulation Clarity Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan pointed out that the U.S. regulatory framework divides financial assets into two categories: securities and commodities. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates securities, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversees commodities. According to Hougan, this division exists because securities often have insiders—entities that hold crucial information unavailable to the public. In contrast, commodities like gold or oil do not have insiders in the same way. This is why they are regulated differently, with the CFTC focusing on ensuring fair markets rather than requiring detailed financial disclosures, as the SEC does for securities. In his X thread, the Bitwise CIO emphasized that decentralized projects, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, cannot have traditional insiders due to their inherent design. These projects are decentralized by nature, meaning there are no central authorities or entities with inside information. Therefore, attempting to classify cryptocurrencies as securities, as is often done in current U.S. regulatory discussions, does not align with the reality of how these networks function. Echoing Hougan’s sentiment, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse had also criticized current crypto regulatory frameworks , arguing that existing securities laws do not align with the technological advancements crypto represents. Decentralization and Regulation Challenges The core idea behind cryptocurrency is decentralization, which is a challenge when it comes to traditional regulatory frameworks. For example, Hougan explained that traditional securities require disclosures like financial statements or ownership structures to prevent insiders from taking advantage of the public. However, in decentralized networks, there is no single entity to disclose such information, making it difficult to fit them under current securities laws. As Hougan points out, the problem is not that crypto lacks transparency but that the current regulatory approach doesn’t consider the unique nature of blockchain technology. Instead of trying to fit crypto into outdated frameworks, Hougan advocates for a more tailored regulatory approach that takes into account the decentralized nature of these projects. This would ensure that investors are protected while allowing for innovation to thrive. The Case for CFTC Regulation One key point Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan made is that instead of trying to regulate decentralized crypto projects as securities under the SEC, there is a growing argument to have the CFTC oversee them. He explained that the CFTC’s focus on creating fair markets, rather than requiring insider disclosures, makes it a more appropriate regulatory body for decentralized networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Hougan pointed out that some in the industry, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse , have argued for CFTC regulation. They believe that the SEC’s current stance on crypto as securities is not only ineffective but also counterproductive. Meanwhile, Garlinghouse took issue with former SEC official John Reed Stark’s claims that cryptocurrencies, including Ripple’s XRP, are securities. Garlinghouse strongly disagreed, calling Stark’s comments “provably false” and asserting that XRP is not a security. Concurrenctly, he criticized the lack of media fact-checking, pointing out that the segment omitted crucial parts of his interview, including his clarification that XRP is not a security under current laws. Subsequently, the US SEC’s strict approach, according to Matt Hougan, could stifle innovation and harm the industry, especially when good projects are caught in the regulatory crossfire alongside bad actors.

Currently, XRP trades between $1.60 and $2.67. The coin is approaching its nearest resistance level at $3.00. Breaking through this point could lead XRP to the next resistance level at $3.61. On the flipside, the closest support level is at $0.9099, which could help stabilize the price if it starts to fall. Technical indicators provide further insight. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.54, slightly above the 100-day average of $2.42, suggesting a potential uptrend in the short term. The RSI is at 56.65, indicating that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic value is 50.66, reflecting a neutral stance. A MACD level of 0.0159 suggests continued price increases for XRP. You might also like: Experts highlight XRP, Cardano, PEPE, and XYZVerse as top bets Pepe Pepe has been on a remarkable run lately.

Dogecoin: From meme to market contender Dogecoin launched in 2013 as a playful alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply and generates 10,000 new coins every minute. While originally considered just a meme coin, Dogecoin surged in value in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market cap exceeding $50 billion. This growth was largely driven by social media buzz, particularly endorsements from Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s popularity underscores the power of community and social media in shaping financial markets. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin’s appeal continues to hinge on social media influence and overall market sentiment.

Launched without transaction taxes, it maintains a pure meme coin identity without utility features. In mid-2023, it reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion, attracting significant attention in the crypto community and sparking a meme coin trend. Pepe features a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and a redistribution system to reward long-term holders. Its roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. As an ERC-20 token, PEPE benefits from Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake security. It is available on platforms like Uniswap, Binance, and KuCoin. PEPE’s popularity and community support contribute to its prominence in the current market cycle. Dogwifhat Dogwifhat is a new meme coin on the Solana blockchain, inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. WIF stands out among dog-themed tokens in the crypto space, focusing on creating a sense of community and fun. In the current market cycle, interest in meme coins continues and WIF’s popularity is growing. The coin leverages Solana’s fast and low-cost transactions, which may attract users. Its appeal lies in the combination of meme culture and blockchain technology, which some investors find intriguing. BONK BONK is another meme coin on the Solana blockchain, featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. After a Coinbase listing, BONK surged over 100%. 50% of Bonk’s supply was airdropped to Solana’s NFT and DeFi participants, serving as a “community coin.” In mid-December 2023, BONK was the third-largest meme coin by market cap, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like a high total supply and the volatile nature of meme coins, BONK’s integration into the Solana ecosystem and involvement in dApps like BonkSwap make it a notable player. In the current market cycle, BONK shows potential due to its community focus and ecosystem integration. Conclusion Although DOGE, PEPE, WIF, and BONK may have limited immediate potential, DOGEN stands out. Tailored for those pursuing the best in life, it embodies luxury and success. With an expected 700% presale growth and potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN follows the successful paths of tokens like BONK and WIF. It seeks to gather a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters. For more information on DOGEN, visit their website , Twitter , or Telegram .

On Monday, these analysts raised the price target for Coinbase Global, Inc’s stock COIN to $420 per share. The revised estimate represents a notable increase from the firm’s $375 target. This increase reflects the growing optimism around Coinbase’s performance. This is largely driven by strong activity in the crypto market, particularly in December. Crypto Market Activity Drives Coinbase Price Target Increase The analysts attributed the boost to a major surge in retail activity within the crypto market. The exchange’s trading volumes are on track to reach record levels. This makes it one of the most active months for crypto trading in Coinbase’s history. The analysts pointed to Bitcoin’s volatility, particularly as its price approached $100,000, as a key factor driving the surge in market activity. They also highlighted the growing interest in altcoins , contributing to the boost. This combination of factors has led to a significant increase in trading volume across the crypto market. Coinbase’s Strong Year and Surge in Share Price Coinbase’s stock has soared more than 80% in 2024, reflecting the broader growth in the crypto market. The company saw a significant sharp uptick in its share price. This surge follows Donald Trump’s unexpected victory in November’s presidential election. Trump’s victory catalyzed a rally across digital assets, pushing Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark. This sparked renewed investor interest in crypto. Many investors view Coinbase’s stocks as an easy way to access the crypto market. Its strong infrastructure and market dominance make it a popular choice for those wanting to profit from crypto’s rise without managing digital assets directly. Looking Ahead: Strong Predictions for Q4 and 2025 Needham’s analysts expressed optimism about Coinbase’s financial trajectory. The analysts forecasted significant results for Q4 2024 and into 2025. Needham’s analysts predicted that Coinbase will continue to post strong financial results in the near future. For the fourth quarter of 2024, they predict the company will report $435 billion in trading volume and generate $2.1 billion in revenue. They expect the company’s stock earnings to reach $2.37 per share. Looking ahead to 2025, they forecast the company will earn $8.9 billion in revenue and report earnings per share of $9.61. Despite these optimistic predictions, Coinbase’s stock fell 8% on Monday, trading at $316.01 by midday. However, this dip does not overshadow the strong growth the company has experienced this year. Its share price has surged from under $200 to over $300, especially following the election. This highlights the strong momentum behind the company’s stock.

Or how Cosmos is shaking things up with its new interoperability features that connect blockchains like never before? These breakthroughs are turning heads in the crypto world. Amidst these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) emerges as a fresh contender with a bold vision. Unlike others, Qubetics addresses real-world issues that have held back blockchain adoption. With its presale already attracting attention, $TICS is a strong pick for anyone looking for the best coins with 1000X potential . Qubetics Redefines Blockchain Development with QubeQode IDE Qubetics is set to change the game with its innovative QubeQode IDE , an all-in-one tool for simplifying blockchain application development. Whether you’re a tech-savvy entrepreneur or someone with no coding experience, this platform empowers users to create decentralised applications with ease. Imagine a small retail business wanting to launch a blockchain-based loyalty programme. Instead of hiring expensive developers, the owner can use QubeQode’s drag-and-drop features to create a smart contract and manage customer rewards effortlessly. Or picture a logistics company needing better transparency for supply chains. QubeQode provides form-based configurations that allow managers to track goods and authenticate records—all without dealing with complex code. By offering pre-built blockchain functionalities, like token management and user authentication, and a library of pre-written code snippets, QubeQode eliminates the barriers that often keep businesses from exploring blockchain solutions. Qubetics has already sold over 300 million $TICS tokens to more than 8,000 holders, raising $5.3 million in its 12th presale stage. Currently priced at $0.031, $TICS is set to see a 10% price jump in the 13th stage starting this weekend. Each stage lasts just seven days, wrapping up every Sunday at midnight. Now, let’s look at the numbers. An investment of $36,000 at the current price would yield approximately 1,161,290 $TICS tokens. If the price reaches $0.25 by the presale’s end, that investment could grow to $290,322—equating to a 703.21% ROI. Post-presale projections suggest even higher gains, with the token potentially reaching $15, offering returns of 48,092.91%. To learn more about this project, take a look at this video . Litecoin’s Upgrades and Expanding Appeal Litecoin has long been known as Bitcoin’s “silver,” but its recent developments are helping it carve out its own unique identity. With faster block times and reduced transaction fees, Litecoin is positioning itself as a go-to option for everyday payments and digital transfers. The latest upgrade enhances its transaction processing capabilities, making it a reliable alternative for merchants looking for quick settlements. Its focus on scalability and reduced energy consumption also aligns with growing demands for eco-friendly crypto solutions. Litecoin is also gaining traction in cross-border transactions, providing a cost-effective and efficient way to transfer money internationally. With its robust network and practical use cases, Litecoin continues to solidify its position in the market as a high-potential investment. Cosmos Connects Blockchains with Seamless Interoperability Cosmos is taking blockchain communication to the next level with its new interoperability features. By allowing blockchains to share data and assets seamlessly, Cosmos eliminates the silos that have long hindered blockchain innovation. This development is a game-changer for developers and users alike. Decentralised apps can now operate across multiple networks, opening up endless possibilities for creating new solutions. For example, financial apps can leverage data from multiple chains, offering users a more connected and efficient experience. Cosmos’s focus on scalability and usability ensures its place as a forward-thinking platform. Its commitment to interoperability is set to attract more developers and users, further boosting its adoption in the blockchain space. Which Coin Offers the Best 1000X Potential? Qubetics, Litecoin, and Cosmos each bring unique strengths to the table. While Litecoin focuses on fast transactions and secure payments, Cosmos excels in blockchain interoperability. However, Qubetics stands out with its QubeQode IDE and its ability to simplify blockchain adoption across industries. For those eyeing exponential growth, Qubetics’ $TICS token is hard to ignore. Its presale offers a promising entry point, and its innovative solutions make it a contender for the best coins with 1000X potential. Just remember to do your research and invest wisely in this dynamic and ever-evolving market.

If Amazon embraces digital assets, it will join other business titans exploring the inclusion of Bitcoin in their asset portfolios. Related Reading: Countdown To $5 XRP: Engineer Predicts Milestone On ‘Strong Fundamentals’ Bitcoin As Financial Reserve Option Shareholders of Amazon urged the online retail store to evaluate the possibility of adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, saying that the firstborn cryptocurrency could enhance the investors’ value in the long term because it is one way of protecting it from inflation. A US-based think tank told Amazon to assess the prospect of using a portion of its financial reserve to hold Bitcoin to increase its shareholder’s value and fight off inflation. According to a recommendation made by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), the shareholders of the company are asking its Board to investigate if including cryptocurrencies into the treasury of the online retail store serves the best long-term interests of shareholders. HISTORY: SHAREHOLDERS ARE PETITIONING $2.3 TRILLION AMAZON TO BUY #BITCOIN BTC IS IN THE BEST “LONG-TERM INTEREST OF SHAREHOLDERS” 🚀 pic.twitter.com/Nj2wCNrVUn — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) December 9, 2024 The NCPPR submitted the shareholder proposal to Amazon to consider the crypto strategy during the company’s 2025 annual shareholders’ meeting. The American think tank suggested that Amazon should assess the benefits of holding some Bitcoin, encouraging the company to allot even 5% of its $585 billion assets to the cryptocurrency. “Though Bitcoin is currently a volatile asset – as Amazon stock has been at times throughout its history – corporations have a responsibility to maximize shareholder value over the long-term as well as the short-term,” NCPRR stated in the document. The researchers said that including some Bitcoins can diversify the company’s balance sheet, solving this problem without taking on too much volatility. Fighting Inflation The NCPRR said that the inflation rate in the US is going up, adding that cash and bonds are no longer the best approach to protect Amazon’s money. The US-based think tank cited that in the last four years, the average inflation rate in the country is pegged at 4.95%, which even went up to 9.1% in June 2022. It added that the true inflation rate is significantly higher, saying that several studies showed that it is nearly double the Consumer Price Index on occasion. “Amazon should – and perhaps has a fiduciary duty to – consider adding assets to its treasury that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short term,” NCPPR remarked. Simple. Accept bitcoin payments? 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/ud5PVNYHrj — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) December 8, 2024 Bitcoin A Good Option The NCPPR believes that Amazon could preserve billions of dollars of shareholder value by simply holding Bitcoin. The researchers explained that the alpha crypto has been increasing in value unlike cash and bonds whose value is lower than the “true inflation rate”, adding that the digital asset surged by 130% this year, which is performing better than bonds.

He shared his thoughts via a LinkedIn post. Nearly 75% of available Bitcoin is held by 2% of its addresses According to the presentation, a paltry 2% of BTC addresses hold 74% of the digital asset. This highly concentrated power, Aggarwal says, contradicts BTC’s founding principles. He explained: Bitcoin was supposed to be decentralized, step away from the central banks, a freedom from authorities. Do you know it is actually the opposite of that? ~ Aggarwal The analyst also said the concentration could spell trouble for the coin and its network should the few BTC whales decide to dump it. He gave the example of an unnamed Chinese firm that triggered a $649 million flash crash when it sold its holdings. Contrasting thoughts on BTC decentralization Aggarwal’s post received a lot of comments on the issue with some people criticizing his claims while others supported him. Maureen Salim is one of those in support. She depicted the 2% as dragons guarding the gold (BTC). To her, investing in BTC is a high-stakes poker game in which small-scale traders are the chips. She agreed they’d suffer most of the whales decided to sell their stashes. But to Olivier C., Aggarwal was missing the point. He explained that by decentralization, Bitcoiners meant the consensus protocol, which protected the BTC platform. Meanwhile, distribution refers to the amounts held by the wallets. He added that the anti-BTC propaganda was TradFi’s way of continuing to control the financial system. Olivier insisted that BTC was the key to unlocking the free economy. What next for BTC decentralization? The debate on BTC decentralization has remained thorny for a long time. However, it’s coming back to the fore following increased interest in the asset by institutional investors. Some say that shift is beneficial to the coin as it shows the confidence of large-scale investors in BTC. Meanwhile, other crypto users are wary that the entry of big-monied players in the space makes the coin inaccessible to retailers. As the debate rages, there’s a growing need to audit Bitcoin’s evolution to ensure it stays true to the creator’s intentions.

These tokens have gone from niche internet jokes to major players with life-changing potential, sparking attention from seasoned traders and everyday dreamers alike. Think of them as that surprise street snack you grab during a long day—unexpected, exciting, and exactly what you needed when you least expected it. And right now, the market is abuzz with opportunities that are shaping up to be some of the best meme coins for massive return potential. BTFD Coin is one of the standout names on this list, as its presale has proven to be a roaring success. With 44 billion tokens sold and over $2.6 million raised, this token is creating waves that investors can’t ignore. At its current stage, priced at $0.0001, BTFD Coin’s potential price surge could position it as a frontrunner for anyone aiming to get their hands on the best meme coins for massive return potential. Neiro and Non-Playable Coin are also stepping into the spotlight, offering unique opportunities that are exciting investors hungry for explosive returns. Whether it’s meme culture, community engagement, or just sheer market momentum, these coins are riding trends that could change the game for investors. Let’s break down these coins and see what makes them stand out. BTFD Coin: A Presale That Proves the Hype Is Real BTFD Coin has had quite the journey. Its presale numbers are nothing short of legendary—44 billion tokens in the bag and $2.6 million raised. That’s a lot of investor confidence, and it paints a picture of how much potential this token has going forward. The price currently sits at $0.0001, but here’s where things get exciting: analysts are projecting that BTFD Coin could climb to $0.0006 after its launch. That’s a hefty price jump and makes it one of the best meme coins for massive return potential. Think about this—if you were to take a bold step and drop $10,000 into BTFD Coin at this stage, you’d secure a jaw-dropping 100 million BTFD Coins. Now, if it climbs to $0.0006, your initial $10,000 would turn into a cool $60,000. And let’s not forget that BTFD Coin offers a staking reward system averaging a staggering 90% APY . This token isn’t just about market trends; it’s backed by a vibrant community (known as the Bulls Squad), strong staking opportunities, and an innovative approach to the market. If you’re on the hunt for exciting, trendsetting opportunities, BTFD Coin is a no-brainer. Neiro: The Next Market Challenger with a Vision Neiro is the cool little sister of Doge, carrying forward the spirit of meme coin culture while carving out its own path. Adopted by the same woman who previously owned Kabosu—the dog behind the iconic Doge meme—Neiro represents heritage and community spirit. Neiro made headlines as the first meme coin to deploy on the Ethereum blockchain, capturing the attention of Vitalik Buterin on August 4th, 2024 during the New Moon. Vitalik confirmed a generous donation of over $500,000 to an animal welfare fund shortly after, marking the second time he has interacted with a meme coin (the first being the SHIB token in 2021). Originally abandoned and sent to a stray shelter, Neiro’s journey mirrors resilience and recovery—much like the cryptosphere itself. Now fully community-owned and managed, Neiro prioritises collaboration and charitable giving. The team has already donated to the shelter that once cared for her and has plans for more initiatives in the future. Today, it’s trading at $0.0019, showing strong market momentum with exciting potential ahead. With its unique story, charitable impact, and growing presence, Neiro is emerging as one of the best meme coins for massive return potential. Non-Playable Coin: A Meme Revolution in the Making With its name derived from one of the most iconic gaming references—those quirky NPCs that always seem to be stuck on repeat—Non-Playable Coin has successfully carved out a unique niche in the meme market. And while it may seem playful or even a bit offbeat at first glance, this token is backed by an ambitious roadmap, creative investor interest, and a strong community vibe that could lead to remarkable returns. The market has a funny way of rewarding meme coins that tap into pop culture nostalgia and storytelling. Non-Playable Coin does this brilliantly. Predictions are already pointing toward Non-Playable Coin’s potential for explosive price gains as more people tune into its charm and vision. It’s worth $0.03623 today and is estimated to rise to a range of $0.036903 to $0.174123 in 2025. So, whether you’re gaming-obsessed, meme-savvy, or just love the idea of participating in niche internet trends with investment potential, NPC could become one of the most exciting opportunities in your portfolio. Why These Tokens Matter Right Now The crypto market can feel unpredictable at times, much like a high-stakes cricket match where momentum swings with every ball. That said, tokens like BTFD Coin, Neiro, and Non-Playable Coin are proving they can not only adapt but thrive in a volatile market. These tokens have the community backing, market trends, and features to ensure they are more than just a passing fad. Whether you’re drawn to BTFD Coin’s presale success and potential price hike, Neiro’s strong utility-driven vision, or Non-Playable Coin’s meme-friendly community, each coin offers something unique. Investors who act quickly could position themselves to make significant returns as these tokens climb further up the market ladder. The Final Play: Your Next Step If you’ve been on the sidelines wondering which tokens to explore, the market isn’t going to wait.

The campaigns are led from two ends, with CEDAR Innovation Foundation leading an online onslaught in social media, while Blockchain Association and DeFi Education Fund are writing to the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Through X, Crenshaw is accused of being anti-crypto more than the outgoing chair of the commission, Gary Gensler. The advocacy group launched a new five-figure digital ad campaign that will be shared across all social media platforms in Washington, DC. The ad addresses lawmakers, urging them to reject Democratic commissioner Crenshaw’s renomination to the SEC. The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to vote on Crenshow’s renomination on Wednesday morning. If the House confirms her, Crenshaw will serve on the commission until June 2029, which advocates feel will undermine cryptocurrency as a whole. Blockchain Association and DeFi Educational Fund write to the committee As the campaign against Crenshaw is picking momentum in social media, the Blockchain Association and DeFi Education Fund have written a letter to the Senate to do their representation duty by voting against Crenshaw’s renomination. The letter details several justifications as to why Crenshaw is not fit to hold a seat on the SEC. The group feels like Crenshaw can not uphold the rule of law. They cited a case where she has operated with impunity while overlooking the court’s position. Crenshaw blatantly refused to approve spot Bitcoin ETP despite the DC Circuit Courts confirming that there is no justifiable reason for them to reject it. According to the advocacy groups, Crenshaw’s character doesn’t embody the SEC’s merit-neutral mission or the needs of American investors—including the one-fifth of Americans who own digital assets. America’s incoming administration is taking an interest in crypto The Senate is urged to reject her and the failed policies of the past instead of approving the nomination, which will have extreme consequences for crypto lovers. President-elect Donald Trump appears interested in digital assets and has committed to forming a special crypto reserve. Trump said that America must start warming towards crypto, or it will be left behind. He highlights how other countries are leveraging crypto for their growth. He pointed to the United Arab Emirates as a valid example of a nation that has embraced crypto and has made progressive policies in the sector.

It is worth noting that its price rally has been accompanied by a significant spike in its funding rates, a critical metric reflecting sentiment in the futures market. The metric, analyzed by CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC, has reached levels not seen since January 2024. This surge in funding rates suggests a growing optimism among traders, with many anticipating the possibility of Ethereum reaching new all-time highs. Related Reading: Large Ethereum Transactions Grow As ETH Breaks Yearly Highs But Is A Correction On The Horizon? Despite this enthusiasm, the market’s current state raises questions about sustainability. Historically, such spikes in funding rates have often preceded short-term corrections, stabilizing the market. According to Shayan, the current situation mirrors January 2024, when Ethereum saw an 88% rally following similar market conditions. The analyst suggests that while the current rally may pave the way for further gains, a pullback could be essential for healthier long-term growth. Funding rates serve as a barometer for market sentiment, particularly in the futures market. A positive funding rate indicates a preference for long positions, with traders expecting higher prices. Ethereum Funding Rates Hit Multi-Month High “Funding rates are at levels last seen in January 2024, when Ethereum rallied by 88%. This reflects increased long-position interest as optimism grows. Similar to January, this sharp increase suggests the likelihood of a pullback.” –… pic.twitter.com/euKGhIqNKO — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 9, 2024 As Ethereum’s funding rates hit multi-month highs, this trend signals a surge in bullish sentiment. However, history shows such sharp increases can create short-term market imbalances, leading to corrections. Shayan noted: While Ethereum’s rally is underpinned by bullish sentiment, the spike in funding rates signals the need for a short-term correction, paving the way for healthier and more sustainable price growth. Ethereum Market Performance Ethereum remains below the $4,000 mark after falling below this level last week. Currently, ETH is trading at $3,819, reflecting a 4.9% decline in the past 24 hours. Despite the recent drop, the asset has gained nearly 30% over the past month. However, ETH’s latest dip further distances it from its all-time high of $4,878 in 2021, leaving it 20.5% below that peak.

33767162,[object Object],1733792448,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"MicroStrategy Expands Bitcoin Holdings With 21,550 BTC Purchase For $2.1 Billion",https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-expands-bitcoin-holdings-with-21550-btc-purchase-for-2-1-billion/,"MicroStrategy, a US-based business intelligence firm, has expanded its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings as part of its corporate treasury strategy. The company announced its latest purchase of 21,550 BTC, worth approximately $2.1 billion. MicroStrategy Unfazed by Bitcoin’s Historic Price Surge In an official announcement today, the publicly-traded company had acquired an additional 21,550 BTC. This purchase comes as Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time in its history, pushing the total cryptocurrency market cap to unprecedented levels. According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the acquisition was funded through proceeds from issuing and selling company shares, totaling $2.13 billion. The purchase was executed between December 2 and December 8 at an average price of $98,783 per BTC, including fees and expenses. Michael Saylor, CEO at MicroStrategy, in an X post stated that the company now holds a total of 423,650 BTC for a total acquisition cost of $25.6 billion, at an average price of $60,324 per BTC. While many investors may have second-thoughts about buying BTC amid its historic run, Saylor seems unfazed by the digital asset’s ascent. Earlier this year, Saylor said in an interview that he would be “buying the top forever.” He stated: I’m confident I’ll be buying Bitcoin at $1 million per coin — likely around $1 billion worth of Bitcoin per day at that price. Notably, with 423,650 BTC on its balance sheet, MicroStrategy now controls just over 2% of Bitcoin’s total capped supply of 21 million coins. Most recently, Saylor urged the US government to replace gold with BTC. The Bitcoin permabull said: Dump your gold. Sell all the US gold and buy Bitcoin. You will demonetize the entire gold asset class. And our enemies hold gold in their banks, so their assets would go to zero. Our assets would go to $100 trillion. Fifth-Consecutive Week Of BTC Purchase MicroStrategy’s latest acquisition marks its fifth consecutive Bitcoin purchase in as many weeks. During this period, BTC’s price has climbed by 40%, while MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has risen by approximately 20%. Year-to-date, MicroStrategy’s stock has soared by 520%, climbing from $69 on January 1 to $388 at the time of writing. This performance has outpaced Bitcoin and the S&P 500, solidifying the company’s position as a leading corporate BTC holder. MicroStrategy’s highly profitable BTC strategy has also inspired companies worldwide, including Japan-based early-stage investment firm Metaplanet. Further, Saylor has also tried to convince tech juggernaut Microsoft to consider adding BTC to its balance sheet. That said, long-time gold bug Peter Schiff is not yet sold on BTC, saying that MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin bet will likely backfire. BTC trades at $100,192 at press time, down 0.1% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTC Purchase|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|microsoft|MicroStrategy|mstr,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|BONK|SEI|BSV|WLD|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-10 01:00:48

In a new interview with Real Vision’s Raoul Pal, Tapiero says that he thinks US-based decentralized finance (DeFi) could explode in size after previously being pushed outside the country due to hostile regulators. Tapiero, the founder of multiple venture capital firms in the space, says that institutions are on the edge of discovering just how small the DeFi world is compared to the rest of the financial markets. “So if I’m looking out over the next two years, the thing that I think could really take off is US-based DeFi. So DeFi two years ago basically got pushed outside of the US. And so, the first step for everybody is through a centralized exchange, they come on their Kraken, or Gemini, Coinbase, and they buy their Bitcoin. But now, especially Coinbase, Kraken too, they’ve made it easy to port over into DeFi, not everyone is going to buy a Ledger and go through Ledger Live or MetaMask. But I do think that once these institutional guys, they’re going to own their Bitcoin through the ETF, they’re going to own their Ethereum. They’re then going to start to understand as they focus on it that it’s really the decentralized financial world that has the ability to grow. I mean TVL (total value locked) in DeFi is I think $100 billion, which is very small. The total value in the space today if I add up all the cryptocurrency and all the equities is around $4 trillion. So of that $4 trillion sitting there, only really 2% of it is actually active in DeFi. And I think that’s going to change.” TVL is a metric representing the amount of assets staked or locked in a platform. At time of writing, DeFi TVL stands at $136.232 billion.

Anton Tkachev, a deputy from the “New People” party in the State Duma, submitted an official appeal to Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, urging the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve similar to traditional state reserves that hold foreign currencies such as the US dollar and euro. Bitcoin as an Alternative Reserve Asset In his letter, Russian lawmaker Anton Tkachev highlighted the limitations of traditional foreign exchange reserves, which are vulnerable to volatility, inflation, and sanctions. These challenges, he argues, pose a risk to Russia’s financial stability. He proposed Bitcoin as an alternative reserve asset, noting that digital currencies are not subject to the controls or financial systems of individual countries. This makes them more resilient in the face of geopolitical tensions. This move precedes an enonomist Peter Schiff motion projection that the Biden admin should sell all US government’s Bitcoin holdings. “With limited access to international payment systems for countries under sanctions, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could become essential tools for global trade,” Tkachev wrote. He emphasized that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature makes it an ideal asset for Russia to store its reserves, enabling it to bypass traditional financial systems and avoid sanctions. Russian Lawmaker Stance On BTC’s Growing Investment Appeal Tkachev also pointed out Bitcoin’s strong investment performance in recent years, noting that the cryptocurrency reached a value of $100,000 in December 2024. He argued that Bitcoin’s high returns make it not only a stable store of value but also an opportunity for significant financial gain. Given this growth, Tkachev suggested that Russia could benefit from holding Bitcoin in its reserves, similar to the way nations hold gold or foreign currency reserves. In line with this, companies like MicroStrategy, have already adopted Bitcoin as part of their investment strategy. MicroStrategy has been consistently purchasing Bitcoin, most recently acquiring 21,550 BTC for $2.1 billion in December. This brings its total holdings to over 423,000 BTC, further cementing the company’s commitment to Bitcoin as a long-term investment. Similarly, Hut 8, a Bitcoin mining company, announced plans to raise $500 million through stock sales, with a portion of the proceeds earmarked for additional Bitcoin purchases. Russia’s Cryptocurrency Strategy and International Trends Russian lawmaker Anton Tkachev’s proposal aligns with Russia’s broader strategy to develop alternatives to traditional financial systems. The Central Bank of Russia is already preparing to launch an experiment to use cryptocurrencies in cross-border payments, aiming to facilitate international trade while bypassing Western sanctions. This initiative is part of a global trend where countries are exploring the potential of digital currencies to maintain economic stability. Russia’s interest in Bitcoin as a reserve asset is also in line with broader international developments. In the United States, Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced the “Bitcoin Act of 2024,” which proposes the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve to strengthen the U.S. dollar and increase the country’s influence in the global cryptocurrency market. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has also voiced support for a Bitcoin reserve, with some of his campaign promises including the idea of holding a strategic reserve of Bitcoin to further the U.S. economy’s resilience in the digital age. While Russia’s proposal is still in the early stages, it reflects a growing trend among countries to explore Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has speculated that countries like China could eventually create their own Bitcoin reserves, especially as global economic pressures continue to rise. He noted that smaller nations might be the first to adopt such a strategy, but larger economies could eventually follow suit.
