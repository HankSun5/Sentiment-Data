Analyzing Bitcoin’s bull market signals,https://crypto.news/from-100k-to-250k-analyzing-bitcoins-bull-market-signals/,"Who would have thought we’d see Bitcoin shoot through the roof this quickly, soaring past $100K, albeit retreating slightly at present? As we move forward into 2025, the main question on our minds is: what lies ahead? Is Bitcoin ( BTC ) a bubble about to burst, or are we on track for $150,000–$200,000 soon? Are there any rational tools to predict its trajectory, or are we left to just play guessing games? From what I’ve observed, the fog starts to lift when you examine on-chain and technical indicators, while also factoring in the macro perspective. Let’s layer these three types of analysis in this article to see what picture emerges for Bitcoin’s next move. Table of Contents Extreme greed, rising active addresses, and record hash rate Weekly Golden Cross signals bull market with $150K-$250K potential RSI signals overbought conditions, hints at pullback or consolidation Fibonacci levels and Bollinger Bands signal key support and potential cooling Visualizing Bitcoin’s market behavior through key indicators Potential crypto space developments in 2025 Closing thoughts Extreme greed, rising active addresses, and record hash rate The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is currently at 78, indicating Extreme Greed, which often signals potential tops in the short term. However, sustained levels of extreme greed during bull markets often align with parabolic price increases before final peaks. This typically precedes short-term pullbacks due to market exuberance, which appears to be what we’re witnessing now as Bitcoin’s price hovers around the $100K level. Crypto Fear & Greed Index | Source: Alternative.me The number of active addresses is increasing and, as of Dec. 8, stands at 855,153, suggesting heightened interest and usage of the Bitcoin network. Number of active BTC addresses | Source: Glassnode As of Dec. 9, 2024, Bitcoin’s hash rate is approximately 850.70 EH/s, reflecting a significant recovery from recent fluctuations but remaining below its all-time high of 949.98 EH/s, recorded on Nov. 26, 2024. While the current hash rate hasn’t yet reclaimed the ATH, this sustained strength reflects miner confidence and network security—long-term bullish signals. Bitcoin’s price tends to follow the hash rate; the more confident miners are about price appreciation, the less likely they are to sell. BTC hash rate | Source: CoinWarz Weekly Golden Cross signals bull market with $150K-$250K potential The weekly Golden Cross, where the 50-week moving average crosses above the 200-week MA, is a highly significant signal for long-term investors because it often marks the start of major bull markets and the conclusion of prolonged bearish phases. The previous instance of this signal occurred when Bitcoin recovered from the 2018 bear market and eventually surged to an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021. Mirroring its behavior in previous bull cycles, this signal reappeared in early 2024 and preceded Bitcoin’s parabolic rise to its recent all-time high of $103,647. Previous bull cycles following weekly Golden Crosses have led to gains of 300%–600%. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin could potentially reach $150,000 to $250,000 before the next major cycle correction. Meanwhile, the next Golden Cross is unlikely until 2026 or 2027, assuming Bitcoin undergoes a complete cycle of price appreciation, correction, and consolidation. BTC Golden & Death Cross pattern | Source: TradingView RSI signals overbought conditions, hints at pullback or consolidation On the weekly timeframe, the Relative Strength Index is at 74.47, consistent with overbought conditions. However, this does not imply a trend reversal right away but rather reflects the possibility of a short-term pullback or a period of sideways price action. In the past, many bull cycles saw similar RSI readings, followed by temporary pullbacks that were then succeeded by renewed rallies to higher highs. In the 2021 bull cycle, the RSI reached similar levels multiple times before peaking above 90, after which Bitcoin experienced a significant correction. Assuming Bitcoin stays in the most recent consolidation range around $100K and the RSI retraces back to a healthier range of 60–65, the next leg upward could occur. A healthy correction of 10%–20% or a sideways period would allow the markets to reset before experiencing sustained growth. For reference, a 10% correction from the all-time high of $103,647 would bring Bitcoin’s price to approximately $93,282. Relative Strength Index | Source: TradingView Fibonacci levels and Bollinger Bands signal key support and potential cooling Fibonacci retracement levels, used in technical analysis to identify potential support and resistance zones, help indicate where a price might retrace before continuing its trend. Based on the chart below: Key Levels: $71,858 (0.618): Major retracement level, acting as a strong support zone (a 30.67% pullback from the all-time high of $103,647). $103,135 (0.786): Significant resistance zone, near the all-time high. Bitcoin’s price is currently trading slightly below the upper Bollinger Band, signaling strong bullish momentum. However, this position also indicates potential overextension, as prices often retrace or consolidate when deviating significantly from the midline (20-week simple moving average, currently at $71,858). A pullback to $71,858 or further consolidation near the current price of $99,249 would represent a normal cooling-off period within the Bollinger Band framework and prepare the market for potential further gains. Fibonacci retracement levels & Bollinger Bands | Source: TradingView Visualizing Bitcoin’s market behavior through key indicators To further visually represent Bitcoin’s market behavior, let’s look at this colored chart below. It includes a color-coded bar at the top that reflects RSI conditions. The currently visible purple and green color blocks suggest periods of oversold or bullish divergence, reflecting bullish momentum and aligning with RSI overbought levels. The second bar shows market structure trends (e.g., ranging, bullish, or bearish). From the chart, we see green blocks that suggest the market is in a bullish phase, confirming breakout behavior. Next, the main oscillator displays the Awesome Oscillator with divergences and pivot points, where the green peaks above zero and brown regions below confirm positive momentum and bullish pivots. The secondary oscillator below the AO displays similar momentum indications, with positive bars (green above zero) suggesting accelerating upward momentum and a strong bullish bias. Bitcoin Rainbow Indicators | Source: TradingView Potential crypto space developments in 2025 Post-halving supply shock, increasing retail and institutional participation, institutional accumulation (companies like MicroStrategy and other corporate treasuries adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset) could push demand for it to new highs. The proportion of institutional investors will likely grow, stabilizing price movements but also making Bitcoin more correlated with traditional markets. Bitcoin’s dominance (currently around 55%) could rise further as investors favor its “digital gold” narrative over altcoins, especially if regulatory scrutiny tightens around smaller tokens. Bitcoin wallet growth will continue as adoption in emerging markets increases, with Bitcoin used as a hedge against local currency devaluation. Major corporations could start settling cross-border transactions in Bitcoin, while in regions with high inflation or de-dollarization trends central banks may increase interest in Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Countries like the U.S., the EU, and the UAE are likely to finalize crypto-friendly regulations , while other jurisdictions may clamp down on decentralized finance and self-custody to maintain control over financial systems. Closing thoughts With a loud explosion of excitement, Bitcoin shattered the $100K barrier, an achievement deemed nothing short of astonishing. Technical indicators, including the weekly Golden Cross and RSI, point toward the possibility of further growth, with projections suggesting a potential climb to $150K–$250K in this bull cycle. However, a healthy period of consolidation or correction would likely provide a stronger foundation for future price action. By 2025, Bitcoin may achieve what was once considered nearly impossible—establishing itself as a major player in the global financial system.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2024-12-09 23:01:13

In a recent X thread, Hougan explained that the regulatory uncertainty is hurting the industry and preventing it from reaching its full potential. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan Stance On Crypto Regulation Clarity Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan pointed out that the U.S. regulatory framework divides financial assets into two categories: securities and commodities. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates securities, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversees commodities. According to Hougan, this division exists because securities often have insiders—entities that hold crucial information unavailable to the public. In contrast, commodities like gold or oil do not have insiders in the same way. This is why they are regulated differently, with the CFTC focusing on ensuring fair markets rather than requiring detailed financial disclosures, as the SEC does for securities. In his X thread, the Bitwise CIO emphasized that decentralized projects, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, cannot have traditional insiders due to their inherent design. These projects are decentralized by nature, meaning there are no central authorities or entities with inside information. Therefore, attempting to classify cryptocurrencies as securities, as is often done in current U.S. regulatory discussions, does not align with the reality of how these networks function. Echoing Hougan’s sentiment, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse had also criticized current crypto regulatory frameworks , arguing that existing securities laws do not align with the technological advancements crypto represents. Decentralization and Regulation Challenges The core idea behind cryptocurrency is decentralization, which is a challenge when it comes to traditional regulatory frameworks. For example, Hougan explained that traditional securities require disclosures like financial statements or ownership structures to prevent insiders from taking advantage of the public. However, in decentralized networks, there is no single entity to disclose such information, making it difficult to fit them under current securities laws. As Hougan points out, the problem is not that crypto lacks transparency but that the current regulatory approach doesn’t consider the unique nature of blockchain technology. Instead of trying to fit crypto into outdated frameworks, Hougan advocates for a more tailored regulatory approach that takes into account the decentralized nature of these projects. This would ensure that investors are protected while allowing for innovation to thrive. The Case for CFTC Regulation One key point Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan made is that instead of trying to regulate decentralized crypto projects as securities under the SEC, there is a growing argument to have the CFTC oversee them. He explained that the CFTC’s focus on creating fair markets, rather than requiring insider disclosures, makes it a more appropriate regulatory body for decentralized networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Hougan pointed out that some in the industry, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse , have argued for CFTC regulation. They believe that the SEC’s current stance on crypto as securities is not only ineffective but also counterproductive. Meanwhile, Garlinghouse took issue with former SEC official John Reed Stark’s claims that cryptocurrencies, including Ripple’s XRP, are securities. Garlinghouse strongly disagreed, calling Stark’s comments “provably false” and asserting that XRP is not a security. Concurrenctly, he criticized the lack of media fact-checking, pointing out that the segment omitted crucial parts of his interview, including his clarification that XRP is not a security under current laws. Subsequently, the US SEC’s strict approach, according to Matt Hougan, could stifle innovation and harm the industry, especially when good projects are caught in the regulatory crossfire alongside bad actors.

Currently, XRP trades between $1.60 and $2.67. The coin is approaching its nearest resistance level at $3.00. Breaking through this point could lead XRP to the next resistance level at $3.61. On the flipside, the closest support level is at $0.9099, which could help stabilize the price if it starts to fall. Technical indicators provide further insight. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.54, slightly above the 100-day average of $2.42, suggesting a potential uptrend in the short term. The RSI is at 56.65, indicating that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic value is 50.66, reflecting a neutral stance. A MACD level of 0.0159 suggests continued price increases for XRP. You might also like: Experts highlight XRP, Cardano, PEPE, and XYZVerse as top bets Pepe Pepe has been on a remarkable run lately.

Dogecoin: From meme to market contender Dogecoin launched in 2013 as a playful alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply and generates 10,000 new coins every minute. While originally considered just a meme coin, Dogecoin surged in value in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market cap exceeding $50 billion. This growth was largely driven by social media buzz, particularly endorsements from Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s popularity underscores the power of community and social media in shaping financial markets. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin’s appeal continues to hinge on social media influence and overall market sentiment.

Launched without transaction taxes, it maintains a pure meme coin identity without utility features. In mid-2023, it reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion, attracting significant attention in the crypto community and sparking a meme coin trend. Pepe features a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and a redistribution system to reward long-term holders. Its roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. As an ERC-20 token, PEPE benefits from Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake security. It is available on platforms like Uniswap, Binance, and KuCoin. PEPE’s popularity and community support contribute to its prominence in the current market cycle. Dogwifhat Dogwifhat is a new meme coin on the Solana blockchain, inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. WIF stands out among dog-themed tokens in the crypto space, focusing on creating a sense of community and fun. In the current market cycle, interest in meme coins continues and WIF’s popularity is growing. The coin leverages Solana’s fast and low-cost transactions, which may attract users. Its appeal lies in the combination of meme culture and blockchain technology, which some investors find intriguing. BONK BONK is another meme coin on the Solana blockchain, featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. After a Coinbase listing, BONK surged over 100%. 50% of Bonk’s supply was airdropped to Solana’s NFT and DeFi participants, serving as a “community coin.” In mid-December 2023, BONK was the third-largest meme coin by market cap, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like a high total supply and the volatile nature of meme coins, BONK’s integration into the Solana ecosystem and involvement in dApps like BonkSwap make it a notable player. In the current market cycle, BONK shows potential due to its community focus and ecosystem integration. Conclusion Although DOGE, PEPE, WIF, and BONK may have limited immediate potential, DOGEN stands out. Tailored for those pursuing the best in life, it embodies luxury and success. With an expected 700% presale growth and potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN follows the successful paths of tokens like BONK and WIF. It seeks to gather a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters. For more information on DOGEN, visit their website , Twitter , or Telegram .

On Monday, these analysts raised the price target for Coinbase Global, Inc’s stock COIN to $420 per share. The revised estimate represents a notable increase from the firm’s $375 target. This increase reflects the growing optimism around Coinbase’s performance. This is largely driven by strong activity in the crypto market, particularly in December. Crypto Market Activity Drives Coinbase Price Target Increase The analysts attributed the boost to a major surge in retail activity within the crypto market. The exchange’s trading volumes are on track to reach record levels. This makes it one of the most active months for crypto trading in Coinbase’s history. The analysts pointed to Bitcoin’s volatility, particularly as its price approached $100,000, as a key factor driving the surge in market activity. They also highlighted the growing interest in altcoins , contributing to the boost. This combination of factors has led to a significant increase in trading volume across the crypto market. Coinbase’s Strong Year and Surge in Share Price Coinbase’s stock has soared more than 80% in 2024, reflecting the broader growth in the crypto market. The company saw a significant sharp uptick in its share price. This surge follows Donald Trump’s unexpected victory in November’s presidential election. Trump’s victory catalyzed a rally across digital assets, pushing Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark. This sparked renewed investor interest in crypto. Many investors view Coinbase’s stocks as an easy way to access the crypto market. Its strong infrastructure and market dominance make it a popular choice for those wanting to profit from crypto’s rise without managing digital assets directly. Looking Ahead: Strong Predictions for Q4 and 2025 Needham’s analysts expressed optimism about Coinbase’s financial trajectory. The analysts forecasted significant results for Q4 2024 and into 2025. Needham’s analysts predicted that Coinbase will continue to post strong financial results in the near future. For the fourth quarter of 2024, they predict the company will report $435 billion in trading volume and generate $2.1 billion in revenue. They expect the company’s stock earnings to reach $2.37 per share. Looking ahead to 2025, they forecast the company will earn $8.9 billion in revenue and report earnings per share of $9.61. Despite these optimistic predictions, Coinbase’s stock fell 8% on Monday, trading at $316.01 by midday. However, this dip does not overshadow the strong growth the company has experienced this year. Its share price has surged from under $200 to over $300, especially following the election. This highlights the strong momentum behind the company’s stock.

Or how Cosmos is shaking things up with its new interoperability features that connect blockchains like never before? These breakthroughs are turning heads in the crypto world. Amidst these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) emerges as a fresh contender with a bold vision. Unlike others, Qubetics addresses real-world issues that have held back blockchain adoption. With its presale already attracting attention, $TICS is a strong pick for anyone looking for the best coins with 1000X potential . Qubetics Redefines Blockchain Development with QubeQode IDE Qubetics is set to change the game with its innovative QubeQode IDE , an all-in-one tool for simplifying blockchain application development. Whether you’re a tech-savvy entrepreneur or someone with no coding experience, this platform empowers users to create decentralised applications with ease. Imagine a small retail business wanting to launch a blockchain-based loyalty programme. Instead of hiring expensive developers, the owner can use QubeQode’s drag-and-drop features to create a smart contract and manage customer rewards effortlessly. Or picture a logistics company needing better transparency for supply chains. QubeQode provides form-based configurations that allow managers to track goods and authenticate records—all without dealing with complex code. By offering pre-built blockchain functionalities, like token management and user authentication, and a library of pre-written code snippets, QubeQode eliminates the barriers that often keep businesses from exploring blockchain solutions. Qubetics has already sold over 300 million $TICS tokens to more than 8,000 holders, raising $5.3 million in its 12th presale stage. Currently priced at $0.031, $TICS is set to see a 10% price jump in the 13th stage starting this weekend. Each stage lasts just seven days, wrapping up every Sunday at midnight. Now, let’s look at the numbers. An investment of $36,000 at the current price would yield approximately 1,161,290 $TICS tokens. If the price reaches $0.25 by the presale’s end, that investment could grow to $290,322—equating to a 703.21% ROI. Post-presale projections suggest even higher gains, with the token potentially reaching $15, offering returns of 48,092.91%. To learn more about this project, take a look at this video . Litecoin’s Upgrades and Expanding Appeal Litecoin has long been known as Bitcoin’s “silver,” but its recent developments are helping it carve out its own unique identity. With faster block times and reduced transaction fees, Litecoin is positioning itself as a go-to option for everyday payments and digital transfers. The latest upgrade enhances its transaction processing capabilities, making it a reliable alternative for merchants looking for quick settlements. Its focus on scalability and reduced energy consumption also aligns with growing demands for eco-friendly crypto solutions. Litecoin is also gaining traction in cross-border transactions, providing a cost-effective and efficient way to transfer money internationally. With its robust network and practical use cases, Litecoin continues to solidify its position in the market as a high-potential investment. Cosmos Connects Blockchains with Seamless Interoperability Cosmos is taking blockchain communication to the next level with its new interoperability features. By allowing blockchains to share data and assets seamlessly, Cosmos eliminates the silos that have long hindered blockchain innovation. This development is a game-changer for developers and users alike. Decentralised apps can now operate across multiple networks, opening up endless possibilities for creating new solutions. For example, financial apps can leverage data from multiple chains, offering users a more connected and efficient experience. Cosmos’s focus on scalability and usability ensures its place as a forward-thinking platform. Its commitment to interoperability is set to attract more developers and users, further boosting its adoption in the blockchain space. Which Coin Offers the Best 1000X Potential? Qubetics, Litecoin, and Cosmos each bring unique strengths to the table. While Litecoin focuses on fast transactions and secure payments, Cosmos excels in blockchain interoperability. However, Qubetics stands out with its QubeQode IDE and its ability to simplify blockchain adoption across industries. For those eyeing exponential growth, Qubetics’ $TICS token is hard to ignore. Its presale offers a promising entry point, and its innovative solutions make it a contender for the best coins with 1000X potential. Just remember to do your research and invest wisely in this dynamic and ever-evolving market.

If Amazon embraces digital assets, it will join other business titans exploring the inclusion of Bitcoin in their asset portfolios. Related Reading: Countdown To $5 XRP: Engineer Predicts Milestone On ‘Strong Fundamentals’ Bitcoin As Financial Reserve Option Shareholders of Amazon urged the online retail store to evaluate the possibility of adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, saying that the firstborn cryptocurrency could enhance the investors’ value in the long term because it is one way of protecting it from inflation. A US-based think tank told Amazon to assess the prospect of using a portion of its financial reserve to hold Bitcoin to increase its shareholder’s value and fight off inflation. According to a recommendation made by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), the shareholders of the company are asking its Board to investigate if including cryptocurrencies into the treasury of the online retail store serves the best long-term interests of shareholders. HISTORY: SHAREHOLDERS ARE PETITIONING $2.3 TRILLION AMAZON TO BUY #BITCOIN BTC IS IN THE BEST “LONG-TERM INTEREST OF SHAREHOLDERS” 🚀 pic.twitter.com/Nj2wCNrVUn — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) December 9, 2024 The NCPPR submitted the shareholder proposal to Amazon to consider the crypto strategy during the company’s 2025 annual shareholders’ meeting. The American think tank suggested that Amazon should assess the benefits of holding some Bitcoin, encouraging the company to allot even 5% of its $585 billion assets to the cryptocurrency. “Though Bitcoin is currently a volatile asset – as Amazon stock has been at times throughout its history – corporations have a responsibility to maximize shareholder value over the long-term as well as the short-term,” NCPRR stated in the document. The researchers said that including some Bitcoins can diversify the company’s balance sheet, solving this problem without taking on too much volatility. Fighting Inflation The NCPRR said that the inflation rate in the US is going up, adding that cash and bonds are no longer the best approach to protect Amazon’s money. The US-based think tank cited that in the last four years, the average inflation rate in the country is pegged at 4.95%, which even went up to 9.1% in June 2022. It added that the true inflation rate is significantly higher, saying that several studies showed that it is nearly double the Consumer Price Index on occasion. “Amazon should – and perhaps has a fiduciary duty to – consider adding assets to its treasury that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short term,” NCPPR remarked. Simple. Accept bitcoin payments? 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/ud5PVNYHrj — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) December 8, 2024 Bitcoin A Good Option The NCPPR believes that Amazon could preserve billions of dollars of shareholder value by simply holding Bitcoin. The researchers explained that the alpha crypto has been increasing in value unlike cash and bonds whose value is lower than the “true inflation rate”, adding that the digital asset surged by 130% this year, which is performing better than bonds.

He shared his thoughts via a LinkedIn post. Nearly 75% of available Bitcoin is held by 2% of its addresses According to the presentation, a paltry 2% of BTC addresses hold 74% of the digital asset. This highly concentrated power, Aggarwal says, contradicts BTC’s founding principles. He explained: Bitcoin was supposed to be decentralized, step away from the central banks, a freedom from authorities. Do you know it is actually the opposite of that? ~ Aggarwal The analyst also said the concentration could spell trouble for the coin and its network should the few BTC whales decide to dump it. He gave the example of an unnamed Chinese firm that triggered a $649 million flash crash when it sold its holdings. Contrasting thoughts on BTC decentralization Aggarwal’s post received a lot of comments on the issue with some people criticizing his claims while others supported him. Maureen Salim is one of those in support. She depicted the 2% as dragons guarding the gold (BTC). To her, investing in BTC is a high-stakes poker game in which small-scale traders are the chips. She agreed they’d suffer most of the whales decided to sell their stashes. But to Olivier C., Aggarwal was missing the point. He explained that by decentralization, Bitcoiners meant the consensus protocol, which protected the BTC platform. Meanwhile, distribution refers to the amounts held by the wallets. He added that the anti-BTC propaganda was TradFi’s way of continuing to control the financial system. Olivier insisted that BTC was the key to unlocking the free economy. What next for BTC decentralization? The debate on BTC decentralization has remained thorny for a long time. However, it’s coming back to the fore following increased interest in the asset by institutional investors. Some say that shift is beneficial to the coin as it shows the confidence of large-scale investors in BTC. Meanwhile, other crypto users are wary that the entry of big-monied players in the space makes the coin inaccessible to retailers. As the debate rages, there’s a growing need to audit Bitcoin’s evolution to ensure it stays true to the creator’s intentions.

These tokens have gone from niche internet jokes to major players with life-changing potential, sparking attention from seasoned traders and everyday dreamers alike. Think of them as that surprise street snack you grab during a long day—unexpected, exciting, and exactly what you needed when you least expected it. And right now, the market is abuzz with opportunities that are shaping up to be some of the best meme coins for massive return potential. BTFD Coin is one of the standout names on this list, as its presale has proven to be a roaring success. With 44 billion tokens sold and over $2.6 million raised, this token is creating waves that investors can’t ignore. At its current stage, priced at $0.0001, BTFD Coin’s potential price surge could position it as a frontrunner for anyone aiming to get their hands on the best meme coins for massive return potential. Neiro and Non-Playable Coin are also stepping into the spotlight, offering unique opportunities that are exciting investors hungry for explosive returns. Whether it’s meme culture, community engagement, or just sheer market momentum, these coins are riding trends that could change the game for investors. Let’s break down these coins and see what makes them stand out. BTFD Coin: A Presale That Proves the Hype Is Real BTFD Coin has had quite the journey. Its presale numbers are nothing short of legendary—44 billion tokens in the bag and $2.6 million raised. That’s a lot of investor confidence, and it paints a picture of how much potential this token has going forward. The price currently sits at $0.0001, but here’s where things get exciting: analysts are projecting that BTFD Coin could climb to $0.0006 after its launch. That’s a hefty price jump and makes it one of the best meme coins for massive return potential. Think about this—if you were to take a bold step and drop $10,000 into BTFD Coin at this stage, you’d secure a jaw-dropping 100 million BTFD Coins. Now, if it climbs to $0.0006, your initial $10,000 would turn into a cool $60,000. And let’s not forget that BTFD Coin offers a staking reward system averaging a staggering 90% APY . This token isn’t just about market trends; it’s backed by a vibrant community (known as the Bulls Squad), strong staking opportunities, and an innovative approach to the market. If you’re on the hunt for exciting, trendsetting opportunities, BTFD Coin is a no-brainer. Neiro: The Next Market Challenger with a Vision Neiro is the cool little sister of Doge, carrying forward the spirit of meme coin culture while carving out its own path. Adopted by the same woman who previously owned Kabosu—the dog behind the iconic Doge meme—Neiro represents heritage and community spirit. Neiro made headlines as the first meme coin to deploy on the Ethereum blockchain, capturing the attention of Vitalik Buterin on August 4th, 2024 during the New Moon. Vitalik confirmed a generous donation of over $500,000 to an animal welfare fund shortly after, marking the second time he has interacted with a meme coin (the first being the SHIB token in 2021). Originally abandoned and sent to a stray shelter, Neiro’s journey mirrors resilience and recovery—much like the cryptosphere itself. Now fully community-owned and managed, Neiro prioritises collaboration and charitable giving. The team has already donated to the shelter that once cared for her and has plans for more initiatives in the future. Today, it’s trading at $0.0019, showing strong market momentum with exciting potential ahead. With its unique story, charitable impact, and growing presence, Neiro is emerging as one of the best meme coins for massive return potential. Non-Playable Coin: A Meme Revolution in the Making With its name derived from one of the most iconic gaming references—those quirky NPCs that always seem to be stuck on repeat—Non-Playable Coin has successfully carved out a unique niche in the meme market. And while it may seem playful or even a bit offbeat at first glance, this token is backed by an ambitious roadmap, creative investor interest, and a strong community vibe that could lead to remarkable returns. The market has a funny way of rewarding meme coins that tap into pop culture nostalgia and storytelling. Non-Playable Coin does this brilliantly. Predictions are already pointing toward Non-Playable Coin’s potential for explosive price gains as more people tune into its charm and vision. It’s worth $0.03623 today and is estimated to rise to a range of $0.036903 to $0.174123 in 2025. So, whether you’re gaming-obsessed, meme-savvy, or just love the idea of participating in niche internet trends with investment potential, NPC could become one of the most exciting opportunities in your portfolio. Why These Tokens Matter Right Now The crypto market can feel unpredictable at times, much like a high-stakes cricket match where momentum swings with every ball. That said, tokens like BTFD Coin, Neiro, and Non-Playable Coin are proving they can not only adapt but thrive in a volatile market. These tokens have the community backing, market trends, and features to ensure they are more than just a passing fad. Whether you’re drawn to BTFD Coin’s presale success and potential price hike, Neiro’s strong utility-driven vision, or Non-Playable Coin’s meme-friendly community, each coin offers something unique. Investors who act quickly could position themselves to make significant returns as these tokens climb further up the market ladder. The Final Play: Your Next Step If you’ve been on the sidelines wondering which tokens to explore, the market isn’t going to wait.

The campaigns are led from two ends, with CEDAR Innovation Foundation leading an online onslaught in social media, while Blockchain Association and DeFi Education Fund are writing to the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Through X, Crenshaw is accused of being anti-crypto more than the outgoing chair of the commission, Gary Gensler. The advocacy group launched a new five-figure digital ad campaign that will be shared across all social media platforms in Washington, DC. The ad addresses lawmakers, urging them to reject Democratic commissioner Crenshaw’s renomination to the SEC. The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to vote on Crenshow’s renomination on Wednesday morning. If the House confirms her, Crenshaw will serve on the commission until June 2029, which advocates feel will undermine cryptocurrency as a whole. Blockchain Association and DeFi Educational Fund write to the committee As the campaign against Crenshaw is picking momentum in social media, the Blockchain Association and DeFi Education Fund have written a letter to the Senate to do their representation duty by voting against Crenshaw’s renomination. The letter details several justifications as to why Crenshaw is not fit to hold a seat on the SEC. The group feels like Crenshaw can not uphold the rule of law. They cited a case where she has operated with impunity while overlooking the court’s position. Crenshaw blatantly refused to approve spot Bitcoin ETP despite the DC Circuit Courts confirming that there is no justifiable reason for them to reject it. According to the advocacy groups, Crenshaw’s character doesn’t embody the SEC’s merit-neutral mission or the needs of American investors—including the one-fifth of Americans who own digital assets. America’s incoming administration is taking an interest in crypto The Senate is urged to reject her and the failed policies of the past instead of approving the nomination, which will have extreme consequences for crypto lovers. President-elect Donald Trump appears interested in digital assets and has committed to forming a special crypto reserve. Trump said that America must start warming towards crypto, or it will be left behind. He highlights how other countries are leveraging crypto for their growth. He pointed to the United Arab Emirates as a valid example of a nation that has embraced crypto and has made progressive policies in the sector.

It is worth noting that its price rally has been accompanied by a significant spike in its funding rates, a critical metric reflecting sentiment in the futures market. The metric, analyzed by CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC, has reached levels not seen since January 2024. This surge in funding rates suggests a growing optimism among traders, with many anticipating the possibility of Ethereum reaching new all-time highs. Related Reading: Large Ethereum Transactions Grow As ETH Breaks Yearly Highs But Is A Correction On The Horizon? Despite this enthusiasm, the market’s current state raises questions about sustainability. Historically, such spikes in funding rates have often preceded short-term corrections, stabilizing the market. According to Shayan, the current situation mirrors January 2024, when Ethereum saw an 88% rally following similar market conditions. The analyst suggests that while the current rally may pave the way for further gains, a pullback could be essential for healthier long-term growth. Funding rates serve as a barometer for market sentiment, particularly in the futures market. A positive funding rate indicates a preference for long positions, with traders expecting higher prices. Ethereum Funding Rates Hit Multi-Month High “Funding rates are at levels last seen in January 2024, when Ethereum rallied by 88%. This reflects increased long-position interest as optimism grows. Similar to January, this sharp increase suggests the likelihood of a pullback.” –… pic.twitter.com/euKGhIqNKO — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 9, 2024 As Ethereum’s funding rates hit multi-month highs, this trend signals a surge in bullish sentiment. However, history shows such sharp increases can create short-term market imbalances, leading to corrections. Shayan noted: While Ethereum’s rally is underpinned by bullish sentiment, the spike in funding rates signals the need for a short-term correction, paving the way for healthier and more sustainable price growth. Ethereum Market Performance Ethereum remains below the $4,000 mark after falling below this level last week. Currently, ETH is trading at $3,819, reflecting a 4.9% decline in the past 24 hours. Despite the recent drop, the asset has gained nearly 30% over the past month. However, ETH’s latest dip further distances it from its all-time high of $4,878 in 2021, leaving it 20.5% below that peak.

In a new interview with Real Vision’s Raoul Pal, Tapiero says that he thinks US-based decentralized finance (DeFi) could explode in size after previously being pushed outside the country due to hostile regulators. Tapiero, the founder of multiple venture capital firms in the space, says that institutions are on the edge of discovering just how small the DeFi world is compared to the rest of the financial markets. “So if I’m looking out over the next two years, the thing that I think could really take off is US-based DeFi. So DeFi two years ago basically got pushed outside of the US. And so, the first step for everybody is through a centralized exchange, they come on their Kraken, or Gemini, Coinbase, and they buy their Bitcoin. But now, especially Coinbase, Kraken too, they’ve made it easy to port over into DeFi, not everyone is going to buy a Ledger and go through Ledger Live or MetaMask. But I do think that once these institutional guys, they’re going to own their Bitcoin through the ETF, they’re going to own their Ethereum. They’re then going to start to understand as they focus on it that it’s really the decentralized financial world that has the ability to grow. I mean TVL (total value locked) in DeFi is I think $100 billion, which is very small. The total value in the space today if I add up all the cryptocurrency and all the equities is around $4 trillion. So of that $4 trillion sitting there, only really 2% of it is actually active in DeFi. And I think that’s going to change.” TVL is a metric representing the amount of assets staked or locked in a platform. At time of writing, DeFi TVL stands at $136.232 billion.

Anton Tkachev, a deputy from the “New People” party in the State Duma, submitted an official appeal to Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, urging the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve similar to traditional state reserves that hold foreign currencies such as the US dollar and euro. Bitcoin as an Alternative Reserve Asset In his letter, Russian lawmaker Anton Tkachev highlighted the limitations of traditional foreign exchange reserves, which are vulnerable to volatility, inflation, and sanctions. These challenges, he argues, pose a risk to Russia’s financial stability. He proposed Bitcoin as an alternative reserve asset, noting that digital currencies are not subject to the controls or financial systems of individual countries. This makes them more resilient in the face of geopolitical tensions. This move precedes an enonomist Peter Schiff motion projection that the Biden admin should sell all US government’s Bitcoin holdings. “With limited access to international payment systems for countries under sanctions, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could become essential tools for global trade,” Tkachev wrote. He emphasized that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature makes it an ideal asset for Russia to store its reserves, enabling it to bypass traditional financial systems and avoid sanctions. Russian Lawmaker Stance On BTC’s Growing Investment Appeal Tkachev also pointed out Bitcoin’s strong investment performance in recent years, noting that the cryptocurrency reached a value of $100,000 in December 2024. He argued that Bitcoin’s high returns make it not only a stable store of value but also an opportunity for significant financial gain. Given this growth, Tkachev suggested that Russia could benefit from holding Bitcoin in its reserves, similar to the way nations hold gold or foreign currency reserves. In line with this, companies like MicroStrategy, have already adopted Bitcoin as part of their investment strategy. MicroStrategy has been consistently purchasing Bitcoin, most recently acquiring 21,550 BTC for $2.1 billion in December. This brings its total holdings to over 423,000 BTC, further cementing the company’s commitment to Bitcoin as a long-term investment. Similarly, Hut 8, a Bitcoin mining company, announced plans to raise $500 million through stock sales, with a portion of the proceeds earmarked for additional Bitcoin purchases. Russia’s Cryptocurrency Strategy and International Trends Russian lawmaker Anton Tkachev’s proposal aligns with Russia’s broader strategy to develop alternatives to traditional financial systems. The Central Bank of Russia is already preparing to launch an experiment to use cryptocurrencies in cross-border payments, aiming to facilitate international trade while bypassing Western sanctions. This initiative is part of a global trend where countries are exploring the potential of digital currencies to maintain economic stability. Russia’s interest in Bitcoin as a reserve asset is also in line with broader international developments. In the United States, Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced the “Bitcoin Act of 2024,” which proposes the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve to strengthen the U.S. dollar and increase the country’s influence in the global cryptocurrency market. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has also voiced support for a Bitcoin reserve, with some of his campaign promises including the idea of holding a strategic reserve of Bitcoin to further the U.S. economy’s resilience in the digital age. While Russia’s proposal is still in the early stages, it reflects a growing trend among countries to explore Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has speculated that countries like China could eventually create their own Bitcoin reserves, especially as global economic pressures continue to rise. He noted that smaller nations might be the first to adopt such a strategy, but larger economies could eventually follow suit.

Anton Tkachev, Duma state deputy of Russia , has urged the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve in the country after the Russian economy and business were sanctioned by the U.S. In his proposal, Tkachev mentioned that Bitcoin ( BTC ) should be treated in the reserves as any other traditional currency as well due to the borderless system of blockchain. “I ask you to assess the feasibility of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve in Russia by analogy with state reserves in traditional currencies. If this initiative is approved, I ask you to submit it to the government of the federation for further implementation,” The deputy stated, on RIA Novosti local news platform This reserve will not only serve as a currency but also contribute as an alternative instrument for storing the value of money. Yet traditional currencies are also threatened by inflation and sanctions, but Bitcoin is not. He also noted that the central bank has been preparing for the launch of a cross-border payment settlement for cryptocurrency , which indicates that the reserve is also possible.

On December 10, 2024, PEPE is outperforming major cryptocurrencies and defying the market trend with its impressive performance. PEPE Current Price Momentum PEPE is trading near $0.00002725 at press time, having recorded a price gain of over 3.50% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume increased by 16%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. However, this modest price surge comes during a period when the majority of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL), are struggling to gain momentum. PEPE Technical Analysis With this recent price surge, PEPE has reached a crucial level of $0.00002750, which currently represents a make-or-break situation for the meme coin. According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, if PEPE closes a four-hour candle above $0.00002750, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 30% to reach $0.000036 in the coming days. Source: Trading View On the other hand, if PEPE fails to hold above the $0.000024 level, this bullish thesis may be invalidated.

Table of Contents XRP attempts $3 but faces resistance PropiChain: A formidable XRP rival Why PropiChain’s presale is creating FOMO Conclusion The XRP price came close to the $3 milestone, reigniting interest in Ripple’s technology. However, the token has seen volatile price swings since then, sparking speculation of a potential crash. Amidst this uncertainty, traders are turning their attention to an emerging Ripple rival, PropiChain , which is predicted to have a 32,039% rally. XRP attempts $3 but faces resistance XRP is known for its ability to facilitate instant and cheap international transactions, with financial institutions around the globe widely adopting it. This widespread adoption was a major factor in the recent XRP price surge. Ripple’s recent legal victories against the SEC also fueled the fast rise of the XRP price. Investors were hopeful that XRP’s momentum would continue, driven by Ripple’s ongoing partnerships and developments in the financial technology sector. However, XRP price’s rise has not come without challenges, as it has suffered a decline again. The drop has raised concerns, with market analysts pointing out that such rapid price increases often precede sharp declines as the market adjusts to correct overinflated values. As such, many traders are on edge, worried about a further XRP price crash and looking for ways to secure their investments.

Metaverse integration: PropiChain will enable virtual property tours and global networking opportunities through its metaverse platform, connecting stakeholders worldwide. Why PropiChain’s presale is creating FOMO PropiChain’s presale has emerged as a hotspot for investors seeking high returns.

Target price by 2025: $2+ (a 32,039% rally). For investors who missed out on XRP price’s early gains, PropiChain presents a second chance. PropiChain’s credibility is enhanced by its BlockAudit security audit, which ensures the platform’s robustness. Its listing on CoinMarketCap has also provided greater visibility, attracting retail and institutional investors.

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crying Kamala on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crying Kamala by entering its contract address – 5eCJhSGBUN4YwJHLU9ZcWjrjmoufVznjzNBHfo4TN1P7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRYKAMA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-10 02:00:04

During a recent interview, Peirce identified three major priorities she believes will provide much-needed clarity and foster growth in the crypto industry. Hester Peirce Unveils SEC’s Crypto Agenda for Reform Under Donald Trump According to a Fox Business interview , Hester Peirce made it clear that the SEC’s regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies must evolve under Donald Trump’s leadership. One of her primary points was to halt what she referred to as the “regulatory suppression” of the crypto industry. She argued that the SEC should cease restricting crypto’s access to necessary services, such as custody, which are vital for the sector’s growth. Peirce stressed that such services are essential for crypto businesses to function properly and continue their expansion. Her call for ending the blockages on custody and other services aligns with a broader vision of enabling the crypto market. Moreover, most recently, David Sacks, the incoming Crypto Czar, addressed the growing concerns around Operation Chokepoint 2.0. His comments followed an account from Chris Lane, the former CTO of Silvergate Bank, who claimed that regulators, rather than the collapse of FTX, led to the bank’s downfall. Lane described how regulatory actions severely limited Silvergate’s ability to hold deposits from digital asset clients, ultimately forcing the bank to shut down. Consequently, Sacks suggested that these allegations warrant further investigation, signaling a possible probe into Operation Chokepoint 2.0. Providing Clarity on SEC Jurisdiction Another central issue raised by Hester Peirce was the need for clearer guidance on what falls within the SEC’s jurisdiction. She highlighted the importance of providing clarity on which activities and assets the SEC should regulate. Peirce explained that clear delineations are needed to identify what qualifies as a security and what does not. Peirce argued that clear definitions will help crypto businesses better understand their obligations. This clarity will allow them to navigate crypto regulations more effectively, reducing the risk of legal errors. In addition, Hester Peirce also stressed the need for collaboration between the SEC and crypto industry stakeholders. She proposed that the SEC work directly with the industry to figure out how existing rules apply and where adjustments should be made. Peirce suggested that this collaboration should be a public, open process, where all parties involved can participate. Coincidentally, these remarks come as Coinbase exposed FDIC “pause letters” obtained through a FOIA request. The letters show the agency’s role in restricting banking services to crypto businesses in 2022. According to the documents, FDIC instructed banks to pause crypto-related activities for further review. Coinbase’s CLO, Paul Grewal, emphasized that these letters confirm the existence of coordinated efforts to limit crypto banking access.

With so many options available, it’s easy to get lost in the noise. However, some projects stand out for their potential, unique features, and real-world utility. Among these, one platform quickly gains attention for its innovation and the excitement surrounding its presale: Qubetics ($TICS). But before diving into its thrilling presale details, let’s take a quick look at the recent developments of other notable coins in the market. Binance has made waves with its listing of Across Protocol (ACX) and Orca (ORCA), pushing these tokens into the spotlight. Meanwhile, Quant continues to maintain a strong presence in the market, providing blockchain interoperability with impressive performance. This article will explore why Qubetics is not just another altcoin but one of the best altcoins to invest in now, alongside these other rising stars. Qubetics: The Future of Blockchain Development is Here Qubetics is not just another blockchain platform. It’s a game-changer, offering tools and features that make blockchain development accessible to all. One of the standout features of Qubetics is the QubeQode IDE , which provides a visual development environment that makes blockchain app creation simpler than ever. With drag-and-drop components, users can seamlessly integrate pre-built functionalities such as user authentication and token management. This eliminates the need for complicated coding, allowing developers to focus on innovation rather than the technicalities of blockchain creation. Add the form-based configuration options to this, and you have a user-friendly way to define application logic and smart contract parameters. For those who need more advanced tools, Qubetics provides a code snippet library packed with pre-written code to speed up the development process for common blockchain tasks. But Qubetics isn’t stopping there. The platform also leverages AI-driven development to enhance the experience further. AI-powered smart contract generation ensures developers can create secure and efficient contracts based on their needs. At the same time, code completion and error detection functionalities make the development process faster and more reliable. AI also suggests optimisations, ensuring that applications are as efficient and secure as possible. Recently, Qubetics launched an AMA session to give its community deeper insights into the platform’s capabilities. For anyone curious to learn more, this session is a must-watch. With such cutting-edge features and a community-driven approach, Qubetics is undoubtedly one of the best altcoins to invest in now. Binance Boosts ACX and ORCA: Big Gains and Big Risks In the world of crypto, listings on major exchanges can send a coin’s price soaring, and that’s exactly what happened when Binance added Across Protocol (ACX) and Orca (ORCA) to its platform. Following the announcement, ACX surged by an impressive 131%, while ORCA rose over 90% in just 24 hours. This strong performance has caught the attention of many, but Binance’s decision to tag these tokens with a “Seed Tag” signals the high volatility and risks involved. Users must take a risk-awareness quiz every 90 days to continue trading these tokens, adding an extra layer of caution for potential investors. With both tokens already gaining traction, it’s clear that they have become one of the best altcoins to invest in now for those prepared to manage the risks. Quant: Leading the Charge in Blockchain Interoperability While other projects rise and fall, Quant remains a stalwart in the crypto market. Known for its ability to enable seamless interoperability between different blockchain networks, Quant is consistently regarded as one of the most promising projects in the space. Quant offers immense long-term value by solving a critical problem in blockchain technology—connecting different networks.

Stellar (XLM) is on the verge of a breakout, with analysts setting sights on a potential rally to $0.90. Meanwhile, Monero (XMR) holds its ground as the undisputed king of privacy coins. But here’s the twist: a new contender, Qubetics ($TICS) , is shaking up the game with a mind-blowing presale, surpassing $5.3 million in investments. With analysts forecasting jaw-dropping ROI figures, everyone’s buzzing about whether this could be the next big thing. So, what’s the fuss about Qubetics? This isn’t just another flashy token with big promises and no backbone. It’s diving deep into real-world asset tokenisation, a fancy way of saying it’s bridging the gap between your tangible assets and the blockchain. But more on that later. For now, let’s explore why these three coins might just be the best coins to join for short-term gains and beyond. Qubetics ($TICS): The Real-World Asset Tokenisation Revolution If you’ve ever wished for a simpler, more accessible way to manage your assets, Qubetics has entered the chat. This blockchain powerhouse focuses on real-world asset tokenisation (RWAT) . What’s that? Think about transforming physical assets—like property, fine art, or even wine—into digital tokens that can be easily bought, sold, or traded. It’s not just futuristic; it’s here and shaking up how we think about ownership. Imagine this: You own a vintage car, a piece of land, or even a rare baseball card. Traditionally, selling or even leveraging those assets would involve tedious paperwork and loads of middlemen. Enter Qubetics. Their platform lets you tokenise these assets, breaking them into fractionalised ownership. That means you could sell just a piece of your property instead of the whole thing—unlocking liquidity without giving up full control. Businesses are already catching on. Real-estate developers could tokenise luxury apartments, allowing investors from across the globe to own shares. Small businesses could tokenise equipment or intellectual property, turning their assets into accessible investment opportunities. Heck, even local art galleries could tokenise their collections, opening doors for everyday investors to own a Picasso—well, part of one. Click here to watch how real estate investors can get the best out of their investments using Qubetics. But the real kicker? Qubetics’ presale is taking off like a SpaceX rocket. With over 300 million tokens sold to 8,000 holders, the project has already raised a staggering $5.3 million. And the current price of $TICS at $0.0311 is about to jump by 10% when Stage 13 kicks in this weekend. Analysts are predicting a meteoric rise—$0.25 by presale’s end, $1 shortly after, and a mind-bending $15 post-mainnet launch. If you’re looking for the best coins to join for short term, $TICS might just be the golden ticket. Stellar (XLM): Ready for Liftoff at $0.90 Stellar is no stranger to the limelight, and for good reason. This blockchain project has been making waves in financial circles, providing fast and affordable cross-border payments. Stellar’s mission? To connect people and financial institutions seamlessly, especially in regions where traditional banking falls short. Now, with two bullish patterns lighting up its charts, analysts are eyeing $0.90 as the next big target. Let’s paint a picture: In the past month, XLM saw a 300% price surge, outperforming many top-tier cryptos. Sure, it cooled off with a 3% dip last week, but that’s not unusual after such a meteoric rise. What’s interesting is how traders are treating the dip as a buying opportunity, with volumes spiking. These signals suggest Stellar’s bulls are far from done. Technical indicators are backing the hype, too. A symmetrical triangle pattern suggests consolidation, while a falling wedge on the RSI points to a potential breakout. If XLM can push past its $0.56 resistance level, it’s off to the races. The target? $0.90—and possibly higher if market momentum aligns. For short-term traders, Stellar’s blend of strong fundamentals and promising technicals makes it a no-brainer. But even long-term holders can smile; Stellar’s role in financial inclusion keeps it relevant. Whether you’re in Buenos Aires or Bogotá, Stellar’s fast, cost-effective remittance capabilities resonate with folks tired of paying exorbitant fees to send money home. Monero (XMR): Privacy First, Always In a world where every click, swipe, and purchase is tracked, Monero is like that friend who says, “Relax, I’ve got your back.” Known as the ultimate privacy coin, Monero enables completely anonymous transactions. For anyone worried about nosy governments, creepy corporations, or plain-old hackers, XMR is the go-to. But Monero isn’t just a tinfoil hat for crypto enthusiasts. It’s practical, too. Think about e-commerce platforms that cater to a global audience. By accepting Monero, they offer customers a level of privacy no credit card or bank transfer ever could. For freelancers in countries with restrictive banking systems, Monero provides financial freedom and security. Monero’s resilience is worth a shout-out. Despite facing regulatory heat—sometimes praised, sometimes vilified—it remains a top pick for privacy-focused investors. Its development community is no slouch either, rolling out regular updates to keep Monero ahead of the curve. Whether you’re hodling or using it for everyday transactions, XMR is a solid choice for anyone prioritising discretion. Now, is it the best coin to join for short-term gains? Maybe not for quick flips. But its steady growth and loyal community make it a strong contender for those playing the long game. After all, in a world obsessed with data collection, privacy is priceless. Conclusion: The Clock’s Ticking—Make Your Move So, there you have it. Qubetics is making headlines with real-world asset tokenisation and a presale that’s smashing records. Stellar is flirting with $0.90, and Monero continues to champion privacy in a digital world. Whether you’re chasing short-term gains or long-term growth, these three projects are worth your attention. Here’s the deal: If you’re serious about making moves, don’t wait too long. The Qubetics presale is a ticking clock, with prices set to rise by 10% this weekend. Stellar’s breakout could happen at any moment, and Monero? It’s the steady rock every diversified portfolio needs. So, what’s it going to be? Dive in, grab some $TICS, and ride the wave—or watch from the sidelines as others cash in. The choice is yours. Don’t let FOMO be the story of your crypto journey.

Here’s What Analysts Say,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-finally-set-for-a-new-all-time-high-heres-what-analysts-say/,"Ethereum (ETH) continues to hover around the critical $4,000 resistance level, a price point many believe could determine the cryptocurrency’s next major move. However, a strong weekly close has sparked optimism among analysts, suggesting that ETH could be on track to reach a new all-time high (ATH) soon. Ethereum Heading To New ATH? Experts Weigh In While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP have experienced explosive growth this year, ETH’s price momentum has been relatively subdued. According to CoinGecko, Ethereum has recorded gains of 62% over the past year, falling short compared to other trending digital assets. Related Reading: Analyst Confirms Ethereum Golden Cross As ETH Surges Past $4,000 – Is Altseason In Sight? However, ETH’s performance relative to other cryptocurrencies has not deterred ETH bulls from aiming for new ATHs for the cryptocurrency. For instance, seasoned crypto analyst Pentoshi recently took to X to explain the significance of ETH’s “structural changes” and the consistently large inflows attracted by spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Pentoshi noted that Ethereum has not only recorded a higher high on the weekly chart, but also had its highest weekly close of the year. The analyst added that, given its current price of slightly below $4,000, there is not much resistance to ATH, which “should act as a magnet” for further gains. Another crypto analyst, @CryptoPoseidonn highlighted that ETH is set to break out of its “4-year, 1,460-day range to the upside.” In a chart, the analyst marked out the different Fibonacci extension levels to identify potential price targets for ETH. According to the chart, ETH can rise to $6,000 at the 1.272 extension level, $7,400 at the 1.618 extension level, and $11,400 at the 2.618 extension level. ETH can rise “much higher, far beyond your worst nightmares,” the analyst added. In a shorter time frame, Satoshi Flipper, another well-known analyst, emphasized that ETH attempts to break through an ascending channel in the 4-hour chart. He suggested that the current price, sitting on diagonal channel support, might present a “nice entry” point, predicting that the next impulsive move could take ETH to $4,400. ETH Bulls Cautiously Optimistic Although there is high anticipation for a new ETH ATH, some experts opine that there may still be a few hurdles before the digital asset records a new ATH price. For instance, ETH crossing the $4,000 level may lead to increased risks of profit-taking, potentially resulting in a short-term correction. Related Reading: Ethereum Risk-Reward Ratio Is Now Attractive, Brokerage Firm Explains However, Ethereum’s fundamentals remain robust, adding to its bullish outlook. For instance, ETH active addresses and large value transactions have shown an uptick, reflecting increased on-chain activity during the recent rally. Additionally, some analysts believe ETH could follow a trajectory similar to Bitcoin’s 2021 bull run, with the potential to reach $10,000. ETH trades at $3,847 at press time, down 3.9% in the past 24 hours.

Trump’s Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tesla on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tesla by entering its contract address – 8T1qq1DxSqWqoR8J9hi3ULGCCoMJdqQBev4WAvJg9awR – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMTESLA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-10 02:43:00

The firm dumped these substantial tokens on Binance, Coinbase, OKX, and Robinhood. Additionally, the sell-off began shortly after UNI’s price dropped by 10%.

UNI was expected to retest this level, but the price decline has brought it here sooner than anticipated.

They’ve morphed from joke tokens to serious investment opportunities, with wild stories of gains capturing the imaginations of investors worldwide. Ponke (PONKE) and Act I: The AI Prophecy (ACT) are two meme coins making waves recently, each with its own unique quirks and community-driven appeal. But the real head-turner is BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a meme coin that’s rewriting the playbook with its explosive presale, community focus, and built-in earning opportunities. Launching its presale on November 26, 2024, BTFD Coin has already raised over $2.6 million. With its catchy mantra, “Buy The F***ing Dip,” this project appeals to every savvy investor who knows the value of seizing opportunities during market dips. And with its price set to jump from $0.0001 during the current presale stage to $0.0006 by the end of its 16 stages, BTFD Coin could very well become the best meme coin to invest in this week. So, what makes it so special, and how does it stack up against Ponke and ACT? Let’s dive in. BTFD Coin (BTFD): A Dip Worth Buying Into BTFD Coin is flipping the script on meme coins with its presale that’s already raising eyebrows. Currently, in its 10th stage, investors can scoop up BTFD for just $0.0001 per coin. With over 44 billion coins sold and 3,900 holders, the project has garnered serious momentum. What’s driving this interest? The promise of hefty returns, for starters. A $1,800 investment at the current price buys 18 million BTFD coins. By the end of the presale, when the coin hits $0.0006, that same investment could balloon to $10,800. Not bad for a few weeks’ wait, eh? BTFD is built on Ethereum, ensuring security and scalability, and comes loaded with features like staking rewards with an average APY of 90% and a P2E game launching soon. It’s designed to thrive in both bear and bull markets, positioning itself as a must-have in any investor’s portfolio. Plus, its community-driven ethos, backed by the “ Bulls Squad ,” offers a sense of camaraderie and purpose often missing in other meme projects. Ponke (PONKE): Embracing Chaos and Winning Hearts If there’s a meme coin that thrives on unpredictability, it’s Ponke. Trading at $0.5445, PONKE has captured the imaginations of high-risk, high-reward enthusiasts. Known for its wild marketing campaigns and its community-driven model, Ponke offers a unique spin on the meme coin phenomenon. With a circulating supply of 555 million tokens and a trading volume that’s been on the rise, it’s clear Ponke knows how to stay relevant. What makes Ponke stand out is its embrace of chaos. Its marketing strategy is as eccentric as it is effective, drawing in a crowd that loves to roll the dice. For investors who crave an adrenaline rush, Ponke delivers in spades. While it might not have the same polished appeal as BTFD, it’s a testament to how meme coins can carve out niches in unexpected ways. Act I: The AI Prophecy (ACT): Riding the AI Wave ACT is the meme coin for the AI generation. Following a meteoric rise of 1,700% in November 2024, it’s now trading at $0.5948. Its listing on major exchanges like Binance and Crypto.com has brought it into the spotlight, and analysts like Altcoin Sherpa have praised its market resilience. But with a current trading volume of $213.7 million, ACT isn’t just coasting on past glories. It’s actively engaging investors with a vision that fuses AI themes with meme culture. That said, ACT’s journey hasn’t been without hiccups. Concerns about liquidity and large sell orders have kept some investors cautious. Still, for those willing to navigate the volatility, ACT offers the kind of thrill that meme coin investors often seek. Why BTFD Coin is the Best Meme Coin to Invest in This Week Based on current trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the most promising opportunity. Its presale performance, innovative features, and strong community focus make it a clear leader in the meme coin space. Investing $1,800 now could yield $10,800 by the presale’s end—a potential 6x return. Add in the staking rewards and the upcoming P2E game, and BTFD is more than just a meme—it’s a movement. While Ponke and ACT have their own merits, they lack the strategic presale structure and comprehensive ecosystem that BTFD offers. This makes BTFD not just the best meme coin to invest in this week, but potentially one of the best investments in the meme coin sector overall. Conclusion The meme coin world is buzzing, and BTFD Coin is leading the meme market with its record-breaking presale. Ponke and ACT offer intriguing options for investors seeking variety, but if you’re looking for a coin that combines humour, utility, and profit potential, BTFD is your best bet. With over $2.6 million raised, 44 billion coins sold, and its price set to soar, there’s no better time to join the movement. Don’t miss out on what could be the best meme coin to invest in this week. Head over to the BTFD presale now and secure your stake before the price climbs. It’s time to Buy The F***ing Dip and ride the bull run to success!

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-10 03:26:00

37448341,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=659656,1733801423,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Five Weeks, Five Purchases: MicroStrategy Invests Another $2.1 Billion In Bitcoin",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/five-weeks-five-purchases-microstrategy-invests-another-2-1-billion-in-bitcoin/,"MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm helmed by co-founder and Chairman Michael Saylor, has made headlines yet again with the announcement of a $2.1 billion Bitcoin (BTC) acquisition. Interestingly, this is the fifth consecutive Monday that the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based corporation has announced major acquisitions of the market’s leading crypto, demonstrating confidence in BTC’s prospects and price appreciation. Microstrategy’s Bitcoin Stash Surpasses Nvidia According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), MicroStrategy purchased 21,550 Bitcoin tokens between December 2 and December 8 for an average price of $98,783 per token. Over the last four years, Saylor and his firm have amassed Bitcoin worth more than $41 billion, a move he undertook to shift the software company’s survival strategy. Saylor said in October that it would fund $42 billion over three years through a combination of at-the-market stock sales and convertible debt offers, bolstering the firm’s BTC acquisition strategy. The rate at which MicroStrategy is accumulating Bitcoin has accelerated substantially in the month since Donald Trump’s election on November 5; it took nearly a year to amass its first 100,000 coins, but just two weeks to grow its holdings from 300,000 to 400,000. This vast Bitcoin stash is now worth more than the cash reserves of computer behemoth Nvidia Corp., as well as nearly all non-financial corporations listed on the S&P 500 Index. Liquidity And Credit Concerns Despite BTC’s bullish outlook, researchers believe MicroStrategy’s method is not risk-free. In four of the last five weeks, the firm has purchased Bitcoin at an average price higher than the average market price , raising questions about the approach’s long-term viability. The company’s stock, MSTR, has increased by more than 500% this year, generating significant interest from investors, while hedge funds have begun to acquire its notes for market-neutral arbitrage methods, capitalizing on Bitcoin’s volatility. However, analysts warn that continued dependence on Bitcoin could be risky. Min Jung, a research analyst at Presto Research, pointed out that while BTC’s rising prices create a positive feedback loop—in which higher stock prices permit more fundraising for further Bitcoin purchases—this cycle is strongly dependent on the crypto’s rise. “If the market turns, the consequences could be severe,” Jung told Bloomberg. A significant drop in Bitcoin’s market value could imperil the company’s financial viability, raising liquidity and credit concerns. Outside of its major enterprise analytics software market, the company’s income creation opportunities would be restricted. Gracy Chen, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, expressed these fears, noting that a drop in Bitcoin prices might jeopardize MicroStrategy’s ability to manage its rising debt levels . “The firm’s massive BTC holdings pose a market concentration risk,” Chen explained. “A large-scale sell-off could lead to significant price fluctuations, affecting not just Bitcoin but the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem.” At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $97,700, down 3% in the last 24 hours.

The price is slightly trading above the $2 level at the time of writing. XRP has tested a key breakout point and the 2021 high, and this retest has resulted in a strong rebound. However, the price has not yet surpassed any previous highs, indicating that further movement is needed to establish an upward trend. The current market structure suggests that XRP may still be in the fourth wave of a larger correction. After a three-wave decline in wave A, followed by a three-wave rise in wave B, XRP is now experiencing the C-wave decline. Despite the rebound, the price has not surpassed previous highs, which means further movement is needed for confirmation of an upward trend. Potential for More Downside Despite the rebound, it is still possible, even likely, that we could see one more low. There is no confirmation yet that the low has been established. During liquidity events, such as those we’ve been seeing recently, rapid price movements make it difficult to pinpoint the micro-structure of the waves. While another dip cannot be ruled out, it’s important to note that the price has already hit the 100% extension of the A-wave, which is a common target for a C-wave. Next Support Levels If the price continues to move downward, the next support levels to watch are around $1.85, where we see an overlap of two key support zones, followed by $1.78 and $1.66. The market is still following the forecasted path, and it’s crucial to monitor how the broader crypto market, including Bitcoin, behaves, as this could impact XRP’s next move.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-10 03:48:49

Is Bitcoin threatened?,https://crypto.news/google-reveal-quantum-computing-chip-how-about-bitcoin/,"Google is introducing the most long-awaited of its first quantum computing chip, Willow. Although it’s a breakthrough in the computer revolution, what about Bitcoin’s future? Google CEO Sundar Pichai revealed Willow as the company’s first quantum computing chip. This invention has brought a new journey for useful quantum computers for practical applications. “Introducing Willow, our new state-of-the-art quantum computing chip with a breakthrough that can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more qubits, cracking a 30-year challenge in the field,” Pichai stated in his X’s post on Dec. 10 Willow, in the benchmark test, could solve a standard computation in under 5 minutes, which is estimated to take 10^25 years or equal to 10,000 quadrillion centuries to solve for a classical supercomputer. This new revolutionary quantum computing processor could reduce errors progressively with super-fast gates to achieve low error rates, reconfigurability, and high connectivity algorithms. Google Quantum AI hardware director Julian Kelly says any qubits with uncharacteristically high errors could be solved by “reconfiguring them to the line” and using tunability to develop new calibration strategies. Through this advanced computer development, are Bitcoin and the rest of cryptocurrencies threatened? You might also like: Quantum computing’s threat to blockchain security: expert Google needs advanced chips to break Bitcoin Willow Chip, at this time, has 105 qubits, which advances computer technology. However, to crack the Bitcoin ( BTC ) blockchain, a quantum computing chip needs 200 million to 400 million qubits at maximum. Bitcoin’s protocol also needs to allow the post-quantum algorithms to be integrated to threaten the coin itself. Meaning this advancement of technology could not cause any danger for crypto, at least for now. Willow has 105 Qubits. To crack Bitcoin you need between 200-400million Qubits. It can also be forked at anytime and upgraded.

33767162,[object Object],1733803234,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Dogecoin Whale Makes $48 Million Binance Deposit, Bearish Sign?",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whale-48-million-binance-deposit-bearish/,"On-chain data shows a Dogecoin whale has made a large deposit to the Binance exchange, which could be bearish for DOGE’s price. Dogecoin Whale Has Moved Big To Binance Today According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert , a massive move has been spotted on the Dogecoin blockchain during the past day. The transfer involved 112,382,564 memecoin tokens worth around $48.7 million when the move was executed on the network. Transactions of this size are generally associated with the whales . Whales refer to humongous entities on the blockchain that can carry some degree of influence in the market thanks to their ability to move around large stacks of coins quickly. Because of their key role in the ecosystem, the transfers of these investors can be worth keeping an eye on. The moves may not directly impact the asset’s price, but they can still be useful to gauge the sentiment among this cohort. Usually, though, it’s hard to gather anything related to what a whale wants to do from their transactions alone. Networks like Dogecoin carry an inherent layer of privacy, so it’s not easy to say whether a transaction is economical or a move between the wallets of the same investor. Luckily, in the case of the current DOGE whale transfer, one of the addresses involved is connected to a centralized platform, providing more room for speculation. Below are the details for the transaction in question. As is visible, the sending address in the case of this Dogecoin transaction was an unknown wallet, meaning that it was likely the whale’s address. On the other hand, the receiver was a wallet connected to the cryptocurrency exchange Binance . Transfers of this type where coins flow from a self-custodial address to an exchange, are known as exchange inflows . Generally, investors move their coins to these platforms whenever they want to use one of the services they provide. This can include selling, so exchange inflows can sometimes lead to a bearish outcome for the memecoin’s price. For the current DOGE transaction, the amount involved is notable, but whether the whale has made it to sell or not remains unknown. DOGE Price Dogecoin has kicked off the new week on a bearish note as its price has observed a plunge of almost 7% during the last 24 hours, coming down to the $0.436 level.",Dogecoin|binance|Doge|dogecoin|Dogecoin Bearish|Dogecoin Exchange Inflow|Dogecoin Whale|Dogecoin Whale Exchange Inflow|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|BONK|SEI|BSV|WLD|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-10 04:00:34

The price is down over 10% and might even decline toward the $2.00 support zone. XRP price started a downside correction from the $2.50 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.26 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $2.32 resistance. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price failed to start a fresh increase above the $2.50 resistance zone. It started a fresh decline below the $2.35 level like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $2.30 and $2.25 levels. The price even dived below the $2.20 support. A low was formed at $1.989 and the price is now correcting some losses. There was a move above the $2.20 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.64 swing high to the $1.98 low. The price is now trading below $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.20 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.250 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.26 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The next resistance is at $2.30 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.64 swing high to the $1.98 low. A clear move above the $2.30 resistance might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.40 resistance or even $2.420 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.550. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.250 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.050 level. The next major support is near the $2.00 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.00 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.880 support. The next major support sits near the $1.750 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRYKAMA.

The overall crypto market cap has dropped by 5.44% reaching $3.43 trillion in the last 24 hours. Historical level of liquidations was witnessed specifically in the last 12 hours. But why is this happening when everyone is so positive about the market and how far Bitcoin can fall? Are you wondering why bitcoin is going down today? Let’s analyse what is happening with the market. High Greed Brings High Risk If you have been in the crypto space for a while and have seen at least one crypto cycle you would have seen such things happening before. When the market goes into a sentiment of high greed for many days and people get comfortable with the bull market, it retraces. It is always traders vs. the market and who has more power? Obviously the market. The seasoned professionals always suggest people to be scared when the market is greedy. Such times are the perfect time for the market to take money from traders. Technical Side of Bitcoin After facing rejection from the new ATH, Bitcoin had taken a downturn of about 13.60%. Though it did not close there and it came out only to be a shadow. The asset held itself and tried to rise again however failed to do so. BTC kept on riding the Moving average 20 for quite some time before falling below it on December 9 which triggered a panic in the market. Following this, Bitcoin fell under the Moving average 50 and then 100. This is enough shock for the market. BTC is currently trading at $96,607, a 2.90% drop in the last 24 hours. The trading volume pumped by 118% as traders started shorting the asset. How down can it go? Well that would be very difficult to say however, the nearest strong zone lies at $92,600 and moving average 200 is also holding this spot, making it more strong. The RSI levels are falling sharp. It is currently at 38.08 which is not good for bulls but definitely a comfortable time for short traders. The average direction index at 16.44 also shows bears are holding the market. Other Metrics According to the liquidation data by Coinglass, a total of $1.75 billion worth of liquidations happened in the last 24 hours. Most of these liquidations are the long traders as the market changed its position following bitcoin’s downward movement. Over half a million traders lost their funds to these liquidations. The whale orders and large trade data from coinglass shows that even though the market shows greed, in reality the long traders are in fear. There are few to none long orders around this price range and whales are shorting BTC. The good amount of longs lie between $92k and $94k. Does this mean the crypto can fall more? Yes, it might, if the market fails to get more strong buys. What to expect? The downturn during a bull market brings in desperate times. The Greed and Fear index shows high greed, the indicators showing an upcoming down movement, makes it all confusing. Be aware that the market tends to move in the opposite direction of a high saturation of emotion. As more and more people will short the asset, Bitcoin will start rising again suddenly. If you are thinking of entering the market to take trades, high precaution is advised in order to save your funds. The high greed sentiment in the market is the reason why bitcoin is going down.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-10 04:44:38

Steingraber highlighted significant inflows into XRP via two charts. In his post on December 7, Steingraber shared a chart marked with real-time data, captioned: “XRP Inflows by the Minute flooding in!” The chart reveals a sharp rise in net inflows triggered by a massive price increase. XRP Inflows by the Minute flooding in! pic.twitter.com/t1sOZvJLHg — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) December 7, 2024 Steingraber’s chart indicates heightened interest and capital movement into XRP, signaling robust demand for the asset during this period. The analyst followed up with a second post on December 8, presenting a broader perspective on XRP’s net inflows over a longer time frame. This post, captioned “ABSOLUTE CARNAGE about to hit XRP,” underscores the escalating scale of net inflows as the price ascended to $2.59. Steingraber’s chart referenced later data from December 7, showing that the digital asset’s net flow had risen from $878.84 thousand by 10:56 AM to $5.96 million by 9 PM. Steingraber suggests that these inflows could signal further gains for XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Remarkable Performance These observations come at a time when XRP has crossed the $2 mark for the first time since 2018, a notable milestone for the digital asset, with its price recently reaching a multi-year high of $2.86. XRP has recorded a 20% gain in the past week, reflecting growing investor confidence. The asset is now trading at $2.58, and this remarkable performance coincides with a transformative period for the cryptocurrency landscape, particularly for XRP and Ripple. The resignation announcement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, effective January 20, 2025, has created optimism within the crypto community. Gensler’s tenure was marked by regulatory scrutiny, including the ongoing lawsuit against Ripple regarding XRP’s classification as a security. Adding to the positive sentiment, President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins , known for his crypto-friendly stance, to succeed Gensler. Atkins’ potential appointment is viewed as a favorable development for the industry, with many anticipating a resolution to Ripple’s lawsuit and similar regulatory challenges. The massive attention XRP is getting could help it reach much higher targets, and the comments on Steingraber’s post show that the community is excited about the digital asset’s immediate future.

If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-10 05:03:00

DOGE is trading near the $0.3750 support and might bounce back. DOGE price started a fresh decline below the $0.420 level. The price is trading below the $0.40 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.4260 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start another rally if it clears the $0.420 and $0.4250 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Dips To Support Dogecoin price started a fresh decline from well above $0.440 like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE traded below the $0.4120 and $0.400 support levels. It even spiked below $0.3880. A low was formed at $0.3749 and the price is now consolidating losses. It recovered some points and climbed above $0.3850.

The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.4250 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.4260 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4777 swing high to the $0.3749 low. The next major resistance is near the $0.4550 level. A close above the $0.4550 resistance might send the price toward the $0.4650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5000 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.5200. More Losses In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.4250 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.3880 level. The next major support is near the $0.3750 level. The main support sits at $0.3650. If there is a downside break below the $0.3650 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.3420 level or even $0.3250 in the near term.

In the video, Long outlined Ripple’s readiness to launch its highly anticipated RLUSD stablecoin and its vision for stablecoins as a transformative payment force. Long highlighted the rapid growth potential of the stablecoin market, which currently holds a market capitalization of about $1 billion but is projected to exceed $3 trillion within a few years. According to Long, this surge will be driven by increasing use cases, particularly in payments. She pointed to Stripe’s acquisition of Bridge as a signal of major payment players integrating stablecoins into their operations, reinforcing the growing demand for digital assets in mainstream financial systems. Ripple’s achievements in this space were also emphasized. “We’ve processed more than $70 billion through digital assets,” Long said, underlining the company’s proven capabilities. Ripple sees stablecoins as central to this evolution and is poised to meet growing market needs with its RLUSD offering. “We have the use case and customers who already want to use stablecoins in payments,” she added. BREAKING NEWS! Ripple President Monica Long drops a bombshell on $RLUSD & $XRP : ""Stablecoins for payments are the next massive trend—and Ripple is READY! We already have the use-case and customers lining up!"" #XRP IS GEARED FOR A LEGENDARY PUMP! pic.twitter.com/LWqjdQW94F — Cheeky Crypto (@CheekyCrypto) December 7, 2024 RLUSD and Ripple’s Vision for Stablecoins The launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin, will be a major step forward for the company. While the stablecoin is “operationally ready” according to Long, regulatory approval is a key factor delaying its rollout. Long noted that Ripple is working with the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to finalize its trust application. Long emphasized the importance of regulatory compliance in ensuring the stablecoin’s success, a sentiment the company recently expressed when providing an update on the stablecoin’s status . The community views RLUSD as a significant addition to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem. Many believe the stablecoin will bolster XRP’s utility, particularly as a bridge asset on the network. Beyond these technical advantages, RLUSD is expected to draw increased attention to Ripple’s blockchain technology and expand its role in global payment solutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Growing Market, Not a Competition Long dismissed the notion of directly challenging market leaders when asked about competition with existing stablecoins. Instead, she expressed confidence in the market’s ability to expand, creating room for new entrants like RLUSD. “I expect the market to really expand,” she said, reinforcing Ripple’s growth-oriented approach rather than a zero-sum competitive strategy. Ripple’s deliberate engagement with regulators reflects its commitment to fostering trust and compliance. This positions the company to take advantage of growing institutional interest in stablecoins, and experts believe RLUSD can significantly benefit XRP’s growth when it launches.

Recently, Baby DogeCoin (BABYDOGE) made waves after a bullish surge triggered by an Elon Musk tweet, and SPX6900 (SPX) has kept traders on their toes with its unpredictable yet exciting market performance. But the real head-turner this week? BTFD Coin (BTFD) , is crushing it with a jaw-dropping presale that’s already raised over $2.6 million! The BTFD Coin presale is now in its 10th stage, selling at just $0.0001 per coin. With over 44 billion tokens sold and 3,900 investors already on board, this is shaping up to be one of the best meme coins to invest in this weekend. BTFD isn’t just about riding the hype—it’s got a robust ecosystem featuring staking rewards, a play-to-earn game, and an ambitious plan to capitalise on the next bull run. Ready to explore why this meme coin could change your portfolio? Let’s dive in! BTFD Coin: $2.6M Presale and a Bullish Future It’s not every day that a meme coin presale raises over $2.6 million in record time, but BTFD Coin has done just that. Since launching on November 26, 2024, this project has captured the hearts (and wallets) of over 3,900 investors. Over 44 billion BTFD tokens have already been snapped up, and at just $0.0001 per token in Stage 10, this is an opportunity that’s hard to ignore. With a planned listing price of $0.0006, early investors could see their investments multiply sixfold. Wondering how this could work for you? Let’s do the maths. Imagine you invest $2,000 at Stage 10 prices of $0.0001 per coin. You’d bag a whopping 20 million BTFD tokens. By the end of the presale, those coins could be worth $12,000. Not bad for a weekend play, exactly? BTFD isn’t just about numbers, though. This project comes packed with features like a play-to-earn game, staking rewards boasting 90% APY, and a community-centric ethos led by the “Bulls Squad.” Built on Ethereum, the project ensures robust scalability, security, and liquidity. So, why wait? BTFD Coin is poised to ride the next bull run, and if you’re serious about capitalising on dips, this one’s a no-brainer. Baby Doge Coin: Social Buzz and Network Expansion Who doesn’t love a good doge? Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) continues to ride the meme wave with its charming branding and strong community. Recent news has kept this coin in the spotlight. Earlier this year, Baby Doge expanded its operations to the Solana network, solidifying its place in the multichain ecosystem. Add to that its impressive burn initiatives to reduce supply, and you’ve got a coin that knows how to keep its fans engaged. But what really got everyone barking was Elon Musk’s cryptic tweet last week, sending BABYDOGE’s price soaring by over 75%. Currently trading at $0.000000002, this little doggie is proving it’s got the bite to match its bark. While Baby Doge doesn’t have the same presale buzz as BTFD Coin, it remains one of the best meme coins to invest in this weekend for its long-term potential. It’s a community favourite for a reason, and if you’ve got a soft spot for canine-inspired cryptos, this one’s worth keeping on your radar. SPX6900: Meme Coin Meets Market Gains If chaotic energy and meme-worthy campaigns are your vibe, SPX6900 (SPX) is your coin. Trading at $0.7321, SPX6900 has seen a solid 7.29% rise over the past week, with a market cap nearing $680 million. What’s fuelling this growth? A combination of exchange listings, community-driven initiatives, and a growing fan base that thrives on unpredictability. October saw SPX6900 achieve an eye-watering 5,204% increase over 30 days—a feat not many coins can claim. However, its wild price swings mean this isn’t a coin for the faint of heart. Analysts note that while SPX6900’s speculative nature is risky, its potential for outsized returns makes it a contender for the best meme coins to invest in this weekend. Don’t Miss The Best Meme Coins to Invest in This Weekend Based on market trends and our analysis, BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands out as the ultimate choice for investors looking to maximise returns. Its presale success, innovative ecosystem, and sixfold price potential make it a top pick. Baby Doge Coin holds strong appeal for those drawn to community-driven projects with a proven track record, while SPX6900 caters to thrill-seekers with its high-risk, high-reward potential. So, what are you waiting for? Join the BTFD Coin presale right now, and don’t miss your chance to ride the next wave of meme coin success. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a curious newcomer, these are the coins you’ll want to watch this weekend. BTFD, BABYDOGE, or SPX6900—who’s got your vote?

Despite the decline in prices, the sentiment remains bullish, with many expecting further growth in the long term. Bitcoin has dipped by more than three percent and is trading close to the $96k level at the time of writing. While the Bitcoin market might be seeing declines, altcoins are also experiencing corrections, and this phase is seen as a crucial part of the market’s long-term cycle. Altcoins like XRP, ADA, DOGE and TRON have recorded double-digit losses and might even dip further. Some market analysts, including prominent figures in the crypto space, have been calling for a 10-20% dip, seeing it as a necessary correction. With the total cryptocurrency market cap recently falling to around $930 billion, many are watching closely to understand if this is the bottom or if further declines are ahead. Analyst Crypto Capital Venture pointed to historical data showing 30% dips in total market cap, including significant drops in altcoins. Such corrections are viewed not as bearish signals, but as opportunities for a stronger bullish run. Looking closely at altcoins, the analyst gave Cardano (ADA) as an example. After breaking a dollar, ADA experienced some volatility , with price drops below $1, but the analyst remains bullish. “These moves are normal,” the analyst explained, pointing to past cycles where ADA experienced dips but later surged back to higher levels. Conclusion: Will the Bullish Trend Survive? Recent developments, including potential U.S. government Bitcoin purchases and discussions around a new crypto tax policy , are fueling optimism for 2025. These factors, combined with historical market patterns, suggest that the bullish trend could continue into the next year, despite current volatility. The analyst said that for long-term holders, these dips are seen as buying opportunities ahead of what could be a significant bull run in the near future.",News,EN,0,0,ADA|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-10 05:20:00

Bitcoin Liquidations Hit $1.5 Billion appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency industry registered heightened volatility in the past 24 hours as Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped more than 6 percent in the past 24 hours to reach a daily range low of about $94,725. The sudden Bitcoin drop heavily impacted the altcoin sector, with the TOTAL2 shedding more than 15 percent, representing over $258 billion. As a result, the total crypto market cap slipped over 7 percent to hover around $3.58 trillion on Tuesday, December 10, during the early Asian session. Nonetheless, a few outlier altcoins registered notable gains in the past 24 hours, led by Baby DogeCoin ($BABYDOGE) and Movement (MOVE). Major Factors that Contributed to Crypto Selloff Today Quantum Bitcoin FUD On Monday, tech giant Google announ ced the launch of Willow, a next-generation quantum chip. According to the company, Willow can perform a benchmark computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years, a figure that exceeds the known age of the universe. While the announcement was huge for the technology sector, it was a huge shakeout for the entire cryptocurrency industry, more so Bitcoin (BTC). Moreover, Bitcoin’s cryptography relies on difficulty adjustment, which is often more than 5 minutes, thus potentially giving Google’s Willow quantum chip a theoretical advantage. Googles new Quantum chip, Willow: – 105 qubits You would need 13 MILLION to 1.9 BILLION qubits to compromise Bitcoin within a practical timeframe TLDR: Bitcoin will be fine for decades — borovik (@3orovik) December 9, 2024 However, experts believe that Bitcoin can simply adapt to a quantum computer attack through necessary difficulty adjustments and security upgrades. Retrace of Bitcoin Countries On Monday, the on-data analysis revealed that the Royal Government of Bhutan transferred 406 Bitcoins to QCP Capital, worth around $40 million. As a major holder of Bitcoin, with a balance of over 11k, the Royal Government of Bhutan will remain a major potential threat to bullish sentiment. Meanwhile, a report emerged that El Salvador could ease its Bitcoin adoption agenda in the country to strike a deal with the IMF on a $1.3 billion loan. Leveraged and Futures Market Cool-off The cryptocurrency market also experienced heightened selling pressure amid heightened liquidations in the leveraged sector . According to the latest market data, more than 582k traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with the total liquidations at over $1.7 billion. Notably, more than $1.5 billion involved long traders, thus triggering a more rejuvenated long squeeze as more traders attempted to catch the falling wave. Meanwhile, the total crypto open interest (OI) dropped from over $138 billion to hover around $123 billion at the time of this writing. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market is Striking Down With Record-Breaking Liquidations-Here’s What’s Next for Bitcoin & Altcoins , On the Flipside Despite the sudden crypto selloff, institutional investors continued with the previous Bitcoin accumulation cycle .

One of the top coins performing well during this period is Dogecoin . The Dogecoin price has surged by over 100% in the past month, aiming for new highs as the recent bull run continues. However, Rollblock , a new online casino token, is giving DOGE a run for its money. The utility token has raised over $7 million during its presale after experiencing massive whale accumulation. The recent development has caused strong speculations that the hot new crypto will outshine DOGE by the end of 2025. Let’s find out why. Dogecoin reaches for the moon: Is a new all-time high possible? Following the recent surge in the Dogecoin price , some experts are predicting the meme coin is on its way to $1. Currently, the DOGE price is around $0.4, up by over 100% in the past month. Dogecoin’s market cap has also increased to over $61 billion, cementing its place as the top meme coin by market cap. The increase in the DOGE price comes after the broader crypto bull run and shouts that a new altcoin season is close. Moreover, recent developments, including the establishment of a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) by President-elect Donald Trump, have caused more futures traders to accumulate DOGE for potential gains. DOGE soars alongside other meme coins The bullish move in the meme coin market is not peculiar to DOGE. Other meme coins have been rallying after the shift in investor sentiment from Bitcoin. Following the giant strides that saw it reach a new all-time high (ATH) of over $99,000, the Bitcoin price has dropped to just above $95K, causing a shift to altcoins like Ethereum and meme tokens like DOGE, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. Similarly, the entire meme coin market cap has increased from around $55 billion in early November to over $122 billion in early December. Meme coin transactions have also surged among long-term and short-term investors. However, DOGE still leads the pack in terms of market cap and trading volume. Rollblock challenges DOGE with its successful presale While DOGE has been soaring, it faces a challenge from Rollblock . The hot new crypto has already moved by over 310% since its presale began, offering investors massive gains before its full launch. Consequently, the coin has raised over $7 million, showing early signs of success. However, its utility will be the major driver in the coming months. That’s because the Rollblock token has various use cases within the gaming ecosystem. These include serving as the reward token in its revenue-sharing program, which rewards token holders with a share of the weekly profits. The RBLK token also incentivizes investors who participate in its staking program, allowing them to earn up to 30% annual percentage yield (APY), paid in RBLK. Additionally, there’s a VIP program for dedicated casino players to earn more RBLK tokens based on their activities on the platform. Conclusion Despite being in its presale stage, Rollblock is already challenging DOGE as the next altcoin to explode. Interested investors can lock in some Rollblock tokens at a low price of $0.041 in stage 9. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Been In Huge Profits Recently As CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn explained in a new post on X, the long-term holders have sold big in the past month. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins for more than 155 days. This cohort includes the most relentless hands of the market, who rarely sell regardless of whether a rally or crash is going on. These investors are in sharp contrast to the “short-term holders” (STHs), who generally react to any happening in the sector. Related Reading: Analyst Sets $4.40 XRP Target As 3rd-Straight Bull Pennant Forms As such, the times that the LTHs decide to sell can be to watch out for since it means the market is at a stage where even these diamond hands have become tempted to part with their long-held coins. Bitcoin is currently experiencing one such instance, as the bull run to unseen highs has forced some LTHs into harvesting their hard-earned profits. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day change for the LTH supply. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin LTH supply has registered a large negative change during the past month, which suggests these HODLers have broken their silence. In total, the diamond hands have transferred 827,783 BTC in this window. Naturally, not all transactions correspond to selling, but generally, there is a high chance of selling being the intent whenever the LTHs move their coins. The reason behind the LTH selloff becomes apparent when considering the group’s profit-loss margin. As CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr pointed out in an X post, the group is sitting on average profits of 326%. From the chart, it’s visible that while the profits of the Bitcoin LTHs are high on their own, they are still considerably less than the margin during the 2021 bull run. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flash Crash Causes $710 Million In Crypto Long Liquidations This, of course, doesn’t mean that the current rally also has as much room left to go, as it’s very possible that this cycle would simply net these diamond hands fewer gains than last time. While the LTHs have been spending significant amounts recently, Bitcoin hasn’t budged too much, which implies considerable new demand is still flowing into the sector that is absorbing this selling pressure. However, It remains to be seen how long this balance will be maintained. BTC Price Bitcoin had shown a brief break out of its consolidation phase earlier in the month, but it would appear the asset has found its way back into the range as its price is now trading around $98,200.

This depicts the traders being highly uncertain and pulling off their holding following a small pullback. Besides, the altcoins have been crushed heavily; the memecoins dropped by a massive margin. What triggered the sell-off? Why crypto market is down today? Will BTC price hold the monthly open range? The crypto markets underwent an unexpected turn before the previous day’s close, wiping nearly $260 billion from the market cap. Besides, the 24-hour trading volume surged exceptionally, reaching nearly $350 billion from $150 billion. This suggests the traders fell into the trap of panic selling, resulting in massive long liquidations. As per the data from Coinglass, the markets had one of the highest liquidations in recent history. The crypto markets faced long liquidations of over $1.76 billion, with more than 5.86K traders liquidated. Interestingly, it was not Bitcoin that faced the highest liquidation but the other altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin, etc. The single largest liquidation was on Binance, liquidating $19.6 million worth of ETH, while the total liquidation of the second largest token is around $250 million, compared to $190 million worth of Bitcoin. This suggests the traders remain hopeful of a BTC rebound but are uncertain about the prospects of the altcoins. Will the Bitcoin price trigger a rebound? Will it close the yearly trade above $100K? Regardless of the market fluctuations, institutions continue to accumulate BTC. The spot BTC ETF marked another positive day with netflows of around $483 million. Blackrock’s IBIT maintains its 7-day inflow streak, bringing over $398. 6 million worth of BTC, totalling over $3.14 billion. The current market scenario suggests the institutions are benefiting from the trader’s panic selling. Now that the Bitcoin price has regained some momentum, the markets are expected to rebound in a short while.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-10 05:34:08

How Dogizen is Challenging Animal Meme Coins,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-first-ever-telegram-ico-how-dogizen-is-challenging-animal-meme-coins/,"Whether it’s dogs, cats, frogs, or hippos, animal meme coins are all the rage. But right now, the windows for parabolic growth with the main animal meme coins like Pepe and dogwifhat are closed due to their large market caps. Investors are now looking for the next challenger to turn in the same gains, and one of the strongest candidates on the board for a pump has come in the form of Dogizen —a canine-flavored Telegram gaming project. Dogizen has raised an impressive $1.4m and its status as the first-ever ICO on Telegram—one of the fastest-growing social messaging apps—and place within the broader Telegram gaming niche gives the DOGIZ token serious potential for a 100x spike. Animal meme coin sector mooning in 2024 Meme coins have outperformed every other digital asset within crypto all year long. And now, the FOMO is real . The institutions and fat cats on Wall Street wish they loosened up their purse strings to throw their lunch money on cats and dogs. Particularly dogs, with two-thirds of the $125 billion meme coin sector dominated by the canine species. That market share is only set to rise with no less than the mainstream media and the incoming secretary of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) hyping up Dogecoin . It’s all just a matter of time before the hype turns into FOMO for retail investors worldwide. Dogizen elevating the animal meme coin game Dogizen’s canine-themed branding is firmly tapped into the lucrative animal meme coin and GameFi narratives. It is the answer to Telegram CEO Pavel Durov’s wish to see a canine-themed equivalent to the massively successful Telegram game Catizen. Plus, Dogizen’s status as the pioneering ICO on Telegram is expected to captivate a substantial portion of the social messaging app’s 950 million users and counting . Dogizen’s ICO will be available directly on Telegram, exposing its native token, DOGIZ, to an audience ready for the canine equivalent of one of the year’s biggest names in the Telegram gaming sector. Dogizen doesn’t stop at being just another immersive tap-to-earn Telegram game, though—it is launching an SDK for developers to build new Telegram games within the Dogizen ecosystem. It’s laying down the foundations for becoming a development layer for the Telegram gaming sector, which could translate into even greater adoption in the coming years. Dogizen: At the intersection of meme coins and Telegram gaming The ever-growing GameFi sector is on the verge of a major breakout in 2025—and Dogizen is right in the middle of one of its hottest niches. Dogizen’s roadmap and groundbreaking features, combined with its targeting of the hottest narrative in crypto, animal meme coins, prime it for blue chip status and crazy growth.

Altcoins See Heavy Dumping in Broader Market Sell-off Since September, this has been the fastest flush-out in altcoins as traders re-align their positions in order to identify any buy-the-dip opportunities. Today’s Bitcoin price drop under $95,000 has led to greater liquidations in the overall crypto market. Blockchain analytics platform Santiment observed that cryptocurrencies that experienced substantial gains during the bull run of the last two months, faced severe drops in the last 24 hours. However, it added that if retail traders succumb to fear and begin offloading their holdings, the market could witness a swift rebound as buying opportunities emerge. On the other hand, crypto analyst IncomeSharks noted that the alt sector managed to maintain the super trend, with professional traders buying the dips. IncomeSharks has expressed optimism about the recent downturn in altcoin prices, describing it as a potentially bullish development for the market. “This is the most bullish thing to happen to altcoins,” noted the analyst. It also led to strong crypto liquidations, now nearing $2 billion. Source: IncomeSharks The analyst noted that the correction has allowed the market to flush out new buyers while maintaining Supertrend support levels, which is a bullish indicator. As per another crypto analyst Rekt Capital, the overall altcoin market has faced rejection from a historically significant resistance level. However, the analyst suggested that the pullback may be less severe this time, indicating a weakening of the $425 billion resistance mark. This trend could signal growing momentum for a potential breakthrough in the near future Source: Rekt Capital Crypto Liquidations Soar to $1.76 Billion As per the Coinglass data , the crypto liquidations have soared to $1.76 billion in the last 24 hours with $1.58 billion in long liquidations and $185 million in short liquidations. In a dramatic turn of events, the cryptocurrency market saw significant turbulence over the past 24 hours, with 583,647 traders liquidated across exchanges. The largest single liquidation order occurred on Binance in the ETH/USDT pair, amounting to $19.69 million. Commenting on the development, popular crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe stated: “That’s the flash crash drop on altcoins. Some have dropped by 30% on the day. Don’t worry, this will reverse back fast, you’d want to see such a massive collapse and liquidity wipe. Onwards we go”. Following today’s crash, Bitcoin’s dominance has inched a notch higher. Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen highlighted a significant milestone in Bitcoin dominance, noting that it recently touched the prior wedge level when excluding stablecoins. Cowen remarked that as long as Bitcoin dominance remains below this level, altcoin-to-Bitcoin (ALT/BTC) trading pairs are structurally stable. Source: Benjamin Cowen At press time, the BTC price is trading 2.6% down at $96,905 with a market cap of $1.917 trillion. The 24-hour Bitcoin liquidations have surged to $189 million with $149 million in long liquidations. On the other hand, the Ethereum price is down 6.62% to the $3,684 level as per the indications on the technical chart. Crypto market analysts believe that these dips are still for buying as ETH could reverse the trajectory again.

Brandt shared what he described as the “most powerful chart in the crypto world,” emphasizing the significance of XRP’s market cap breaking through a substantial triangular consolidation pattern, signaling potential momentum in the cryptocurrency’s performance. This the most powerful chart in all of crypto world $XRPUSD pic.twitter.com/UexaPB4D9r — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 7, 2024 The digital asset has demonstrated remarkable performance recently. XRP is trading at $2.17, down 12% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, it recently crossed $2 for the first time since 2018. It has maintained this level since then. The asset is currently positioned as the third most valuable token by market cap, recently flipping Solana, BNB, and USDT. Experts have predicted that it can surpass Ethereum in the current cycle, and the community is eagerly anticipating further gains. Peter Brandt’s Analysis of XRP Brandt’s chart shows the market cap level of $146.3 billion as a crucial level for XRP to surpass. The digital asset has dropped below this level, currently trading at $2.17 with a market cap of $123.5 billion. Brandt’s analysis represents a notable shift in his previous stance towards XRP. Historically critical of the cryptocurrency, he had previously suggested that the XRP/BTC trading pair was headed towards zero and predicted a potentially significant downturn for its community. His recent perspective marks a dramatic reversal from earlier bearish predictions. He recently predicted that a surge above the asset’s 2021 peak of $1.96 would bring a substantial rally , and following the breakout, XRP surged to a multi-year high of $2.86. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Remarkable Performance Two other factors have also contributed to XRP’s recent surge. First, the unexpected resignation of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has created a sense of regulatory uncertainty and potential optimism within the cryptocurrency market. Second, increasing speculation and discussions surrounding potential exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals have generated additional momentum for the digital asset. However, those excited about ETFs will have to wait, as the SEC has revealed that it won’t approve any more ETFs under the current administration.

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crying Kamala on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crying Kamala by entering its contract address – 5eCJhSGBUN4YwJHLU9ZcWjrjmoufVznjzNBHfo4TN1P7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRYKAMA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-10 05:55:00

The report, led by analysts including Kenneth Worthington, attributes the explosive growth in the market in part to the re-election of President-elect Donald Trump. This political development has ignited a historic rally in the crypto ecosystem that includes tokens, decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins, and public companies with exposure to crypto. Total cryptocurrency market capitalization increased by 45% in November, reaching $3.3 trillion. Trading volumes more than doubled across the market, with some digital assets seeing even higher increases in activity. However, the report noted an opposing trend in non-fungible token (NFT) volumes, which remained relatively stagnant despite the broader market rally. Spot exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the U.S. also hit new milestones with record monthly net sales of $7.6 billion. Bitcoin-focused ETPs saw significant growth in both size and trading volumes, further solidifying Bitcoin’s dominance in the ecosystem. The report noted that Bitcoin’s dominance has increased throughout the year, despite a slight decline in recent weeks due to the increasing popularity of Bitcoin ETPs, and that Bitcoin continues to maintain its importance. At the end of November, Bitcoin ETPs accounted for $105 billion in assets under management. Related News: Binance CEO Richard Teng Makes a Statement for the End of 2024: He Talked About The Fate Of Cryptocurrencies After Trump JPMorgan analysts noted that while Bitcoin ETPs have not significantly impacted BTC spot trading volumes, they have underlined BTC’s central role in the market. The rally in November also boosted the Bitcoin mining economy, with the report noting that the rise in the Bitcoin price outpaced the growth in hashrate, increasing profitability for miners. As the cryptocurrency market begins December, the momentum from November raises questions about sustainability and future trends. With market caps reaching all-time highs and trading volumes increasing, industry watchers are eager to see if the rally will continue into the new year. *This is not investment advice.

CEO Brad Garlinghouse criticized a 60 Minutes segment for omitting critical details about Ripple's legal battle with the SEC, while CTO David Schwartz's cryptic ”lock in” message fueled bullish sentiment among XRP enthusiasts. Brad Garlinghouse Criticizes Omission of Key Facts in 60 Minutes Crypto Election Segment Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse has criticized CBS’ 60 Minutes for allegedly leaving out significant details in its recent segment on cryptocurrency’s influence in the 2024 United States elections. Taking to social media platform X on Dec. 8, Garlinghouse accused the program of providing an incomplete narrative, particularly concerning the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The 60 Minutes report , spearheaded by journalist Margaret Brennan, delved into the role of cryptocurrency in US politics . It highlighted Ripple’s financial support for Fairshake, a political action committee (PAC) advocating for pro-crypto candidates. Ripple’s contributions reportedly amounted to millions of dollars in a bid to influence the elections toward more favorable outcomes for the blockchain and crypto sector. As part of the segment, Garlinghouse explained the SEC’s allegation against Ripple, which claimed that the company’s sales of XRP constituted the sale of unregistered securities. This legal contention, filed in December 2020, has become a cornerstone in the broader debate over the regulatory classification of digital assets. “Their allegation was that Ripple and our sales of XRP represented the sale of an unregistered security,” Garlinghouse stated in the interview. Garlinghouse’s criticism of 60 Minutes stems from what he views as a significant omission. He noted that the program failed to highlight a pivotal July 2024 ruling, where a federal judge declared that XRP was not a security in the context of programmatic sales on digital asset exchanges. In his X post, Garlinghouse said, “[Former SEC official John Reed Stark] knows better despite his comments that 60 Minutes chose to air.” The segment featured Stark’s counterarguments, where he claimed that courts had repeatedly deemed cryptocurrencies as securities under existing legal tests. This commentary, Garlinghouse argued, misrepresented the nuances of XRP’s legal status and undermined the weight of the July ruling. Ripple’s legal challenges with the SEC have been ongoing since December 2020. In August, the company was found liable for a $125 million civil penalty, a decision Ripple has appealed. The case remains unresolved, with the SEC also pursuing a counter-appeal. The regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ripple and XRP continues to be a flashpoint in discussions about the US approach to cryptocurrency oversight. Garlinghouse expressed frustration with the SEC’s leadership, particularly under Chair Gary Gensler, accusing the commission of stifling innovation in the digital asset space. He stated during the interview that organizations like Fairshake might not have been necessary if the SEC had adopted a more progressive stance on digital assets. XRP’s Resurgence Post-Ruling Following the landmark ruling in July, XRP experienced a resurgence, briefly reclaiming its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The ruling provided a temporary morale boost for XRP supporters and raised hopes for a more favorable regulatory environment for other digital assets. Some asset managers have even filed applications with the SEC to launch exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to XRP, signaling renewed interest in the token. The Ripple case has become emblematic of the broader clash between the crypto industry and US regulators over the classification of digital assets. Critics argue that the SEC’s enforcement-heavy approach lacks clarity and hinders innovation. The question of whether cryptocurrencies should be considered securities has become a sticking point, with the industry calling for clearer legislative guidelines. Garlinghouse’s comments come at a critical juncture for cryptocurrency in the United States. With the 2024 elections spotlighting the role of digital assets in shaping policy, Ripple’s high-profile case brings attention to the urgent need for regulatory clarity. As the legal battle continues, the stakes remain high not just for Ripple but for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Ripple CTO Sparks Bullish Sentiment Among XRP Community with ”Lock In” Message Meanwhile, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz , has ignited a wave of excitement within the XRP community following a cryptic post urging followers to “lock in.” The brief yet impactful message has been interpreted by many as a call to hold onto XRP for the long term, fueling optimism around the cryptocurrency's future trajectory. Schwartz’s enigmatic statement, simply saying “Lock in,” was shared on his X account and reposted across the platform. The XRP community, known for its passionate support of Ripple and its digital asset, responded with a flood of bullish sentiments. Many XRP enthusiasts interpreted the phrase as a strong signal to maintain their holdings or even accumulate more XRP, in line with the popular crypto ethos of “hodling.” Notable community member and XRP advocate @XRPcryptowolf echoed the general sentiment, posting, “David just confirmed to lock in and not sell any XRP.” While Schwartz’s statement galvanized enthusiasm, he also took the opportunity to warn the XRP community about the persistent threat of cryptocurrency scams. These schemes often involve fraudsters impersonating prominent figures, including Ripple executives like CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and offering unrealistic returns in exchange for small cryptocurrency transfers. In a humorous yet cautionary post, Schwartz addressed one of the most common scams, writing, “If you send me just 10 XRP, then I will ...... have 10 more XRP.” The lighthearted comment places the spotlight on the seriousness of such fraudulent schemes, which frequently leverage deepfake technology and fake accounts to mislead investors. Ripple’s leadership, including Schwartz and Garlinghouse, has consistently emphasized the importance of vigilance in the face of these scams. XRP’s Bullish Momentum Amid the excitement stirred by Schwartz’s post, XRP appears to be showing strong bullish momentum. According to cryptocurrency analyst and trader Ali Martinez, XRP has formed three consecutive bull pennant patterns on its chart—a technical indicator suggesting the continuation of an upward trend. Martinez has subsequently set ambitious price targets for XRP, predicting that the asset could climb to $4.40 after testing the $2.25 level. As of the latest data from CoinMarketCap , XRP is trading at $2.13, positioning the token well within range of these projections. The bullish sentiment surrounding XRP is bolstered by its recent resurgence as a top-performing cryptocurrency. The asset has experienced significant growth in both price and adoption, particularly following Ripple's partial legal victory against the SEC earlier this year, which ruled that programmatic sales of XRP did not constitute the sale of securities. The XRP community, often referred to as the “XRP Army,” remains steadfast in its belief in the asset's long-term potential. Schwartz’s “lock in” message has amplified this confidence, with many taking it as a direct endorsement of the asset’s bullish outlook. Ripple’s ongoing efforts to expand the use of XRP in cross-border payments and financial services, coupled with its fight for regulatory clarity in the US, continue to position XRP as a pivotal player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. David Schwartz’s cryptic yet impactful “lock in” message has reignited enthusiasm among XRP supporters, coinciding with technical indicators pointing to potential price gains. As Ripple continues to navigate its legal challenges and expand its global footprint, the cryptocurrency appears poised for a promising future. However, Schwartz’s reminder about the prevalence of scams serves as a critical caution for investors to remain vigilant in the dynamic and often unpredictable world of cryptocurrency.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-10 06:15:45
