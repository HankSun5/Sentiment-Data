Analyzing Bitcoin’s bull market signals,https://crypto.news/from-100k-to-250k-analyzing-bitcoins-bull-market-signals/,"Who would have thought we’d see Bitcoin shoot through the roof this quickly, soaring past $100K, albeit retreating slightly at present? As we move forward into 2025, the main question on our minds is: what lies ahead? Is Bitcoin ( BTC ) a bubble about to burst, or are we on track for $150,000–$200,000 soon? Are there any rational tools to predict its trajectory, or are we left to just play guessing games? From what I’ve observed, the fog starts to lift when you examine on-chain and technical indicators, while also factoring in the macro perspective. Let’s layer these three types of analysis in this article to see what picture emerges for Bitcoin’s next move. Table of Contents Extreme greed, rising active addresses, and record hash rate Weekly Golden Cross signals bull market with $150K-$250K potential RSI signals overbought conditions, hints at pullback or consolidation Fibonacci levels and Bollinger Bands signal key support and potential cooling Visualizing Bitcoin’s market behavior through key indicators Potential crypto space developments in 2025 Closing thoughts Extreme greed, rising active addresses, and record hash rate The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is currently at 78, indicating Extreme Greed, which often signals potential tops in the short term. However, sustained levels of extreme greed during bull markets often align with parabolic price increases before final peaks. This typically precedes short-term pullbacks due to market exuberance, which appears to be what we’re witnessing now as Bitcoin’s price hovers around the $100K level. Crypto Fear & Greed Index | Source: Alternative.me The number of active addresses is increasing and, as of Dec. 8, stands at 855,153, suggesting heightened interest and usage of the Bitcoin network. Number of active BTC addresses | Source: Glassnode As of Dec. 9, 2024, Bitcoin’s hash rate is approximately 850.70 EH/s, reflecting a significant recovery from recent fluctuations but remaining below its all-time high of 949.98 EH/s, recorded on Nov. 26, 2024. While the current hash rate hasn’t yet reclaimed the ATH, this sustained strength reflects miner confidence and network security—long-term bullish signals. Bitcoin’s price tends to follow the hash rate; the more confident miners are about price appreciation, the less likely they are to sell. BTC hash rate | Source: CoinWarz Weekly Golden Cross signals bull market with $150K-$250K potential The weekly Golden Cross, where the 50-week moving average crosses above the 200-week MA, is a highly significant signal for long-term investors because it often marks the start of major bull markets and the conclusion of prolonged bearish phases. The previous instance of this signal occurred when Bitcoin recovered from the 2018 bear market and eventually surged to an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021. Mirroring its behavior in previous bull cycles, this signal reappeared in early 2024 and preceded Bitcoin’s parabolic rise to its recent all-time high of $103,647. Previous bull cycles following weekly Golden Crosses have led to gains of 300%–600%. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin could potentially reach $150,000 to $250,000 before the next major cycle correction. Meanwhile, the next Golden Cross is unlikely until 2026 or 2027, assuming Bitcoin undergoes a complete cycle of price appreciation, correction, and consolidation. BTC Golden & Death Cross pattern | Source: TradingView RSI signals overbought conditions, hints at pullback or consolidation On the weekly timeframe, the Relative Strength Index is at 74.47, consistent with overbought conditions. However, this does not imply a trend reversal right away but rather reflects the possibility of a short-term pullback or a period of sideways price action. In the past, many bull cycles saw similar RSI readings, followed by temporary pullbacks that were then succeeded by renewed rallies to higher highs. In the 2021 bull cycle, the RSI reached similar levels multiple times before peaking above 90, after which Bitcoin experienced a significant correction. Assuming Bitcoin stays in the most recent consolidation range around $100K and the RSI retraces back to a healthier range of 60–65, the next leg upward could occur. A healthy correction of 10%–20% or a sideways period would allow the markets to reset before experiencing sustained growth. For reference, a 10% correction from the all-time high of $103,647 would bring Bitcoin’s price to approximately $93,282. Relative Strength Index | Source: TradingView Fibonacci levels and Bollinger Bands signal key support and potential cooling Fibonacci retracement levels, used in technical analysis to identify potential support and resistance zones, help indicate where a price might retrace before continuing its trend. Based on the chart below: Key Levels: $71,858 (0.618): Major retracement level, acting as a strong support zone (a 30.67% pullback from the all-time high of $103,647). $103,135 (0.786): Significant resistance zone, near the all-time high. Bitcoin’s price is currently trading slightly below the upper Bollinger Band, signaling strong bullish momentum. However, this position also indicates potential overextension, as prices often retrace or consolidate when deviating significantly from the midline (20-week simple moving average, currently at $71,858). A pullback to $71,858 or further consolidation near the current price of $99,249 would represent a normal cooling-off period within the Bollinger Band framework and prepare the market for potential further gains. Fibonacci retracement levels & Bollinger Bands | Source: TradingView Visualizing Bitcoin’s market behavior through key indicators To further visually represent Bitcoin’s market behavior, let’s look at this colored chart below. It includes a color-coded bar at the top that reflects RSI conditions. The currently visible purple and green color blocks suggest periods of oversold or bullish divergence, reflecting bullish momentum and aligning with RSI overbought levels. The second bar shows market structure trends (e.g., ranging, bullish, or bearish). From the chart, we see green blocks that suggest the market is in a bullish phase, confirming breakout behavior. Next, the main oscillator displays the Awesome Oscillator with divergences and pivot points, where the green peaks above zero and brown regions below confirm positive momentum and bullish pivots. The secondary oscillator below the AO displays similar momentum indications, with positive bars (green above zero) suggesting accelerating upward momentum and a strong bullish bias. Bitcoin Rainbow Indicators | Source: TradingView Potential crypto space developments in 2025 Post-halving supply shock, increasing retail and institutional participation, institutional accumulation (companies like MicroStrategy and other corporate treasuries adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset) could push demand for it to new highs. The proportion of institutional investors will likely grow, stabilizing price movements but also making Bitcoin more correlated with traditional markets. Bitcoin’s dominance (currently around 55%) could rise further as investors favor its “digital gold” narrative over altcoins, especially if regulatory scrutiny tightens around smaller tokens. Bitcoin wallet growth will continue as adoption in emerging markets increases, with Bitcoin used as a hedge against local currency devaluation. Major corporations could start settling cross-border transactions in Bitcoin, while in regions with high inflation or de-dollarization trends central banks may increase interest in Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Countries like the U.S., the EU, and the UAE are likely to finalize crypto-friendly regulations , while other jurisdictions may clamp down on decentralized finance and self-custody to maintain control over financial systems. Closing thoughts With a loud explosion of excitement, Bitcoin shattered the $100K barrier, an achievement deemed nothing short of astonishing. Technical indicators, including the weekly Golden Cross and RSI, point toward the possibility of further growth, with projections suggesting a potential climb to $150K–$250K in this bull cycle. However, a healthy period of consolidation or correction would likely provide a stronger foundation for future price action. By 2025, Bitcoin may achieve what was once considered nearly impossible—establishing itself as a major player in the global financial system.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2024-12-09 23:01:13

In a recent X thread, Hougan explained that the regulatory uncertainty is hurting the industry and preventing it from reaching its full potential. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan Stance On Crypto Regulation Clarity Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan pointed out that the U.S. regulatory framework divides financial assets into two categories: securities and commodities. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates securities, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversees commodities. According to Hougan, this division exists because securities often have insiders—entities that hold crucial information unavailable to the public. In contrast, commodities like gold or oil do not have insiders in the same way. This is why they are regulated differently, with the CFTC focusing on ensuring fair markets rather than requiring detailed financial disclosures, as the SEC does for securities. In his X thread, the Bitwise CIO emphasized that decentralized projects, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, cannot have traditional insiders due to their inherent design. These projects are decentralized by nature, meaning there are no central authorities or entities with inside information. Therefore, attempting to classify cryptocurrencies as securities, as is often done in current U.S. regulatory discussions, does not align with the reality of how these networks function. Echoing Hougan’s sentiment, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse had also criticized current crypto regulatory frameworks , arguing that existing securities laws do not align with the technological advancements crypto represents. Decentralization and Regulation Challenges The core idea behind cryptocurrency is decentralization, which is a challenge when it comes to traditional regulatory frameworks. For example, Hougan explained that traditional securities require disclosures like financial statements or ownership structures to prevent insiders from taking advantage of the public. However, in decentralized networks, there is no single entity to disclose such information, making it difficult to fit them under current securities laws. As Hougan points out, the problem is not that crypto lacks transparency but that the current regulatory approach doesn’t consider the unique nature of blockchain technology. Instead of trying to fit crypto into outdated frameworks, Hougan advocates for a more tailored regulatory approach that takes into account the decentralized nature of these projects. This would ensure that investors are protected while allowing for innovation to thrive. The Case for CFTC Regulation One key point Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan made is that instead of trying to regulate decentralized crypto projects as securities under the SEC, there is a growing argument to have the CFTC oversee them. He explained that the CFTC’s focus on creating fair markets, rather than requiring insider disclosures, makes it a more appropriate regulatory body for decentralized networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Hougan pointed out that some in the industry, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse , have argued for CFTC regulation. They believe that the SEC’s current stance on crypto as securities is not only ineffective but also counterproductive. Meanwhile, Garlinghouse took issue with former SEC official John Reed Stark’s claims that cryptocurrencies, including Ripple’s XRP, are securities. Garlinghouse strongly disagreed, calling Stark’s comments “provably false” and asserting that XRP is not a security. Concurrenctly, he criticized the lack of media fact-checking, pointing out that the segment omitted crucial parts of his interview, including his clarification that XRP is not a security under current laws. Subsequently, the US SEC’s strict approach, according to Matt Hougan, could stifle innovation and harm the industry, especially when good projects are caught in the regulatory crossfire alongside bad actors.

Currently, XRP trades between $1.60 and $2.67. The coin is approaching its nearest resistance level at $3.00. Breaking through this point could lead XRP to the next resistance level at $3.61. On the flipside, the closest support level is at $0.9099, which could help stabilize the price if it starts to fall. Technical indicators provide further insight. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.54, slightly above the 100-day average of $2.42, suggesting a potential uptrend in the short term. The RSI is at 56.65, indicating that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic value is 50.66, reflecting a neutral stance. A MACD level of 0.0159 suggests continued price increases for XRP. You might also like: Experts highlight XRP, Cardano, PEPE, and XYZVerse as top bets Pepe Pepe has been on a remarkable run lately.

Dogecoin: From meme to market contender Dogecoin launched in 2013 as a playful alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply and generates 10,000 new coins every minute. While originally considered just a meme coin, Dogecoin surged in value in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market cap exceeding $50 billion. This growth was largely driven by social media buzz, particularly endorsements from Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s popularity underscores the power of community and social media in shaping financial markets. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin’s appeal continues to hinge on social media influence and overall market sentiment.

Launched without transaction taxes, it maintains a pure meme coin identity without utility features. In mid-2023, it reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion, attracting significant attention in the crypto community and sparking a meme coin trend. Pepe features a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and a redistribution system to reward long-term holders. Its roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. As an ERC-20 token, PEPE benefits from Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake security. It is available on platforms like Uniswap, Binance, and KuCoin. PEPE’s popularity and community support contribute to its prominence in the current market cycle. Dogwifhat Dogwifhat is a new meme coin on the Solana blockchain, inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. WIF stands out among dog-themed tokens in the crypto space, focusing on creating a sense of community and fun. In the current market cycle, interest in meme coins continues and WIF’s popularity is growing. The coin leverages Solana’s fast and low-cost transactions, which may attract users. Its appeal lies in the combination of meme culture and blockchain technology, which some investors find intriguing. BONK BONK is another meme coin on the Solana blockchain, featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. After a Coinbase listing, BONK surged over 100%. 50% of Bonk’s supply was airdropped to Solana’s NFT and DeFi participants, serving as a “community coin.” In mid-December 2023, BONK was the third-largest meme coin by market cap, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like a high total supply and the volatile nature of meme coins, BONK’s integration into the Solana ecosystem and involvement in dApps like BonkSwap make it a notable player. In the current market cycle, BONK shows potential due to its community focus and ecosystem integration. Conclusion Although DOGE, PEPE, WIF, and BONK may have limited immediate potential, DOGEN stands out. Tailored for those pursuing the best in life, it embodies luxury and success. With an expected 700% presale growth and potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN follows the successful paths of tokens like BONK and WIF. It seeks to gather a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters. For more information on DOGEN, visit their website , Twitter , or Telegram .

On Monday, these analysts raised the price target for Coinbase Global, Inc’s stock COIN to $420 per share. The revised estimate represents a notable increase from the firm’s $375 target. This increase reflects the growing optimism around Coinbase’s performance. This is largely driven by strong activity in the crypto market, particularly in December. Crypto Market Activity Drives Coinbase Price Target Increase The analysts attributed the boost to a major surge in retail activity within the crypto market. The exchange’s trading volumes are on track to reach record levels. This makes it one of the most active months for crypto trading in Coinbase’s history. The analysts pointed to Bitcoin’s volatility, particularly as its price approached $100,000, as a key factor driving the surge in market activity. They also highlighted the growing interest in altcoins , contributing to the boost. This combination of factors has led to a significant increase in trading volume across the crypto market. Coinbase’s Strong Year and Surge in Share Price Coinbase’s stock has soared more than 80% in 2024, reflecting the broader growth in the crypto market. The company saw a significant sharp uptick in its share price. This surge follows Donald Trump’s unexpected victory in November’s presidential election. Trump’s victory catalyzed a rally across digital assets, pushing Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark. This sparked renewed investor interest in crypto. Many investors view Coinbase’s stocks as an easy way to access the crypto market. Its strong infrastructure and market dominance make it a popular choice for those wanting to profit from crypto’s rise without managing digital assets directly. Looking Ahead: Strong Predictions for Q4 and 2025 Needham’s analysts expressed optimism about Coinbase’s financial trajectory. The analysts forecasted significant results for Q4 2024 and into 2025. Needham’s analysts predicted that Coinbase will continue to post strong financial results in the near future. For the fourth quarter of 2024, they predict the company will report $435 billion in trading volume and generate $2.1 billion in revenue. They expect the company’s stock earnings to reach $2.37 per share. Looking ahead to 2025, they forecast the company will earn $8.9 billion in revenue and report earnings per share of $9.61. Despite these optimistic predictions, Coinbase’s stock fell 8% on Monday, trading at $316.01 by midday. However, this dip does not overshadow the strong growth the company has experienced this year. Its share price has surged from under $200 to over $300, especially following the election. This highlights the strong momentum behind the company’s stock.

Or how Cosmos is shaking things up with its new interoperability features that connect blockchains like never before? These breakthroughs are turning heads in the crypto world. Amidst these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) emerges as a fresh contender with a bold vision. Unlike others, Qubetics addresses real-world issues that have held back blockchain adoption. With its presale already attracting attention, $TICS is a strong pick for anyone looking for the best coins with 1000X potential . Qubetics Redefines Blockchain Development with QubeQode IDE Qubetics is set to change the game with its innovative QubeQode IDE , an all-in-one tool for simplifying blockchain application development. Whether you’re a tech-savvy entrepreneur or someone with no coding experience, this platform empowers users to create decentralised applications with ease. Imagine a small retail business wanting to launch a blockchain-based loyalty programme. Instead of hiring expensive developers, the owner can use QubeQode’s drag-and-drop features to create a smart contract and manage customer rewards effortlessly. Or picture a logistics company needing better transparency for supply chains. QubeQode provides form-based configurations that allow managers to track goods and authenticate records—all without dealing with complex code. By offering pre-built blockchain functionalities, like token management and user authentication, and a library of pre-written code snippets, QubeQode eliminates the barriers that often keep businesses from exploring blockchain solutions. Qubetics has already sold over 300 million $TICS tokens to more than 8,000 holders, raising $5.3 million in its 12th presale stage. Currently priced at $0.031, $TICS is set to see a 10% price jump in the 13th stage starting this weekend. Each stage lasts just seven days, wrapping up every Sunday at midnight. Now, let’s look at the numbers. An investment of $36,000 at the current price would yield approximately 1,161,290 $TICS tokens. If the price reaches $0.25 by the presale’s end, that investment could grow to $290,322—equating to a 703.21% ROI. Post-presale projections suggest even higher gains, with the token potentially reaching $15, offering returns of 48,092.91%. To learn more about this project, take a look at this video . Litecoin’s Upgrades and Expanding Appeal Litecoin has long been known as Bitcoin’s “silver,” but its recent developments are helping it carve out its own unique identity. With faster block times and reduced transaction fees, Litecoin is positioning itself as a go-to option for everyday payments and digital transfers. The latest upgrade enhances its transaction processing capabilities, making it a reliable alternative for merchants looking for quick settlements. Its focus on scalability and reduced energy consumption also aligns with growing demands for eco-friendly crypto solutions. Litecoin is also gaining traction in cross-border transactions, providing a cost-effective and efficient way to transfer money internationally. With its robust network and practical use cases, Litecoin continues to solidify its position in the market as a high-potential investment. Cosmos Connects Blockchains with Seamless Interoperability Cosmos is taking blockchain communication to the next level with its new interoperability features. By allowing blockchains to share data and assets seamlessly, Cosmos eliminates the silos that have long hindered blockchain innovation. This development is a game-changer for developers and users alike. Decentralised apps can now operate across multiple networks, opening up endless possibilities for creating new solutions. For example, financial apps can leverage data from multiple chains, offering users a more connected and efficient experience. Cosmos’s focus on scalability and usability ensures its place as a forward-thinking platform. Its commitment to interoperability is set to attract more developers and users, further boosting its adoption in the blockchain space. Which Coin Offers the Best 1000X Potential? Qubetics, Litecoin, and Cosmos each bring unique strengths to the table. While Litecoin focuses on fast transactions and secure payments, Cosmos excels in blockchain interoperability. However, Qubetics stands out with its QubeQode IDE and its ability to simplify blockchain adoption across industries. For those eyeing exponential growth, Qubetics’ $TICS token is hard to ignore. Its presale offers a promising entry point, and its innovative solutions make it a contender for the best coins with 1000X potential. Just remember to do your research and invest wisely in this dynamic and ever-evolving market.

If Amazon embraces digital assets, it will join other business titans exploring the inclusion of Bitcoin in their asset portfolios. Related Reading: Countdown To $5 XRP: Engineer Predicts Milestone On ‘Strong Fundamentals’ Bitcoin As Financial Reserve Option Shareholders of Amazon urged the online retail store to evaluate the possibility of adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, saying that the firstborn cryptocurrency could enhance the investors’ value in the long term because it is one way of protecting it from inflation. A US-based think tank told Amazon to assess the prospect of using a portion of its financial reserve to hold Bitcoin to increase its shareholder’s value and fight off inflation. According to a recommendation made by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), the shareholders of the company are asking its Board to investigate if including cryptocurrencies into the treasury of the online retail store serves the best long-term interests of shareholders. HISTORY: SHAREHOLDERS ARE PETITIONING $2.3 TRILLION AMAZON TO BUY #BITCOIN BTC IS IN THE BEST “LONG-TERM INTEREST OF SHAREHOLDERS” 🚀 pic.twitter.com/Nj2wCNrVUn — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) December 9, 2024 The NCPPR submitted the shareholder proposal to Amazon to consider the crypto strategy during the company’s 2025 annual shareholders’ meeting. The American think tank suggested that Amazon should assess the benefits of holding some Bitcoin, encouraging the company to allot even 5% of its $585 billion assets to the cryptocurrency. “Though Bitcoin is currently a volatile asset – as Amazon stock has been at times throughout its history – corporations have a responsibility to maximize shareholder value over the long-term as well as the short-term,” NCPRR stated in the document. The researchers said that including some Bitcoins can diversify the company’s balance sheet, solving this problem without taking on too much volatility. Fighting Inflation The NCPRR said that the inflation rate in the US is going up, adding that cash and bonds are no longer the best approach to protect Amazon’s money. The US-based think tank cited that in the last four years, the average inflation rate in the country is pegged at 4.95%, which even went up to 9.1% in June 2022. It added that the true inflation rate is significantly higher, saying that several studies showed that it is nearly double the Consumer Price Index on occasion. “Amazon should – and perhaps has a fiduciary duty to – consider adding assets to its treasury that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short term,” NCPPR remarked. Simple. Accept bitcoin payments? 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/ud5PVNYHrj — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) December 8, 2024 Bitcoin A Good Option The NCPPR believes that Amazon could preserve billions of dollars of shareholder value by simply holding Bitcoin. The researchers explained that the alpha crypto has been increasing in value unlike cash and bonds whose value is lower than the “true inflation rate”, adding that the digital asset surged by 130% this year, which is performing better than bonds.

He shared his thoughts via a LinkedIn post. Nearly 75% of available Bitcoin is held by 2% of its addresses According to the presentation, a paltry 2% of BTC addresses hold 74% of the digital asset. This highly concentrated power, Aggarwal says, contradicts BTC’s founding principles. He explained: Bitcoin was supposed to be decentralized, step away from the central banks, a freedom from authorities. Do you know it is actually the opposite of that? ~ Aggarwal The analyst also said the concentration could spell trouble for the coin and its network should the few BTC whales decide to dump it. He gave the example of an unnamed Chinese firm that triggered a $649 million flash crash when it sold its holdings. Contrasting thoughts on BTC decentralization Aggarwal’s post received a lot of comments on the issue with some people criticizing his claims while others supported him. Maureen Salim is one of those in support. She depicted the 2% as dragons guarding the gold (BTC). To her, investing in BTC is a high-stakes poker game in which small-scale traders are the chips. She agreed they’d suffer most of the whales decided to sell their stashes. But to Olivier C., Aggarwal was missing the point. He explained that by decentralization, Bitcoiners meant the consensus protocol, which protected the BTC platform. Meanwhile, distribution refers to the amounts held by the wallets. He added that the anti-BTC propaganda was TradFi’s way of continuing to control the financial system. Olivier insisted that BTC was the key to unlocking the free economy. What next for BTC decentralization? The debate on BTC decentralization has remained thorny for a long time. However, it’s coming back to the fore following increased interest in the asset by institutional investors. Some say that shift is beneficial to the coin as it shows the confidence of large-scale investors in BTC. Meanwhile, other crypto users are wary that the entry of big-monied players in the space makes the coin inaccessible to retailers. As the debate rages, there’s a growing need to audit Bitcoin’s evolution to ensure it stays true to the creator’s intentions.

These tokens have gone from niche internet jokes to major players with life-changing potential, sparking attention from seasoned traders and everyday dreamers alike. Think of them as that surprise street snack you grab during a long day—unexpected, exciting, and exactly what you needed when you least expected it. And right now, the market is abuzz with opportunities that are shaping up to be some of the best meme coins for massive return potential. BTFD Coin is one of the standout names on this list, as its presale has proven to be a roaring success. With 44 billion tokens sold and over $2.6 million raised, this token is creating waves that investors can’t ignore. At its current stage, priced at $0.0001, BTFD Coin’s potential price surge could position it as a frontrunner for anyone aiming to get their hands on the best meme coins for massive return potential. Neiro and Non-Playable Coin are also stepping into the spotlight, offering unique opportunities that are exciting investors hungry for explosive returns. Whether it’s meme culture, community engagement, or just sheer market momentum, these coins are riding trends that could change the game for investors. Let’s break down these coins and see what makes them stand out. BTFD Coin: A Presale That Proves the Hype Is Real BTFD Coin has had quite the journey. Its presale numbers are nothing short of legendary—44 billion tokens in the bag and $2.6 million raised. That’s a lot of investor confidence, and it paints a picture of how much potential this token has going forward. The price currently sits at $0.0001, but here’s where things get exciting: analysts are projecting that BTFD Coin could climb to $0.0006 after its launch. That’s a hefty price jump and makes it one of the best meme coins for massive return potential. Think about this—if you were to take a bold step and drop $10,000 into BTFD Coin at this stage, you’d secure a jaw-dropping 100 million BTFD Coins. Now, if it climbs to $0.0006, your initial $10,000 would turn into a cool $60,000. And let’s not forget that BTFD Coin offers a staking reward system averaging a staggering 90% APY . This token isn’t just about market trends; it’s backed by a vibrant community (known as the Bulls Squad), strong staking opportunities, and an innovative approach to the market. If you’re on the hunt for exciting, trendsetting opportunities, BTFD Coin is a no-brainer. Neiro: The Next Market Challenger with a Vision Neiro is the cool little sister of Doge, carrying forward the spirit of meme coin culture while carving out its own path. Adopted by the same woman who previously owned Kabosu—the dog behind the iconic Doge meme—Neiro represents heritage and community spirit. Neiro made headlines as the first meme coin to deploy on the Ethereum blockchain, capturing the attention of Vitalik Buterin on August 4th, 2024 during the New Moon. Vitalik confirmed a generous donation of over $500,000 to an animal welfare fund shortly after, marking the second time he has interacted with a meme coin (the first being the SHIB token in 2021). Originally abandoned and sent to a stray shelter, Neiro’s journey mirrors resilience and recovery—much like the cryptosphere itself. Now fully community-owned and managed, Neiro prioritises collaboration and charitable giving. The team has already donated to the shelter that once cared for her and has plans for more initiatives in the future. Today, it’s trading at $0.0019, showing strong market momentum with exciting potential ahead. With its unique story, charitable impact, and growing presence, Neiro is emerging as one of the best meme coins for massive return potential. Non-Playable Coin: A Meme Revolution in the Making With its name derived from one of the most iconic gaming references—those quirky NPCs that always seem to be stuck on repeat—Non-Playable Coin has successfully carved out a unique niche in the meme market. And while it may seem playful or even a bit offbeat at first glance, this token is backed by an ambitious roadmap, creative investor interest, and a strong community vibe that could lead to remarkable returns. The market has a funny way of rewarding meme coins that tap into pop culture nostalgia and storytelling. Non-Playable Coin does this brilliantly. Predictions are already pointing toward Non-Playable Coin’s potential for explosive price gains as more people tune into its charm and vision. It’s worth $0.03623 today and is estimated to rise to a range of $0.036903 to $0.174123 in 2025. So, whether you’re gaming-obsessed, meme-savvy, or just love the idea of participating in niche internet trends with investment potential, NPC could become one of the most exciting opportunities in your portfolio. Why These Tokens Matter Right Now The crypto market can feel unpredictable at times, much like a high-stakes cricket match where momentum swings with every ball. That said, tokens like BTFD Coin, Neiro, and Non-Playable Coin are proving they can not only adapt but thrive in a volatile market. These tokens have the community backing, market trends, and features to ensure they are more than just a passing fad. Whether you’re drawn to BTFD Coin’s presale success and potential price hike, Neiro’s strong utility-driven vision, or Non-Playable Coin’s meme-friendly community, each coin offers something unique. Investors who act quickly could position themselves to make significant returns as these tokens climb further up the market ladder. The Final Play: Your Next Step If you’ve been on the sidelines wondering which tokens to explore, the market isn’t going to wait.

The campaigns are led from two ends, with CEDAR Innovation Foundation leading an online onslaught in social media, while Blockchain Association and DeFi Education Fund are writing to the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Through X, Crenshaw is accused of being anti-crypto more than the outgoing chair of the commission, Gary Gensler. The advocacy group launched a new five-figure digital ad campaign that will be shared across all social media platforms in Washington, DC. The ad addresses lawmakers, urging them to reject Democratic commissioner Crenshaw’s renomination to the SEC. The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to vote on Crenshow’s renomination on Wednesday morning. If the House confirms her, Crenshaw will serve on the commission until June 2029, which advocates feel will undermine cryptocurrency as a whole. Blockchain Association and DeFi Educational Fund write to the committee As the campaign against Crenshaw is picking momentum in social media, the Blockchain Association and DeFi Education Fund have written a letter to the Senate to do their representation duty by voting against Crenshaw’s renomination. The letter details several justifications as to why Crenshaw is not fit to hold a seat on the SEC. The group feels like Crenshaw can not uphold the rule of law. They cited a case where she has operated with impunity while overlooking the court’s position. Crenshaw blatantly refused to approve spot Bitcoin ETP despite the DC Circuit Courts confirming that there is no justifiable reason for them to reject it. According to the advocacy groups, Crenshaw’s character doesn’t embody the SEC’s merit-neutral mission or the needs of American investors—including the one-fifth of Americans who own digital assets. America’s incoming administration is taking an interest in crypto The Senate is urged to reject her and the failed policies of the past instead of approving the nomination, which will have extreme consequences for crypto lovers. President-elect Donald Trump appears interested in digital assets and has committed to forming a special crypto reserve. Trump said that America must start warming towards crypto, or it will be left behind. He highlights how other countries are leveraging crypto for their growth. He pointed to the United Arab Emirates as a valid example of a nation that has embraced crypto and has made progressive policies in the sector.

It is worth noting that its price rally has been accompanied by a significant spike in its funding rates, a critical metric reflecting sentiment in the futures market. The metric, analyzed by CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC, has reached levels not seen since January 2024. This surge in funding rates suggests a growing optimism among traders, with many anticipating the possibility of Ethereum reaching new all-time highs. Related Reading: Large Ethereum Transactions Grow As ETH Breaks Yearly Highs But Is A Correction On The Horizon? Despite this enthusiasm, the market’s current state raises questions about sustainability. Historically, such spikes in funding rates have often preceded short-term corrections, stabilizing the market. According to Shayan, the current situation mirrors January 2024, when Ethereum saw an 88% rally following similar market conditions. The analyst suggests that while the current rally may pave the way for further gains, a pullback could be essential for healthier long-term growth. Funding rates serve as a barometer for market sentiment, particularly in the futures market. A positive funding rate indicates a preference for long positions, with traders expecting higher prices. Ethereum Funding Rates Hit Multi-Month High “Funding rates are at levels last seen in January 2024, when Ethereum rallied by 88%. This reflects increased long-position interest as optimism grows. Similar to January, this sharp increase suggests the likelihood of a pullback.” –… pic.twitter.com/euKGhIqNKO — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 9, 2024 As Ethereum’s funding rates hit multi-month highs, this trend signals a surge in bullish sentiment. However, history shows such sharp increases can create short-term market imbalances, leading to corrections. Shayan noted: While Ethereum’s rally is underpinned by bullish sentiment, the spike in funding rates signals the need for a short-term correction, paving the way for healthier and more sustainable price growth. Ethereum Market Performance Ethereum remains below the $4,000 mark after falling below this level last week. Currently, ETH is trading at $3,819, reflecting a 4.9% decline in the past 24 hours. Despite the recent drop, the asset has gained nearly 30% over the past month. However, ETH’s latest dip further distances it from its all-time high of $4,878 in 2021, leaving it 20.5% below that peak.

In a new interview with Real Vision’s Raoul Pal, Tapiero says that he thinks US-based decentralized finance (DeFi) could explode in size after previously being pushed outside the country due to hostile regulators. Tapiero, the founder of multiple venture capital firms in the space, says that institutions are on the edge of discovering just how small the DeFi world is compared to the rest of the financial markets. “So if I’m looking out over the next two years, the thing that I think could really take off is US-based DeFi. So DeFi two years ago basically got pushed outside of the US. And so, the first step for everybody is through a centralized exchange, they come on their Kraken, or Gemini, Coinbase, and they buy their Bitcoin. But now, especially Coinbase, Kraken too, they’ve made it easy to port over into DeFi, not everyone is going to buy a Ledger and go through Ledger Live or MetaMask. But I do think that once these institutional guys, they’re going to own their Bitcoin through the ETF, they’re going to own their Ethereum. They’re then going to start to understand as they focus on it that it’s really the decentralized financial world that has the ability to grow. I mean TVL (total value locked) in DeFi is I think $100 billion, which is very small. The total value in the space today if I add up all the cryptocurrency and all the equities is around $4 trillion. So of that $4 trillion sitting there, only really 2% of it is actually active in DeFi. And I think that’s going to change.” TVL is a metric representing the amount of assets staked or locked in a platform. At time of writing, DeFi TVL stands at $136.232 billion.

Anton Tkachev, a deputy from the “New People” party in the State Duma, submitted an official appeal to Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, urging the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve similar to traditional state reserves that hold foreign currencies such as the US dollar and euro. Bitcoin as an Alternative Reserve Asset In his letter, Russian lawmaker Anton Tkachev highlighted the limitations of traditional foreign exchange reserves, which are vulnerable to volatility, inflation, and sanctions. These challenges, he argues, pose a risk to Russia’s financial stability. He proposed Bitcoin as an alternative reserve asset, noting that digital currencies are not subject to the controls or financial systems of individual countries. This makes them more resilient in the face of geopolitical tensions. This move precedes an enonomist Peter Schiff motion projection that the Biden admin should sell all US government’s Bitcoin holdings. “With limited access to international payment systems for countries under sanctions, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could become essential tools for global trade,” Tkachev wrote. He emphasized that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature makes it an ideal asset for Russia to store its reserves, enabling it to bypass traditional financial systems and avoid sanctions. Russian Lawmaker Stance On BTC’s Growing Investment Appeal Tkachev also pointed out Bitcoin’s strong investment performance in recent years, noting that the cryptocurrency reached a value of $100,000 in December 2024. He argued that Bitcoin’s high returns make it not only a stable store of value but also an opportunity for significant financial gain. Given this growth, Tkachev suggested that Russia could benefit from holding Bitcoin in its reserves, similar to the way nations hold gold or foreign currency reserves. In line with this, companies like MicroStrategy, have already adopted Bitcoin as part of their investment strategy. MicroStrategy has been consistently purchasing Bitcoin, most recently acquiring 21,550 BTC for $2.1 billion in December. This brings its total holdings to over 423,000 BTC, further cementing the company’s commitment to Bitcoin as a long-term investment. Similarly, Hut 8, a Bitcoin mining company, announced plans to raise $500 million through stock sales, with a portion of the proceeds earmarked for additional Bitcoin purchases. Russia’s Cryptocurrency Strategy and International Trends Russian lawmaker Anton Tkachev’s proposal aligns with Russia’s broader strategy to develop alternatives to traditional financial systems. The Central Bank of Russia is already preparing to launch an experiment to use cryptocurrencies in cross-border payments, aiming to facilitate international trade while bypassing Western sanctions. This initiative is part of a global trend where countries are exploring the potential of digital currencies to maintain economic stability. Russia’s interest in Bitcoin as a reserve asset is also in line with broader international developments. In the United States, Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced the “Bitcoin Act of 2024,” which proposes the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve to strengthen the U.S. dollar and increase the country’s influence in the global cryptocurrency market. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has also voiced support for a Bitcoin reserve, with some of his campaign promises including the idea of holding a strategic reserve of Bitcoin to further the U.S. economy’s resilience in the digital age. While Russia’s proposal is still in the early stages, it reflects a growing trend among countries to explore Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has speculated that countries like China could eventually create their own Bitcoin reserves, especially as global economic pressures continue to rise. He noted that smaller nations might be the first to adopt such a strategy, but larger economies could eventually follow suit.

Anton Tkachev, Duma state deputy of Russia , has urged the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve in the country after the Russian economy and business were sanctioned by the U.S. In his proposal, Tkachev mentioned that Bitcoin ( BTC ) should be treated in the reserves as any other traditional currency as well due to the borderless system of blockchain. “I ask you to assess the feasibility of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve in Russia by analogy with state reserves in traditional currencies. If this initiative is approved, I ask you to submit it to the government of the federation for further implementation,” The deputy stated, on RIA Novosti local news platform This reserve will not only serve as a currency but also contribute as an alternative instrument for storing the value of money. Yet traditional currencies are also threatened by inflation and sanctions, but Bitcoin is not. He also noted that the central bank has been preparing for the launch of a cross-border payment settlement for cryptocurrency , which indicates that the reserve is also possible.

On December 10, 2024, PEPE is outperforming major cryptocurrencies and defying the market trend with its impressive performance. PEPE Current Price Momentum PEPE is trading near $0.00002725 at press time, having recorded a price gain of over 3.50% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume increased by 16%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. However, this modest price surge comes during a period when the majority of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL), are struggling to gain momentum. PEPE Technical Analysis With this recent price surge, PEPE has reached a crucial level of $0.00002750, which currently represents a make-or-break situation for the meme coin. According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, if PEPE closes a four-hour candle above $0.00002750, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 30% to reach $0.000036 in the coming days.

Table of Contents XRP attempts $3 but faces resistance PropiChain: A formidable XRP rival Why PropiChain’s presale is creating FOMO Conclusion The XRP price came close to the $3 milestone, reigniting interest in Ripple’s technology. However, the token has seen volatile price swings since then, sparking speculation of a potential crash. Amidst this uncertainty, traders are turning their attention to an emerging Ripple rival, PropiChain , which is predicted to have a 32,039% rally. XRP attempts $3 but faces resistance XRP is known for its ability to facilitate instant and cheap international transactions, with financial institutions around the globe widely adopting it. This widespread adoption was a major factor in the recent XRP price surge. Ripple’s recent legal victories against the SEC also fueled the fast rise of the XRP price. Investors were hopeful that XRP’s momentum would continue, driven by Ripple’s ongoing partnerships and developments in the financial technology sector. However, XRP price’s rise has not come without challenges, as it has suffered a decline again. The drop has raised concerns, with market analysts pointing out that such rapid price increases often precede sharp declines as the market adjusts to correct overinflated values. As such, many traders are on edge, worried about a further XRP price crash and looking for ways to secure their investments.

Metaverse integration: PropiChain will enable virtual property tours and global networking opportunities through its metaverse platform, connecting stakeholders worldwide. Why PropiChain’s presale is creating FOMO PropiChain’s presale has emerged as a hotspot for investors seeking high returns.

Target price by 2025: $2+ (a 32,039% rally). For investors who missed out on XRP price’s early gains, PropiChain presents a second chance. PropiChain’s credibility is enhanced by its BlockAudit security audit, which ensures the platform’s robustness. Its listing on CoinMarketCap has also provided greater visibility, attracting retail and institutional investors.

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crying Kamala on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crying Kamala by entering its contract address – 5eCJhSGBUN4YwJHLU9ZcWjrjmoufVznjzNBHfo4TN1P7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRYKAMA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-10 02:00:04

During a recent interview, Peirce identified three major priorities she believes will provide much-needed clarity and foster growth in the crypto industry. Hester Peirce Unveils SEC’s Crypto Agenda for Reform Under Donald Trump According to a Fox Business interview , Hester Peirce made it clear that the SEC’s regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies must evolve under Donald Trump’s leadership. One of her primary points was to halt what she referred to as the “regulatory suppression” of the crypto industry. She argued that the SEC should cease restricting crypto’s access to necessary services, such as custody, which are vital for the sector’s growth. Peirce stressed that such services are essential for crypto businesses to function properly and continue their expansion. Her call for ending the blockages on custody and other services aligns with a broader vision of enabling the crypto market. Moreover, most recently, David Sacks, the incoming Crypto Czar, addressed the growing concerns around Operation Chokepoint 2.0. His comments followed an account from Chris Lane, the former CTO of Silvergate Bank, who claimed that regulators, rather than the collapse of FTX, led to the bank’s downfall. Lane described how regulatory actions severely limited Silvergate’s ability to hold deposits from digital asset clients, ultimately forcing the bank to shut down. Consequently, Sacks suggested that these allegations warrant further investigation, signaling a possible probe into Operation Chokepoint 2.0. Providing Clarity on SEC Jurisdiction Another central issue raised by Hester Peirce was the need for clearer guidance on what falls within the SEC’s jurisdiction. She highlighted the importance of providing clarity on which activities and assets the SEC should regulate. Peirce explained that clear delineations are needed to identify what qualifies as a security and what does not. Peirce argued that clear definitions will help crypto businesses better understand their obligations. This clarity will allow them to navigate crypto regulations more effectively, reducing the risk of legal errors. In addition, Hester Peirce also stressed the need for collaboration between the SEC and crypto industry stakeholders. She proposed that the SEC work directly with the industry to figure out how existing rules apply and where adjustments should be made. Peirce suggested that this collaboration should be a public, open process, where all parties involved can participate. Coincidentally, these remarks come as Coinbase exposed FDIC “pause letters” obtained through a FOIA request. The letters show the agency’s role in restricting banking services to crypto businesses in 2022. According to the documents, FDIC instructed banks to pause crypto-related activities for further review. Coinbase’s CLO, Paul Grewal, emphasized that these letters confirm the existence of coordinated efforts to limit crypto banking access.

With so many options available, it’s easy to get lost in the noise. However, some projects stand out for their potential, unique features, and real-world utility. Among these, one platform quickly gains attention for its innovation and the excitement surrounding its presale: Qubetics ($TICS). But before diving into its thrilling presale details, let’s take a quick look at the recent developments of other notable coins in the market. Binance has made waves with its listing of Across Protocol (ACX) and Orca (ORCA), pushing these tokens into the spotlight. Meanwhile, Quant continues to maintain a strong presence in the market, providing blockchain interoperability with impressive performance. This article will explore why Qubetics is not just another altcoin but one of the best altcoins to invest in now, alongside these other rising stars. Qubetics: The Future of Blockchain Development is Here Qubetics is not just another blockchain platform. It’s a game-changer, offering tools and features that make blockchain development accessible to all. One of the standout features of Qubetics is the QubeQode IDE , which provides a visual development environment that makes blockchain app creation simpler than ever. With drag-and-drop components, users can seamlessly integrate pre-built functionalities such as user authentication and token management. This eliminates the need for complicated coding, allowing developers to focus on innovation rather than the technicalities of blockchain creation. Add the form-based configuration options to this, and you have a user-friendly way to define application logic and smart contract parameters. For those who need more advanced tools, Qubetics provides a code snippet library packed with pre-written code to speed up the development process for common blockchain tasks. But Qubetics isn’t stopping there. The platform also leverages AI-driven development to enhance the experience further. AI-powered smart contract generation ensures developers can create secure and efficient contracts based on their needs. At the same time, code completion and error detection functionalities make the development process faster and more reliable. AI also suggests optimisations, ensuring that applications are as efficient and secure as possible. Recently, Qubetics launched an AMA session to give its community deeper insights into the platform’s capabilities. For anyone curious to learn more, this session is a must-watch. With such cutting-edge features and a community-driven approach, Qubetics is undoubtedly one of the best altcoins to invest in now. Binance Boosts ACX and ORCA: Big Gains and Big Risks In the world of crypto, listings on major exchanges can send a coin’s price soaring, and that’s exactly what happened when Binance added Across Protocol (ACX) and Orca (ORCA) to its platform. Following the announcement, ACX surged by an impressive 131%, while ORCA rose over 90% in just 24 hours. This strong performance has caught the attention of many, but Binance’s decision to tag these tokens with a “Seed Tag” signals the high volatility and risks involved. Users must take a risk-awareness quiz every 90 days to continue trading these tokens, adding an extra layer of caution for potential investors. With both tokens already gaining traction, it’s clear that they have become one of the best altcoins to invest in now for those prepared to manage the risks. Quant: Leading the Charge in Blockchain Interoperability While other projects rise and fall, Quant remains a stalwart in the crypto market. Known for its ability to enable seamless interoperability between different blockchain networks, Quant is consistently regarded as one of the most promising projects in the space. Quant offers immense long-term value by solving a critical problem in blockchain technology—connecting different networks.

Stellar (XLM) is on the verge of a breakout, with analysts setting sights on a potential rally to $0.90. Meanwhile, Monero (XMR) holds its ground as the undisputed king of privacy coins. But here’s the twist: a new contender, Qubetics ($TICS) , is shaking up the game with a mind-blowing presale, surpassing $5.3 million in investments. With analysts forecasting jaw-dropping ROI figures, everyone’s buzzing about whether this could be the next big thing. So, what’s the fuss about Qubetics? This isn’t just another flashy token with big promises and no backbone. It’s diving deep into real-world asset tokenisation, a fancy way of saying it’s bridging the gap between your tangible assets and the blockchain. But more on that later. For now, let’s explore why these three coins might just be the best coins to join for short-term gains and beyond. Qubetics ($TICS): The Real-World Asset Tokenisation Revolution If you’ve ever wished for a simpler, more accessible way to manage your assets, Qubetics has entered the chat. This blockchain powerhouse focuses on real-world asset tokenisation (RWAT) . What’s that? Think about transforming physical assets—like property, fine art, or even wine—into digital tokens that can be easily bought, sold, or traded. It’s not just futuristic; it’s here and shaking up how we think about ownership. Imagine this: You own a vintage car, a piece of land, or even a rare baseball card. Traditionally, selling or even leveraging those assets would involve tedious paperwork and loads of middlemen. Enter Qubetics. Their platform lets you tokenise these assets, breaking them into fractionalised ownership. That means you could sell just a piece of your property instead of the whole thing—unlocking liquidity without giving up full control. Businesses are already catching on. Real-estate developers could tokenise luxury apartments, allowing investors from across the globe to own shares. Small businesses could tokenise equipment or intellectual property, turning their assets into accessible investment opportunities. Heck, even local art galleries could tokenise their collections, opening doors for everyday investors to own a Picasso—well, part of one. Click here to watch how real estate investors can get the best out of their investments using Qubetics. But the real kicker? Qubetics’ presale is taking off like a SpaceX rocket. With over 300 million tokens sold to 8,000 holders, the project has already raised a staggering $5.3 million. And the current price of $TICS at $0.0311 is about to jump by 10% when Stage 13 kicks in this weekend. Analysts are predicting a meteoric rise—$0.25 by presale’s end, $1 shortly after, and a mind-bending $15 post-mainnet launch. If you’re looking for the best coins to join for short term, $TICS might just be the golden ticket. Stellar (XLM): Ready for Liftoff at $0.90 Stellar is no stranger to the limelight, and for good reason. This blockchain project has been making waves in financial circles, providing fast and affordable cross-border payments. Stellar’s mission? To connect people and financial institutions seamlessly, especially in regions where traditional banking falls short. Now, with two bullish patterns lighting up its charts, analysts are eyeing $0.90 as the next big target. Let’s paint a picture: In the past month, XLM saw a 300% price surge, outperforming many top-tier cryptos. Sure, it cooled off with a 3% dip last week, but that’s not unusual after such a meteoric rise. What’s interesting is how traders are treating the dip as a buying opportunity, with volumes spiking. These signals suggest Stellar’s bulls are far from done. Technical indicators are backing the hype, too. A symmetrical triangle pattern suggests consolidation, while a falling wedge on the RSI points to a potential breakout. If XLM can push past its $0.56 resistance level, it’s off to the races. The target? $0.90—and possibly higher if market momentum aligns. For short-term traders, Stellar’s blend of strong fundamentals and promising technicals makes it a no-brainer. But even long-term holders can smile; Stellar’s role in financial inclusion keeps it relevant. Whether you’re in Buenos Aires or Bogotá, Stellar’s fast, cost-effective remittance capabilities resonate with folks tired of paying exorbitant fees to send money home. Monero (XMR): Privacy First, Always In a world where every click, swipe, and purchase is tracked, Monero is like that friend who says, “Relax, I’ve got your back.” Known as the ultimate privacy coin, Monero enables completely anonymous transactions. For anyone worried about nosy governments, creepy corporations, or plain-old hackers, XMR is the go-to. But Monero isn’t just a tinfoil hat for crypto enthusiasts. It’s practical, too. Think about e-commerce platforms that cater to a global audience. By accepting Monero, they offer customers a level of privacy no credit card or bank transfer ever could. For freelancers in countries with restrictive banking systems, Monero provides financial freedom and security. Monero’s resilience is worth a shout-out. Despite facing regulatory heat—sometimes praised, sometimes vilified—it remains a top pick for privacy-focused investors. Its development community is no slouch either, rolling out regular updates to keep Monero ahead of the curve. Whether you’re hodling or using it for everyday transactions, XMR is a solid choice for anyone prioritising discretion. Now, is it the best coin to join for short-term gains? Maybe not for quick flips. But its steady growth and loyal community make it a strong contender for those playing the long game. After all, in a world obsessed with data collection, privacy is priceless. Conclusion: The Clock’s Ticking—Make Your Move So, there you have it. Qubetics is making headlines with real-world asset tokenisation and a presale that’s smashing records. Stellar is flirting with $0.90, and Monero continues to champion privacy in a digital world. Whether you’re chasing short-term gains or long-term growth, these three projects are worth your attention. Here’s the deal: If you’re serious about making moves, don’t wait too long. The Qubetics presale is a ticking clock, with prices set to rise by 10% this weekend. Stellar’s breakout could happen at any moment, and Monero? It’s the steady rock every diversified portfolio needs. So, what’s it going to be? Dive in, grab some $TICS, and ride the wave—or watch from the sidelines as others cash in. The choice is yours. Don’t let FOMO be the story of your crypto journey.

Here’s What Analysts Say,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-finally-set-for-a-new-all-time-high-heres-what-analysts-say/,"Ethereum (ETH) continues to hover around the critical $4,000 resistance level, a price point many believe could determine the cryptocurrency’s next major move. However, a strong weekly close has sparked optimism among analysts, suggesting that ETH could be on track to reach a new all-time high (ATH) soon. Ethereum Heading To New ATH? Experts Weigh In While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP have experienced explosive growth this year, ETH’s price momentum has been relatively subdued. According to CoinGecko, Ethereum has recorded gains of 62% over the past year, falling short compared to other trending digital assets. Related Reading: Analyst Confirms Ethereum Golden Cross As ETH Surges Past $4,000 – Is Altseason In Sight? However, ETH’s performance relative to other cryptocurrencies has not deterred ETH bulls from aiming for new ATHs for the cryptocurrency. For instance, seasoned crypto analyst Pentoshi recently took to X to explain the significance of ETH’s “structural changes” and the consistently large inflows attracted by spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Pentoshi noted that Ethereum has not only recorded a higher high on the weekly chart, but also had its highest weekly close of the year. The analyst added that, given its current price of slightly below $4,000, there is not much resistance to ATH, which “should act as a magnet” for further gains. Another crypto analyst, @CryptoPoseidonn highlighted that ETH is set to break out of its “4-year, 1,460-day range to the upside.” In a chart, the analyst marked out the different Fibonacci extension levels to identify potential price targets for ETH. According to the chart, ETH can rise to $6,000 at the 1.272 extension level, $7,400 at the 1.618 extension level, and $11,400 at the 2.618 extension level. ETH can rise “much higher, far beyond your worst nightmares,” the analyst added. In a shorter time frame, Satoshi Flipper, another well-known analyst, emphasized that ETH attempts to break through an ascending channel in the 4-hour chart. He suggested that the current price, sitting on diagonal channel support, might present a “nice entry” point, predicting that the next impulsive move could take ETH to $4,400. ETH Bulls Cautiously Optimistic Although there is high anticipation for a new ETH ATH, some experts opine that there may still be a few hurdles before the digital asset records a new ATH price. For instance, ETH crossing the $4,000 level may lead to increased risks of profit-taking, potentially resulting in a short-term correction. Related Reading: Ethereum Risk-Reward Ratio Is Now Attractive, Brokerage Firm Explains However, Ethereum’s fundamentals remain robust, adding to its bullish outlook. For instance, ETH active addresses and large value transactions have shown an uptick, reflecting increased on-chain activity during the recent rally. Additionally, some analysts believe ETH could follow a trajectory similar to Bitcoin’s 2021 bull run, with the potential to reach $10,000. ETH trades at $3,847 at press time, down 3.9% in the past 24 hours.

Trump’s Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tesla on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tesla by entering its contract address – 8T1qq1DxSqWqoR8J9hi3ULGCCoMJdqQBev4WAvJg9awR – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMTESLA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-10 02:43:00

The firm dumped these substantial tokens on Binance, Coinbase, OKX, and Robinhood. Additionally, the sell-off began shortly after UNI’s price dropped by 10%.

UNI was expected to retest this level, but the price decline has brought it here sooner than anticipated.

They’ve morphed from joke tokens to serious investment opportunities, with wild stories of gains capturing the imaginations of investors worldwide. Ponke (PONKE) and Act I: The AI Prophecy (ACT) are two meme coins making waves recently, each with its own unique quirks and community-driven appeal. But the real head-turner is BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a meme coin that’s rewriting the playbook with its explosive presale, community focus, and built-in earning opportunities. Launching its presale on November 26, 2024, BTFD Coin has already raised over $2.6 million. With its catchy mantra, “Buy The F***ing Dip,” this project appeals to every savvy investor who knows the value of seizing opportunities during market dips. And with its price set to jump from $0.0001 during the current presale stage to $0.0006 by the end of its 16 stages, BTFD Coin could very well become the best meme coin to invest in this week. So, what makes it so special, and how does it stack up against Ponke and ACT? Let’s dive in. BTFD Coin (BTFD): A Dip Worth Buying Into BTFD Coin is flipping the script on meme coins with its presale that’s already raising eyebrows. Currently, in its 10th stage, investors can scoop up BTFD for just $0.0001 per coin. With over 44 billion coins sold and 3,900 holders, the project has garnered serious momentum. What’s driving this interest? The promise of hefty returns, for starters. A $1,800 investment at the current price buys 18 million BTFD coins. By the end of the presale, when the coin hits $0.0006, that same investment could balloon to $10,800. Not bad for a few weeks’ wait, eh? BTFD is built on Ethereum, ensuring security and scalability, and comes loaded with features like staking rewards with an average APY of 90% and a P2E game launching soon. It’s designed to thrive in both bear and bull markets, positioning itself as a must-have in any investor’s portfolio. Plus, its community-driven ethos, backed by the “ Bulls Squad ,” offers a sense of camaraderie and purpose often missing in other meme projects. Ponke (PONKE): Embracing Chaos and Winning Hearts If there’s a meme coin that thrives on unpredictability, it’s Ponke. Trading at $0.5445, PONKE has captured the imaginations of high-risk, high-reward enthusiasts. Known for its wild marketing campaigns and its community-driven model, Ponke offers a unique spin on the meme coin phenomenon. With a circulating supply of 555 million tokens and a trading volume that’s been on the rise, it’s clear Ponke knows how to stay relevant. What makes Ponke stand out is its embrace of chaos. Its marketing strategy is as eccentric as it is effective, drawing in a crowd that loves to roll the dice. For investors who crave an adrenaline rush, Ponke delivers in spades. While it might not have the same polished appeal as BTFD, it’s a testament to how meme coins can carve out niches in unexpected ways. Act I: The AI Prophecy (ACT): Riding the AI Wave ACT is the meme coin for the AI generation. Following a meteoric rise of 1,700% in November 2024, it’s now trading at $0.5948. Its listing on major exchanges like Binance and Crypto.com has brought it into the spotlight, and analysts like Altcoin Sherpa have praised its market resilience. But with a current trading volume of $213.7 million, ACT isn’t just coasting on past glories. It’s actively engaging investors with a vision that fuses AI themes with meme culture. That said, ACT’s journey hasn’t been without hiccups. Concerns about liquidity and large sell orders have kept some investors cautious. Still, for those willing to navigate the volatility, ACT offers the kind of thrill that meme coin investors often seek. Why BTFD Coin is the Best Meme Coin to Invest in This Week Based on current trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the most promising opportunity. Its presale performance, innovative features, and strong community focus make it a clear leader in the meme coin space. Investing $1,800 now could yield $10,800 by the presale’s end—a potential 6x return. Add in the staking rewards and the upcoming P2E game, and BTFD is more than just a meme—it’s a movement. While Ponke and ACT have their own merits, they lack the strategic presale structure and comprehensive ecosystem that BTFD offers. This makes BTFD not just the best meme coin to invest in this week, but potentially one of the best investments in the meme coin sector overall. Conclusion The meme coin world is buzzing, and BTFD Coin is leading the meme market with its record-breaking presale. Ponke and ACT offer intriguing options for investors seeking variety, but if you’re looking for a coin that combines humour, utility, and profit potential, BTFD is your best bet. With over $2.6 million raised, 44 billion coins sold, and its price set to soar, there’s no better time to join the movement. Don’t miss out on what could be the best meme coin to invest in this week. Head over to the BTFD presale now and secure your stake before the price climbs. It’s time to Buy The F***ing Dip and ride the bull run to success!

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-10 03:26:00

Interestingly, this is the fifth consecutive Monday that the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based corporation has announced major acquisitions of the market’s leading crypto, demonstrating confidence in BTC’s prospects and price appreciation. Microstrategy’s Bitcoin Stash Surpasses Nvidia According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), MicroStrategy purchased 21,550 Bitcoin tokens between December 2 and December 8 for an average price of $98,783 per token. Over the last four years, Saylor and his firm have amassed Bitcoin worth more than $41 billion, a move he undertook to shift the software company’s survival strategy. Saylor said in October that it would fund $42 billion over three years through a combination of at-the-market stock sales and convertible debt offers, bolstering the firm’s BTC acquisition strategy. The rate at which MicroStrategy is accumulating Bitcoin has accelerated substantially in the month since Donald Trump’s election on November 5; it took nearly a year to amass its first 100,000 coins, but just two weeks to grow its holdings from 300,000 to 400,000. This vast Bitcoin stash is now worth more than the cash reserves of computer behemoth Nvidia Corp., as well as nearly all non-financial corporations listed on the S&P 500 Index. Liquidity And Credit Concerns Despite BTC’s bullish outlook, researchers believe MicroStrategy’s method is not risk-free. In four of the last five weeks, the firm has purchased Bitcoin at an average price higher than the average market price , raising questions about the approach’s long-term viability. The company’s stock, MSTR, has increased by more than 500% this year, generating significant interest from investors, while hedge funds have begun to acquire its notes for market-neutral arbitrage methods, capitalizing on Bitcoin’s volatility. However, analysts warn that continued dependence on Bitcoin could be risky. Min Jung, a research analyst at Presto Research, pointed out that while BTC’s rising prices create a positive feedback loop—in which higher stock prices permit more fundraising for further Bitcoin purchases—this cycle is strongly dependent on the crypto’s rise. “If the market turns, the consequences could be severe,” Jung told Bloomberg. A significant drop in Bitcoin’s market value could imperil the company’s financial viability, raising liquidity and credit concerns. Outside of its major enterprise analytics software market, the company’s income creation opportunities would be restricted. Gracy Chen, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, expressed these fears, noting that a drop in Bitcoin prices might jeopardize MicroStrategy’s ability to manage its rising debt levels . “The firm’s massive BTC holdings pose a market concentration risk,” Chen explained. “A large-scale sell-off could lead to significant price fluctuations, affecting not just Bitcoin but the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem.” At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $97,700, down 3% in the last 24 hours.

The price is slightly trading above the $2 level at the time of writing. XRP has tested a key breakout point and the 2021 high, and this retest has resulted in a strong rebound. However, the price has not yet surpassed any previous highs, indicating that further movement is needed to establish an upward trend. The current market structure suggests that XRP may still be in the fourth wave of a larger correction. After a three-wave decline in wave A, followed by a three-wave rise in wave B, XRP is now experiencing the C-wave decline. Despite the rebound, the price has not surpassed previous highs, which means further movement is needed for confirmation of an upward trend. Potential for More Downside Despite the rebound, it is still possible, even likely, that we could see one more low. There is no confirmation yet that the low has been established. During liquidity events, such as those we’ve been seeing recently, rapid price movements make it difficult to pinpoint the micro-structure of the waves. While another dip cannot be ruled out, it’s important to note that the price has already hit the 100% extension of the A-wave, which is a common target for a C-wave. Next Support Levels If the price continues to move downward, the next support levels to watch are around $1.85, where we see an overlap of two key support zones, followed by $1.78 and $1.66. The market is still following the forecasted path, and it’s crucial to monitor how the broader crypto market, including Bitcoin, behaves, as this could impact XRP’s next move.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-10 03:48:49

Although it’s a breakthrough in the computer revolution, what about Bitcoin’s future? Google CEO Sundar Pichai revealed Willow as the company’s first quantum computing chip. This invention has brought a new journey for useful quantum computers for practical applications. “Introducing Willow, our new state-of-the-art quantum computing chip with a breakthrough that can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more qubits, cracking a 30-year challenge in the field,” Pichai stated in his X’s post on Dec. 10 Willow, in the benchmark test, could solve a standard computation in under 5 minutes, which is estimated to take 10^25 years or equal to 10,000 quadrillion centuries to solve for a classical supercomputer. This new revolutionary quantum computing processor could reduce errors progressively with super-fast gates to achieve low error rates, reconfigurability, and high connectivity algorithms. Google Quantum AI hardware director Julian Kelly says any qubits with uncharacteristically high errors could be solved by “reconfiguring them to the line” and using tunability to develop new calibration strategies. Through this advanced computer development, are Bitcoin and the rest of cryptocurrencies threatened?

However, to crack the Bitcoin ( BTC ) blockchain, a quantum computing chip needs 200 million to 400 million qubits at maximum. Bitcoin’s protocol also needs to allow the post-quantum algorithms to be integrated to threaten the coin itself.

The overall crypto market cap has dropped by 5.44% reaching $3.43 trillion in the last 24 hours. Historical level of liquidations was witnessed specifically in the last 12 hours. But why is this happening when everyone is so positive about the market and how far Bitcoin can fall? Are you wondering why bitcoin is going down today? Let’s analyse what is happening with the market. High Greed Brings High Risk If you have been in the crypto space for a while and have seen at least one crypto cycle you would have seen such things happening before. When the market goes into a sentiment of high greed for many days and people get comfortable with the bull market, it retraces. It is always traders vs. the market and who has more power? Obviously the market. The seasoned professionals always suggest people to be scared when the market is greedy. Such times are the perfect time for the market to take money from traders. Technical Side of Bitcoin After facing rejection from the new ATH, Bitcoin had taken a downturn of about 13.60%. Though it did not close there and it came out only to be a shadow. The asset held itself and tried to rise again however failed to do so. BTC kept on riding the Moving average 20 for quite some time before falling below it on December 9 which triggered a panic in the market. Following this, Bitcoin fell under the Moving average 50 and then 100. This is enough shock for the market. BTC is currently trading at $96,607, a 2.90% drop in the last 24 hours. The trading volume pumped by 118% as traders started shorting the asset. How down can it go? Well that would be very difficult to say however, the nearest strong zone lies at $92,600 and moving average 200 is also holding this spot, making it more strong. The RSI levels are falling sharp. It is currently at 38.08 which is not good for bulls but definitely a comfortable time for short traders. The average direction index at 16.44 also shows bears are holding the market. Other Metrics According to the liquidation data by Coinglass, a total of $1.75 billion worth of liquidations happened in the last 24 hours. Most of these liquidations are the long traders as the market changed its position following bitcoin’s downward movement. Over half a million traders lost their funds to these liquidations. The whale orders and large trade data from coinglass shows that even though the market shows greed, in reality the long traders are in fear. There are few to none long orders around this price range and whales are shorting BTC. The good amount of longs lie between $92k and $94k. Does this mean the crypto can fall more? Yes, it might, if the market fails to get more strong buys. What to expect? The downturn during a bull market brings in desperate times. The Greed and Fear index shows high greed, the indicators showing an upcoming down movement, makes it all confusing. Be aware that the market tends to move in the opposite direction of a high saturation of emotion. As more and more people will short the asset, Bitcoin will start rising again suddenly. If you are thinking of entering the market to take trades, high precaution is advised in order to save your funds. The high greed sentiment in the market is the reason why bitcoin is going down.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-10 04:44:38

Steingraber highlighted significant inflows into XRP via two charts. In his post on December 7, Steingraber shared a chart marked with real-time data, captioned: “XRP Inflows by the Minute flooding in!” The chart reveals a sharp rise in net inflows triggered by a massive price increase. XRP Inflows by the Minute flooding in! pic.twitter.com/t1sOZvJLHg — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) December 7, 2024 Steingraber’s chart indicates heightened interest and capital movement into XRP, signaling robust demand for the asset during this period. The analyst followed up with a second post on December 8, presenting a broader perspective on XRP’s net inflows over a longer time frame. This post, captioned “ABSOLUTE CARNAGE about to hit XRP,” underscores the escalating scale of net inflows as the price ascended to $2.59. Steingraber’s chart referenced later data from December 7, showing that the digital asset’s net flow had risen from $878.84 thousand by 10:56 AM to $5.96 million by 9 PM. Steingraber suggests that these inflows could signal further gains for XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Remarkable Performance These observations come at a time when XRP has crossed the $2 mark for the first time since 2018, a notable milestone for the digital asset, with its price recently reaching a multi-year high of $2.86. XRP has recorded a 20% gain in the past week, reflecting growing investor confidence. The asset is now trading at $2.58, and this remarkable performance coincides with a transformative period for the cryptocurrency landscape, particularly for XRP and Ripple. The resignation announcement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, effective January 20, 2025, has created optimism within the crypto community. Gensler’s tenure was marked by regulatory scrutiny, including the ongoing lawsuit against Ripple regarding XRP’s classification as a security. Adding to the positive sentiment, President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins , known for his crypto-friendly stance, to succeed Gensler. Atkins’ potential appointment is viewed as a favorable development for the industry, with many anticipating a resolution to Ripple’s lawsuit and similar regulatory challenges. The massive attention XRP is getting could help it reach much higher targets, and the comments on Steingraber’s post show that the community is excited about the digital asset’s immediate future.

In the video, Long outlined Ripple’s readiness to launch its highly anticipated RLUSD stablecoin and its vision for stablecoins as a transformative payment force. Long highlighted the rapid growth potential of the stablecoin market, which currently holds a market capitalization of about $1 billion but is projected to exceed $3 trillion within a few years. According to Long, this surge will be driven by increasing use cases, particularly in payments. She pointed to Stripe’s acquisition of Bridge as a signal of major payment players integrating stablecoins into their operations, reinforcing the growing demand for digital assets in mainstream financial systems. Ripple’s achievements in this space were also emphasized. “We’ve processed more than $70 billion through digital assets,” Long said, underlining the company’s proven capabilities. Ripple sees stablecoins as central to this evolution and is poised to meet growing market needs with its RLUSD offering. “We have the use case and customers who already want to use stablecoins in payments,” she added. BREAKING NEWS! Ripple President Monica Long drops a bombshell on $RLUSD & $XRP : ""Stablecoins for payments are the next massive trend—and Ripple is READY! We already have the use-case and customers lining up!"" #XRP IS GEARED FOR A LEGENDARY PUMP! pic.twitter.com/LWqjdQW94F — Cheeky Crypto (@CheekyCrypto) December 7, 2024 RLUSD and Ripple’s Vision for Stablecoins The launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin, will be a major step forward for the company. While the stablecoin is “operationally ready” according to Long, regulatory approval is a key factor delaying its rollout. Long noted that Ripple is working with the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to finalize its trust application. Long emphasized the importance of regulatory compliance in ensuring the stablecoin’s success, a sentiment the company recently expressed when providing an update on the stablecoin’s status . The community views RLUSD as a significant addition to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem. Many believe the stablecoin will bolster XRP’s utility, particularly as a bridge asset on the network. Beyond these technical advantages, RLUSD is expected to draw increased attention to Ripple’s blockchain technology and expand its role in global payment solutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Growing Market, Not a Competition Long dismissed the notion of directly challenging market leaders when asked about competition with existing stablecoins. Instead, she expressed confidence in the market’s ability to expand, creating room for new entrants like RLUSD. “I expect the market to really expand,” she said, reinforcing Ripple’s growth-oriented approach rather than a zero-sum competitive strategy. Ripple’s deliberate engagement with regulators reflects its commitment to fostering trust and compliance. This positions the company to take advantage of growing institutional interest in stablecoins, and experts believe RLUSD can significantly benefit XRP’s growth when it launches.

Recently, Baby DogeCoin (BABYDOGE) made waves after a bullish surge triggered by an Elon Musk tweet, and SPX6900 (SPX) has kept traders on their toes with its unpredictable yet exciting market performance. But the real head-turner this week? BTFD Coin (BTFD) , is crushing it with a jaw-dropping presale that’s already raised over $2.6 million! The BTFD Coin presale is now in its 10th stage, selling at just $0.0001 per coin. With over 44 billion tokens sold and 3,900 investors already on board, this is shaping up to be one of the best meme coins to invest in this weekend. BTFD isn’t just about riding the hype—it’s got a robust ecosystem featuring staking rewards, a play-to-earn game, and an ambitious plan to capitalise on the next bull run. Ready to explore why this meme coin could change your portfolio? Let’s dive in! BTFD Coin: $2.6M Presale and a Bullish Future It’s not every day that a meme coin presale raises over $2.6 million in record time, but BTFD Coin has done just that. Since launching on November 26, 2024, this project has captured the hearts (and wallets) of over 3,900 investors. Over 44 billion BTFD tokens have already been snapped up, and at just $0.0001 per token in Stage 10, this is an opportunity that’s hard to ignore. With a planned listing price of $0.0006, early investors could see their investments multiply sixfold. Wondering how this could work for you? Let’s do the maths. Imagine you invest $2,000 at Stage 10 prices of $0.0001 per coin. You’d bag a whopping 20 million BTFD tokens. By the end of the presale, those coins could be worth $12,000. Not bad for a weekend play, exactly? BTFD isn’t just about numbers, though. This project comes packed with features like a play-to-earn game, staking rewards boasting 90% APY, and a community-centric ethos led by the “Bulls Squad.” Built on Ethereum, the project ensures robust scalability, security, and liquidity. So, why wait? BTFD Coin is poised to ride the next bull run, and if you’re serious about capitalising on dips, this one’s a no-brainer. Baby Doge Coin: Social Buzz and Network Expansion Who doesn’t love a good doge? Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) continues to ride the meme wave with its charming branding and strong community. Recent news has kept this coin in the spotlight. Earlier this year, Baby Doge expanded its operations to the Solana network, solidifying its place in the multichain ecosystem. Add to that its impressive burn initiatives to reduce supply, and you’ve got a coin that knows how to keep its fans engaged. But what really got everyone barking was Elon Musk’s cryptic tweet last week, sending BABYDOGE’s price soaring by over 75%. Currently trading at $0.000000002, this little doggie is proving it’s got the bite to match its bark. While Baby Doge doesn’t have the same presale buzz as BTFD Coin, it remains one of the best meme coins to invest in this weekend for its long-term potential. It’s a community favourite for a reason, and if you’ve got a soft spot for canine-inspired cryptos, this one’s worth keeping on your radar. SPX6900: Meme Coin Meets Market Gains If chaotic energy and meme-worthy campaigns are your vibe, SPX6900 (SPX) is your coin. Trading at $0.7321, SPX6900 has seen a solid 7.29% rise over the past week, with a market cap nearing $680 million. What’s fuelling this growth? A combination of exchange listings, community-driven initiatives, and a growing fan base that thrives on unpredictability. October saw SPX6900 achieve an eye-watering 5,204% increase over 30 days—a feat not many coins can claim. However, its wild price swings mean this isn’t a coin for the faint of heart. Analysts note that while SPX6900’s speculative nature is risky, its potential for outsized returns makes it a contender for the best meme coins to invest in this weekend. Don’t Miss The Best Meme Coins to Invest in This Weekend Based on market trends and our analysis, BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands out as the ultimate choice for investors looking to maximise returns. Its presale success, innovative ecosystem, and sixfold price potential make it a top pick. Baby Doge Coin holds strong appeal for those drawn to community-driven projects with a proven track record, while SPX6900 caters to thrill-seekers with its high-risk, high-reward potential. So, what are you waiting for? Join the BTFD Coin presale right now, and don’t miss your chance to ride the next wave of meme coin success. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a curious newcomer, these are the coins you’ll want to watch this weekend. BTFD, BABYDOGE, or SPX6900—who’s got your vote?

Despite the decline in prices, the sentiment remains bullish, with many expecting further growth in the long term. Bitcoin has dipped by more than three percent and is trading close to the $96k level at the time of writing. While the Bitcoin market might be seeing declines, altcoins are also experiencing corrections, and this phase is seen as a crucial part of the market’s long-term cycle. Altcoins like XRP, ADA, DOGE and TRON have recorded double-digit losses and might even dip further. Some market analysts, including prominent figures in the crypto space, have been calling for a 10-20% dip, seeing it as a necessary correction. With the total cryptocurrency market cap recently falling to around $930 billion, many are watching closely to understand if this is the bottom or if further declines are ahead. Analyst Crypto Capital Venture pointed to historical data showing 30% dips in total market cap, including significant drops in altcoins. Such corrections are viewed not as bearish signals, but as opportunities for a stronger bullish run. Looking closely at altcoins, the analyst gave Cardano (ADA) as an example. After breaking a dollar, ADA experienced some volatility , with price drops below $1, but the analyst remains bullish. “These moves are normal,” the analyst explained, pointing to past cycles where ADA experienced dips but later surged back to higher levels. Conclusion: Will the Bullish Trend Survive? Recent developments, including potential U.S. government Bitcoin purchases and discussions around a new crypto tax policy , are fueling optimism for 2025. These factors, combined with historical market patterns, suggest that the bullish trend could continue into the next year, despite current volatility. The analyst said that for long-term holders, these dips are seen as buying opportunities ahead of what could be a significant bull run in the near future.",News,EN,0,0,ADA|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-10 05:20:00

Bitcoin Liquidations Hit $1.5 Billion appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency industry registered heightened volatility in the past 24 hours as Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped more than 6 percent in the past 24 hours to reach a daily range low of about $94,725. The sudden Bitcoin drop heavily impacted the altcoin sector, with the TOTAL2 shedding more than 15 percent, representing over $258 billion. As a result, the total crypto market cap slipped over 7 percent to hover around $3.58 trillion on Tuesday, December 10, during the early Asian session. Nonetheless, a few outlier altcoins registered notable gains in the past 24 hours, led by Baby DogeCoin ($BABYDOGE) and Movement (MOVE). Major Factors that Contributed to Crypto Selloff Today Quantum Bitcoin FUD On Monday, tech giant Google announ ced the launch of Willow, a next-generation quantum chip. According to the company, Willow can perform a benchmark computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years, a figure that exceeds the known age of the universe. While the announcement was huge for the technology sector, it was a huge shakeout for the entire cryptocurrency industry, more so Bitcoin (BTC). Moreover, Bitcoin’s cryptography relies on difficulty adjustment, which is often more than 5 minutes, thus potentially giving Google’s Willow quantum chip a theoretical advantage. Googles new Quantum chip, Willow: – 105 qubits You would need 13 MILLION to 1.9 BILLION qubits to compromise Bitcoin within a practical timeframe TLDR: Bitcoin will be fine for decades — borovik (@3orovik) December 9, 2024 However, experts believe that Bitcoin can simply adapt to a quantum computer attack through necessary difficulty adjustments and security upgrades. Retrace of Bitcoin Countries On Monday, the on-data analysis revealed that the Royal Government of Bhutan transferred 406 Bitcoins to QCP Capital, worth around $40 million. As a major holder of Bitcoin, with a balance of over 11k, the Royal Government of Bhutan will remain a major potential threat to bullish sentiment. Meanwhile, a report emerged that El Salvador could ease its Bitcoin adoption agenda in the country to strike a deal with the IMF on a $1.3 billion loan. Leveraged and Futures Market Cool-off The cryptocurrency market also experienced heightened selling pressure amid heightened liquidations in the leveraged sector . According to the latest market data, more than 582k traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with the total liquidations at over $1.7 billion. Notably, more than $1.5 billion involved long traders, thus triggering a more rejuvenated long squeeze as more traders attempted to catch the falling wave. Meanwhile, the total crypto open interest (OI) dropped from over $138 billion to hover around $123 billion at the time of this writing. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market is Striking Down With Record-Breaking Liquidations-Here’s What’s Next for Bitcoin & Altcoins , On the Flipside Despite the sudden crypto selloff, institutional investors continued with the previous Bitcoin accumulation cycle .

One of the top coins performing well during this period is Dogecoin . The Dogecoin price has surged by over 100% in the past month, aiming for new highs as the recent bull run continues. However, Rollblock , a new online casino token, is giving DOGE a run for its money. The utility token has raised over $7 million during its presale after experiencing massive whale accumulation. The recent development has caused strong speculations that the hot new crypto will outshine DOGE by the end of 2025. Let’s find out why. Dogecoin reaches for the moon: Is a new all-time high possible? Following the recent surge in the Dogecoin price , some experts are predicting the meme coin is on its way to $1. Currently, the DOGE price is around $0.4, up by over 100% in the past month. Dogecoin’s market cap has also increased to over $61 billion, cementing its place as the top meme coin by market cap. The increase in the DOGE price comes after the broader crypto bull run and shouts that a new altcoin season is close. Moreover, recent developments, including the establishment of a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) by President-elect Donald Trump, have caused more futures traders to accumulate DOGE for potential gains. DOGE soars alongside other meme coins The bullish move in the meme coin market is not peculiar to DOGE. Other meme coins have been rallying after the shift in investor sentiment from Bitcoin. Following the giant strides that saw it reach a new all-time high (ATH) of over $99,000, the Bitcoin price has dropped to just above $95K, causing a shift to altcoins like Ethereum and meme tokens like DOGE, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. Similarly, the entire meme coin market cap has increased from around $55 billion in early November to over $122 billion in early December. Meme coin transactions have also surged among long-term and short-term investors. However, DOGE still leads the pack in terms of market cap and trading volume. Rollblock challenges DOGE with its successful presale While DOGE has been soaring, it faces a challenge from Rollblock . The hot new crypto has already moved by over 310% since its presale began, offering investors massive gains before its full launch. Consequently, the coin has raised over $7 million, showing early signs of success. However, its utility will be the major driver in the coming months. That’s because the Rollblock token has various use cases within the gaming ecosystem. These include serving as the reward token in its revenue-sharing program, which rewards token holders with a share of the weekly profits. The RBLK token also incentivizes investors who participate in its staking program, allowing them to earn up to 30% annual percentage yield (APY), paid in RBLK. Additionally, there’s a VIP program for dedicated casino players to earn more RBLK tokens based on their activities on the platform. Conclusion Despite being in its presale stage, Rollblock is already challenging DOGE as the next altcoin to explode. Interested investors can lock in some Rollblock tokens at a low price of $0.041 in stage 9. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Been In Huge Profits Recently As CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn explained in a new post on X, the long-term holders have sold big in the past month. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins for more than 155 days. This cohort includes the most relentless hands of the market, who rarely sell regardless of whether a rally or crash is going on. These investors are in sharp contrast to the “short-term holders” (STHs), who generally react to any happening in the sector. Related Reading: Analyst Sets $4.40 XRP Target As 3rd-Straight Bull Pennant Forms As such, the times that the LTHs decide to sell can be to watch out for since it means the market is at a stage where even these diamond hands have become tempted to part with their long-held coins. Bitcoin is currently experiencing one such instance, as the bull run to unseen highs has forced some LTHs into harvesting their hard-earned profits. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day change for the LTH supply. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin LTH supply has registered a large negative change during the past month, which suggests these HODLers have broken their silence. In total, the diamond hands have transferred 827,783 BTC in this window. Naturally, not all transactions correspond to selling, but generally, there is a high chance of selling being the intent whenever the LTHs move their coins. The reason behind the LTH selloff becomes apparent when considering the group’s profit-loss margin. As CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr pointed out in an X post, the group is sitting on average profits of 326%. From the chart, it’s visible that while the profits of the Bitcoin LTHs are high on their own, they are still considerably less than the margin during the 2021 bull run. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flash Crash Causes $710 Million In Crypto Long Liquidations This, of course, doesn’t mean that the current rally also has as much room left to go, as it’s very possible that this cycle would simply net these diamond hands fewer gains than last time. While the LTHs have been spending significant amounts recently, Bitcoin hasn’t budged too much, which implies considerable new demand is still flowing into the sector that is absorbing this selling pressure. However, It remains to be seen how long this balance will be maintained. BTC Price Bitcoin had shown a brief break out of its consolidation phase earlier in the month, but it would appear the asset has found its way back into the range as its price is now trading around $98,200.

This depicts the traders being highly uncertain and pulling off their holding following a small pullback. Besides, the altcoins have been crushed heavily; the memecoins dropped by a massive margin. What triggered the sell-off? Why crypto market is down today? Will BTC price hold the monthly open range? The crypto markets underwent an unexpected turn before the previous day’s close, wiping nearly $260 billion from the market cap. Besides, the 24-hour trading volume surged exceptionally, reaching nearly $350 billion from $150 billion. This suggests the traders fell into the trap of panic selling, resulting in massive long liquidations. As per the data from Coinglass, the markets had one of the highest liquidations in recent history. The crypto markets faced long liquidations of over $1.76 billion, with more than 5.86K traders liquidated. Interestingly, it was not Bitcoin that faced the highest liquidation but the other altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin, etc. The single largest liquidation was on Binance, liquidating $19.6 million worth of ETH, while the total liquidation of the second largest token is around $250 million, compared to $190 million worth of Bitcoin. This suggests the traders remain hopeful of a BTC rebound but are uncertain about the prospects of the altcoins. Will the Bitcoin price trigger a rebound? Will it close the yearly trade above $100K? Regardless of the market fluctuations, institutions continue to accumulate BTC. The spot BTC ETF marked another positive day with netflows of around $483 million. Blackrock’s IBIT maintains its 7-day inflow streak, bringing over $398. 6 million worth of BTC, totalling over $3.14 billion. The current market scenario suggests the institutions are benefiting from the trader’s panic selling. Now that the Bitcoin price has regained some momentum, the markets are expected to rebound in a short while.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-10 05:34:08

How Dogizen is Challenging Animal Meme Coins,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-first-ever-telegram-ico-how-dogizen-is-challenging-animal-meme-coins/,"Whether it’s dogs, cats, frogs, or hippos, animal meme coins are all the rage. But right now, the windows for parabolic growth with the main animal meme coins like Pepe and dogwifhat are closed due to their large market caps. Investors are now looking for the next challenger to turn in the same gains, and one of the strongest candidates on the board for a pump has come in the form of Dogizen —a canine-flavored Telegram gaming project. Dogizen has raised an impressive $1.4m and its status as the first-ever ICO on Telegram—one of the fastest-growing social messaging apps—and place within the broader Telegram gaming niche gives the DOGIZ token serious potential for a 100x spike. Animal meme coin sector mooning in 2024 Meme coins have outperformed every other digital asset within crypto all year long. And now, the FOMO is real . The institutions and fat cats on Wall Street wish they loosened up their purse strings to throw their lunch money on cats and dogs. Particularly dogs, with two-thirds of the $125 billion meme coin sector dominated by the canine species. That market share is only set to rise with no less than the mainstream media and the incoming secretary of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) hyping up Dogecoin . It’s all just a matter of time before the hype turns into FOMO for retail investors worldwide. Dogizen elevating the animal meme coin game Dogizen’s canine-themed branding is firmly tapped into the lucrative animal meme coin and GameFi narratives. It is the answer to Telegram CEO Pavel Durov’s wish to see a canine-themed equivalent to the massively successful Telegram game Catizen. Plus, Dogizen’s status as the pioneering ICO on Telegram is expected to captivate a substantial portion of the social messaging app’s 950 million users and counting . Dogizen’s ICO will be available directly on Telegram, exposing its native token, DOGIZ, to an audience ready for the canine equivalent of one of the year’s biggest names in the Telegram gaming sector. Dogizen doesn’t stop at being just another immersive tap-to-earn Telegram game, though—it is launching an SDK for developers to build new Telegram games within the Dogizen ecosystem. It’s laying down the foundations for becoming a development layer for the Telegram gaming sector, which could translate into even greater adoption in the coming years. Dogizen: At the intersection of meme coins and Telegram gaming The ever-growing GameFi sector is on the verge of a major breakout in 2025—and Dogizen is right in the middle of one of its hottest niches. Dogizen’s roadmap and groundbreaking features, combined with its targeting of the hottest narrative in crypto, animal meme coins, prime it for blue chip status and crazy growth.

With Bitcoin facing multiple rejections at $100K levels, investors remain curious is the altcoins party comes to an end. Altcoins See Heavy Dumping in Broader Market Sell-off Since September, this has been the fastest flush-out in altcoins as traders re-align their positions in order to identify any buy-the-dip opportunities. Today’s Bitcoin price drop under $95,000 has led to greater liquidations in the overall crypto market. Blockchain analytics platform Santiment observed that cryptocurrencies that experienced substantial gains during the bull run of the last two months, faced severe drops in the last 24 hours. However, it added that if retail traders succumb to fear and begin offloading their holdings, the market could witness a swift rebound as buying opportunities emerge. On the other hand, crypto analyst IncomeSharks noted that the alt sector managed to maintain the super trend, with professional traders buying the dips. IncomeSharks has expressed optimism about the recent downturn in altcoin prices, describing it as a potentially bullish development for the market. “This is the most bullish thing to happen to altcoins,” noted the analyst. It also led to strong crypto liquidations, now nearing $2 billion. Source: IncomeSharks The analyst noted that the correction has allowed the market to flush out new buyers while maintaining Supertrend support levels, which is a bullish indicator. As per another crypto analyst Rekt Capital, the overall altcoin market has faced rejection from a historically significant resistance level. However, the analyst suggested that the pullback may be less severe this time, indicating a weakening of the $425 billion resistance mark. This trend could signal growing momentum for a potential breakthrough in the near future Source: Rekt Capital Crypto Liquidations Soar to $1.76 Billion As per the Coinglass data , the crypto liquidations have soared to $1.76 billion in the last 24 hours with $1.58 billion in long liquidations and $185 million in short liquidations. In a dramatic turn of events, the cryptocurrency market saw significant turbulence over the past 24 hours, with 583,647 traders liquidated across exchanges. The largest single liquidation order occurred on Binance in the ETH/USDT pair, amounting to $19.69 million. Commenting on the development, popular crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe stated: “That’s the flash crash drop on altcoins. Some have dropped by 30% on the day. Don’t worry, this will reverse back fast, you’d want to see such a massive collapse and liquidity wipe. Onwards we go”. Following today’s crash, Bitcoin’s dominance has inched a notch higher. Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen highlighted a significant milestone in Bitcoin dominance, noting that it recently touched the prior wedge level when excluding stablecoins. Cowen remarked that as long as Bitcoin dominance remains below this level, altcoin-to-Bitcoin (ALT/BTC) trading pairs are structurally stable. Source: Benjamin Cowen At press time, the BTC price is trading 2.6% down at $96,905 with a market cap of $1.917 trillion. The 24-hour Bitcoin liquidations have surged to $189 million with $149 million in long liquidations. On the other hand, the Ethereum price is down 6.62% to the $3,684 level as per the indications on the technical chart.

Brandt shared what he described as the “most powerful chart in the crypto world,” emphasizing the significance of XRP’s market cap breaking through a substantial triangular consolidation pattern, signaling potential momentum in the cryptocurrency’s performance. This the most powerful chart in all of crypto world $XRPUSD pic.twitter.com/UexaPB4D9r — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 7, 2024 The digital asset has demonstrated remarkable performance recently. XRP is trading at $2.17, down 12% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, it recently crossed $2 for the first time since 2018. It has maintained this level since then. The asset is currently positioned as the third most valuable token by market cap, recently flipping Solana, BNB, and USDT. Experts have predicted that it can surpass Ethereum in the current cycle, and the community is eagerly anticipating further gains. Peter Brandt’s Analysis of XRP Brandt’s chart shows the market cap level of $146.3 billion as a crucial level for XRP to surpass. The digital asset has dropped below this level, currently trading at $2.17 with a market cap of $123.5 billion. Brandt’s analysis represents a notable shift in his previous stance towards XRP. Historically critical of the cryptocurrency, he had previously suggested that the XRP/BTC trading pair was headed towards zero and predicted a potentially significant downturn for its community. His recent perspective marks a dramatic reversal from earlier bearish predictions. He recently predicted that a surge above the asset’s 2021 peak of $1.96 would bring a substantial rally , and following the breakout, XRP surged to a multi-year high of $2.86. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Remarkable Performance Two other factors have also contributed to XRP’s recent surge. First, the unexpected resignation of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has created a sense of regulatory uncertainty and potential optimism within the cryptocurrency market. Second, increasing speculation and discussions surrounding potential exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals have generated additional momentum for the digital asset. However, those excited about ETFs will have to wait, as the SEC has revealed that it won’t approve any more ETFs under the current administration.

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crying Kamala on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crying Kamala by entering its contract address – 5eCJhSGBUN4YwJHLU9ZcWjrjmoufVznjzNBHfo4TN1P7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRYKAMA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-10 05:55:00

The report, led by analysts including Kenneth Worthington, attributes the explosive growth in the market in part to the re-election of President-elect Donald Trump. This political development has ignited a historic rally in the crypto ecosystem that includes tokens, decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins, and public companies with exposure to crypto. Total cryptocurrency market capitalization increased by 45% in November, reaching $3.3 trillion. Trading volumes more than doubled across the market, with some digital assets seeing even higher increases in activity. However, the report noted an opposing trend in non-fungible token (NFT) volumes, which remained relatively stagnant despite the broader market rally. Spot exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the U.S. also hit new milestones with record monthly net sales of $7.6 billion. Bitcoin-focused ETPs saw significant growth in both size and trading volumes, further solidifying Bitcoin’s dominance in the ecosystem. The report noted that Bitcoin’s dominance has increased throughout the year, despite a slight decline in recent weeks due to the increasing popularity of Bitcoin ETPs, and that Bitcoin continues to maintain its importance. At the end of November, Bitcoin ETPs accounted for $105 billion in assets under management. Related News: Binance CEO Richard Teng Makes a Statement for the End of 2024: He Talked About The Fate Of Cryptocurrencies After Trump JPMorgan analysts noted that while Bitcoin ETPs have not significantly impacted BTC spot trading volumes, they have underlined BTC’s central role in the market. The rally in November also boosted the Bitcoin mining economy, with the report noting that the rise in the Bitcoin price outpaced the growth in hashrate, increasing profitability for miners. As the cryptocurrency market begins December, the momentum from November raises questions about sustainability and future trends. With market caps reaching all-time highs and trading volumes increasing, industry watchers are eager to see if the rally will continue into the new year. *This is not investment advice.

CEO Brad Garlinghouse criticized a 60 Minutes segment for omitting critical details about Ripple's legal battle with the SEC, while CTO David Schwartz's cryptic ”lock in” message fueled bullish sentiment among XRP enthusiasts. Brad Garlinghouse Criticizes Omission of Key Facts in 60 Minutes Crypto Election Segment Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse has criticized CBS’ 60 Minutes for allegedly leaving out significant details in its recent segment on cryptocurrency’s influence in the 2024 United States elections. Taking to social media platform X on Dec. 8, Garlinghouse accused the program of providing an incomplete narrative, particularly concerning the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The 60 Minutes report , spearheaded by journalist Margaret Brennan, delved into the role of cryptocurrency in US politics . It highlighted Ripple’s financial support for Fairshake, a political action committee (PAC) advocating for pro-crypto candidates. Ripple’s contributions reportedly amounted to millions of dollars in a bid to influence the elections toward more favorable outcomes for the blockchain and crypto sector. As part of the segment, Garlinghouse explained the SEC’s allegation against Ripple, which claimed that the company’s sales of XRP constituted the sale of unregistered securities. This legal contention, filed in December 2020, has become a cornerstone in the broader debate over the regulatory classification of digital assets. “Their allegation was that Ripple and our sales of XRP represented the sale of an unregistered security,” Garlinghouse stated in the interview. Garlinghouse’s criticism of 60 Minutes stems from what he views as a significant omission. He noted that the program failed to highlight a pivotal July 2024 ruling, where a federal judge declared that XRP was not a security in the context of programmatic sales on digital asset exchanges. In his X post, Garlinghouse said, “[Former SEC official John Reed Stark] knows better despite his comments that 60 Minutes chose to air.” The segment featured Stark’s counterarguments, where he claimed that courts had repeatedly deemed cryptocurrencies as securities under existing legal tests. This commentary, Garlinghouse argued, misrepresented the nuances of XRP’s legal status and undermined the weight of the July ruling. Ripple’s legal challenges with the SEC have been ongoing since December 2020. In August, the company was found liable for a $125 million civil penalty, a decision Ripple has appealed. The case remains unresolved, with the SEC also pursuing a counter-appeal. The regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ripple and XRP continues to be a flashpoint in discussions about the US approach to cryptocurrency oversight. Garlinghouse expressed frustration with the SEC’s leadership, particularly under Chair Gary Gensler, accusing the commission of stifling innovation in the digital asset space. He stated during the interview that organizations like Fairshake might not have been necessary if the SEC had adopted a more progressive stance on digital assets. XRP’s Resurgence Post-Ruling Following the landmark ruling in July, XRP experienced a resurgence, briefly reclaiming its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The ruling provided a temporary morale boost for XRP supporters and raised hopes for a more favorable regulatory environment for other digital assets. Some asset managers have even filed applications with the SEC to launch exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to XRP, signaling renewed interest in the token. The Ripple case has become emblematic of the broader clash between the crypto industry and US regulators over the classification of digital assets. Critics argue that the SEC’s enforcement-heavy approach lacks clarity and hinders innovation. The question of whether cryptocurrencies should be considered securities has become a sticking point, with the industry calling for clearer legislative guidelines. Garlinghouse’s comments come at a critical juncture for cryptocurrency in the United States. With the 2024 elections spotlighting the role of digital assets in shaping policy, Ripple’s high-profile case brings attention to the urgent need for regulatory clarity. As the legal battle continues, the stakes remain high not just for Ripple but for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Ripple CTO Sparks Bullish Sentiment Among XRP Community with ”Lock In” Message Meanwhile, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz , has ignited a wave of excitement within the XRP community following a cryptic post urging followers to “lock in.” The brief yet impactful message has been interpreted by many as a call to hold onto XRP for the long term, fueling optimism around the cryptocurrency's future trajectory. Schwartz’s enigmatic statement, simply saying “Lock in,” was shared on his X account and reposted across the platform. The XRP community, known for its passionate support of Ripple and its digital asset, responded with a flood of bullish sentiments. Many XRP enthusiasts interpreted the phrase as a strong signal to maintain their holdings or even accumulate more XRP, in line with the popular crypto ethos of “hodling.” Notable community member and XRP advocate @XRPcryptowolf echoed the general sentiment, posting, “David just confirmed to lock in and not sell any XRP.” While Schwartz’s statement galvanized enthusiasm, he also took the opportunity to warn the XRP community about the persistent threat of cryptocurrency scams. These schemes often involve fraudsters impersonating prominent figures, including Ripple executives like CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and offering unrealistic returns in exchange for small cryptocurrency transfers. In a humorous yet cautionary post, Schwartz addressed one of the most common scams, writing, “If you send me just 10 XRP, then I will ...... have 10 more XRP.” The lighthearted comment places the spotlight on the seriousness of such fraudulent schemes, which frequently leverage deepfake technology and fake accounts to mislead investors. Ripple’s leadership, including Schwartz and Garlinghouse, has consistently emphasized the importance of vigilance in the face of these scams. XRP’s Bullish Momentum Amid the excitement stirred by Schwartz’s post, XRP appears to be showing strong bullish momentum. According to cryptocurrency analyst and trader Ali Martinez, XRP has formed three consecutive bull pennant patterns on its chart—a technical indicator suggesting the continuation of an upward trend. Martinez has subsequently set ambitious price targets for XRP, predicting that the asset could climb to $4.40 after testing the $2.25 level. As of the latest data from CoinMarketCap , XRP is trading at $2.13, positioning the token well within range of these projections. The bullish sentiment surrounding XRP is bolstered by its recent resurgence as a top-performing cryptocurrency. The asset has experienced significant growth in both price and adoption, particularly following Ripple's partial legal victory against the SEC earlier this year, which ruled that programmatic sales of XRP did not constitute the sale of securities. The XRP community, often referred to as the “XRP Army,” remains steadfast in its belief in the asset's long-term potential. Schwartz’s “lock in” message has amplified this confidence, with many taking it as a direct endorsement of the asset’s bullish outlook. Ripple’s ongoing efforts to expand the use of XRP in cross-border payments and financial services, coupled with its fight for regulatory clarity in the US, continue to position XRP as a pivotal player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. David Schwartz’s cryptic yet impactful “lock in” message has reignited enthusiasm among XRP supporters, coinciding with technical indicators pointing to potential price gains. As Ripple continues to navigate its legal challenges and expand its global footprint, the cryptocurrency appears poised for a promising future. However, Schwartz’s reminder about the prevalence of scams serves as a critical caution for investors to remain vigilant in the dynamic and often unpredictable world of cryptocurrency.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-10 06:15:45

The Bank of England has suggested that zero-knowledge proofs and other privacy-enhancing technologies — also known as PTEs — could be viable components of a potential digital pound. In its latest report called “Enhancing the Privacy of a Digital Pound,” the central bank said that such technologies as pseudonymization, ZK-proofs, and secure multiparty computing, “might feasibly be applied to digital currency systems such as the digital pound to minimize the sharing of data both with the central bank and between payment intermediaries, giving users greater control over their data and enhancing user privacy.” “This presents opportunities for a digital pound to be at least as private as current forms of digital money and potentially even more private, although as with any technology, there are limitations to what emerging types of PETs can achieve.” The Bank of England Following public feedback from its 2023 consultation, the Bank of England and HM Treasury reaffirmed their commitment to safeguarding user privacy, reassuring that neither the government nor the central bank would have access to users’ personal data. ZK-proof is a cryptographic protocol that enables one party to prove they know something without revealing the actual information. The technology is actively being used in blockchains like Ethereum ( ETH ), Zcash ( ZEC ), and Polygon ( POL ) for privacy and scaling solutions.

The Bank of England began its exploration of a digital pound in 2020, when it established a task force to evaluate the potential design and implications of a central bank digital currency. However, public consultations and detailed assessments have been ongoing since early 2021, with the central bank emphasizing the importance of adapting to technological advances in payments and the declining use of cash. The bank has yet to make a final decision on launching its digital currency.

Now, additional evidence has emerged in the form of record activity on decentralized finance (DeFi), which offers unique and programmable onchain options, perpetuals, and structured products. The total dollar value of crypto tokens locked (TVL) on Derive has risen past $100 million, alongside a record-setting trading volume and monthly active traders. “Derive.xyz's latest market insights reveal remarkable growth and heightened activity, with its total value locked surpassing $100 million for the first time, amid record-setting weeks for trading volume and active traders,"" Sean Dawson, head of research at Derive, told CoinDesk in an email. “Yield on all USDC deposits has reached 10% on Derive.xyz, while it hit all-time highs in notional volume at $369 million and monthly active trades at 5,416,"" Dawson added. The Derive platform comprises of Derive Chain, a settlement layer for transactions; Derive Protocol, which enables permissionless, self-custodial margin trading of perpetuals, options and spot; and Derive Exchange, an order book. The record activity on Derive is consistent with the widespread demand for options tied to cryptocurrencies and digital assets-related investment vehicles like spot ETFs and stocks. Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price later. A call gives the right to buy and represents a bullish bet on the market, while a put indicates a bearish bet. Whales sell BTC calls Last week, a whale sold collected over $1.6 million in premium by selling BTC calls against a long position in the spot market. The so-called covered call strategy involved short positions in March expiry call options at strikes, ranging from $105,000 to $130,000. The whale will retain the premium if BTC stays below $105,000 by the end of March. Conversely, the long position in the spot market will compensate for losses stemming from a potential rally beyond $130,000. Another popular strategy among traders has been posting sUSDe, a reward-bearing token earned by staking Ethena's USDe stablecoin, as collateral on Derive to borrow USDC at rates notably lower than other lending protocols. The same is used to buy sUSDe again, and the cycle is repeated. The so-called DeFi carry trades earn a double-digit return owing to the positive spread between sUSDe's 28% annualized yield and Derive's ongoing USDC borrowing rate of around 18%.",Markets|Bitcoin|Derivatives|Markets,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-10 07:27:34

However, the cryptocurrency has gained 60.08% in the last month and 40.92% over six months, indicating strong underlying momentum. Technical indicators show the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 33.36, close to oversold territory, and the Stochastic at 17.48, which may suggest a potential rebound. If SHIB breaks above the nearest resistance level at $0.00003759, it could target the second resistance at $0.00004443. Reaching this level would represent an increase of approximately 30% from current prices.

The company intends to use the funds primarily to acquire more Bitcoin and support general business operations, reflecting its strong belief in Bitcoin as ""digital gold."" An additional $75 million option for investors further emphasizes Riot's ambitious financial strategy. Convertible senior notes, a blend of debt and equity features, have become a favored method for companies to secure funding for Bitcoin acquisitions. Riot follows a path similar to MicroStrategy , a leader in Bitcoin holdings, which has issued billions in such notes to fund its Bitcoin purchases. Riot’s announcement highlights its confidence in Bitcoin’s value and its intention to expand its reserves as part of a long-term growth plan. The company made the announcement on social media, stating: “ Riot announces a $500 million private offering of convertible senior notes. Proceeds will be used to purchase Bitcoin and support operations. ” This mirrors strategies employed by other firms, showcasing the increasing adoption of Bitcoin-focused financial approaches. Riot’s strategy aims to strengthen its vertically integrated operations, which span Bitcoin mining and infrastructure projects across states like Texas and Kentucky. By increasing its Bitcoin holdings, Riot seeks to solidify its position as a leader in the mining sector while reinforcing its balance sheet with an asset it considers resilient and appreciating. While this financial strategy offers significant potential, it carries risks, such as potential dilution of shareholder value if the notes are converted into equity. However, Riot’s focus on mining, as opposed to MicroStrategy’s broader business intelligence operations, allows it to capitalize directly on Bitcoin price movements. This specialization gives Riot a unique advantage in the competitive crypto sector. The $500 million raised is expected to bolster Riot’s ability to scale its operations and enhance its infrastructure. The company’s focus on Bitcoin as a core asset reflects its belief in the cryptocurrency’s resilience and potential for future growth. As Bitcoin continues to gain acceptance among institutional and retail investors, Riot’s bold approach signals confidence in its long-term role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Riot's success with this offering will depend on market conditions, investor sentiment, and its ability to navigate operational challenges. Nonetheless, the move aligns with the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption, further solidifying Bitcoin's role in modern financial strategies . By adopting these innovative financial tools, Riot not only aims to expand its reserves but also positions itself as a key player in the broader crypto landscape. The company’s confidence in Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value underscores its commitment to supporting and advancing the cryptocurrency industry. This approach highlights the growing integration of traditional financial instruments with the emerging crypto economy.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-10 07:32:09

Chen believes the anticipated pro-crypto stance could create a more favorable environment for global exchanges, but compliance hurdles remain a significant challenge. Chen highlighted the need for a local partner to navigate US regulations, which are known for being complex and varied at both federal and state levels. She explained that a joint venture with an already licensed partner might be a practical solution, allowing Bitget to bypass the extensive licensing process. However, she emphasized that no final decisions have been made. Bitget previously explored entering the US in 2022 but abandoned the effort due to compliance issues. While the possibility is being revisited, Chen remained cautious, noting that even with a supportive federal administration, state-level regulatory obstacles could be difficult to overcome. Recent compliance challenges, such as warnings from Japanese regulators, further complicate matters. The US market presents significant opportunities for Bitget, the 7th largest centralized exchange by daily trading volume, according to Coingecko. Expanding into the US could boost its global market share. Chen acknowledged this, stating that the ongoing bull market and Bitget’s growing popularity, including a 400% increase in its token (BGB) this year , provide a window of opportunity for expansion. Chen’s comments align with Bitget’s broader strategy of leveraging market momentum. The company recently launched a token listing portal, capitalizing on industry hype and filling gaps left by competitors facing regulatory scrutiny. However, her statements about the US market appear more exploratory than definitive, reflecting the cautious approach Bitget is taking in light of past difficulties. As Trump’s administration promotes pro-crypto reforms, including appointing a Crypto Czar and a new SEC Chair supportive of digital assets, Bitget’s leadership sees potential.

While the segment was initially seen as an opportunity to provide a balanced perspective on Ripple’s role in the cryptocurrency industry and its long-running push for regulation, Hartner and others in the crypto community felt the broadcast misrepresented key facts about XRP and dismissed its utility. Inaccuracies From the 60 Minutes Interview In a rec ent thread on X, Hartner pointed out factual inaccuracies in the 60 Minutes segment. For example, the program described XRP as “Ripple’s cryptocurrency.” Hartner emphasized that XRP is not owned by Ripple but operates on a decentralized public blockchain called the XRP Ledger. He noted that Ripple is a prominent contributor to the XRP community but does not control the digital asset. The segment also featured John Reed Stark, a former SEC official, who described cryptocurrencies as a “scourge” and dismissed their utility, claiming they are purely speculative. Despite Ripple’s growing adoption of XRP in the cross-border payment market, Stark’s comments were amplified without significant counterpoints. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Hartner noted that Ripple’s customers actively use XRP to facilitate faster and more cost-effective international transactions, demonstrating the token’s practical use cases. During the interview, Garlinghouse also pointed to JP Morgan’s interest in and adoption of blockchain technology . A significant omission in the segment was the July 2023 ruling by Judge Analisa Torres, which declared that XRP itself is not inherently a security. The court determined that XRP itself is not a security , and distinguished between XRP sales to institutional investors and sales to retail buyers on exchanges, affirming that the latter does not meet the definition of a security. This decision was a landmark moment for the cryptocurrency industry, but 60 Minutes failed to address it, leading to further frustration among XRP supporters. Garlinghouse himself criticized 60 Minutes on X after the interview aired. He expressed disappointment in the program’s lack of nuance, omission of crucial information, and reliance on dismissive rhetoric from critics like Stark. Hartner’s critiques reflect broader dissatisfaction within the cryptocurrency community. Mainstream outlets often prioritize sensationalist narratives over balanced reporting, overlooking real-world applications of blockchain technology, and the 60 Minutes interview is a clear example.

The complaints surfaced on X, where users disputed Coinbase’s explanation that a ""minor increase"" in restricted accounts was due to inactivity and FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt). On December 9, Coinbase Support acknowledged a sharp rise in platform activity following the election, citing a 2-3x increase in fraud attempts. According to Coinbase, this surge led to automated fraud-prevention measures, resulting in higher account restrictions and longer customer support response times . The exchange said it was working to address the issue but has faced strong pushback from users. Many have shared frustrations online, accusing Coinbase of misleading the public. Reports describe lengthy freezes on trading and withdrawals, with some accounts flagged for extended manual reviews or VPN usage. One user claimed their account was locked simply for using a VPN, while others reported receiving little to no support from Coinbase despite repeated inquiries. Influential figures in the crypto space have joined the criticism. Glauber Contessoto, a prominent investor, stated, “Coinbase needs a 24/7 customer service line where users can speak to a real person to resolve issues. It shouldn’t be this difficult.” Hundreds of similar comments flooded Coinbase’s posts, underscoring widespread dissatisfaction with the exchange’s customer support. Coinbase has faced additional challenges this year. In October, a phishing attack led to a $6.5 million loss , with funds laundered through TON-linked wallets. More recently, Coinbase exited the Turkish market, citing regulatory difficulties. These issues reflect broader obstacles faced by crypto exchanges in navigating global compliance environments. Despite these setbacks, Coinbase saw significant financial success in 2024. Increased crypto trading activity and favorable regulatory developments in the US helped the company achieve a 97% year-to-date stock gain. Its layer-2 network, Base, also reached notable milestones, surpassing six million daily transactions in Q3 and ranking as the fifth-largest blockchain by total value locked (TVL). While Coinbase’s financial performance remains strong, the backlash over restricted accounts highlights the need for improved customer service and better communication with users. The company faces mounting pressure to address these issues as its user base continues to grow.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-10 07:40:51

It promises an instant, secure, stable, innovative, low-cost, and efficient payment experience that will reshape the future of the digital economy. A few months earlier the AE Coin had announced it received preliminary approval from the Central Bank. One AE Coin will be equivalent to one UAE Dirham. AE Coin aims to empower individuals and businesses to access modern financial tools, fostering financial inclusion, and supporting innovation in industries such as e-commerce, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi).

According to Chainalysis, the stablecoin market in the UAE has grown significantly in 2024. Through the first half of the year, the value of stablecoins received by services (particularly CEX and DEX) in UAE totaled over US$9.8billion, a 55% spike over the US$6.3billion received over H1 2023. Stablecoins now account for the largest share of crypto activity in the UAE (51%), which stands significantly higher than both Bitcoin (19%) and Ether (9%), which are typically considered to be the most recognized and popular cryptocurrencies. Retail stablecoin transfers are the majority of transactions in UAE Finally retail-sized transfers (US$10K and below) accounted for a meagre 6% of value received, while professional-sized (US$10k to US$1million), institutional-sized (US$1million to US$10million) and large institutional-sized (US$10million and above) accounted for 40%, 34%, and 20% respectively. In terms of volume of stablecoin transfers in the UAE, retail sized transactions were by far the majority (93%). This indicates a highly active market for retail investors who are likely using stablecoins as a means to trade in and out of other virtual assets.

Tkachev, a member of the New People party, submitted his suggestion to Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, highlighting Bitcoin's potential as an independent asset free from international sanctions and inflation risks associated with traditional currencies like the dollar, euro, and yuan. Tkachev's proposal comes at a time when Russia appears to be softening its stance on cryptocurrency regulation. President Vladimir Putin recently stated that Bitcoin cannot be banned and will continue to grow, providing a confidence boost that helped Bitcoin surpass the $100,000 milestone after lingering near $95,000 for weeks. On the regulatory front, Russia has made significant changes. Cryptocurrency transactions are now exempt from VAT, with profits from crypto activities taxed at 15%, similar to securities. Earlier this year, Russia also legalized Bitcoin mining, though restrictions remain in specific regions. Mining is prohibited in occupied Ukrainian territories, such as Donetsk and Lugansk, and seasonal restrictions are in place in Siberia during winter months to manage electricity demand. The idea of a national Bitcoin reserve is not unique to Russia. In the US, Pennsylvania recently proposed allocating 10% of state funds to Bitcoin as an inflation hedge and investment strategy. There is growing optimism that Donald Trump, after his inauguration in January, might consider establishing a national Bitcoin reserve. Investment firms like VanEck have also advocated for Bitcoin as a reserve asset. El Salvador, a trailblazer in this field, introduced its Bitcoin reserve in 2021. The country now holds over $554 million worth of BTC, with unrealized profits nearing 120% . Russia’s interest in following this path reflects a global trend of increasing adoption of Bitcoin as a strategic financial asset. Whether Russia will move forward with Tkachev's proposal remains to be seen, but the suggestion aligns with the country’s recent efforts to optimize its crypto regulations and explore alternatives to traditional financial systems .",,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-10 07:45:40

Dogecoin (DOGE) unapologetically took the spotlight as it recorded a memorable triple-digit surge in less than a month. Dogwifhat (WIF) is also catching eyeballs, and although its performance lagged, it appears primed for a massive rally in the upcoming weeks. Meanwhile, Lunex Network continues to make strides in the DEX space as thousands are rushing to the ongoing presale of the native $LNEX token. Let’s see how these projects compare and why $LNEX could take everyone by surprise in 2025. Dogecoin Has Broken Out, What’s Next? After facing rejection at the $0.47 mark, Dogecoin (DOGE) entered a consolidation phase around $0.40 as buyers scooped up the dip. Over the last few days, however, Dogecoin has started gaining ground again and today it trades at $0.46 following an 8.4% weekly increase. Interest in Dogecoin has been reignited as reflected by the 43% surge in volume, with roughly $9.7 billion worth of DOGE traded in the last 24 hours. According to Trader Tardigrade , the chart shows that Dogecoin is in the process of breaking out of a bullish pennant pattern. This breakout, supported by the increase in volume, could pave the way for another major leg-up in the Dogecoin price, with the next big target being the prophesied $1 milestone. Investors Keep An Eye On This Dogwifhat Pattern Dogwifhat (WIF) was launched about a year ago, and since then it has grown to be one of the top meme coins in the space. CoinMarketCap shows a 2100% yearly increase, placing Dogwifhat in the crypto top 50 with a noteworthy $3.69 billion in market capitalization. Dogwifhat faced intense selling pressure around the $4 mark, which led to a retracement and consolidation on lower levels. Currently, Dogwifhat sells for $3.70, with 4.5% in weekly gains. Analyst and trader Dylan has drawn attention to an inverse head & shoulders formation on the Dogwifhat chart. This bullish formation could be foreshadowing a run to a new all-time high for Dogwifhat, provided that the $4 resistance is reclaimed and flipped into support. Lunex Network Grabs Attention With Passive Income Model Lunex Network is a cutting-edge decentralized exchange that connects and seamlessly transacts between individual blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Investors can use the platform to trade across 50,000 different assets at the lowest price possible, while simultaneously earning generous rewards via Lunex’s revenue-sharing mechanism. Lunex Network stays true to its roots as a decentralized protocol by implementing a no-KYC policy. Investors simply request the currency pair, input a receiving address, and confirm the swap. Users enjoy complete anonymity without having to go through various hoops and verification processes while retaining exclusive custody of their funds. Lunex will also offer a DeFi crypto wallet and a portfolio tracker for efficient asset management. The Lunex Pro subscription service will provide advanced trading tools and exclusive features for those who want to take their trading to the next level, these include cashback bonuses and AML wallet checks. One of the most intriguing aspects of the Lunex Network is the passive income mechanism, which will allow users who stake the $LNEX token to earn up to 18% APY. To sustain this, Lunex will invest a portion of its weekly earnings to repurchase $LNEX tokens and then distribute them as recurring staking rewards to holders. Moreover, a certain amount of the tokens will be burned forever, promoting long-term growth and encouraging holding, while investors enjoy the benefits of token appreciation on top of the staking rewards. Right now, $LNEX tokens sell for just $0.038. Early buyers can expect an 18x multiplier by the end of the presale alone, meaning that there has never been a better time to get involved.

37455788,https://coinpaprika.com/news/google-s-quantum-chip-sparks-bitcoin-security-debate,1733816893,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37455788.jpeg,Google's Quantum Chip Sparks Bitcoin Security Debate,https://coinpaprika.com/news/google-s-quantum-chip-sparks-bitcoin-security-debate,"Google recently unveiled its latest quantum computing chip, Willow, featuring 105 qubits and delivering groundbreaking computational power. This announcement has sparked concerns within the crypto community about Bitcoin’s cryptographic security, as quantum computers are known for their potential to break encryption algorithms. Willow has achieved a remarkable milestone, solving a complex computation in just five minutes—something the most advanced classical supercomputers would need ten septillion years to accomplish. Quantum computers, unlike traditional machines, use qubits that can process multiple calculations simultaneously through quantum entanglement and uncertainty, giving them an edge in tasks like encryption-breaking. This development has reignited debates about whether Willow could compromise Bitcoin’s security. Critics fear that a sufficiently powerful quantum computer might one day break the algorithms safeguarding cryptocurrencies, potentially destabilizing their value and usage. However, experts have clarified that cracking Bitcoin's encryption requires millions of qubits—far exceeding Willow’s current capacity. Crypto developers have been preparing for this scenario for years, working on quantum-resistant solutions to ensure long-term security. Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, addressed this issue recently by introducing updates to strengthen Ethereum against quantum threats. Despite some alarmist reactions, such as claims that ""Bitcoin is dead,"" the broader consensus is that Willow poses no immediate threat to Bitcoin. Commentators have emphasized that quantum computers like Willow are still far from achieving the scale needed to challenge Bitcoin’s cryptographic algorithms. The crypto community remains proactive. Developers and researchers have been exploring quantum-resistant cryptographic techniques, ensuring that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will continue to evolve alongside advancements in quantum computing. While Willow represents a significant leap in quantum research, experts stress that its capabilities are not a cause for panic but rather a reminder of the need for innovation in crypto security. In conclusion, Google’s Willow is a milestone in quantum computing but falls far short of threatening Bitcoin’s encryption. The crypto space has anticipated this challenge for years and is already taking steps to stay ahead of potential risks, ensuring the continued stability and security of blockchain systems.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-10 07:48:13

The pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, who wrote the code for Bitcoin, imagined it as a digital infrastructure for a future where people are free to transact without banks and governments. Recently, one token ( Cutoshi ) that applies these principles launched with major success. How Cutoshi Applies Satoshi’s Principles MemeFi token Cutoshi is walking in Satoshi’s footsteps, to great success. The token raised over $1.3 million so far in its presale, with a vision of building a decentralized ecosystem for all its users. Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision for Bitcoin was that of a decentralized technology without centralized authorities. Bitcoin enables peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. This means that users can send money to each other without relying on banks and platforms. Cutoshi is adopting this principle by creating a decentralized exchange (DEX), that works across different blockchains. Unlike the popular centralized exchanges like Binance, the Cutoshi DEX allows users to swap tokens directly with each other. Another key aspect of Satoshi’s goal is enabling users to have direct control over their assets. Nobody but the holders of Bitcoin wallets can access their contents. Without a seed phrase, these wallets are impervious. Cutoshi mirrors this principle by enabling users to keep the coins in their custody. In contrast, centralized exchanges hold their users’ tokens, which can lead to misuse. For instance, the bankrupt exchange FTX used users’ crypto for trading, ultimately losing their assets. This has cost their users billions in crypto losses. DEXs avoid this issue by leaving control to the users. Cutoshi Sees Major Interest In Presale In addition to building a decentralized ecosystem, like Satoshi, Cutoshi has another major advantage. The token is leveraging the power of memes to attract traders and make DeFi more accessible. Despite the volatility of memecoins, these tokens attract millions of traders. In particular, retail traders love that they can invest in memecoins with little technical knowledge. Meme coins are all about the viral factor and their community. By using a meme mascot, in particular the “Maneki-neko,” or lucky cat, Cutoshi aims to tap into that viral potential. People in Asia believe that the lucky cat brings prosperity and luck to their houses and Cutoshi wants to do the same. The viral potential of memecoins means that Cutoshi has the upside of being discovered by meme coin communities, potentially seeing parabolic gains. Conclusion The recent bull market rally is seeing people enter the crypto market for the first time. By using memes, projects like Cutoshi have the potential to bring these people into the world of DeFi, a more decentralized and safer way to trade crypto.

Under the MoU, First Abu Dhabi Bank is piloting a credit line for approved lenders to provide stablecoin lending with those Libre issued tokens as collateral.Holders of all sorts of crypto assets enthusiastically use their tokens as collateral to borrow against. In this case Libre, which already proposed the use of its blue chip RWA tokens as collateral on a MakerDAO forum in September , has brought a $335 billion bank into the mix. FAB will be handling liquidity through lending credit lines on Libre’s assets on public chains like Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, NEAR, Aptos and Coinbase’s layer2 network BASE.Libre’s collateralized lending offering is part of an initiative the firm calls “Project HODL” (short for High-Yield Optimized Decentralized Liquidity).“We've been working on adding utility to our AUM in the form of collateralized lending,” said Dr. Avtar Sehra, founder and CEO of Libre in an interview. “Essentially it's an on-chain infrastructure that allows these RWAs to be used as collateral.

Trump’s Appointments Signal Shift To Pro-Crypto Regulation Trump’s recent selections, such as a digital asset champion to lead the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the creation of a White House czar for artificial intelligence and crypto, indicate a shift toward a more friendly regulatory climate. Notably, Trump has praised the concept of establishing a national Bitcoin reserve, which is gaining bipartisan support in Congress, with pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis at the lead. Related Reading: XRP Skeptic Turned Believer? Critic Hails XRP As Crypto’s Chart King Bitcoin recently surpassed the $100,000 mark for the first time on December 5, trading at around $96,898 as of Monday. The cryptocurrency’s six-week winning streak is the longest since the market frenzy of 2021, but analysts remain concerned about volatility. David Lawant, head of research at crypto premier broker FalconX, noted that a sustained push above the $100,000 milestone will most likely necessitate other positive catalysts, as BTC has struggled to recapture this level while stabilizing after the advance over the last four days. Bitcoin Rally Boosts MicroStrategy And Peers Bloomberg also notes that the positive atmosphere surrounding cryptocurrencies has resulted in a substantial rebound among companies that have followed MicroStrategy’s strategy of selling convertible bonds to fund Bitcoin purchases. MicroStrategy alone sold $6.2 billion in convertibles this year and intends to raise an additional $21 billion through fixed-income offerings. Other companies, including MARA Holdings and Core Scientific, have successfully obtained significant funds to support their Bitcoin acquisitions. MicroStrategy’s stock, MSTR, has risen 73% since Donald Trump’s election, while MARA, Riot Platforms, and Core Scientific’s shares have increased by 63%, 33%, and 30%, respectively. This trend closely resembles Bitcoin’s nearly 40% growth within the same period. With a market capitalization approaching $2 trillion, Bitcoin’s recent ascent has dramatically increased MicroStrategy’s assets, which are now worth more than $41 billion.

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crying Kamala on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crying Kamala by entering its contract address – 5eCJhSGBUN4YwJHLU9ZcWjrjmoufVznjzNBHfo4TN1P7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRYKAMA.

In a new interview with trader Scott Melker, pseudonymous analyst PlanB says that Bitcoin could surge to as high as $150,000 in December, a more than 53% gain from its current value. “It’s almost scary that it is happening again. It seems programmed: three years of boring bear markets and then one year of FOMO (fear of missing out) and face-melting bull action. And it’s like that in all the past cycles. So if history is any guide, we’re going to see that again. And I certainly think we’re going to see that again. So indeed $100,000 if not $150,000, somewhere between that for this month, December.” He also says that based on historic precedence, Bitcoin may continue to go on a series of rallies printing new all-time highs until at least June. “Again, if history is any guide, the returns of Bitcoin are not normally distributed. So it’s not like we get an all-time high and then a bear market and an all-time high and some middle ground. No, it’s all-time high after all-time high after all-time high. It’s very clustered. So maybe six to 12 months of real bull market action.” Bitcoin is trading for $97,677 at time of writing, down 2% in the last 24 hours.

In 2025, it will range between $1.71 and $2.03, with an average price of $1.76. In 2030, it will range between $10.60 and $12.93, with an average price of $10.98. Unlike the common sentiment of being a meme token, ApeCoin (APE) has utility. APE is an ERC-20 token that governs the ApeCoin DAO. The token also has utility within an affiliated company, Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Otherside metaverse, BAYC, and MAYC NFTs. Will APE reach $10? What will be its price in 2025? Let’s explore these and more in the Cryptopolitan Price Prediction from 2024 to 2030. Overview Cryptocurrency Apecoin Ticker APE Current price $1.47 Market cap $1.09B Trading volume $460.21M Circulating supply 752.65M All-time high $39.40 on Mar 17, 2022 All-time low $0.4826 on Aug 5, 2024 24-hour high $1.75 24-hour low $1.30 Apecoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 20.91% 50-day SMA $1.2399 200-day SMA $1.0236 Sentiment Bullish Fear and Greed Index 78 (Extreme Greed) Green days 21/30 (70%) APE price analysis As of the time of writing (December 10), APE’s price dropped by 14.42%, trading at approximately $1.48 over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency’s trading volume rose by 127.80% in 24 hours. APE/USD 1-day chart analysis APE price chart APE has consistently dropped from the year’s high up until the launch of Apechian, losing over half its value. On October 19, it made a bullish run and topped out at $1.759, rising by over 150% in a single day, a level previously reached earlier in April. Later, it corrected to a low of $0.867 and then rose above $2 in December. The William Alligator trend lines show it now registers high volatility.

APE price analysis shows the market has been bullish despite registering negative momentum in recent days, meaning it will continue correcting over the short term. Why is APE up? APE has traded in a high Fibonacci over the last 30 days. The rise could be attributed to the wider market sentiment and the launch of Apechain. Will APE reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2030. At the time, APE should have bridged to ApeChain and grown much utility and applications such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‘household’ cryptocurrency. Will APE reach $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2030. Does APE have a good long-term future? APE’s utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE. Recent news/ updates With the launch of ApeChain, APE proceeded to pump by over 100% accompanied by the launch of new projects such as Donkey Dash, Ape Express, Battle Plan, and the Ape Portal.

In an interview with Bloomberg TV on Dec. 9, CEO of Binance Richard Teng was asked about whether the major crypto exchange plans to re-enter the U.S market following the rise of President-elect Donald Trump’s administration that has shown a more crypto-friendly approach. Teng explained that the exchange is currently focusing more on “global deployment,” instead of the possibilities of a U.S market return. “Whether we will re-enter the U.S market, I think that’s a premature discussion. As of now we are focusing on our global deployment, and we are growing very quickly and very happy with the progress we are seeing,” said Teng.

Teng also highlights the milestones throughout the “landmark year” of 2024 for crypto, including Bitcoin reaching beyond $100,000 and the approval of several Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana ETFs. “We have now a very crypto-friendly President in the States and an extremely smart strategy, appointing an AI and Crypto Czar on that front because these two represent the most innovative technology for the future and other countries will do extremely well [to focus on those areas],” he said. Moreover, he predicted that many other countries and organizations will begin to deploy funds into crypto, following America’s decision to announce plans for a strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve and Brazil’s Bitcoin reserve bill. “So it’s not only the countries, it’s the sovereign wealth funds, institutions, foundations of government and high net worth individuals. So they are going to start allocating this space,” said Teng.

The drop in the Bitcoin price has slashed the prices of the majority of the tokens, including Chainlink & Litecoin. Meanwhile, as the markets are trying to cope with the massive sell-offs, the bulls seem to be confident of these two top tokens. Therefore, as the prices of LINK & LTC have initiated a rebound, they are expected to lead the top gainers for the day. Chainlink Poised to Reclaim $25 Chainlink is considered one of the strongest undervalued altcoins, which has more room to swell. The recent pullback dragged the levels from the highs above $27 to below $20 but the quick intervention of bulls has elevated the price to $22.87. The trading volume has reached close to $3 billion with a rise of over 31%, marking the growing dominance of the bulls. Therefore, the LINK price is expected to revive a strong upswing to reach the resistance above $27 if the bulls manage to secure these levels before the end of the fortnight. Regardless of the recent pullback, the LINK price remains strong within the rising, expanding channel in the short term. The token rebounded after hitting the interim support at $20.56, indicating the bulls were vigilant. On the other hand, the OBV, the volume-based indicator, triggered a bullish divergence, suggesting the start of a bullish trend. Meanwhile, the MACD shows a drop in the selling pressure as the buying volume intensifies. Therefore, the Chainlink price is expected to rise to $24.92 in the next few hours and achieve $25 in a short while. Litecoin Price Poised for a 15% Rebound Ever since the breakout from the consolidation in November, the LTC price has managed to range along the ascending support and mark the yearly highs above $145. This move attracted significant bearish activity, followed by a notable sell-off. However, the token is trying to validate a rebound, intending to surge above $120 before the day’s close. The short-term price action of Litecoin suggests the bulls have entered as the token defends the ascending support. Besides, the rebound in RSI levels also validates the claim, indicating a rise to immediate resistance at $121 may be imminent. Additionally, the +Di has reached the lower threshold and awaiting a rebound. This substantiates the bullish claim as the ADX is heading towards higher levels. Therefore, the DMI may rise and could probably undergo a bullish crossover in the next 24 to 36 hours, which may offer a strong boost to the LTC price, reclaiming $130.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|LINK|LTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-10 08:10:38

Layer 2s have made quite a buzz over the last few months because of their high network activity. Arbitrum led the Layer 2 pack with a total value locked (TVL) of $3.25 billion. Arbitrum is an Optimistic Rollup solution that shifts network operations away from the Ethereum mainnet while maintaining Ethereum-level security. Arbitrum’s BOLD testnet also went live; when integrated into the mainnet, the update will enable permissionless validation on Arbitrum. This means that anyone can challenge the state of the Arbitrum network. Currently, validators are allow-listed. Is Arbitrum a good investment? Will it go up? Where will it be in 5 years?

ARB is neutral at current levels with the fear and greed index showing extreme greed among investors. On the charts, it is correcting from the recent high. Is Arbitrum a good investment? Arbitrum is a leading Layer 2 blockchain with an impressive TVL. The network also achieves development milestones, like quadrupling transactions after integrating EIP-4844 , which cuts transaction costs by 90%. Despite a gloomy month, price predictions suggest a different narrative. Why is Arbitrum UP? Arbitrum’s current recovery is partly consistent with the network’s rising TVL. The crypto market is also bullish. Will Arbitrum reach $10? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $10 in the period ending in 2030. Will Arbitrum reach $100? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $100 in the period ending in 2030. Will Arbitrum reach $1,000? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $1,000 in the period ending in 2030. Does Arbitrum have a good long-term future? A high adoption rate is crucial for any blockchain’s long-term success and sustainability. Arbitrum’s performance in this regard is a positive sign of its future performance despite the price declines.

His appeal to Finance Minister Anton Siluanov outlines a vision of something that could safeguard the country’s financial stability against sanctions, inflation, and the unpredictability of traditional currency reserves. The US dollar, euro, and yuan aren’t cutting it anymore, Tkachev said. They’re vulnerable. They’re subject to geopolitical games, sanctions, and inflation. Bitcoin, on the other hand, operates outside of any single country’s control, making it an attractive option for a government facing financial isolation. “I ask you to assess the feasibility of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve,” Tkachev said . Bitcoin as a strategic tool for sanctioned nations He explained that: “In conditions of limited access to traditional international payment systems for countries under sanctions, cryptocurrencies are becoming virtually the only instrument for international trade. The Central Bank of Russia is already preparing to launch an experiment in cross-border settlements in cryptocurrency.” Bitcoin’s financial appeal is clear. It’s the best-performing investment asset of the last decade. As of press time, Bitcoin’s price hovers around the $100,000 neighborhood, solidifying its reputation as both a store of value and a speculative asset. Tkachev’s proposal argues that holding Bitcoin could be as much about financial gain as it is about protecting against external threats. “Bitcoin has shown one of the highest returns of all investment assets,” the appeal says. Meanwhile, just a few weeks ago, President Vladimir Putin signed a law that said crypto is now recognized as “legal property” in Russia. Global interest in national Bitcoin reserves It was Putin’s buddy President-elect Donald Trump who made the Bitcoin national reserve idea popular. At a Bitcoin conference in July, he told attendees, “Never sell your Bitcoin,” while outlining his many plans. He even fired SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who was the industry’s biggest hater. However, Trump’s Bitcoin reserve plan has its critics. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers called the idea “crazy,” claiming it’s more about political theater than sound economic policy. “There’s no reason to do that other than to pander to generous special interest campaign contributors,” he said. Summers likened Bitcoin to “sterile inventory,” arguing it lacks the tangible value of resources like gold or oil. Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced legislation that would see the US government buy one million Bitcoins—roughly 5% of the total supply—over the next five years. She wants the Federal Reserve’s gold stash to be sold in order to finance that, which really is a terrible idea economically. Peter Schiff, another crypto hater, said, “A reserve of something you can never sell and must continuously buy is worthless.” He added that governments will be forced to keep buying Bitcoin to maintain its value, potentially destroying their own currencies in the process.

As of press time, some had crashed by as much as 15%. Market intelligence platform Santiment revealed a glimmer of hope amid the bearish trend. The platform mentioned seven altcoins that saw the worst hit in a tweet, adding that they could see “a swift rebound” if retailers begin selling their holdings. Altcoins, particularly those that have surged significantly during this 2-month bull rally, have plummeted today.

These crypto assets have seen significant price gains within the past two months. For example, TRX recently surged from $0.23 to $0.43, surpassing its 2018 price high. This rapid uptrend made the crypto project’s founder, Justin Sun, call TRX the next XRP (another altcoin that saw a massive surge within a few days). AVAX has also seen massive gains recently, soaring from $28 to $54 within the past month. DOT also jumped from $4.35 to $11.1 in the same time frame. The other altcoins also recorded significant price surges. These assets’ values have now dropped significantly, sparking fear and uncertainty among token holders. Due to the latest price tumble, Santiment hinted that retail traders might sell their holdings out of fear. What Could Drive the Rebound? The market intelligence platform believes these assets could experience an impressive bounce-back if retailers offload their altcoin holdings. The firm had explained in a previous report that crypto assets often go in the opposite direction from traders’ expectations. A bearish outlook towards these assets can prepare them for a bullish uptick. In other words, a bearish trend can drive the altcoin family’s rebound if this trend happens.

On-chain stats on Tuesday revealed that this trader turned a mere $3K into a staggering $73 million using the frog-themed meme crypto, Pepe Coin. Notably, this trade maneuver has gained significant traction as PEPE price recently hit a new ATH before witnessing a waning movement. Market watchers anticipate whether the meme coin has topped this bull cycle, given this trader offloaded trillions of coins amid the crypto’s ATH run. Crypto Trader Turns $3K To $73M With Pepe Coin, What’s The Scoop? According to recent data from Lookonchain, a crypto trader was recorded turning $3K into $73M using Pepe Coin. Notably, this trade maneuver echoed a buzz across the broader landscape as the frog-themed meme coin hit a new ATH before the market recently plummeted. Per the data, this trader invested $3K to buy 4.91 trillion coins as of April 15, 2023. Over time, the trader gradually sold his holdings, cashing out a whopping 3.03 trillion coins for $27.5 million. Notably, a recent trade move by this trader was recorded as another 100 billion token selloff for a $2.8 million profit. Further, even after selling massive amounts, this market enthusiast holds 1.88 trillion tokens, pushing his total profit to $73 million. While this trading strategy sparked significant market discussions, it’s also notable that market watchers speculate on the asset’s future movements. The trader’s remaining holdings could further witness selloffs in light of profit-booking intentions. However, the remaining holding also indicates a sense of confidence in one of the leading meme coins by market cap and its future movements. Besides, recent whale data has cemented investors’ optimism surrounding the frog-themed meme token. Another post from Lookonchain revealed that 9 wallets belonging to the same whale spent 13.8 million DAI to acquire 555 billion PEPE at an average price of $0.000025. This massive buying, underscoring heightened buying pressure on the asset, has added to market optimism on future movements. What’s Ahead For The Frog-Themed Meme Token? At the time of reporting, despite the massive buying, PEPE price slipped 1.5% intraday and is currently trading at $0.00002529. Its 24-hour low and high were $0.00002244 and $0.00002825, also marking a new ATH. Besides, broader charts underscored an ongoing bull run for the token, showcasing weekly and monthly gains worth 23% and 122%, respectively. This broader rising action falls in line with a bullish Q4 and the token witnessing heightened buying over the days. Simultaneously, a recent PEPE price analysis by CoinGape Media indicated that the coin’s price could double. This bullish projection rides the back of a staggering $1.14 billion worth of whale accumulations. Crypto trader and investors continue to eye the coin optimistically, expecting further gains in light of recent bullish on-chain statistics.

SpotonChain data shows a 30-day pattern in which midrange and large-tier wallets (those with $10,000 to $10 million) increased their holdings by up to 120%. Such accumulation is sometimes a forerunner to market movements, and current trends indicate that whales are preparing themselves for long-term gains. Bullish Forecasts And Market Dynamics Analysts are enthusiastic about PEPE’s future performance. Technical indicators point to a potential 254% increase within three months, supported by significant investor interest and favorable market circumstances. The development of 13,000 new wallets over the last month demonstrates the organic demand that is propelling this memecoin’s growth. Meanwhile, long-term projections are a lot more aggressive, with one estimating an astonishing 1720% gain in less than a year, data from CoinCheckup shows. All these have been fueled by the optimism of increased inflows into Ethereum ETF and regulatory certainty. Analysts project that if PEPE holds important support levels, the stock will be able to overcome resistance and continue its ascending path.

While a short-term recovery is uncertain, the big picture outlook for Ripple is extremely bullish from a technical perspective. XRP has breached a popular 8-year old pattern hinting that the outlok for the token is wildly bullish. Based on the theoretical forecasting methods, XRP price could hit $200 and go beyond based on Ripple’s 8-year chart pattern. XRP Price Today The latest price of XRP is $2.20, marking a 5% decrease in the last 24 hours. Despite this dip, XRP has experienced significant price movement over the past month. Notably, its value surged earlier in November, attracting heightened investor interest. However, the recent rally has triggered profit-taking, leading to a short-term correction for the digital asset. Over the past week, XRP’s price has dropped by 14%, highlighting a brief cooling period after its earlier gains. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency has still been up an impressive 278% over the past month. Source- TradingView Over the past year, XRP has surged by an astounding 230%. Starting from a modest $0.50, it has climbed above $2.20, breaking several key resistance levels. This ascent reflects a bullish trend that has gained traction among investors. If XRP maintains this upward trajectory, it could reach as high as $200 by 2025. Source: TradingView XRP Technical Analysis: 8-year Pattern Forecasts $200 Target XRP price has recently broken out of a bullish pennant or bull flag pattern that spanned over eight years, signalling the potential for a massive upward move. A bullish pennant consists of a sharp initial rally, known as the flagpole, followed by a period of consolidation shaped like a triangle known as flag. This pattern is a continuation setup, and its target is calculated by measuring the length of the flagpole and adding it to the breakout point. For XRP, the flagpole represents a staggering 54,000% increase during its previous rally, projecting a potential target of approximately $200 following the breakout. XRP Price price chart Even for a theoretical forecasts, the XRP price targets are ambitious, to say the least. So, will Ripple hit $200? Will Ripple Hit $200? XRP price draws investor attention as Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark, sparking a widespread bullish sentiment across the crypto market . Major top altcoins like BNB and SOL experienced substantial surges, riding the wave of renewed market enthusiasm. Many speculate this could signal the start of a long-anticipated altcoin season, driving further price rallies across digital assets, including XRP. Given the current momentum, a $5 target is more realistic. Speculation around the U.S. elections and the potential inauguration of Donald Trump in January are heightening interest in digital assets. The U.S. election and lawsuits against the SEC could drive momentum, potentially replacing Gensler. Ripple’s bullish breakout and market momentum position XRP for potential growth. While $200 is speculative, strong adoption and market conditions could drive substantial gains in the coming years.

On December 10, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) released the results of its public consultation on a potential CBDC, which garnered feedback from 500 written submissions and 18,000 survey responses. More than 70% of the respondents were of the opinion that a CBDC, which the bank refers to as “digital cash,” was not important. Further, only 16% agreed with the RBNZ’s rationale for introducing a CBDC to ensure access to central bank money in digital form and promote innovation and competition in New Zealand’s digital economy. Most participants raised concerns about security, privacy, and whether such a system was even necessary, while 65% indicated no interest in proposed features like automated payments and real-time balance tracking. 90% of respondents flagged potential government control as their main concern, linking the idea of a CBDC to increased traceability and reduced privacy. Some worry that, even if not initially intended for intrusive purposes, a CBDC could evolve into a tool for monitoring or controlling financial behavior. You might also like: New Zealand’s central bank starts consultations on Bluetooth-friendly CBDC Respondents were also largely unconcerned about the impact of crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum on the use and popularity of the New Zealand dollar. Many viewed cryptocurrencies as offering various advantages like fixed supply and the absence of centralized control. Meanwhile, some saw stablecoins as a viable alternative ‘while questioning the need for direct access to central bank money,’ a perspective firmly countered by RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr, who views them as inherently unstable and not a viable replacement for traditional currency. To address these concerns, the Reserve Bank plans to focus its research agenda on privacy and autonomy. “These issues will form the backbone of our end-user strategy We intend to look at a wide range of instruments to protect privacy and autonomy, such as legislative, cultural, or technological means,” it added. The RBNZ launched its consultation on April 17, 2024, which ran until July 26, to explore the future of digital cash. At the time, RBNZ Director Ian Woolford assured that the central bank “will not control or see how you spend your money.” According to the central bank, digital cash would coexist with physical cash, functioning without a commercial bank account by using a digital wallet, payment card, or mobile app while also supporting offline transactions via Bluetooth.

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-10 09:41:58

In no time the memecoins faced a huge sell-off and plunged, driving the market cap from $137 billion to $116 billion. Meanwhile, the trading volume of the memecoins doubled, suggesting market participants fell into the trap of ‘panic selling’. However, despite massive losses, popular ones Dogecoin & Pepe have triggered a recovery and if they remain bullish until the day’s close, the other memecoins are also expected to gain some strength. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis Dogecoin faced huge liquidations of around $90 million in the past 24 hours that slashed the price from $0.466 to $0.412. However, the token has been displaying strength since the start of its rally in October and as a result, the bulls managed to defend the crucial support. Currently, the price is trading within a rising channel, suggesting the DOGE price may reclaim the lost levels to form new yearly highs soon. As seen in the above chart, the DOGE price has reclaimed it’s levels within the bullish pattern, suggesting the bulls to have remained vigilant. Meanwhile, the RSI displayed a bullish divergence while the MACD suggests a drop in the buying pressure. Moreover, a bullish crossover in the short term may have a huge positive impact in the long term, which could push the prices above the pivotal resistance around $0.478. Beyond this move, a rise above $0.5 could be imminent, forming highs at $0.53. Pepe (PEPE) Price Analysis Being different from the other memecoins, the PEPE price is displaying significant strength as the levels maintain a healthy upswing close to its ATH. Regardless of the current market turmoil, the popular memecoin is just 8% away from its highs and hence there is a high possibility of forming new highs later this week. The PEPE price is trading within a rising wedge and the current daily candle has hit the upper resistance and also tested the support. Therefore, with this, the price is expected to rise above $0.000027 in a short while, which may push the prices above $0.00003 shortly. However, the RSI and OBV are displaying a bullish divergence, which could be a matter of concern at the moment. Therefore, the PEPE price is believed to mark new highs above the said target and eventually face a notable rejection after breaking out from the rising wedge.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|PEPE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-10 09:42:17

The cryptocurrency sector endured a severe correction in the past 24 hours, with Shiba Inu (SHIB) being among the losers. Its price tumbled by over 12%, while its market capitalization briefly dipped below $15 billion. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko However, some essential factors suggest that SHIB might return to the upward trend soon. One example is the meme coin’s burn rate, which skyrocketed by more than 1,000% on a 24-hour scale, resulting in approximately 51.7 million tokens being destroyed . The USD equivalent of the stash might be insignificant , but continuous efforts in that field will reduce the circulating supply of Shiba Inu, potentially making it more valuable (assuming demand remains the same or heads north). Since adopting the program, the SHIB team and community have burned over 410.7 trillion tokens, leaving around 589.3 trillion in circulation. The second bullish element is Shiba Inu’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which recently plunged below 30. The technical analysis tool measures the speed and change of price movements and varies from 0 to 100. Readings below 30 typically indicate that the asset is underbought, suggesting a higher likelihood of a potential rebound. On the other hand, anything above 70 suggests a possible correction. Last but not least , we will touch upon SHIB’s exchange netflow , which has been negative for the past three days (according to CryptoQuant’s data). This is considered bullish since it signals a potential shift from centralized platforms towards self-custody methods, hence reducing the immediate selling pressure. Bonus: Shibarium’s Advancement Shiba Inu’s layer-2 scaling solution – Shibarium – made the headlines earlier this week when it blasted through another milestone. As CryptoPotato reported , the total number of wallet addresses surpassed two million. Over the past several weeks, the network has been processing daily transaction into the millions, with their total number currently standing at over 630 million. Shibarium’s increased activity may attract new developers and users, which could bolster the overall visibility and adoption of SHIB.

El Salvador To Scale Back Its BTC Ambitions According to a Dec. 9 report from the Financial Times citing people familiar with the matter, El Salvador expects to secure a $1.3 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund in the next two to three weeks. In return, the Salvadoran government will stop forcing merchants to accept Bitcoin as payment, making it a voluntary payment method instead of compulsory. If confirmed, the deal would unlock a total of $3.3 billion in loans from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, aimed at “supporting macroeconomic adjustment and structural reforms.” El Salvador Has Been Buying Bitcoin Since 2021 El Salvador made history in 2021 when it became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender , forcing businesses to accept the cryptocurrency if they had the technological means to do so. The impoverished Central American nation made its first 200 BTC buy on Sept. 6, 2021. The El Salvador government, led by its pro-Bitcoin president Nayib Bukele, has continued to purchase Bitcoin since, committing to acquire 1 BTC daily . The nation currently holds 5,932 BTC as of November 2024. With Bitcoin hitting $100,000 earlier this month, Bukele announced that the government’s Bitcoin stash was worth roughly $600 million , representing an impressive 126% increase. The IMF, however, has condemned the approach and issued multiple warnings over the years, citing “a number of macroeconomic, financial, and legal issues.” The latest development comes as no surprise to some observers, as in October, the International Monetary Fund reiterated its recommendation to limit the scope of its Bitcoin legislation and adoption. Nevertheless, the legal modification is unlikely to significantly impact Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador, which has been to a certain extent, poor. Back in August, Bukele admitted that the country’s BTC experiment had mixed results, adding that the crypto had witnessed limited domestic adoption.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|El Salvador,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-10 09:44:37

It appears that the dip comes amid a retreat noted in the broader crypto market, indicating that investors are taking a pause ahead of the crucial economic releases. However, despite the recent dip, a top expert predicts ADA to hit $4 in the coming days if it holds a key support level. Top Analyst Predicts Cardano Price To Hit $4 The crypto market saw its biggest liquidation recently, with traders liquidating $1.76 billion in the last 24 hours. This has triggered immense selling pressure on the broader crypto market, with Bitcoin and the top altcoins taking the biggest hits. There was no exception for Cardano price as well, which saw a slump of nearly 10% during writing. However, despite the recent dip, top crypto market experts appear to have remained bullish on the future trajectory of the crypto. For context, Ali Martinez, a prominent figure in the crypto space, recently shared a price chart of ADA, citing its historical trends. The analyst has compared the recent price swings to its 2020 performance, saying that he would continue to accumulate ADA even if the price continue to slump. Source: Ali Martinez, X In addition, Martinez also hinted that the crypto is poised to hit $4 or even $6, which would allow traders to book profit. In his recent X post, he stated: “Even if it dips down to $0.76, I’m buying more and plan to book profits between $4 and $6.” What’s Next For ADA? ADA price today was down nearly 10% during writing and exchanged hands at $1.01. However, the crypto’s trading volume has rocketed 122% to $3.88 billion at the same time. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high of $1.15, while noting a monthly gain of 75%. Besides, CoinGlass data showed that Cardano Futures Open Interest slumped 25% amid a broader crypto market crash , indicating a waning risk-bet appetite of the investors. However, the Relative Strength Index for ADA at 53 suggests a neutral stance for the crypto. This indicates that the crypto could witness further gains. Source: TradingView Additionally, Martinez has highlighted a key trend for Cardano price, saying that the crypto has slipped below the “critical $1.20 support level.” He noted that around 93,000 addresses had purchased 2.54 billion ADA at this level. Besides, he also said that the next demand zone for the crypto stands at $1 now. Source: Ali Martinez, X In addition, the Cardano Foundation X handle was hacked recently, which has also sparked concerns in the market. The hackers have promoted a false token, saying that it would stop ADA withdrawals due to the US SEC crackdown. However, the team was quick to address the issues, which has boosted the market spirit. On the other hand, a recent analysis hints at a potential ADA rally to $2. Also, the analysis showed that the Cardano price trajectory remains bullish as long as it holds above the $0.644 support level, indicating that the crypto could witness further rally in the coming days.

The asset hinges on strong hands holding for the long term, with the added security of locked tokens. The M3M3 token is a Solana asset that aims to combine meme hype with staking. The token has been heavily promoted by influencers, and a significant part of its supply already has been locked in staked positions. The new trend has already built up 10.4K followers on X, and a total of 19,523 holders . At this level, M3M3 resembles an early-stage meme token. This time around, new buyers are urged to also stake their tokens for rewards. Meteora boosts M3M3 for its native DEX token The appeal of M3M3 comes from Meteora, one of the rising DEX platforms on Solana. Meteora is not at the level of Raydium and Orca, but it has also benefitted from the meme token boom. The exchange has now introduced its native token, similar to RAY or JUP, tapping users seeking passive income. Meteora has set up three chief roles for M3M3 – as a launchpad token for third-party startups, as a general staking token, and as a liquidity token for meme creators to boost their initial liquidity. M3M3 aimed to serve as a version of SOL specifically for the Meteora ecosystem. M3M3 was created with a supply of 999,999,926 tokens, of which 167,035,922 are already staked. It is precisely the staking use case that is the leading narrative for this asset. Meteora claims to have distributed more than $3.11M in staking rewards. The M3M3 staking comes with a warning – whales are quickly making their entries. Commenters are also trying to enter the top 100 wallets, which are the only stakers that earn rewards. Its tokenomics model creates an inherent competition for the top spots, which adds to the demand for M3M3. Meteora, the token’s issuer, notes the new tokenomics allows holders to move beyond the PvP aggressive trading model, instead competing to buy more and take one of the valuable spots among the top 100 holders. Once a staker secures one of the spots, they earn both SOL payouts and additional M3M3. Once again, there is an incentive not to sell, but to hold. This type of tokenomics does not look for endless increments in buyer count but for competitive buying among holders, leading the underlying asset to trade higher. The M3M3 model resembles the Olympus DAO and its OHM staking token, which collapsed under its promised high APY. The other problem with the new token is the prevalence of insiders, who may be controlling the supply. There are no high-value whale wallets, but the supply has been split into wallets with exactly 0.75% of the supply, based on BubbleMaps data. Users find workaround for M3M3 unstaking issues In addition to the social media drive to stake more M3M3, the asset had a small technical glitch, which prevented immediate unstaking. The token’s front end unstaking link does not allow for withdrawals. The Meteora team, which claims to support the token, has not commented on the limitation or whether it is deliberate or a mistake. Users have found a workaround for the M3M3 unstaking limitation by removing a hard-coded value to release the tokens. One of the reasons for unstaking is the spectacular run of M3M3 as a short-term trading bet. M3M3 launched at $0.001 on December 4, quickly rallying above $0.12. The token is gaining speed and liquidity, potentially leading some early stakers to liquidate their holdings. M3M3 rallied strongly since its launch, while buyers were incentivized to hold with high rewards. M3M3 still has a market capitalization of just $125M, with $2.2M in locked liquidity. The staking rewards exceed the token’s market capitalization, which may further incentivize holders. However, M3M3 is also considered a relative risk due to its high reward rate. Meteora claims to be able to provide returns even if M3M3 market prices go lower, based on its DEX activity. Traders are also looking at M3M3, expecting its tokenomics model to lead it to a higher price range. Not all ecosystem participants will move in as buyers, and some will bet on the speculative value of the asset. The M3M3 model is spreading to other DEX and DeFi protocols, as a way of encouraging buying and long-term holding.

The altcoins crashed even harder, with numerous double-digit price losers, before they were able to catch their breath and recover some ground. BTC’s Nosedive CryptoPotato reported yesterday morning that BTC had fallen further away from the $100,000 level after surging past $101,000 on Sunday. Hours later, though, the asset breached into six-digit territory, but it was a short-lived move. Although MicroStrategy announced another mindblowing bitcoin purchase, the cryptocurrency actually dumped hard in value and slumped by roughly six grand in hours. Thus, it plummeted toward $94,000 for the first time since last week’s leverage-induced crash. Nevertheless, the asset managed to bounce off almost immediately and now sits above $97,000. This massive volatility harmed over-leveraged traders, with more than 500,000 such market participants getting wrecked on a daily scale. The total value of liquidated positions is up to $1.6 billion, according to CoinGlass. For now, the BTC market cap has declined to $1.930 trillion. The silver lining is that its dominance over the alts has shot up to 53%, as most of them have suffered a lot. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 10.12.2024. Source: TradingView Alts in Red As mentioned above, many of the alts dumped harder than BTC, even though they have managed to bounce off their Monday evening bottoms. Still, some of the biggest losers on a daily scale include BRETT (-14%), WIF (-13%), WLD (-13%), EOS (-12.5%), GALA (-12.3%), SAND (-12%), and TAO (-12%). Larger-cap alts like ETH, SOL, and BNB have dropped by around 3-4%. XRP dumped beneath $2 briefly during the crash, and even though it stands at $2.2 now, it is still 7% down on the day. Numerous others posted violent declines over the past day, but here are those who stand the best chance to bounce off quicker, according to Santiment. The total crypto market cap went from $3.9 trillion to well below $3.6 trillion before settling at just over the latter. Thus, the metric is down by $300 billion daily.

The findings shared on the Treasury’s official website expand on how cryptocurrencies are changing the investment landscape despite their speculative nature. The government arm is looking to soften the situation before President-elect Donald Trump takes over the reins on January 20, 2025. Trump has famously pledged to create a strategic bitcoin reserve in the US, which the Treasury will be directly involved in. It remains to be seen whether Trump will follow through with his promise. If the US decides to act, trillions of dollars worth of treasury bills could be invested in Bitcoin. The Rise of Stablecoins The report also focuses on the rise of US stablecoins, especially USD Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). According to the findings, the rise in stablecoins has resulted in a modest increase in demand for short-dated treasuries. The stablecoin market is expected to witness further growth in the future, so it will need to be regulated strenuously. Tokenization The Treasury report also touched on the important tokenization aspect that has become one of the most well-known use cases of the Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT) revolution. The report states that tokenizing Real World Assets (RWA) across interoperable blockchains will considerably benefit this process and unleash new economic arrangements and opportunities. Key US Treasury Projects, Including Tokenizing US Treasuries The American Treasury focuses on projects like tokenized treasury repo, tokenized treasury funds, and digital asset treasury tokenizations. The report lists the major benefits of using this new approach, including improved collateral management, increased liquidity, improved clearing and settlement, and more. Significant downsides reported include technological risks, operability risks, and legal and economic uncertainty due to the nature of the digital currency economy. The Future The US Treasury seems eager to take advantage of the crypto revolution and devise a solution that works in its favor. However, the report itself doesn’t trust public blockchain networks for tokenization and other advancements. For this, the department plans to introduce a government-managed private blockchain. Overall, the report proposes a cautious approach by the government as the blockchain sector is extremely volatile. However, investing directly in Bitcoin is no longer a farce.

Notably, over the past 24 hours, these large-scale investors have purchased an astonishing 20,000 BTC, valued at $2 billion. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this activity on Saturday, tweeting, “Bitcoin whale accumulation is going parabolic. They just bought another 20,000 BTC in the last 24 hours, valued at $2 billion.” This accumulation surge follows another revelation Martinez made on December 4th: “Around 400 new Bitcoin whales, holding between 100 and 10,000 BTC, have joined the network in the last two weeks.” The sudden influx of whale buying follows a volatile week in the Bitcoin market. From December 5 to 6, Bitcoin’s price plummeted from a record high of $103,900 to $90,500, a staggering 13.98% drop, before stabilizing around $98,000. The surge in whale activity, coupled with recent price growth, has sparked increasing speculation that Bitcoin could easily surpass the $200,000 mark in the coming months. An analyst at Bernstein suggests this milestone could be reached as early as 2025. Glassnode founders, popularly known as “Negtropic” on X, also expressed optimism despite Thursday’s flash crash following Bitcoin’s surge past $100,000 . They stated that Bitcoin’s recovery, driven by spot buying, suggests a break above the $98,500 resistance soon, potentially pushing prices toward the $104,000-$105,000 range in the short term. Elsewhere, data from CryptoQuant also highlights a surge in retail investor interest, with the 30-day demand change hitting its highest level since 2020. While increased retail participation often signals a market top, it also reflects growing enthusiasm, which could bolster Bitcoin’s next leg up. Another factor driving optimism is the trend of Bitcoin leaving exchanges. Significant negative exchange netflows, or Bitcoin moving from exchanges to private wallets, indicate ongoing accumulation by whales. This trend reduces the available supply on exchanges, creating favorable conditions for price increases. While the $200,000 target is gaining traction among bullish analysts, some experts warn of potential corrections. Jamie Coates, chief analyst at Real Vision, predicted a two-to-three-month consolidation phase as Bitcoin responds to macroeconomic factors. “Bitcoin has hit new ATHs in the face of a deteriorating liquidity backdrop.

After surging post-election to a record $103,800, Bitcoin has struggled to hold six-figure levels while the crypto market shed around $200 billion overnight. The downturn was not exclusive to BTC as smaller tokens also nosedived by up to 15%, marking one of the year’s steepest intraday losses. The fear and greed index still depicts “Extreme Greed” as the cumulative crypto market cap stands at $3.46 trillion with a trading volume of $350 billion. Macro fears meet BTC chaos Data provided by Coinglass shows that more than 580k traders were liquidated in the last 24 hours. The total liquidation came in at $1.76 billion, with the largest single liquidated position of $19.69 million in ETH/USDT recorded on Binance. Over $1.6 billion worth of liquidated positions (90%) were long bets, which is a reflection of investors’ hopes for the bullish run to continue. The market retraction comes ahead of the upcoming US inflation data. Fears from potential macroeconomic scenarios and BTC’s latest swing come together to form the perfect storm for traders. Bitcoin price dropped by over 4%, hitting the lower $95,000 zone and causing panic in the market. Data shows that more than $178 million worth of long and short bets got liquidated in the last 24 hours. Over $142 million worth of liquidations (80%) turned out to be long bets. This shows that traders were very much hopeful for BTC’s bullish rally to continue but the bears had different plans. BTC is still up by 120% on the year-to-date (YTD) basis and is trading at an average price of $97,455 as of press time. Its 24-hour trading volume stands at $116.2 billion. Trump-led rally vanishing? Speculation after Donald Trump’s pro-crypto agenda won him the US elections fueled a boom, but notorious crypto swings have led to rapid exits. Trump’s crypto pivot has excited investors with $10 billion flowing into US spot-Bitcoin ETFs since his election. Ripple’s XRP was one of the biggest losers of the day. After witnessing a solid upward run, XRP price dropped by over 10% in the last 24 hours, and it is down by 18% over the last 7 days. XRP is trading at an average price of $2.24 as of press time. Meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and smaller assets have struggled even worse, which may indicate the sector’s broad-based weakness. DOGE price went down by 6% while SHIB recorded a drop of 12% in the last 24 hours.

As a publicly traded company, Coinbase ‘s 2024 strategy for listing tokens seems to reflect a more measured approach compared to its rivals, with a selective focus on high-market-cap meme coins and a preference for Ethereum ( ETH ) and Base ( BASE ) networks rather than Solana ( SOL ) or BNB Chain (formerly Binance Smart Chain). https://twitter.com/ai_9684xtpa/status/1866367898501206452 In an X thread on Dec. 10, an on-chain analyst under alias “ai_9684xtpa” revealed that in 2024, Coinbase has added 34 tokens to its listing roadmap, with seven meme coins, making up 20.58% of the total. Moreover, about 71% of the listed meme coins had market values over $500 million, showing Coinbase focuses more on larger assets than its competitors. Meme coin listings on Coinbase have picked up since October, following a rise in interest around “dog coins” as alternative tokens. This trend mirrors what’s happening on Binance, which has also added 14 meme coins since October. You might also like: Coinbase adds GIGA and TURBO to its asset roadmap While both exchanges share a peak in meme coin activity during this period, Coinbase’s listings reveal somewhat of a selective approach to network distribution, the analyst found. Unlike Binance, which sees over 60% of its meme coin listings on Solana, the majority (57%) of meme coins listed on Coinbase are on Ethereum, with Solana and Coinbase’s own layer 2 network, Base, each accounting for 28.6%.

As shared by Eleanor Terret on X (formerly Twitter) on December 10, 2024, Peirce identified key steps for achieving regulatory clarity under the SEC’s new leadership, advocating for a more collaborative and adaptable approach. This comes amid increasing calls for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to modernize its stance on digital assets and provide a framework that aligns with the evolving needs of the crypto ecosystem. Peirce’s Proposed Steps for Regulatory Clarity Commissioner Peirce emphasized three critical measures to create a balanced and transparent regulatory environment for the crypto industry: 1. End Restrictive Policies Like “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” Peirce criticized restrictive measures that hinder the industry’s access to essential services such as custody and banking. Dubbed “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” these policies have reportedly limited the ability of legitimate crypto businesses to operate effectively, deterring innovation and investment. 2. Define Assets Beyond the SEC’s Regulatory Scope A major point of contention within the industry is the ambiguity surrounding which digital assets qualify as securities. Peirce called for clear definitions to reduce uncertainty and streamline compliance efforts, ensuring that businesses can operate within the law without fear of unexpected enforcement actions. 3. Collaborate with Stakeholders Peirce advocated for open collaboration between the SEC, crypto entities, and the public to adapt existing rules to the unique characteristics of blockchain and cryptocurrency. This inclusive approach aims to balance innovation with investor protection. Why Regulatory Clarity Matters The cryptocurrency industry has long grappled with an uncertain regulatory environment in the United States. This lack of clarity has led to enforcement actions against major players and deterred potential investors. Key Benefits of Regulatory Clarity : Investor Confidence : Clear guidelines provide assurance to investors, encouraging capital inflows. Innovation Enablement : A well-defined framework fosters technological advancements and business growth. Global Competitiveness : By aligning its regulations with international standards, the U.S. can remain a leader in the global digital economy. The Role of New SEC Leadership The appointment of a new SEC Chair signals an opportunity for the agency to reset its approach to crypto regulations. Under new leadership, the SEC is positioned to shift from enforcement-driven tactics to a more constructive and forward-thinking regulatory strategy. Leadership Priorities : Modernizing outdated rules to accommodate blockchain technology. Engaging with international regulators to harmonize global crypto standards. Balancing the needs of innovation with the mandate of investor protection. Peirce’s recommendations align with these priorities, offering a roadmap for a more inclusive and effective regulatory framework. Challenges in Implementing a Crypto-Friendly Framework While Peirce’s proposals are well-received within the industry, implementing them is no small feat. The SEC must navigate several challenges: 1. Balancing Innovation with Risk Mitigation : The agency must ensure that investor protections are not compromised while accommodating new technologies. 2. Political and Bureaucratic Hurdles : Developing consensus within the government and regulatory agencies can be time-consuming and contentious. 3. Addressing Market Volatility : The crypto market’s inherent volatility poses challenges for crafting stable and predictable regulatory policies. Industry Response to Peirce’s Remarks Hester Peirce’s proactive stance has garnered widespread attention and support from the cryptocurrency community. What Experts Are Saying : Crypto Advocates : Praise Peirce for her forward-thinking approach, viewing her as a critical ally in the fight for fair and clear regulations. Skeptics : Argue that more stringent controls are necessary to protect retail investors and curb market manipulation. Neutral Observers : Emphasize the importance of balanced regulations that address risks while supporting growth. This mix of reactions highlights the complexity of achieving consensus in a highly polarized regulatory landscape. Global Context: Crypto Regulations Beyond the U.S. While the U.S. grapples with defining its crypto policy, other nations are forging ahead with their own regulatory frameworks. Examples of Global Progress : European Union : The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation provides comprehensive guidelines for the industry. United Arab Emirates : The UAE has positioned itself as a crypto-friendly hub with clear licensing requirements for businesses. Singapore : Balances strict anti-money laundering measures with innovation-friendly policies, attracting global blockchain firms. The U.S. risks falling behind these regions if it fails to establish clear and competitive crypto regulations. The Path Forward for U.S. Crypto Regulations Peirce’s call for collaboration and transparency presents a roadmap for the SEC to move forward: Immediate Steps : End policies that unfairly restrict crypto businesses from accessing essential services. Provide interim guidance to clarify the classification of digital assets. Long-Term Goals : Create a dedicated crypto regulatory body or task force within the SEC. Work with Congress to develop comprehensive legislation that supports innovation while protecting investors. By taking these steps, the U.S. can foster a thriving crypto ecosystem that benefits businesses, investors, and the economy. Conclusion Hester Peirce’s remarks on the need for clearer crypto regulations come at a critical time for the industry. Her proposals to end restrictive policies, define regulatory boundaries, and engage with stakeholders offer a vision of progress and collaboration. Under the SEC’s new leadership, there is a unique opportunity to create a regulatory framework that balances innovation with investor protection, ensuring that the U.S. remains at the forefront of the global digital economy.

This development underscores the ongoing competition among major crypto exchanges and raises questions about what’s driving the changing dynamics. This article explores the reasons behind Coinbase’s decline, Binance’s resurgence, and what these trends mean for the global cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Rise of Binance and the Fall of Coinbase Coinbase and Binance, two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, have long been seen as rivals in the race for market dominance. However, the latest data reveals a stark contrast in their recent trajectories: Coinbase’s Market Share Decline : Market Share at 6.6% : This is a significant drop, reflecting a struggle to retain its position amid growing competition. Regulatory Challenges : Coinbase has faced increased scrutiny from U.S. regulators, potentially deterring some users. Higher Fees : The platform’s higher transaction fees compared to Binance may also contribute to the decline. Binance’s Market Share Growth : Regains 44.1% Market Share : Binance remains the dominant player in the crypto exchange space, driven by its global reach and competitive offerings. Wide Range of Services : From spot trading to futures, Binance’s extensive product range attracts diverse traders. Lower Fees and Incentives : Binance’s user-friendly fee structure and promotional campaigns appeal to both retail and institutional traders. Factors Contributing to Coinbase’s Decline The decline in Coinbase’s market share can be attributed to several factors that have weakened its competitive edge in a rapidly evolving market: 1. Regulatory Pressures : As a U.S.-based exchange, Coinbase operates under strict regulatory oversight. Recent lawsuits and investigations by the SEC and other regulatory bodies have cast a shadow over its operations, creating uncertainty for users and investors. 2. Limited Global Presence : While Coinbase has expanded its services internationally, its footprint remains limited compared to Binance, which has established itself in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. 3. Fee Structure : Coinbase’s transaction fees are higher than those of Binance, making it less attractive to cost-conscious traders. This disparity is particularly impactful during periods of high trading activity. 4. Competition from Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) : The rise of decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap has drawn users away from centralized platforms like Coinbase, further eroding its market share. How Binance Maintains Its Dominance Binance’s ability to reclaim and maintain a 44.1% market share highlights its adaptability and strategic decision-making: 1. Global Strategy : Binance has strategically positioned itself in regions with high crypto adoption, such as Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, ensuring a steady influx of new users. 2. Diverse Offerings : In addition to traditional trading pairs, Binance provides staking, lending, futures, and options trading, catering to a broad spectrum of users. 3. Competitive Pricing : Binance’s low transaction fees and frequent promotional campaigns, such as trading fee discounts, keep users engaged and loyal. 4. Resilience Amid Regulatory Challenges : Despite regulatory scrutiny in certain regions, Binance has demonstrated resilience by adjusting its operations and enhancing compliance efforts, which has helped maintain user trust. The Role of Emerging Players and Trends While Coinbase and Binance dominate the centralized exchange landscape, the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and emerging competitors is reshaping the market. Impact of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) : Growing Popularity : Platforms like Uniswap and Curve are attracting users with their decentralized, permissionless trading models. Regulatory Advantages : DEXs are less susceptible to regulatory pressures, making them appealing to certain traders. Emerging Centralized Competitors : KuCoin and Bybit : These exchanges are steadily increasing their market share by offering innovative products and services. Regional Exchanges : Platforms tailored to local markets, such as WazirX in India, are carving out niche spaces. What This Means for the Crypto Ecosystem The shifting market shares of Coinbase and Binance reflect broader trends in the cryptocurrency ecosystem: 1. Increasing Competition : The market is becoming more fragmented as users seek platforms that offer the best combination of features, fees, and security. 2. Regulatory Impact : Exchanges operating in jurisdictions with unclear or restrictive regulations face greater challenges, influencing user behavior. 3. User Preferences : Traders are increasingly prioritizing low fees, fast transactions, and diverse offerings, pressuring exchanges to innovate continually. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead Both Coinbase and Binance face unique challenges as they navigate the complexities of a rapidly growing and evolving industry: Challenges for Coinbase : Restoring user trust amid regulatory scrutiny. Expanding its global presence to compete with Binance. Revising its fee structure to remain competitive. Challenges for Binance : Managing regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions. Maintaining platform security and user trust amid its rapid growth. Addressing competition from decentralized platforms and emerging centralized exchanges. Conclusion The recent data from Kaiko highlights a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency exchange market. Coinbase’s market share drop to 6.6% signals challenges in adapting to a highly competitive and evolving landscape, while Binance’s 44.1% dominance underscores its strategic strength and global appeal. As the cryptocurrency market matures, these trends offer valuable insights into how exchanges must innovate and adapt to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse user base. Whether through regulatory compliance, technological advancements, or improved user experience, the race for market dominance will continue to shape the future of digital finance.

Speaking to a captivated audience, CZ suggested that Bitcoin’s qualities as a “hard asset” make it an attractive addition to national reserves, particularly for nations looking to hedge against inflation and economic instability. This prediction aligns with recent discussions about Bitcoin’s growing role in geopolitics, including President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal for a U.S. national Bitcoin stockpile, as reported by Cointelegraph . While the concept has sparked debates, CZ’s statement adds weight to the argument that Bitcoin is poised to become a critical asset in global finance. Bitcoin as a Strategic Asset for Nations CZ’s assertion that smaller nations will lead the way in adopting Bitcoin reserves stems from Bitcoin’s unique attributes. As a decentralized and deflationary digital currency with a capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin offers a store of value that is immune to government manipulation or devaluation. Why Bitcoin Appeals to Nations : Hedge Against Inflation : With rising global inflation, Bitcoin provides a deflationary alternative to fiat currencies. Economic Sovereignty : Smaller nations can reduce reliance on foreign currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, by diversifying their reserves. Digital Transformation : Embracing Bitcoin aligns with broader trends in digitizing financial systems. Smaller Nations Paving the Way CZ believes that smaller, economically agile nations are best positioned to adopt Bitcoin reserves. These countries often face challenges like volatile currencies, limited access to global financial markets, and dependency on remittances. By integrating Bitcoin into their national reserves, they can secure economic stability and attract investment. Examples of Potential Early Adopters : El Salvador : Already recognized as a pioneer after adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Zimbabwe : Could turn to Bitcoin to combat hyperinflation and restore financial trust. Caribbean Nations : Known for embracing crypto to boost tourism and trade. China’s Potential Role in Bitcoin Adoption CZ also hinted at the possibility of China exploring Bitcoin reserves in the future. While China has historically maintained a restrictive stance on cryptocurrency, its recognition of Bitcoin as a “hard asset” could pave the way for a strategic shift. Why China Might Consider Bitcoin : Diversifying Reserves : Bitcoin could complement China’s significant gold holdings and reduce dependency on the U.S. dollar. Technological Leadership : Embracing Bitcoin could enhance China’s influence in the digital currency space. Strategic Competition : With nations like the U.S. considering Bitcoin stockpiles, China may follow suit to maintain economic parity. President-elect Trump’s Bitcoin Stockpile Proposal CZ’s prediction aligns with President-elect Donald Trump’s recent proposal to establish a U.S. national Bitcoin stockpile. The idea has sparked heated debates, with proponents arguing that it would strengthen the U.S. economy and critics warning it could artificially inflate Bitcoin prices. Key Elements of Trump’s Proposal : Strategic Asset Accumulation : Advocates see Bitcoin as a hedge against economic volatility.

37462921,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108614,1733831664,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Jetking Infotrain to Become First Indian Public Company to Buy Bitcoin,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/jetking-infotrain-to-buy-bitcoin/,"In a landmark announcement for India’s cryptocurrency landscape, Jetking Infotrain , a publicly listed IT company, revealed plans to adopt Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. As reported by U.Today on December 9, 2024, Jetking Infotrain aims to allocate a significant portion of its treasury assets to Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies . This strategic move is designed to diversify the company’s holdings and serve as a hedge against inflation. The announcement makes Jetking Infotrain the first publicly traded Indian company to embrace Bitcoin in this capacity, marking a pivotal moment for corporate adoption of cryptocurrencies in India. A Game-Changing Move in Indian Finance Jetking Infotrain’s decision to adopt Bitcoin signals a seismic shift in how Indian companies perceive digital assets. Traditionally cautious about cryptocurrencies due to regulatory uncertainties, Indian businesses have largely stayed on the sidelines of the global crypto revolution. Jetking’s move could pave the way for other publicly listed companies in India to explore Bitcoin as a viable asset class. Why This Matters : Leadership in Innovation : Jetking Infotrain is positioning itself as a pioneer in corporate crypto adoption in India. Global Alignment : The move aligns with a global trend where companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have incorporated Bitcoin into their treasuries. Inflation Hedge : Bitcoin’s limited supply makes it an attractive store of value amid inflationary pressures. Why Bitcoin? The Case for Corporate Treasury Bitcoin has emerged as a compelling asset for corporate treasuries worldwide. Companies view Bitcoin not only as a hedge against inflation but also as a means of diversifying their holdings. Key Benefits of Holding Bitcoin : Scarcity-Driven Value : Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins ensures long-term scarcity, driving its appeal as a store of value. Decentralization : Unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin is decentralized, reducing exposure to government monetary policies. Liquidity : Bitcoin’s market maturity has improved its liquidity, making it suitable for large-scale corporate transactions. Jetking Infotrain’s decision mirrors strategies adopted by global giants such as MicroStrategy , Tesla , and Square , who have all integrated Bitcoin into their financial frameworks. Jetking Infotrain: A Brief Overview Founded in 1990, Jetking Infotrain is a well-known IT training company in India, specializing in hardware and networking education. With its innovative approach to technology training, Jetking has consistently positioned itself as a forward-thinking organization. Key Milestones of Jetking Infotrain : Became a publicly listed company, reflecting its commitment to transparency and growth. Expanded its footprint across India with a strong focus on digital education. Continues to innovate by exploring emerging technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrency. The company’s decision to adopt Bitcoin reinforces its reputation as a leader in embracing cutting-edge technology. The Indian Regulatory Landscape India’s regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies has been evolving over the past few years. While the government has explored a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and issued warnings about unregulated crypto investments, it has yet to provide a comprehensive framework for cryptocurrency adoption. Key Regulatory Considerations : Taxation : Cryptocurrencies are subject to capital gains taxes, impacting corporate investments. Legal Ambiguity : The lack of clarity on crypto’s legal status in India creates potential risks for businesses. RBI’s Role : The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has historically been cautious about cryptocurrencies, though recent discussions indicate a more balanced approach. Jetking Infotrain’s move signals confidence in the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies, even amid regulatory uncertainties. The Global Context: Corporate Adoption of Bitcoin Jetking Infotrain joins a growing list of companies worldwide that have integrated Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries. Notable Examples : MicroStrategy : Holds over 180,000 BTC, making it the largest corporate Bitcoin holder. Tesla : Allocated a portion of its reserves to Bitcoin in 2021, signaling confidence in its long-term value. Block (formerly Square) : Invested in Bitcoin as part of its mission to advance financial inclusion. These companies have demonstrated that holding Bitcoin can enhance a company’s balance sheet while signaling innovation to stakeholders. Unanswered Questions About Jetking’s Bitcoin Plans While the announcement is a significant step, Jetking Infotrain has yet to disclose certain details about its Bitcoin strategy: Position Size : The company has not revealed how much Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies it plans to acquire. Timeline : There is no specific timeframe for the purchase or integration of these assets. Asset Mix : It remains unclear whether the focus will solely be on Bitcoin or include other digital assets like Ethereum or stablecoins. These unanswered questions leave room for speculation but also highlight the company’s cautious approach to rolling out its crypto strategy. Potential Risks and Rewards Adopting Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset comes with both opportunities and challenges: Potential Rewards : Hedging Inflation : Bitcoin’s scarcity-driven value offers protection against inflationary pressures. Market Leadership : Early adoption could position Jetking as a thought leader in India’s corporate sector. Global Visibility : This move could enhance Jetking’s reputation on an international stage. Potential Risks : Regulatory Uncertainty : Indian regulations could impact the company’s ability to operate freely in the crypto space. Volatility : Bitcoin’s price fluctuations could pose risks to treasury stability. Market Sentiment : Negative sentiment or market corrections could impact the value of the company’s holdings. Despite these risks, Jetking Infotrain’s decision underscores its willingness to innovate and explore emerging financial strategies. Community and Industry Reactions Jetking’s announcement has sparked significant interest within the cryptocurrency community and beyond. What Are Experts Saying? Crypto Advocates : Applaud Jetking’s move as a step toward mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin in India. Traditional Investors : Caution about the risks associated with volatility and regulatory ambiguity. Regulators : Likely to scrutinize the decision as they shape India’s crypto policies. This mixed reaction reflects the broader debate about cryptocurrency’s role in corporate finance. Conclusion Jetking Infotrain’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset marks a historic moment for India’s cryptocurrency ecosystem. As the first publicly listed Indian company to take this step, Jetking is breaking new ground, aligning with global trends, and signaling a shift in how Indian corporations view digital assets. While challenges like regulatory uncertainty and price volatility remain, the potential benefits of diversification, inflation hedging, and global visibility make this a bold and strategic move.

This drop signals the start of a correction and is likely to take BTC much lower before a recovery rally emerges. Let’s take a look at technicals, futures data and on-chain metrics to see what Bitcoin might do next. Before we step into any aspect of our analysis, let’s explore why Bitcoin crashed. Explaining December 9 Crypto Market Crash: A $1.7 Billion Liquidation Event During a raging bull run, the leverage present in the ecosystem climbs higher. This is true even in the traditional markets. With cryptocurrencies, this is dialied up to an eleven. As a result, when Bitcoin price slide 6% on late Monday, it caused altcoins to hemmorhage, triggering a flurry of liquidations due to the massive leverage. As a result of this cascade, the total liquidation reached a whopping $1.7 billion, according to data from CoinGlass . Crypto Market Liquidations Hit $1.7B on December 9 The leverage is one of the key drivers of such a massive crash and liquidation event. However, Google’s announcement of Willow, a quantum chip, could have also added some tailwind to the crash, some speculate. While Google’s new chip has made a huge step in advancing quantum chips, it is still far away from being a threat to Bitcoin’s encryption. Kevin Rose, former Google employee added, “Google’s Willow chip, while a significant advancement, comprises 105 qubits. We have a ways to go… Nonetheless, this is a remarkable leap forward in quantum computing” Bitcoin Price Analysis: Will BTC Recover? Bitcoin’s four-week upsloping consolidation ended on December 9 after a 6.35% crash. This crash, albiet small, breached the inclined trend line, signaling an end to the consolidation and a potential start to the downtrend. Currently, BTC sits on the $97,205 support level, a breakdown of which could trigger a crash to $94,875 and $92,514 support levels. While BTC has ended the four-week consoldiation, it is sitll bullish on the short-term. Howerver, a breakdown of $92,514 would flip this bias favoring bears. Regardless, investors need to keep a close eye on $90K, a key psychological level. A bounce here could trigger a recovery rally, but a failure from bulls to defend this level could trigger a steep correction to $86,621 So, will BTC recover? If the $90k to $92.5k support levels hold, Bitcoin price should kickstart a recovery rally. BTC/USDT 4-hour chart The Open Interest data shows a decline from $65 billion on December 5 to $60 billion as of December 9. If the OI does not pick up moderately, then recovery bounce is unlikely to sustain. BTC Open Interest The 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator shows that it is close to zero, suggesting that there are no unrealized profits. While this is a positive sign, it is not a great time to buy yet or expect a recovery. When the 30-day MVRV indicator dips to 6% to 13%, BTC price has reversed. BTC 30-day MVRV Hence, the Bitcoin price prediction hints that a short-term recovery is highly unlikely. The data from price chart, open interest, and on-chain metrics all suggest a similar hesitation – a BTC bounce here is not welcome. That said, investors need to be cautious not to FOMO as some altcoins are likely going to fly.

This remarkable growth was largely driven by President-elect Donald Trump’s reelection, as reported by CoinDesk , which rejuvenated investor confidence and spurred a rally across digital assets. The resurgence in the crypto market also saw trading volumes more than double, while Bitcoin ETPs (exchange-traded products) recorded $7.6 billion in net sales . Additionally, mining profitability improved as Bitcoin’s price rally outpaced hashrate growth, creating a favorable environment for miners. A Political Catalyst: Trump’s Reelection Sparks Market Optimism President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election played a pivotal role in the cryptocurrency market’s explosive growth last month. Trump’s administration has historically had a mixed stance on digital assets, but his reelection has been perceived as a signal for reduced regulatory pressure and a more pro-business environment, which has rekindled interest in crypto investments. Why Trump’s Reelection Matters to Crypto : Market Confidence : Political stability often correlates with investor confidence, encouraging risk-on behavior in alternative asset classes. Regulatory Outlook : The expectation of a business-friendly approach under Trump has led to speculation that crypto regulations may be softened or streamlined. Institutional Participation : Clearer regulatory policies could pave the way for more institutional capital to flow into the crypto market. Bitcoin Leads the Charge Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, was at the forefront of this market surge. Its price rally significantly contributed to the broader market’s growth, with Bitcoin ETPs witnessing $7.6 billion in net sales , reflecting heightened interest from institutional and retail investors alike. Key Highlights for Bitcoin in November : Price Rally : Bitcoin’s robust price growth drove market enthusiasm, setting a positive tone for altcoins. Trading Volumes : More than doubled, signaling heightened investor activity across exchanges. Mining Profitability : Improved as the price rally outpaced the growth in network hashrate, creating favorable conditions for miners. Crypto Market Cap Hits $3.3 Trillion The 45% increase in the crypto market cap represents one of the most significant monthly growth periods in 2024, bringing the total to $3.3 trillion. This milestone underscores the sector’s resilience and its ability to rebound from regulatory challenges and market downturns. What’s Behind the Growth? Institutional Inflows : Major players like asset management firms and banks increased their exposure to digital assets. Retail Enthusiasm : Renewed optimism among retail investors further boosted demand across leading cryptocurrencies. Global Adoption : Countries exploring CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) and blockchain innovations added to the positive sentiment. Improved Mining Profitability November also brought good news for Bitcoin miners. As Bitcoin’s price surged, mining profitability improved, even as the network’s hashrate continued to climb. This trend highlights the delicate balance between price dynamics and network security. Factors Driving Mining Success : Outpacing Hashrate Growth : Bitcoin’s rally outstripped the growth in computational power, enhancing miner revenue. Energy Efficiency : Advances in mining technology have reduced costs, making operations more profitable. Geopolitical Shifts : With miners relocating to more favorable jurisdictions, operational stability has improved. Altcoins Join the Rally While Bitcoin took center stage, the altcoin market also benefited from November’s bullish sentiment. Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano, among others, recorded significant price increases as investors diversified their portfolios. Top Performers : Ethereum (ETH) : Continued to gain traction due to its use in decentralized applications and its position as the leading smart contract platform. Solana (SOL) : Outpaced many competitors in terms of transaction speed and cost, attracting new projects. Cardano (ADA) : Saw increased adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi) and enterprise applications. The Role of Bitcoin ETPs in Market Growth The impressive $7.6 billion in net sales recorded by Bitcoin ETPs underscores their growing role in bridging the gap between traditional financial markets and cryptocurrencies. These products allow institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning the asset, simplifying compliance and risk management. Why Bitcoin ETPs Are Crucial : Ease of Access : Provides a familiar vehicle for traditional investors. Liquidity Boost : Increased activity in ETPs contributes to overall market liquidity. Market Maturity : Signals growing acceptance of crypto as an asset class by mainstream financial institutions. Challenges Ahead for the Crypto Market While the crypto market’s performance in November was remarkable, it’s essential to consider potential risks that could impact its trajectory: Regulatory Uncertainty : Despite Trump’s perceived pro-business stance, regulatory clarity remains a pressing issue. Market Volatility : The crypto market’s historical tendency for sharp corrections could lead to sudden price swings. Global Economic Factors : Rising interest rates or geopolitical tensions could influence investor sentiment. However, the industry’s resilience and innovation continue to position it for long-term growth. The Broader Implications of November’s Growth The 45% growth in November highlights a renewed appetite for digital assets, with implications for the broader financial ecosystem. This milestone suggests that cryptocurrencies are maturing into a significant asset class capable of attracting both retail and institutional capital. What’s Next for Crypto? Increased Adoption : More businesses and individuals are likely to integrate cryptocurrencies into their financial strategies. Technological Advancements : Innovations in blockchain technology will continue to enhance scalability and efficiency. Global Influence : Cryptocurrencies will play a central role in shaping the future of finance, commerce, and governance. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market’s 45% growth in November, reaching a record $3.3 trillion market cap, marks a pivotal moment in 2024. Bolstered by President-elect Trump’s reelection, rising trading volumes, and improved mining profitability, the crypto sector is entering a new phase of growth and adoption. While challenges like regulatory uncertainty and market volatility remain, the long-term outlook for digital assets is overwhelmingly positive. As institutional interest grows and technological advancements continue, the cryptocurrency market is well-positioned to reshape global finance in the years to come.

Tkachev sent an appeal to Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov urging an assessment of the feasibility of creating such a reserve. Arguments in Support of the Initiative The document, cited by local media, highlights Bitcoin’s potential as an alternative to traditional currency reserves. In the appeal, Tkachev addressed the finance minister, writing: “I ask you, dear Anton Germanovich, to assess the feasibility of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve in Russia by analogy with state reserves in traditional currencies. If this initiative is approved, I ask you to submit it to the government of the Russian Federation for further implementation.” His proposal outlines the challenges of reliance on traditional currencies susceptible to volatility, sanctions, and inflation. Tkachev explained that these vulnerabilities threaten Russia’s financial stability. He noted the need for innovative financial instruments, including alternative reserve assets independent of any single nation, to address modern geopolitical challenges. The report also emphasized the rising significance of cryptocurrencies in global trade. The official noted that they have become a critical tool for nations facing sanctions and limited access to traditional payment systems. He also highlighted the Central Bank of Russia’s ongoing efforts to trial cross-border crypto payments. Additionally, Tkachev pointed out Bitcoin’s performance, citing its rise to $100,000 in December 2024 as evidence of its potential as a store of value and a source of significant profits for state reserves. Putin Shows Public Support For Bitcoin The proposition follows comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who supported Bitcoin during the Investment Forum in Moscow on December 4. Putin described the cryptocurrency as an “unstoppable technology” and endorsed its potential as a global reserve asset. The president criticized the U.S. for leveraging the dollar’s dominance to enforce political agendas. He cited Western nations’ freezing of $300 billion in Russian reserves after the 2022 Ukraine war as a key factor driving countries to explore alternatives like Bitcoin. Emphasizing the resilience of digital currencies, Putin stated that no one can ban Bitcoin or other electronic payment systems, predicting their continued development as nations seek lower costs and improved reliability. This development aligns with a growing global trend of governments considering Bitcoin as a reserve asset. In the United States, recent months have seen increased interest in Bitcoin reserves following Donald Trump’s election win, with several states initiating related legislation. Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim recently announced plans to incorporate Bitcoin into the city’s investment portfolio, aiming to establish it as a crypto-friendly hub. Other international leaders, including Venezuelan opposition figure María Corina Machado and Polish presidential candidate Sławomir Mentzen, have also championed the idea of Bitcoin reserves for their respective nations.

Unlike Binance, Coinbase favors higher-market-cap tokens for long-term growth potential. Ethereum leads Coinbase’s memecoin network distribution, with diverse blockchain support. In early 2024, Coinbase surprised the market by adding seven memecoins to its listing roadmap. This move reflected a strategic shift as the platform cautiously entered a space largely dominated by risk-tolerant competitors like Binance. Coinbase’s memecoin listings this year reveal a cautious yet calculated strategy compared to Binance’s aggressive approach, aligning with its reputation as a regulated exchange while balancing innovation and compliance. Coinbase’s Cautious Take on Memecoins: Conservative Yet Calculated Coinbase has added 34 tokens to its roadmap this year, with memecoins making up roughly 20.58%.

This development was reported by Tree News on X, citing Bloomberg. This strategic acquisition reaffirms MicroStrategy’s commitment to its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy and underscores its bullish stance on cryptocurrency as a long-term investment. A Strategic Move Amid Market Fluctuations The purchase adds to MicroStrategy’s already substantial Bitcoin reserves, solidifying its dominance as the top corporate investor in the cryptocurrency sector. This move comes at a time when Bitcoin prices are fluctuating amid broader market uncertainty, reflecting the company’s unwavering confidence in the asset’s future potential. Why this matters: MicroStrategy’s acquisitions signal institutional confidence in Bitcoin. The company’s strategy could inspire other corporate entities to consider similar moves. MicroStrategy: A Bitcoin Trailblazer MicroStrategy, led by executive chairman Michael Saylor, has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin. The company began its Bitcoin acquisition journey in 2020, citing the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation and a superior store of value compared to traditional assets like cash and gold. Key Highlights of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Holdings : As of this acquisition, the company’s total Bitcoin holdings exceed 180,000 BTC. Its strategy involves purchasing Bitcoin using a combination of cash reserves and debt offerings. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings are valued at billions of dollars, making it a bellwether for corporate adoption of cryptocurrency. The Impact on Bitcoin Markets Large-scale purchases like MicroStrategy’s often have ripple effects on the cryptocurrency market: Price Stability : Significant acquisitions can temporarily stabilize or increase Bitcoin prices. Institutional Legitimacy : High-profile investments bolster Bitcoin’s image as a credible asset class. Market Confidence : Such moves may inspire confidence among retail and institutional investors alike. MicroStrategy’s Investment Strategy MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy is not merely opportunistic; it reflects a broader belief in the asset’s transformative potential. The company has consistently articulated its view of Bitcoin as digital gold and a means of preserving wealth over the long term. Key elements of MicroStrategy’s strategy : Accumulating Bitcoin during market dips. Employing debt financing to leverage its purchasing power. Advocating for regulatory clarity to foster broader adoption. Corporate Adoption of Bitcoin: A Growing Trend MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions have set a precedent for other corporations. While few companies have embraced Bitcoin as extensively, interest is growing among institutional investors seeking diversification and inflation hedges. Notable Corporate Bitcoin Holders : Tesla : Holds a significant Bitcoin reserve as part of its investment strategy. Square (Block) : Allocated funds to Bitcoin as part of its balance sheet diversification. Marathon Digital Holdings : A mining company with substantial Bitcoin reserves. Regulatory Considerations for Institutional Investors The rise in corporate Bitcoin acquisitions comes amid increased regulatory scrutiny. Companies like MicroStrategy must navigate evolving policies to ensure compliance while pursuing their crypto strategies. Regulatory challenges include : Tax implications for cryptocurrency holdings. Reporting requirements for publicly traded companies. Navigating jurisdictional differences in crypto regulations. Conclusion MicroStrategy’s acquisition of 21,550 BTC in early December highlights its unwavering commitment to Bitcoin as a cornerstone of its corporate strategy. As the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, MicroStrategy not only influences the cryptocurrency market but also sets an example for other companies considering the integration of digital assets into their portfolios.

Altcoins generally went even further into the red, and now the big three of Ethereum ($ETH), Solana ($SOL), and Binance Coin ($BNB) are about to stage their own recoveries. How far up can they go? $ETH retests huge triangle breakout Source: TradingView For the $ETH price on the weekly time frame, things are looking very good indeed. Monday’s price reversal just had the effect of forcing $ETH back for a retest of the huge triangle. This being successful, the coast would be clear for the $ETH bulls to free the price from this triangle and set off towards the all-time high. If the all-time high at $4,878 can be achieved, the next target is the 1.618 Fibonacci at $5,310. $SOL confirms bottom of channel Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $SOL shows that the price has been traversing within a descending channel. The worst point in Monday’s reversal coincided perfectly with the bottom trendline of the channel, from which the price has started its bounce. If the $SOL bulls can push the price back to the top of the channel, a breakout from this would give a measured move to around $270, depending on how long the price takes to get back to the top, and where it potentially breaks out. $SOL bull flag and retest of major horizontal support Source: TradingView On the weekly chart for $SOL, things are looking great. The Monday candle wick down has retested what is now hugely strong support at $202. Also, it can be seen that the channel is in fact a bull flag. Having just tested the bottom trendline of this bull flag, it would be likely that the price does get back to the top and break out from there. The measured move for this would be to around $340. $BNB breaks out and confirms above huge ascending triangle Source: TradingView Another wonderful chart is that of $BNB. The weekly chart shows how the price has respected the ascending trendline since all the way back to the beginning of 2018. Also, since 2021, the price has started to traverse inside a big ascending triangle, which broke out last week, and has retested this week. Fibonacci targets overhead are at $1,000, $1,500, $2,000, and $2,500. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Recent on-chain data indicated that the non-profit organization sold 100 coins for over 300,000 DAI, raising market concerns. Notably, this dumping saga, nearly a month after the last selloff was recorded, has sparked sentiments of further selloffs incoming. Meanwhile, crypto market traders and investors continue to extensively eye the crypto for further price shifts amid such market events. Ethereum Foundation Sells Again Raising Market Concerns According to recent data from Spot on Chain , the Ethereum Foundation sold 100 ETH for 374,334 DAI on December 10. Per the data, this selloff has brought the organization’s total Ethereum sales in 2024 to 4,366 coins, worth $12.21 million. Intriguingly, the average price for these selloffs was recorded as $2,796. Moreover, it’s also noteworthy that this dump occurred roughly a month after the last selloff was recorded. In conclusion, market participants remain apprehensive as the selloffs bring increased selling pressure to the crypto while the non-profit organization continues to offload it. A previous CoinGape report revealed that the Ethereum Foundation boasted $970.2 million in treasury, with the lion’s share of the firm’s crypto holdings in Ethereum. The massive holdings further raise concerns as the firm could decide to sell ahead amid a bull market, bringing further downside pressure to the asset. ETH Loses Momentum Meanwhile, ETH price today declined nearly 3% at the time of reporting and was sitting at $3,752. The crypto’s 24-hour low and high were registered as $3,525.23 and $3,944.76, respectively. Notably, the waning action comes in tandem with the Ethereum Foundation’s selloff, raising market apprehensiveness. Besides, with the broader charts indicating phenomenal gains, worth 4% and 17% monthly and weekly, market watchers speculate if further selloffs are to come as the price continues to rise. In the interim, investors also remain apprehensive over the crypto’s future movements, solidified by additional bearish market stats. A recent Ethereum price analysis by CoinGape Media indicated that the crypto braces for a drop, as pointed out by technical factors and broader chart movements.

37463251,8b03bb74-d573-44b0-ba18-cc1b48610971,1733832000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/37463251.jpeg,Crypto Daybook Americas: Banks Favor King Dollar as BTC Tug-of-War Rages,https://www.coindesk.com/daybook-us/2024/12/10/crypto-daybook-americas-banks-favor-king-dollar-as-btc-tug-of-war-rages,"By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin's bull-bear tug-of-war continues to rage, with prices recovering to over $97,000 from Monday's dip to $94,200. The slide was prompted by concern Google's new quantum-computing chip, Willow, could compromise BTC's security — a worry quickly dismissed by analysts. That leaves directional traders with little to do other than wait for the dust to settle before picking a side, as prices remain locked in Thursday's indecisive trading range . But there’s a silver lining! The turbulence has crowded out those undisciplined, overleveraged altcoin traders, as is evident from perpetual funding rates. Altcoin rates have receded closer to the center of Velo Data's heat map, which oscillates between -200% and 200%, indicating more balanced conditions than the bullish extremes of last week. Tokens like Stacks' STX even sport negative funding rates, a perfect entry point for bulls, according to pseudonymous analyst Byzantine General. ""If these rates continue to decline, it could signal the unwinding of excessive long leverage, potentially leading to a more balanced market,"" analysts at Bitfinex said, adding that $100,000 is no longer the key support/resistance level and a new equilibrium is probably forming in spot markets. That said, as we look toward the end of 2024, there’s a developing story: Banks are getting bullish on the dollar, which doesn’t usually bode well for assets denominated in the U.S. currency, like BTC and risk assets. ""The combination of cyclical, fiscal, and U.S. political forces is making the USD stronger again,"" HSBC said recently. ""We update our USD bullish view further; the USD bubble is re-inflating, which spells trouble ahead for many other currencies."" Citibank sees the dollar index (DXY) rallying to 115, an 8% increase. Keep an eye on the Far East too. A renewed rally in Chinese stocks following Beijing's promise of more stimulus could suck capital from other markets, including cryptocurrencies. Amid all this, there's talk President-elect Trump may struggle to deliver his crypto promises. Peter Tschir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities, put it best: ""Trump does have loyalty to those who helped fund his campaign, but I don't see this as a lasting relationship, especially as he will likely get a lot of pressure from the National Security element of D.C. to be cautious on helping crypto too much."" After all, it's one thing to promise big from Mar-a-Lago and a different ball game when delivering from the White House. Stay Alert!

Various tokens themed after, or claiming to use, quantum computing within their technology stack jumped more than 100% in the past 24 hours after internet giant Google unveiled Willow, a quantum-computing chip that took 5 minutes to solve tasks during its testing period that would have taken 10 septillion years for current supercomputers to finish. Crypto markets took a hit after the announcement on concerns the development was long-term bearish for bitcoin and other blockchains, whose security features can, in theory, be exploited by quantum computers.But while the entire market dropped, tokens such as Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL), Quantum Network, Quantum Swap, among others, zoomed higher.Quantum-resistant or post-quantum tokens aim to use cryptographic algorithms believed to be secure against quantum computing attacks. These algorithms are designed to resist attacks using Shor’s algorithm, which is particularly effective against current public-key cryptosystems. Tokens labeled with ""quantum"" might be perceived as being at the forefront of technology, even if their actual utility or relation to quantum computing is minimal. This perception can drive investment — and a chance to speculate on the short-term trading narrative. Derivatives Positioning Perpetual funding rates in DINO coins have normalized as Monday's price drop triggered a decent leverage washout. ETH's implied volatility term structure remains in backwardation, pointing to higher near-term volatility. A notable BTC options trade included a long position in the $150,000 strike call expiring in March.

Crypto researchers, including Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin, emphasize the urgency of developing quantum-resistant algorithms. Oil Prices Ease, but Geopolitical Risk and China Policy Stance Check Losses (CNBC): Oil prices eased slightly on Tuesday but retained earlier gains, driven by geopolitical risks after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s fall and optimism around China’s plans for economic stimulus.

Layer 1 giants Avalanche and Solana hold promise, but Rollblock steals the spotlight with potential 50x gains in 2025 Table of Contents Avalanche Etna upgrade looks bullish for December Solana dips as Pump.Fun pulls the plug on streaming Rollblock tokens selling at a breakneck pace Layer one chains such as Avalanche and Solana will likely give incredible returns during 2025. However, the brand-new web3 casino platform Rollblock (RBLK) looks likely to outperform the market as experts predict astonishing 50x moves from current levels. Let’s find out why. Avalanche Etna upgrade looks bullish for December Avalanche has gained 1.3% today to reach $49.5 after a recent spike to $53.8 was met with fierce selling from Avalanche whales. There has been a 13% surge in on-chain activity for Avalanche in the last 24 hours, with Avalanche volume hitting $2.6 billion across exchanges. If Avalanche can flip the key psychological level of $50 to support in the days ahead, then a run to the yearly highs of $65 looks likely during Q1. The Etna Avalanche upgrade is due to go live on the Avalanche mainnet on December 16, representing the most significant upgrade to the Avalanche chain since 2020. This should be a hugely bullish catalyst for Avalanche price action, assuming that the Avalanche 9000 roadmap goes according to plan. Solana dips as Pump.Fun pulls the plug on streaming Solana has fallen by 3.2% today as the Solana price scrambles for support at $218. Over the past week, Solana has lost over 4%, while the monthly candle still looks green with 15% gains. This week the Pump.Fun launchpad on Solana has had to suspend its live streaming feature after a series of controversial meme coin launches. This has resulted in a wave of selling within the Solana ecosystem and could see the Solana price fall to test support at $200 in the weeks ahead.

Rollblock uses the immutable Ethereum blockchain to guarantee that all transactions stand as intended and that there can be no bet manipulation, a major pain point for this $450 billion industry. Rollblock has recently launched a hugely popular sports betting feature, which allows pundits to place a huge variety of bets across all major sporting tournaments. This will further boost Rollblock revenue, which is already rising exponentially thanks to the massive range of 7,000 casino table games already live on the platform. As demand for RBLK ramps up, the supply is set to decline rapidly thanks to Rollblock’s smart revenue-sharing scheme. This will result in masses of RBLK tokens being taken off the market each week using Rollblock profits, as 60% of these tokens are then burned from the supply and the remaining coins are allocated to stakers within the community. Stage 9 coins are selling fast at the presale discount of $0.041. For more information, visit the Rollblock presale website and join the online community.

The world we operate in is rapidly changing, and businesses are having to adapt swiftly. Following the global pandemic, many enterprise businesses were forced to look domestically as supply chains were hit and international trade became more challenging. This has been compounded by geo-political tensions, which have been impacting global supply chains. However, many supply chains have started to open up and are becoming increasingly strong as new technology unlocks borders, both physically and metaphorically. You might also like: Collaborative infrastructure is the only way for DeFi-TradFi cooperation | Opinion Despite this, one consistent ‘thorn in the side’ issue for finance teams is that of cross-border payments. Moving any amount of money safely and quickly to different parts of the world without being hit with excessive fees is a challenge that’s been well-documented from a consumer perspective. The issues are compounded when the size and complexity of the transaction multiplies for enterprises. However, there is a solution here. Digital currencies powered by blockchain technology are poised to revolutionize B2B interactions on a global scale and have the ability to remove those cross-border payment problems for businesses. They will offer the ability to pay 24/7, 365 days, all around the world in a secure manner with low fees. At the start of October, the online payment giant PayPal used SAP’s new Digital Currency Hub to pay an invoice to Ernst & Young using its stablecoin PayPal USD ( PYUSD ). Examples like this show the increasing adoption of digital currencies and blockchain technology by global firms, with cross-border payments being a tangible use case. The challenges for enterprise businesses Legacy infrastructure supporting cross-border transactions can be cumbersome, expensive and full of compliance challenges. Enterprises of all sizes feel this pressure acutely, and digital currencies can solve many of the problems that these enterprises face. When I speak to our clients, it’s clear how digital currency payments can help them. The big three challenges most frequently referenced are: Speed and accessibility: Traditional payments can take place only during banking hours, and customers need to be mindful of closing times. Also, they take up to several days to settle—especially when complex in nature or of a high value. In contrast, transactions made with digital currencies can be executed almost instantaneously. This speed is particularly important for large enterprises needing to move high amounts of money cross-border on a weekend, for example, to complete an M&A transaction. Cost efficiency: Enterprises often face high transaction fees and unfavorable exchange rates when engaging in international trade. These costs can accumulate quickly, impacting profitability. Digital currencies can significantly reduce transaction fees, as they eliminate the need for multiple intermediaries. Regulatory compliance: Globally, we’re seeing increasingly complex regulatory environments. Navigating multiple different geographies compounds this issue. Digital currencies can enhance transparency and traceability, making it easier for enterprises to comply with local and international regulations. Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides a reliable audit trail, facilitating compliance and reducing the risk of fraud. Efficiencies and savings for enterprise businesses If the three challenges listed above are solved through blockchain technology and digital currencies, enterprise businesses can streamline operations significantly—with clear cost savings. But the benefits go so much broader too: Improved cash flow management: Faster transactions lead to better cash flow management. Enterprises can receive payments in real time, enhancing liquidity and allowing for more strategic investments and operational flexibility. Ability to establish new business models: With significantly lower costs, especially for smaller payments, enterprises can establish new consumption or subscription-based business models involving more frequent invoicing with lower payment amounts, thus allowing them to differentiate their offerings. Reduced fraud risk: Fraud and cybercrime are significant risks in cross-border transactions. Blockchain’s decentralized nature ensures that no single entity has control over the entire system. Each transaction is recorded on a public ledger and cannot be reverted, so fraudulent chargebacks are impossible. Looking to the future—how do we get there? The points I’ve listed above provide only a snapshot of why I believe we’ll start seeing more and more enterprise B2B payments take place on the blockchain with stablecoins. The savings, operational efficiency, and security benefits combined are too much to ignore. However, there’s still a long way to go before blockchain-enabled enterprise stablecoin payments become the norm. To realize the full potential of blockchain in B2B cross-border transactions, enterprises must take deliberate steps to integrate this technology into their operations. The first step towards this future is for leaders to educate their teams about the benefits and functionalities of blockchain technology and digital currencies, particularly stablecoins. This understanding will facilitate smoother transitions and greater buy-in internally. Before full-scale implementation, enterprises should conduct pilot projects to test payments with stablecoins in controlled environments. This approach allows organizations to identify challenges and gauge the technology’s effectiveness for their particular use cases. Partnering with crypto custody providers and exchanges, as well as business application providers, can help businesses navigate any integration issues and provide valuable expertise and resources. I believe the future of B2B cross-border enterprise transactions is undeniably intertwined with blockchain technology. As we move forward, the call to action is clear: enterprises should consider evolving their financial strategies and utilizing the power of the blockchain and stablecoins for payments. The benefits are significant. Read more: Digital asset investors embrace a bullish optimism | Opinion Author: Cedric Bru Cedric Bru is the CEO of Taulia.

This substantial growth has spurred many bullish predictions for the digital asset. Despite the significant recent gains, many analysts believe the asset still has considerable room for further expansion. The current market dynamics suggest a complex environment that could potentially support additional price appreciation, and many analysts are targeting new all-time highs. Love it or hate it, the #XRP explosion will begin unexpectedly. pic.twitter.com/4GBCI0YD1q — Amonyx (@amonbuy) December 8, 2024 How High Can XRP Go? Amonyx (@amonbuy), a well-respected crypto analyst on X, recently shared insights into XRP’s potential. He highlighted a long-term consolidation pattern that could bring substantial gains. He attached a chart showing that XRP has been consolidating for seven years, an unprecedented length in the crypto market. This consolidation phase began after XRP hit its all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018, and many prominent analysts have pointed to similar extended consolidation phases . The current price movements suggest that breaking out of this established range could signal a significant breakthrough for the cryptocurrency. Amonyx expects the surge following this extended consolidation to shock the market. He stated on X, “Love it or hate it, the #XRP explosion will begin unexpectedly.” Although Amonyx did not provide a specific target, his chart suggests that the digital asset could reach double digits. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other Experts Predict Huge Surge for XRP BarriC (@B_arri_C) provided a deeper dive into XRP’s potential trajectory. He believes the asset is gearing up for a massive run, and expects it to climb from $2.5 to $10, and eventually hit $20. The digital asset is currently trading at $2.24 after a decline from yesterday, but it is still showing bullish signs and could reverse its trajectory soon. BarriC also listed a few factors that could lead to higher prices than $20. First of these is the successful launch of a BlackRock XRP ETF. Multiple asset managers have applied for XRP ETFs . BlackRock has not officially submitted an application, but as the world’s largest asset manager, a BlackRock XRP ETF could be the biggest in the market, and give the asset the boost it needs to surpass $20. Following the current cycle, BarriC believes utility will help XRP keep growing. XRP powers Ripple’s vast network and provides cheap and efficient cross-border payments. With its growing adoption, XRP’s utility and popularity are rising. He believes utility can help the digital asset reach triple digits after the current cycle.

This reading confirms that the market remains in an Altcoin Season , a period characterized by altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. The index measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) over the past 90 days. For the market to qualify as an Altcoin Season , at least 75% of these coins must have outperformed Bitcoin. With a score of 66, the market is solidly in altcoin territory, reflecting strong momentum across a diverse range of assets. What Is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a sentiment and performance indicator that tracks the relative strength of altcoins compared to Bitcoin. The index ranges from 1 to 100 : 1-25 : Signals Bitcoin Season , where Bitcoin significantly outperforms most altcoins. 26-74 : Represents a mixed or neutral market with no clear dominance. 75-100 : Denotes Altcoin Season , where most altcoins outperform Bitcoin. Calculation Methodology The index is calculated by evaluating the performance of the top 100 coins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) on CoinMarketCap over the past 90 days. The metric provides a daily snapshot of market sentiment, offering traders insights into shifting trends. Implications of an Altcoin Season The Altcoin Season Index hitting 66 indicates that altcoins are gaining significant traction relative to Bitcoin. This shift in momentum carries several implications for the cryptocurrency market: 1. Increased Market Diversification Altcoin Season reflects a growing appetite among traders for assets beyond Bitcoin, often driven by unique use cases or technological advancements in the altcoin space. 2. Opportunity for Gains Historically, altcoin rallies have delivered higher percentage returns than Bitcoin during bullish periods, offering traders opportunities for significant gains. 3. Risk of Overextension While the potential for profit is high, altcoins are typically more volatile than Bitcoin. Traders should remain cautious of rapid market reversals. Factors Driving the Current Altcoin Season Several key factors contribute to the ongoing Altcoin Season, as reflected by the rising index: 1. DeFi and GameFi Growth Altcoins powering decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and blockchain-based gaming ecosystems have seen increased adoption, driving their outperformance. 2. Layer-2 and Interoperability Solutions Projects focusing on scalability and cross-chain compatibility, such as Polygon (MATIC) and Cosmos (ATOM), are gaining traction, bolstering altcoin performance. 3. Institutional Interest Growing institutional involvement in cryptocurrencies extends beyond Bitcoin, with funds and firms exploring altcoins for diversification. 4. Social Media Hype Social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit have played a pivotal role in promoting niche altcoins, amplifying their visibility and price action. How Altcoin Season Affects Market Participants The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool for traders and investors seeking to navigate shifting market conditions. 1. For Retail Traders Altcoin Season often attracts retail investors looking for high returns in emerging projects. However, the increased volatility of altcoins requires careful risk management. 2. For Institutional Investors Institutions may use Altcoin Season to explore assets with specific utilities or long-term potential, balancing risk with strategic diversification. 3. For Developers and Projects The heightened interest in altcoins during this period can drive attention and capital to blockchain projects, accelerating their development and adoption. Historical Trends: Lessons from Previous Altcoin Seasons Analyzing past Altcoin Seasons provides valuable context for understanding the current market dynamics: 2017 Altcoin Boom Catalyst : The ICO (Initial Coin Offering) frenzy drove massive interest in altcoins. Outcome : Many altcoins outperformed Bitcoin but faced severe corrections during the subsequent bear market. 2021 Altcoin Rally Catalyst : The rise of DeFi, NFTs, and smart contract platforms like Ethereum. Outcome : Altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) achieved significant gains, but volatility remained a risk. Current Trends (2024) Focus : Layer-2 solutions, interoperability, and real-world applications dominate the altcoin narrative. Opportunity : A more mature market and institutional interest may provide greater stability compared to previous cycles. Strategies for Navigating Altcoin Season While Altcoin Season presents opportunities for traders, it also requires a strategic approach to mitigate risks: 1. Focus on Fundamentals Invest in projects with strong use cases, robust development teams, and active communities. Avoid speculative coins with unclear value propositions. 2. Diversify Your Portfolio Spread investments across multiple altcoins to reduce the risk of overexposure to a single asset. Include a mix of large-cap and emerging coins. 3. Monitor Bitcoin’s Performance Bitcoin’s dominance remains a key indicator of market trends. A sudden rise in Bitcoin dominance could signal the end of Altcoin Season. 4. Use Stop-Loss Orders Implement stop-loss orders to protect against sudden downturns, especially in highly volatile altcoins. 5. Stay Informed Leverage tools like the Altcoin Season Index and market analytics platforms to stay ahead of trends. Potential Risks of Altcoin Season Despite the opportunities, traders should remain aware of the risks associated with Altcoin Season: 1. High Volatility Altcoins are more susceptible to sharp price swings, which can lead to significant losses for unprepared traders. 2. Market Overextension An extended Altcoin Season can result in inflated valuations, increasing the likelihood of a market correction. 3. Rug Pulls and Scams The altcoin market often attracts bad actors during bullish phases. Conduct thorough due diligence before investing in lesser-known projects. The Road Ahead: Will the Index Continue to Rise? The Altcoin Season Index’s current level of 66 suggests strong momentum for altcoins, but its trajectory will depend on several factors: Bitcoin Dominance : A sustained decrease in Bitcoin’s market share could fuel further altcoin gains. Macroeconomic Conditions : Global economic stability and regulatory clarity will influence market sentiment. Technological Developments : Breakthroughs in blockchain scalability, interoperability, and adoption could sustain altcoin performance. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s rise to 66 confirms a period of strong momentum for altcoins, reflecting increasing interest and outperformance relative to Bitcoin. For traders and investors, this period presents a wealth of opportunities but also demands caution and strategic planning to navigate its inherent risks. By understanding the factors driving Altcoin Season and employing sound strategies, market participants can position themselves to capitalize on the current trends while mitigating potential downsides.

Bullish Price Action Bitcoin’s sustained rally and strong performance from leading altcoins have reinforced positive sentiment. 2. Institutional Interest Frequent large Bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges like Coinbase, as noted in recent market analyses, highlight rising institutional activity. 3. Market Liquidity Higher trading volumes and increased capital inflows into cryptocurrency markets suggest robust engagement. 4. Broader Economic Trends Macroeconomic uncertainties, such as inflation concerns, have driven demand for decentralized and deflationary assets like Bitcoin. Strategies for Navigating Extreme Greed While the current sentiment is bullish, traders must adopt strategies to manage the inherent risks of an overheated market: 1. Avoid Emotional Decisions Resist the temptation to chase prices based on fear of missing out (FOMO). Stick to a well-defined trading plan with clear entry and exit points. 2. Diversify Holdings Avoid overexposure to a single asset or sector. Consider balancing high-risk crypto investments with more stable assets. 3. Monitor Key Indicators Keep an eye on volatility metrics and market momentum to anticipate potential reversals. Use tools like moving averages and RSI (Relative Strength Index) to identify overbought conditions. 4. Take Profits Strategically Lock in gains incrementally to reduce exposure during volatile periods. Reinvest profits into long-term conviction positions. Implications for Retail and Institutional Investors For Retail Traders : The index serves as a valuable tool for gauging market sentiment and making informed decisions. Extreme greed readings should prompt caution, particularly for new investors. For Institutions : Positive sentiment can signal opportunities for strategic accumulation during bullish phases. However, institutions must also be mindful of potential market corrections, ensuring risk is managed effectively. Potential Triggers for Sentiment Shift While the market remains in ‘Extreme Greed,’ certain events could prompt a change in sentiment: 1. Regulatory Announcements New crypto regulations or enforcement actions could dampen enthusiasm. 2. Macroeconomic Changes Shifts in interest rates or global economic conditions may affect risk appetite. 3. Market Corrections Significant price drops in Bitcoin or other leading assets could quickly reverse sentiment. The Broader Role of Sentiment Analysis in Crypto Tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offer valuable insights into market psychology, complementing technical and fundamental analysis. By understanding sentiment trends, traders can better anticipate market movements and adjust their strategies accordingly. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index remaining at 78 underscores the market’s current state of ‘Extreme Greed,’ reflecting strong optimism among participants. While this sentiment aligns with bullish price action and growing institutional interest, it also serves as a cautionary signal for potential overheating. By leveraging tools like the index, maintaining disciplined trading strategies, and staying informed about market developments, investors can navigate these conditions effectively. As the crypto market continues to evolve, sentiment analysis will remain a key component in understanding and predicting its dynamic behavior.

37463284,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108628,1733832417,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Analyst: Large Bitcoin Withdrawals Indicate Growing Institutional Interest,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/institutional-interest-in-bitcoin/,"A recent report by CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci highlights an intriguing development in the cryptocurrency market: 8,455 Bitcoin was withdrawn from Coinbase in a single block on December 9, 2024. This significant movement, which translates to over $280 million at current prices, points to rising institutional interest in Bitcoin, according to Kesmeci. The analyst speculates that such transactions may be linked to major players like BlackRock , potentially fulfilling spot Bitcoin ETF requirements, or companies like MicroStrategy , known for their strategic Bitcoin acquisitions. Regardless of Bitcoin’s price movements, frequent large-scale withdrawals are a strong indicator of sustained institutional activity in the cryptocurrency space. Rising Institutional Activity in the Bitcoin Market Institutional interest in Bitcoin has been a growing trend over the past few years, and the latest Coinbase withdrawal is yet another sign of this momentum. Key Highlights from the CryptoQuant Analysis : Large-Scale Movement : The 8,455 Bitcoin withdrawal is one of the largest single-block transfers observed recently. Potential ETF Link : The movement aligns with speculation about institutional preparations for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Consistent Pattern : Similar large withdrawals have been observed in recent weeks, further supporting the idea of sustained institutional accumulation. Institutional Players Driving the Trend 1. Spot Bitcoin ETFs and BlackRock’s Role The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has been a pivotal development for institutional adoption. Companies like BlackRock , the world’s largest asset manager, are at the forefront of this trend. Why ETFs Matter : Spot Bitcoin ETFs enable traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of directly holding the asset. Speculative Link : The large Coinbase withdrawal may represent preparations for fulfilling ETF demand, given the surge in interest from institutional clients. 2. MicroStrategy’s Strategic Buys MicroStrategy , a business intelligence firm led by Michael Saylor, has become synonymous with Bitcoin accumulation. With holdings exceeding 180,000 BTC , the company remains a key player in the institutional adoption narrative. Potential Connection : Kesmeci speculates that the recent withdrawal could be tied to another MicroStrategy purchase, aligning with the company’s long-term strategy of adding to its Bitcoin reserves. Why Institutional Interest Is Significant The increasing involvement of institutional investors in Bitcoin is reshaping the market in profound ways: 1. Enhancing Legitimacy Institutional participation validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, encouraging broader acceptance among traditional investors. 2. Stabilizing Market Dynamics Large institutional holdings can reduce volatility over time by introducing a more predictable supply-and-demand structure. 3. Driving Innovation The entry of institutions has spurred the development of new financial products, such as ETFs, custody solutions, and derivatives, further maturing the market. Indicators of Institutional Activity Large Bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges like Coinbase are one of several indicators pointing to rising institutional activity: 1. Exchange Outflows Significant outflows often suggest accumulation by entities that intend to hold Bitcoin long-term, rather than trade it on exchanges. 2. OTC Desk Activity Institutional investors often rely on over-the-counter (OTC) desks for large transactions to minimize market impact, aligning with the observed patterns of reduced exchange liquidity. 3. Wallet Consolidation The movement of Bitcoin into high-security, cold storage wallets is another sign of long-term institutional commitment. Implications for the Crypto Market The rising interest from institutional players carries several implications for the broader cryptocurrency market: 1. Price Stability Frequent large withdrawals suggest a growing preference for long-term holding, which could reduce selling pressure and stabilize prices. 2. Increased Liquidity With more institutional products, such as ETFs, entering the market, liquidity is likely to improve, making Bitcoin more accessible to a wider range of investors. 3. Heightened Competition The entry of major financial institutions introduces competition in the crypto ecosystem, driving innovation and better services for retail and institutional clients alike. Challenges and Risks Despite the positive outlook, the rising institutional interest in Bitcoin is not without its challenges: 1. Regulatory Uncertainty Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, creating potential roadblocks for institutional adoption. 2. Concentration of Holdings Large-scale accumulation by institutions could lead to centralization, potentially undermining Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos. 3. Market Manipulation The significant influence of institutional players raises concerns about potential market manipulation, particularly if holdings become overly concentrated. What This Means for Retail Investors For retail investors, the growing presence of institutions in the Bitcoin market presents both opportunities and challenges: Opportunities : Enhanced market credibility and adoption. Development of accessible financial products like ETFs. Potential for reduced volatility in the long term. Challenges : Increased competition for Bitcoin supply. Possible centralization of market influence. Expert Reactions to the Coinbase Withdrawal The crypto community and analysts have reacted to the CryptoQuant report with a mix of enthusiasm and caution: Proponents of Institutional Adoption : Validation of Bitcoin : View the trend as a sign of Bitcoin’s maturation into a mainstream asset. Market Growth Potential : Highlight the potential for increased liquidity and broader adoption. Skeptics : Centralization Risks : Warn about the long-term implications of Bitcoin ownership concentrating in institutional hands. Market Manipulation : Raise concerns about the influence large players could wield over market dynamics. Conclusion The recent withdrawal of 8,455 Bitcoin from Coinbase , as highlighted by CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci, underscores the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Whether linked to ETF demand or strategic corporate acquisitions, this trend reflects a significant shift in how major players view and interact with cryptocurrency. As institutions continue to integrate Bitcoin into their portfolios, the market is likely to experience greater stability, increased legitimacy, and broader adoption. However, these developments also bring challenges, such as regulatory uncertainty and the risk of centralization. For retail investors, the key lies in understanding these dynamics and positioning themselves to benefit from the evolving landscape.

37463340,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108626,1733832471,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Russian Lawmaker Proposes National Bitcoin Reserve to Counter Sanctions,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/russia-proposes-national-bitcoin-reserve/,"In a groundbreaking proposal, Anton Tkachev , a member of Russia’s State Duma, has called for the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve . The initiative aims to mitigate the economic impact of international sanctions and enhance Russia’s financial stability. Highlighting Bitcoin’s role as a resilient store of value and a potential tool for international trade, Tkachev’s proposal could mark a significant shift in Russia’s approach to cryptocurrency. As reported by Crypto Briefing on December 10, 2024, the move aligns with the Central Bank of Russia’s (CBR) ongoing efforts to integrate digital assets into cross-border payment systems. However, implementing such a policy would require substantial collaboration among financial regulators, government agencies, and policymakers. The Motivation Behind a National Bitcoin Reserve Russia’s push for a national Bitcoin reserve comes amid increasing geopolitical and economic challenges, including restricted access to global payment systems due to sanctions. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and its utility in facilitating international trade have made it an attractive option for countries seeking alternatives to traditional financial infrastructure. Why Bitcoin? Store of Value : Bitcoin’s fixed supply and deflationary nature make it a reliable hedge against currency devaluation. Decentralization : As a decentralized digital currency, Bitcoin operates independently of central banks or governments, reducing vulnerabilities to sanctions. Utility in Trade : Bitcoin can facilitate cross-border transactions without reliance on SWIFT or other centralized payment systems. Russia’s Growing Interest in Digital Assets This proposal is not an isolated development. It reflects a broader trend in Russia’s evolving stance toward cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology: 1. Cross-Border Payment Systems The Central Bank of Russia has been actively exploring the use of digital assets to enable cross-border payments. This effort aims to bypass international sanctions and maintain trade relationships with partner nations. 2. National Cryptocurrency Developments Russia has also been developing its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) , the digital ruble , to enhance its financial infrastructure and reduce reliance on foreign currencies. 3. Legal and Regulatory Progress Recent legislative efforts have focused on creating a clearer regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, signaling a gradual acceptance of digital assets within Russia’s financial system. Challenges in Implementing a National Bitcoin Reserve While the proposal offers significant advantages, establishing a national Bitcoin reserve would not be without challenges: 1. Policy and Regulatory Adjustments Russia’s current cryptocurrency regulations restrict certain activities, such as using crypto as a means of payment. Introducing a Bitcoin reserve would require policy changes to accommodate its use in government-level transactions. 2. Coordination Among Agencies The successful implementation of the proposal would require seamless coordination between the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance, and other regulatory bodies. 3. Price Volatility Bitcoin’s price volatility could pose risks to financial stability if not managed carefully. Developing mechanisms to mitigate these risks would be critical. 4. International Scrutiny Adopting Bitcoin as a national reserve asset could attract further scrutiny from countries already imposing sanctions on Russia, potentially escalating geopolitical tensions. Global Implications of Russia’s Proposal If Russia establishes a national Bitcoin reserve, it would represent a significant milestone in the global adoption of cryptocurrency as a sovereign asset. Potential Global Impacts : Legitimizing Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset : Russia’s adoption could encourage other nations to consider Bitcoin for their reserves. Shifting Geopolitical Dynamics : Countries facing similar sanctions, such as Iran or Venezuela, may follow suit, leveraging Bitcoin to circumvent financial restrictions. Increased Demand : A national Bitcoin reserve would likely increase demand for the cryptocurrency, potentially driving prices higher. Comparisons to Other Nations’ Crypto Strategies Russia’s interest in Bitcoin as a reserve asset is part of a broader trend of national governments exploring cryptocurrencies for financial resilience: 1. El Salvador El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, using it to boost financial inclusion and reduce remittance costs. 2. Iran Iran has used Bitcoin mining to monetize its energy resources, enabling cross-border transactions despite sanctions. 3. China Although China has banned cryptocurrency trading, it is heavily invested in blockchain technology and has launched a digital yuan to modernize its financial system. Expert Opinions on the Proposal The proposal has sparked mixed reactions from experts and stakeholders: Supporters : Argue that a Bitcoin reserve could enhance financial sovereignty and reduce dependency on traditional financial systems. Highlight Bitcoin’s potential to act as a hedge against sanctions and economic instability. Critics : Warn about the risks of price volatility and its impact on financial stability. Raise concerns about the lack of global consensus on cryptocurrency regulations, which could complicate implementation. Neutral Observers : Emphasize the need for comprehensive research and strategic planning to ensure the proposal’s success. How a Bitcoin Reserve Could Benefit Russia Despite the challenges, a national Bitcoin reserve could offer several strategic advantages for Russia: 1. Sanction Mitigation By leveraging Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, Russia could bypass traditional financial networks and continue international trade without reliance on SWIFT or other centralized systems. 2. Diversification of Reserves Adding Bitcoin to its reserves would diversify Russia’s financial assets, reducing exposure to traditional fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. 3. Encouraging Innovation Adopting Bitcoin at the national level could stimulate growth in Russia’s blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors, attracting talent and investment. Steps Toward Implementation To establish a national Bitcoin reserve, Russia would need to take several key steps: 1. Legislative Reforms Amend existing laws to allow government entities to hold and use Bitcoin for strategic purposes. 2. Infrastructure Development Build secure custody solutions for storing Bitcoin reserves and integrating them into the financial system. 3. Risk Management Frameworks Develop strategies to mitigate price volatility and ensure the stability of reserve assets. 4. International Collaboration Work with allied nations to create a cooperative framework for using cryptocurrencies in international trade. Community and Industry Reactions The crypto community has shown keen interest in the proposal, with many viewing it as a significant step toward mainstream adoption of Bitcoin: What Industry Leaders Are Saying : Proponents : Applaud the proposal as a bold move that showcases Bitcoin’s potential as a sovereign asset. Skeptics : Caution against the risks of relying on a volatile asset for national reserves. Neutral Analysts : Highlight the importance of careful planning and international dialogue to ensure the proposal’s success. Conclusion Anton Tkachev’s proposal for a national Bitcoin reserve marks a bold and innovative approach to addressing the economic challenges posed by sanctions and financial instability. By leveraging Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and utility in international trade, Russia could strengthen its financial sovereignty and pave the way for broader adoption of digital assets at the national level. While the proposal faces challenges such as regulatory hurdles, price volatility, and international scrutiny, its potential benefits make it a compelling option for Russia and other nations exploring cryptocurrency as a strategic asset.

37463379,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108624,1733832587,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,10x Research: Signs of Weak Cryptocurrency Market Momentum Signal Short-Term Consolidation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cryptocurrency-market-momentum-weakening/,"The cryptocurrency market, often characterized by dramatic price swings and high volatility, is currently exhibiting signs of weakening momentum. According to a report from 10x Research , shared by CoinDesk on December 10, 2024, this slowdown is likely part of a short-term consolidation phase rather than a bearish reversal. The report identifies several symptoms of this slowdown, including declining trading volumes and profit-taking by long-term holders . However, it also presents an optimistic outlook, suggesting that this period of consolidation is a healthy reset for the market, setting the stage for future growth. Markus Thielen , CEO of 10x Research, emphasizes that traders should seize this opportunity to evaluate their portfolios, focusing on outperforming assets and avoiding weaker market segments. This detailed article unpacks the findings of 10x Research, explores the causes and implications of a consolidation phase, and provides actionable strategies for navigating this transitional period in the cryptocurrency market. What Does Weak Market Momentum Look Like? The cryptocurrency market’s current behavior shows several key indicators of slowing momentum: 1. Declining Trading Volumes Trading volumes, a critical measure of market activity and liquidity, have been on a downward trend across major exchanges. Lower volumes often signify reduced investor engagement, leading to slower price movements and a lack of clear directional trends. 2. Profit-Taking by Long-Term Holders Long-term holders, who typically weather market volatility, are now locking in profits after an extended bull run. This selling pressure contributes to short-term price stagnation, as fresh buying interest is required to absorb these sales and push prices higher. 3. Sector-Specific Weakness Certain segments of the crypto market, particularly smaller or speculative altcoins, are underperforming relative to blue-chip assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This disparity highlights the importance of discerning between strong and weak positions during periods of consolidation. Understanding Market Consolidation According to 10x Research, the current slowdown is part of a consolidation phase , a common phenomenon in financial markets following periods of significant price appreciation. What Is Market Consolidation? Consolidation occurs when asset prices trade within a relatively narrow range, reflecting a temporary equilibrium between buying and selling pressure. Rather than a sign of weakness, consolidation often precedes the next major market move. Why Consolidation Is Beneficial : Profit-Taking Stabilizes Markets : Consolidation allows for healthy profit-taking, reducing the risk of sharp corrections. Position Re-Evaluation : Traders and investors can assess their portfolios, identify strong assets, and exit weaker positions. Foundation for Growth : This phase often lays the groundwork for the next bullish leg, particularly for assets with strong fundamentals. Historical Context: How Consolidation Has Played Out Before Consolidation phases are not new to the cryptocurrency market. They have occurred during previous bull runs and have often served as launching pads for future growth. Case Study: Bitcoin in 2021 Rally : Bitcoin experienced a massive rally in early 2021, reaching new all-time highs. Consolidation : A mid-year slowdown saw prices stabilize, with Bitcoin trading within a narrow range for several months. Recovery : The market eventually regained momentum, pushing Bitcoin to record-breaking levels by the end of the year. This cyclical behavior demonstrates the importance of viewing consolidation as a natural and often necessary part of market dynamics. Why Momentum Weakens in Bull Markets Even during extended bull markets, periods of reduced momentum are inevitable. These slowdowns are often triggered by a combination of internal and external factors: 1. Profit-Taking After sustained price increases, many investors choose to lock in gains, creating selling pressure that slows upward momentum. 2. Market Fatigue High-intensity trading during rallies can lead to temporary exhaustion among market participants, reducing overall activity. 3. Macro Events Regulatory developments, economic data releases, or geopolitical tensions can influence market sentiment, prompting a cautious approach among traders. The Role of Trading Volume in Market Analysis Trading volume is a crucial metric for gauging market health. The current decline in volumes signals hesitation among traders and investors. Why Trading Volume Matters : Indicates Interest : Higher volumes reflect active participation and robust demand for assets. Supports Price Movements : Sustained upward trends require strong volume to confirm legitimacy. Detects Reversals : A sudden drop in volume can indicate a potential shift in market sentiment. By monitoring volume trends, traders can gain valuable insights into the market’s underlying strength or weakness. 10x Research’s Strategic Recommendations Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research, offers actionable advice for traders navigating this period of consolidation: 1. Focus on Core Positions Traders should prioritize assets with proven track records and strong fundamentals. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other leading cryptocurrencies are often considered safer bets during uncertain times. 2. Identify Outperforming Assets Pay attention to which assets are holding their value or gaining during the slowdown. These positions are likely to lead the market when momentum returns. 3. Avoid Weak Segments Minimize exposure to speculative or underperforming tokens that are more vulnerable to further declines during consolidation phases. 4. Stay Updated Leverage reliable market analysis tools and platforms, like 10x Research, to stay informed about emerging trends and market conditions. Opportunities Amid Consolidation While consolidation phases may seem daunting, they also present opportunities for savvy traders and investors: 1. Reposition Portfolios Use this time to exit weaker positions and increase exposure to assets with strong long-term potential. 2. Accumulate Strategic Assets Prices often stabilize or dip during consolidation, creating favorable conditions for accumulating high-quality assets. 3. Monitor Market Leaders Assets that outperform during consolidation are often the first to rally when momentum returns, making them valuable indicators for future trends. Challenges to Watch During Consolidation Despite the opportunities, traders must remain cautious and aware of potential risks: 1. Prolonged Stagnation Extended periods of low activity can erode confidence, leading to further price declines. 2. External Shocks Unexpected regulatory announcements or macroeconomic events could disrupt consolidation and trigger significant volatility. 3. Overleveraged Positions Traders using high leverage may face liquidation risks if prices move against their positions during this period. The Bull Market’s Long-Term Outlook Despite short-term consolidation, the cryptocurrency market’s long-term outlook remains bullish. Factors supporting this optimism include: 1. Institutional Adoption Major financial institutions continue to integrate cryptocurrencies into their portfolios, lending credibility and stability to the market. 2. Technological Advancements Innovations in blockchain technology, including improvements in scalability and security, enhance the utility and adoption of cryptocurrencies. 3. Macroeconomic Tailwinds Inflationary pressures and global economic uncertainty drive demand for decentralized and deflationary assets like Bitcoin. Community and Industry Reactions The findings from 10x Research have sparked significant discussions among crypto enthusiasts, traders, and analysts: Supporters : Many view this phase as a natural reset, offering opportunities to reassess strategies and accumulate quality assets. Critics : Some analysts caution against overconfidence, emphasizing the need for vigilance in an unpredictable market. Neutral Observers : Highlight the importance of staying informed and maintaining a balanced approach during consolidation. Conclusion The current signs of weakening cryptocurrency market momentum, as identified by 10x Research, represent a short-term consolidation phase rather than a bearish trend. Traders who navigate this period strategically—focusing on core positions, monitoring outperformers, and avoiding weaker segments—can position themselves for success when the market regains momentum. With a long-term bullish outlook driven by institutional adoption and technological advancements, the cryptocurrency market remains an exciting and dynamic space for informed investors.

37463513,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98647,1733832753,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Analyst Explains Why Ripple And XRP Are Strategic Weapons For The United States Government,https://zycrypto.com/analyst-explains-why-ripple-and-xrp-are-strategic-weapons-for-the-united-states-government/,"Presently the third most valuable cryptocurrency , XRP, remains one of the crypto market’s headliners. Its recent astronomical price performance attracted the attention of both fans and those who have long been skeptical of the Ripple-linked token. As one of the old-timers of the cryptosphere, XRP has in recent times enjoyed an ultra-bullish period after rocketing to just below the $3 mark. The XRP rally follows Donald Trump’s election victory in November, as hopes that the new administration will adopt a more lenient approach toward cryptocurrencies triggered unprecedented interest in them. After all, Trump promised on the campaign trail to make the U.S. the “crypto capital” of the world. Now, a popular digital asset researcher is stressing that the U.S. government could leverage Ripple and XRP as strategic weapons. Ripple And XRP Hold Strategic Importance For The US With the current chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, set to step down on the day crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in, analyst Anders explains why Ripple and XRP are strategically important to boost the country as the global leader in the worlds of finance and crypto. In a recent X post , Anders pointed out that Ripple has created a state-of-the-art business-to-business (B2B) system for cross-border payments. He noted that San Francisco-headquartered Ripple controls this next-generation payment solution, giving the United States an edge in the industry. Secondly, Anders suggested that Ripple’s forthcoming U.S. dollar-pegged RLUSD stablecoin could boost the adoption of the greenback by global financial institutions. It’s worth mentioning that RLUSD was scheduled to launch on Dec. 4 pending approval by the New York Department of Financial Services, but was delayed. Still, Ripple’s chief technology officer, David Schwartz, believes the long-anticipated stablecoin could potentially be launched by year-end. Once RLUSD is available, Ripple has previously indicated that it will use both the stablecoin and the XRP token in its cross-border payments solution to serve its international clients. Anders further pinpointed Ripple’s huge XRP trove as another strategic weapon for the U.S. According to the pundit, Ripple currently holds approximately 45% of all XRP supply, making the U.S.-based firm the largest holder of the third largest crypto. He emphasized the significance of accomplishment by citing one of Trump’s pre-election promises to support all U.S.-based cryptocurrency firms and tokens. “No other entity in the crypto space fulfills all these points. Especially since Ripple has created a full B2B cross-border payments system AND at the same time will issue their own USD stablecoin. This is only the beginning as well, we’ll see institutional DeFi products come to market, etc. Therefore Ripple holds strategic importance for the US,” Anders concluded. XRP Round 2 Imminent? The price of Ripple’s cryptocurrency, XRP, has soared over 339% over the last month. Notably, the coin was trading five times lower just a month ago, and its market cap was hovering around $30 billion. Fast-forward to today, and XRP is a $130 billion asset. Meanwhile, widely-followed crypto analyst DonAlt suggested that XRP might be preparing for a round 2, indicating that the recent breakout could well be just the beginning of a much larger rally for the coin. It remains to be seen whether XRP can finally flip Ether (ETH) with the incoming second leg of parabolic growth.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-10 12:12:33

Its two-day retreat happened as Bitcoin and other altcoins suffered a harsh reversal. Still, some notable analysts believe that the current DOGE price crash will be brief and that the uptrend is still intact. Crypto Analyst Sees Dogecoin Price Rising To $18 A quick look at statements by most crypto analysts shows that many of them are highly optimistic that the Dogecoin price has room for more growth. In an X post, Ali Martinez , a popular technical and on-chain analyst, predicted that DOGE was still in a good place in its bullish cycle. He pointed to the weekly chart with a regression channel. He expects that the DOGE price will rise to about $3 in the ongoing bull run. His long-term view is that the coin will ultimately rise to $18. A move from the current price of $0.4127 to $3 would imply a 628% rally, while a surge to $18 would lead to a 4,267% gain. Scofield , another crypto analyst, predicted that the Dogecoin price would soon take off. He pointed out that it had just moved to a key support level on the four-hour chart and that it would soon bounce back. DOGE Price Forecast Dogecoin Price Technical Analysis: Needs To Flip $0.4835 The weekly chart shows that DOGE price has remained in a consolidation phase in the past few weeks. This price action happened after it rallied to a multi-year high of $0.4841, its highest level since May 2021. The price was also a few points above the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.4565. Dogecoin remains much higher than the key support at $0.2278, its highest level on March 25, and the upper side of the small cup and handle pattern. While it is still too early to tell, there are signs that the ongoing consolidation is part of the formation of either a bullish flag or a bullish pennant pattern. These patterns are made up of a long vertical line followed by a consolidation. If these patterns work out, it means that the Dogecoin price will have a bullish breakout, with the next logical target being at $0.7373, its all-time high. Dogecoin Price Chart On the flip side, a drop below $0.3690, the 50% retracement level will invalidate the bullish Dogecoin price forecast . Such a drop will see it drop to the psychological point at $0.300.

37419449,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/just-keep-building-the-narratives-at-devcon-2024,1733833132,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/37419449.jpeg,“Just Keep Building” - The Narratives At DevCon 2024,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/just-keep-building-the-narratives-at-devcon-2024,"DevCon has emerged as one of the hottest extravaganzas on the crypto calendar, bringing together the most innovative Ethereum builders, explorers, entrepreneurs and users from around the world, and the 2024 edition in Bangkok was one of the most insightful yet. If you didn’t make it to the event, don’t worry, for we caught up with a number of representatives from leading crypto companies that graced DevCon with their presence to help us define the narratives on everyone’s lips. So let’s look at a quick rundown of what everyone was talking about, and how these developments will shape the future of the Ethereum ecosystem going forward. AI’s Intersection With Crypto One of the major themes throughout the event was the rise of AI, and attendees were only too eager to elaborate on the ways that technology will be integrated into blockchain and DeFi especially, with a focus on expanding access and automation. “AI agents have emerged as one of the most likely use cases, starting with social media avatars and later, leading to all sorts of personalized agents,” said Ken Timsit, managing director of Cronos Labs. Himanshu Tyagi, co-founder of Sentient said she thinks most attendees will remember Devcon 2024 as the conference that marked the beginning of the rise of crypto and AI. “There was a lot of excitement around social bots connected to crypto rails, interacting with the community through twitter or discord,” he said. “These bots will inspire the next generation of crypto products, and we need new tech to keep them aligned with communities. What’s more, I feel that next year will be completely about crypto and AI. Social bots will evolve to multiplatform, multi-AI creatures playing coordination games with the crypto community. I won't be surprised to see some regulation forbidding AI to launch tokens.” Although bots and agents were the most often-discussed use cases, Tyagi also thinks AI can also play a growing role in enhancing crypto security. Asked what he felt was the most impactful moment at DevCon, he highlighted the release of OML 1.0 fingerprinting library of Sentient at the Open AGI summit. “These fingerprints will evolve to be the foundational blocks for Model Loyalty, making sure that the model can be controlled and kept aligned with the community,” he promised. Security Still A Major Focus As always, the need for better security systems in crypto was ever-present on the DevCon agenda, and attendees were encouraged by a number of developments that suggest progress is being made. Nelly Cornejo, CMO at iExec , said the highlight of the event was a talk about the impact of TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) and how they can help further decentralization of Ethereum. “TEEs have the potential to push the protocol to its edges,” she said. “When paired with other cryptographic approaches, we can achieve this level of decentralization without giving excessive power to manufacturers.That’s why, since 2018, we at iExec have been leading the charge in combining Confidential Computing with blockchain technology. It’s incredibly exciting to see this space evolve, with more and more use cases being discovered and developed.” dRPC CEO Constantine Zaitcev said an interesting point was made during the ""Abstract Bangkok Panel” discussion involving Vitalik Buterin and other prominent crypto leaders on the topic of account abstraction. “This conversation not only highlighted Ethereum’s commitment to decentralization but also showcased how technical advancements like Schnorr signatures can significantly improve user experiences in areas such as wallet security and usability​,” he said. Zaitcev is also optimistic about increased regulation in the crypto industry. “It will lead to clearer frameworks, balancing innovation with compliance,” he explained. “This will foster more institutional adoption while addressing concerns around data privacy and security​.” L2 Networks Gather Momentum Layer-2 networks were easily the most commonly recurring theme at DevCon. Cornejo said it has become clear to everyone in the Ethereum community that infrastructure is the key to scaling and usability. “Scaling upgrades have significantly lowered transaction costs—sometimes by as much as 99%,” he said. “For example, back in 2021, Ethereum transactions involving USDC averaged around $12 in gas fees. By September this year, that dropped to about $1 on Ethereum and less than a cent on Base, Coinbase’s L2 network. This is a massive improvement, especially when compared to the $44 average cost of international wire transfers today. Cronos Labs’ Timsit said his company’s side event, hosted alongside Google Cloud, ZKSync and others has made it clear that interoperable L2 blockchains are going to get even more attention in the New Year. “L2s, particularly zero-knowledge L2s, are going to become the priority solutions for growing Ethereum’s ecosystem in 2025,” he predicted. According to Zaitcev, there are lots of reasons to be excited about L2s, but the most pressing benefit is prices and cost optimization. “The continued rise of layer-2 solutions and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) will make blockchain interactions more affordable and efficient, with dynamic pricing models for infrastructure services becoming standard​,” he promised. Cornejo believes L2s themselves are already having this impact, and are one of the major reasons why blockchains in general are growing so rapidly. “Blockchains are now processing more than 50 times the volume they could just four years ago, thanks to Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions, high-throughput blockchains, and the ETH Dencun upgrade, which drastically reduced fees for L2 networks,” he stated. Priorities Will Shift The emergence of so many prominent L2 networks has led to a lot of rivalries between them, with the likes of ZK rollups and optimistic rollups all competing for users and trying to outdo each other. But in the coming year, Mark Smargon of Fuse.io thinks those networks will be much less focused on each other, and much more aware of where the real competition is. “Right now, people are thinking about past problems that might be interesting for our investors, instead of considering future problems that we can solve for our consumers,” Smargon said. “There is too much debate about L2's competing with each other, and how Ethereum is competing with Solana. In a year from now I predict we will not hear about those competitions because we need to grow the pie and once we do that, crypto will get 100-times bigger and every team will realize that their main competition is Web2.” The Memecoin Hype Will Expand No Ethereum roadshow these days is complete without a mention of memecoins, and Cornejo believes they will continue to grow as a force on Ethereum, as there are no signs of the hype around them letting up. “Memecoins continue to gain popularity in this cycle,” Cornejo said. “Google Trends shows that searches for ""meme coin"" and ""meme coins"" are at their highest levels in five years. Pump.fun also reached a record with 69,046 new tokens launched in a single day. However, it’s crucial to remain cautious as market conditions evolve. As Keynes famously said, “Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.””Nate Holiday, CEO of Space and Time, captured the essence of the post-Devcon 2024 Space and Time with his succinct yet powerful statement:“ETH is still king for developers. Ignore the noise. Keep building.” His words reflect the overarching mood among the Ethereum community and Web3 developers, emphasising Ethereum's enduring dominance as the foundational blockchain for innovation and development. Despite the rise of competing ecosystems and the noise surrounding new narratives, Holiday’s message underscores a key takeaway from Devcon: Ethereum remains the go-to platform for developers seeking robust infrastructure, active community support, and a mature ecosystem.

The bank upgraded Cipher Mining (CIFR) and CleanSpark (CLSK) to overweight from neutral. JPMorgan also introduced a new price $8 price target for Cipher, and raised its CleanSpark price target to $17 from $10.50. MARA Holdings (MARA) was also upgraded to neutral from underweight and raised its price target on the stock to $23 from $12. The U.S. bank downgraded IREN (IREN) to neutral from overweight while increasing its price target on the shares to $15 from $9.50. It raised its Riot Platforms (RIOT) price target to $16 from $9.50, while maintaining its overweight rating on the company. The bank said it was introducing a new sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation framework for the miners, which took into account company's mining operations, their respective land and power portfolios, and their hodl balance to reflect any bitcoin that the firms may hold on their balance sheet. Cipher rose over 4% in early trading Tuesday, CleanSpark gained around 3.5%, MARA climbed over 2%, RIOT was almost 2% higher, and IREN was 0.4% better.

Elon Musk’s role in the US government under Trump’s administration and his continued endorsement of DOGE could enhance its visibility and utility, driving potential price growth. New DOGE Rally on the Horizon? The meme coin niche suffered a severe blow in the past 24 hours, with its market capitalization plummeting by over 13%. Some of the worst-affected assets charting double-digit price declines include Shiba Inu (SHIB), dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk Inu (BONK), Popcat (POPCAT), Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), and more. The sector’s undisputed leader – Dogecoin (DOGE) – is also well in the red, albeit suffering a bit less than most of its rivals. Several hours ago, its price dipped under $0.40, while currently, it trades at around $0.41 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 5.5% plunge on a daily scale. DOGE Price, Source: CoinGecko Many analysts, though, remained unfazed by the pullback. Some, such as Ali Martinez, were even thankful for the dip, viewing it as a buying opportunity. Check out where we are in the #Dogecoin $DOGE bull cycle! Very early, right? For that reason, I’m thankful for the dip and will buy more between $0.40-$0.30. The target remains $3, and if things go wild, $18! pic.twitter.com/jdPODkxgHe — Ali (@ali_charts) December 9, 2024 Other industry participants who have made bullish Dogecoin price predictions include Jake Wujastyk and Cephii. The former described the latest correction as “a little flush to clear out the leverage,” which might be followed by another resurgence. Cephii claimed that DOGE has one of “the strongest charts around” and a high potential for further gains in the near future . DOGE to Thrive During Trump’s Reign? Donald Trump’s win in the US presidential elections last month was undoubtedly considered great news by DOGE proponents. After all, America’s upcoming political leader has Elon Musk in his inner circle and even appointed him to lead a new division called the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). The unit is expected to reduce bureaucracy, cut government spending, and enhance efficiency , with Trump describing it as “The Manhattan Project” of our time. For his part, Musk is a well-known proponent of Dogecoin, often praising its merits and endorsing it on X. Earlier this year, Tesla (the EV giant spearheaded by the billionaire) integrated the meme coin as a payment method on its website. There are also rumors that X (the social media platform that Musk purchased for $44 billion in 2022) might embrace DOGE settlements sooner or later. Elon Musk’s involvement in the US political scene may positively affect DOGE’s price. However, its performance will also depend on various other factors, such as broader market trends and developments within the Dogecoin ecosystem.

The Bitcoin miner is the public company with the second largest Bitcoin holdings, and this announcement comes just a day after MicroStrategy, the public company with the largest BTC holding, announced another purchase. MARA Acquires 11,774 BTC For $1.1 Billion MARA revealed in a recent filing with the SEC that it had purchased 11,774 BTC for $1.1 billion. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin miner also confirmed this purchase in an X post, stating that it used the proceeds from its zero-coupon convertible notes offerings to make this purchase. The company acquired these bitcoins at an average price of $96,000 per BTC and has achieved a BTC yield of 12.3% quarter-to-date (QTD) and 47.6% year-to-date (YTD). Following this recent purchase, the Bitcoin miner now holds 40,435 BTC, worth around $3.9 billion based on the current Bitcoin price . MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor also commented on MARA’s announcement, touching on the fact that the company has achieved a BTC yield of 47.6% YTD, which seemed to have impressed the tech entrepreneur and Bitcoin advocate. Interestingly, MARA Holding’s announcement comes just a day after Saylor’s company announced that it purchased 21,550 BTC for $2.1 billion. MicroStrategy and Marathon Digital are the public companies with the largest Bitcoin holdings. However, the software company is well ahead, with 423,650 BTC compared to the Bitcoin miner’s 40,435 BTC. Other companies are already looking to emulate this Bitcoin strategy, and Microsoft could soon be one of them. The company’s shareholders will vote today on a Bitcoin adoption proposal, which, if passed, would see the tech company adopt the flagship crypto on its balance sheet.

The DeFi coin has had quite the run lately, and even Solana can't stop the roaring XRP token. As XRP readies for the 2025 bull run, a new DeFi coin is brewing to take over from top altcoins in the market. The presale is surging to new heights and SOL and XRP whales are starting to take note of the new coin. Read on for further details! Solana’s SOL is Set for Gains in the 2025 Bull Run The crypto market is very volatile at the moment, and even relatively stable tokens like the top altcoins have been very unstable lately. Solana is one of the top coins to be affected by the volatility, as SOL has lost sight of reaching its ATH now. SOL was on a roll last week, touching the $250 mark and correcting briefly. The Solana token is on a 0.68% net loss from the week, exchanging for $234.41, but that's not to say that Solana won't be back. There's a lot of potential, and there's always time for another spark, especially with the 2025 bull run in mind. The SOL price can take a significant turn for the better in the 2025 bull run, as talk on Solana ETFs has risen again. However, SOL investors are looking for something more promising. Ripple’s XRP Jumps SOL on Top Tokens Ranking Ripple’s XRP token is the pick of the week, as its recovery from the South Korean martial law drama has been astounding. The token rose to a six-year high on Tuesday, December 3, 2024, and despite correcting significantly from there, Ripple’s XRP is still on 48% weekly gains. The steep rise in Ripple whale movements and investments has set the ecosystem alive with action. Ripple’s market cap was the first to benefit from the surge; now, the market cap has left Solana's in fifth place, and Ripple is now the 4th biggest token with $127 billion in market cap. Even its DeFi activity has surpassed Solana's, and the surge from November has seen several analysts ask about Ripple ETFs. It seems a far shot from here, but the regulations are about to get relaxed. Maybe we'll see Ripple ETFs launch before the end of 2025. Before then, we have a new token that is taking up traders' interest. A new DeFi coin is a few weeks from launch, but the presale is making massive waves already. DTX Exchange is Uniting Digital Trading Markets The DTX Exchange (DTX) is planning a new front for the DeFi sector. It is a hybrid blockchain that unites the major digital trading markets. Unlike traditional exchanges that offer mostly just crypto coins, DTX Exchange is opening the doors of DeFi to all, even stock and foreign exchange brokers. The VulcanX-based project offers equity products like shares and foreign currency pairs to go with the crypto tokens. Rather than depending on multiple platforms to manage different portfolios, DTX Exchange gives traders a single interface to manage their assets in one place. There are 120,000 tradable assets to choose from, spanning crypto, stock, and Forex markets. As though that is not enough, users also have a rare chance to trade Real World Assets (RWAs) backed by crypto coins. Gold, crude oil, precious metals, and so much more are all on the DTX Exchange network. And for the investors, there's a 15% APY rate for staking your tokens; raise the security on DTX Exchange and watch your rewards spike alongside it. They also get rebates for holding onto their DTX DeFi coins, as the platform gives them a share of the daily trading revenue according to how much DTX they are holding. There's the ongoing presale where traders are accumulating as many tokens as they can get. Investors Stack DTX DeFi Coins in Its Presale Ahead of the 2025 Bull Run! The DTX Exchange DeFi coin is in its public presale Stage 6 and has raised almost $10 million so far, with investors proactively stacking the coin ahead of a boom in the 2025 bull run. Crypto analysts have also thrown their weights behind the DeFi coin, projecting up to 100x for DTX in the 2025 bull run. But even before then, there is much to gain from the presale. DTX is currently valued at $0.12, and new investors can start accumulating gains from the next stage till launch when the price goes up to $0.20.

Bitcoin price dropped to below $94,000, while top altcoins such as Binance Coin, Dogecoin, Solana and Ethereum followed the downward trend. These losses were triggered by liquidations of over $1.76 billion in the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass data . However, savvy investors see this altcoin crash as an opportunity to look for crypto to buy dip, for significant gains. Crypto to Buy Dip Now for Potential 500% Gains Here are four potential crypto to buy-Cardano (ADA), Minotaurus (MTAUR), Avalanche (AVAX), and Dogecoin (DOGE). 1. Cardano (ADA): Crypto to Buy Targeting New Highs Currently, Cardano is experiencing a monthly increase of over 70%, but it has dropped nearly 10% in the last day and about 19% in the past week, trading today at $1.01. Nevertheless, the token has jumped by 101% to $3.7 billion in trading volume within the last 24 hours, indicating increased trading activity and enthusiasm for ADA. Its solid fundamentals and growing adoption indicate this downturn may represent a prime chance for long-term investors. Why Consider ADA?

While there is no evidence to support this, DTX’s rapid growth and features align with what high-profile crypto folks are looking for. Ripple’s Momentum and the Altcoin Opportunity Ripple (XRP) has increased 36% in the last few weeks to over $2, currently trading at $2.3. This is due to the increasing likelihood of XRP ETF approvals with big names like WisdomTree’s XRP ETF and Bitwise’s Physical XRP ETP getting investors excited. While Ripple is riding the regulatory clarity wave, the spotlight on DTX means it could be Garlinghouse’s next move to diversify into the altcoin space. Source: CoinMarketCap DTX Exchange (DTX) Is a One Trading Solution DTX Exchange has reached the top of the crypto pile by raising $9.6 million in its 6th presale and pricing tokens at $0.12. The platform is unique in that it combines the functionality of a centralized and decentralized exchange. You can trade everything from cryptocurrencies to ETFs to tokenized real world assets all with up to 1000x liquidity. Key features driving this demand: Phoenix Wallet: A decentralized custody solution for stocks, forex, and crypto assets. VulcanX Blockchain: DPoS RWA Tokenization: Coming soon. Trading physical assets on-chain. Are Ripple (XRP) and DTX Exchange (DTX) on the Same Page? Ripple’s vision of efficient cross border payments is in line with DTX’s mission to democratize trading. With over 160,000 community members DTX is proving to be a force to be reckoned with. DTX Exchange (DTX) is designed for crypto veterans and traditional investors alike, as the gateway for retail traders to access multiple financial instruments under one roof. Garlinghouse’s involvement may be due to DTX’s use of blockchain to fix the inefficiencies in traditional finance, just like Ripple did with cross-border payments. Altcoin Mania: The Capital Rotates into DTX Exchange (DTX) As Ripple gains momentum, other altcoins like DTX Exchange are emerging as investment opportunities. Experts expect DTX to follow Ripple’s chart and potentially go up to 100x after CEX listing. Early adopters are already seeing returns, and presale investors are seeing significant token appreciation even before the project goes live. DTX is rising fast as capital is rotating out of speculative meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) into utility-driven projects. $1.3 million was moved from DOGE wallets to DTX in 24 hours, showing that people are moving towards projects that have real value. Who Will Lead The Next Wave of The Cryptocurrency Adoption? If Garlinghouse is involved, this could be a big deal for DTX Exchange (DTX). The bridge between traditional finance and blockchain-backed trading solutions is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for early investors. With live trading in December and CEX listings soon after, DTX is going to lead the next wave of cryptocurrency adoption. Whether Garlinghouse is involved or not, the narrative around DTX is that it’s going to be a major player in the DeFi space. Investors interested should grab tokens during presale while prices are still a fraction of what they will be.

The connectivity cloud company’s report goes through the most popular internet services, providing global internet insights and security trends for 2024. Binance was the crypto industry’s representative, making it into the top six. According to Cloudflare, financial services cover everything from traditional banking to crypto and tax tools. According to the 2024 report, the top six financial services are Stripe, Trading View, Alipay, PayPal, Nubank, and Binance. Cloudflare’s network presently extends across over 330 cities in over 120 regions, serving an average of over 63 million HTTP(S) requests per second for millions of Internet properties. Additionally, it manages over 42 million DNS requests per second on average. Binance makes the top six of finance applications According to Cloudflare , Binance peaked in third position on November 12-13, following the US elections. However, it settled in sixth position, up from eighth last year. On the other hand, PayPal fell to the fourth position from the second spot. Also, TradingView ascended to the second position, while AliPay, the Chinese mobile and online payment platform, secured the third position. Nubank, the Brazilian Neobank (exclusively online), entered the top 10 at the fifth position. It is regarded as the most valuable. It is one of the largest financial groups in Latin America and the world’s largest digital bank. Crypto ratings and financial impacts Cloudflare conducted a specific evaluation of services related to crypto in the financial services category. The findings are that the crypto sector has continued to develop in 2024 despite a few collapses in recent years. Crypto has also experienced a late-year boom. Binance and Coinbase maintained the top two positions, while OKX advanced to third place this year. In late August, CoinGecko was demoted to the sixth position as OKX took its place. Meanwhile, 2miners.com, a new entrant, ascended to the fourth position. CoinMarketCap ranked fifth, followed by several dynamic new entrants in the Top 10. Source: Cloudflare The overall classification was influenced by the US elections and Bitcoin’s price. Coinbase’s most successful day was November 21, when it ranked #131 as Bitcoin approached $100,000. OKX peaked at the 149th position on Nov 22 as CoinMarketCap reached the176th position on Nov 23 Also, on September 26, Binance made its debut in the Top 100 when Bitcoin surpassed $65,000. Financial attacks per Cloudflare data According to Cloudflare, the frequency of attacks in industries frequently changes over time, depending on the attackers’ intentions. When their intention is financial harm, they aim at e-commerce sites during peak buying season, assault online games to gain advantages over opponents, or attack government-related sites to make political statements. To determine industry-specific attack activity in 2024, Cloudflare examined mitigated traffic for customers having an associated industry and vertical in their customer record. May was the most active month for attacks targeting finance organizations, with an upsurge of 15.3% of mitigated traffic occurring during the week of May 13. This is consistent with the figure in the Q2 2024 DDoS threat report, which indicates that the Financial Services industry was the most frequently targeted for request volume in South America and the Middle East region during the quarter. Source: Cloudflare Companies in the gambling/games industry were the most targeted in 2024, accounting for 6.6% of all global mitigated traffic. The industry was marginally ahead of Finance, which topped 2023’s aggregate rankings. Gambling and games sites saw the greatest share of reduced traffic in January and the first week of February.

However, top ETH-based tokens have defied all odds and have maintained bullish price action this week. With the rising uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market, will Ethereum-based altcoins lead the charge and dominate the crypto bull rally this month? In this article, we have covered the market sentiment and price analysis of Beam (BEAM), Curve Dao (CRV), and Ondo (ONDO) crypto tokens. Beam (BEAM) Despite recording a drop of ~2% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $171.52 million, the Beam price has jumped ~12% over the last seven days and 56.36% during the last 30 days. Moreover, with a market cap of $1.61 billion, it has secured the 71st position. TradingView: BEAM/USDT The Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues hovering close to its overbought range in the daily time frame. Further, with its SMA indicator constantly supporting the Beam price chart, this altcoin may continue gaining value during the upcoming time. If the bulls regain momentum, the Beam price could breach its important resistance level of $0.036 and head toward its 52-week high of $0.044390. Conversely, a bearish action could pull the price of this altcoin toward its low of $0.0250. Will Beam Price Hit $1?

TradingView: CRV/USDT The EMA 50/200-day has displayed a Golden Cross in the 1D price chart. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a steady drop in the positive histogram. This highlights a mixed price action for the Curve Dao price this week. Maintaining its bullish price sentiment could set the stage for it to retest its $1.35 mark.

TradingView: ONDO/USDT The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is on the verge of experiencing a bearish convergence in the Ondo price chart. Moreover, the RSI indicator has experienced a similar price action, highlighting uncertainty in the short-term price targets. If the bulls successfully retest its support level of $1.49, the Ondo price will prepare to retest its resistance trendline of $1.80.

The major question is: how high could these altcoins go as Ethereum (ETH) overcomes important resistance levels and Cardano (ADA) keeps on its amazing surge? Concurrent with this, DTX Exchange (DTX) —a breakthrough platform combining the best of centralized and decentralized exchanges—is drawing enormous investor interest before its token launch on multiple exchanges. Could the next major winners in the crypto market be these initiatives, especially the developing DTX platform? Read on to find out. DTX Exchange (DTX) Promises Huge ROIs DTX Exchange is a hybrid platform that combines the best aspects of centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Moreover, DTX Exchange is enhancing the trading sector by providing unrivaled security, efficiency, and user control. The DTX coin is attracting a lot of investor interest as its presale has already raised approximately $10 million. This makes DTX Exchange rank as the best crypto investment of the quarter. DTX presents amazing growth potential at just $0.12 at the sixth presale stage. Now is the ideal moment to get involved as the price is set to rise to $0.14 in the 7th stage. With its innovative one-stop platform that lets customers trade stocks, ETFs, FX, and cryptocurrencies among other asset classes, DTX Exchange distinguishes itself. Moreover, DTX Exchange guarantees that users keep complete ownership of their assets, providing them with non-custodial storage and wallet-based trading. By the end of the presale, analysts estimate a 2000% rally; once the token launches on several exchanges, a possible 20x surge is expected. Why Ethereum (ETH) is One of the Best Cryptos to Buy Now Among crypto enthusiasts, Ethereum (ETH) has been causing great buzz. The Ethereum price surged over 7% in the past week and passed the important $3,700 resistance mark. With many analysts anticipating the Ethereum price will soon rally back to its ATH of $4,891, attained in 2021, this breakout has positioned Ethereum (ETH) as one of the best cryptos to buy now. With the positive community sentiment, analysts are hopeful that Ethereum (ETH) might rapidly reach this price even if it is almost 20% away from its ATH. The Ethereum price chart shows that the altcoin has already surged by more than 27% over the past month, breaking the $4,000 milestone with slight declines below $3,900 regarded as brief pullbacks. Given that Ethereum (ETH) is expected to trade within a band of $4,101 to $7,400 by 2025, its future price forecast is still really amazing. Strong market activity shown by recent price volatility and consecutive green days on the Ethereum price chart helps the altcoin to be a top pick for investors looking for both short-term profits and long-term gains. Bullish Momentum Behind Cardano (ADA) Pushes Toward $2 Emerging as a competitor as the best crypto investment of the current cycle, Cardano (ADA) offers investors interesting gains that have attracted attention. The Cardano price has surged by over 150% over the previous thirty days alone, reaching the $1.3 level. With the Cardano price increasing by about 3% over the past week, the optimistic trend has stayed solid. Driven by its strong fundamentals and committed, active community, Cardano's (ADA) progress does not show any slowing down tendency. Although there is some bearish pressure following the rally to $1.3 which resulted in a decline to the $1.15 support, overall the picture on the Cardano price chart is still bullish. With the MACD and Moving Averages indicating ongoing positive momentum on the Cardano price chart, technical indicators support the altcoin's bullish outlook. Should Cardano (ADA) overcome the negative trendline on the monthly chart, experts believe the altcoin will keep rising toward the $2 mark in the next few weeks. DTX Exchange Joins Ethereum and Cardano In The Rally Race DTX Exchange is becoming a revolutionary platform with great potential as Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) keep their outstanding rallies. DTX Exchange aims to transform the trading scene with its hybrid model combining the finest of centralized and decentralized exchanges. With analysts projecting a 2000% increase during the presale and a possible 20x increase once the token launches on multiple exchanges, DTX has great potential for a huge value increase.

Synthetix coin price analysis gives out a highly bearish prediction with regards to the ongoing market events. SNX/USD value has decreased to a $2.734 low over the last 24 hours. Side by side, the market sentiment remained extremely bearish. Overall, the cryptocurrency lost up to a massive 12.59 percent of value during the day. Technical indicators are giving out a positive verdict; however, the price charts continue to present a bearish outlook. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as we shall explore in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2024 to 2030. It is expected that SNX will reach $44 by 2030. Why is SNX down? The cryptocurrency market is under bearish pressure, and SNX faces the same sentiment. However, it is still encouraging that SNX is one of the best performers and has moved above its average since August 13, 2024. The SNX price has decreased to $2.734; moreover, it has lost up to 12.59% of its value since the last 24 hours Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does not justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if RSI returns from the oversold zone, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach $5 by 2026. Will SNX reach $10? According to Cryptopolitan’s price prediction, SNX will reach the $10 level by the fourth quarter of 2026. The last time SNX was seen at the $10 level was November 2021. Will SNX reach $100? According to Cryptopolitan’s price prediction, SNX may not reach this level in the next ten years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like $100 too far-fetched. Does SNX have a good long-term Future? SNX is nearing an oversold position, which means the token is undervalued compared to its actual worth, which makes it a perfect time for buyers to enter the market. Considering the low price and a good future evaluation of $23 by the end of 2030, the asset is worth buying.

Synthetix historic price sentiment Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while November saw a stream of improved prices through out with the coin peaking $2.63.

Speaking on Bloomberg TV on December 9, Teng described any discussion of re-entering the U.S. market or relaunching Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin as “premature.” “For now, our focus is on global deployment,” Teng stated, highlighting the exchange’s efforts to capture market share worldwide. He noted Binance’s intention to target institutions, sovereign wealth funds, and high-net-worth individuals, whom he believes are poised to allocate more resources to the crypto sector. Binance withdrew from the U.S. in November 2023 following a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities over allegations including sanctions violations and operating without proper licensing. As part of the settlement, the Justice Department and the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) imposed independent compliance monitoring on the exchange for three and five years, respectively. Teng Backs Stronger Compliance When asked whether Binance might seek to shorten these compliance monitoring periods under President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly administration , Teng dismissed the idea as irrelevant. “Compliance is the way forward,” he said, emphasizing Binance’s heavy investment in compliance infrastructure as a competitive advantage in an increasingly regulated environment. Since taking over as CEO in November 2023, Teng has championed compliance and regulatory adherence, acknowledging past shortcomings under his predecessor Changpeng Zhao. “There were gaps in terms of compliance,” Teng admitted in a December 2023 interview. Despite these efforts, the exchange continues to face scrutiny. Its U.S. arm, Binance.US, operates as a crypto-only exchange without the ability to transact in U.S. dollars. The SEC has accused Binance , Binance.US, and Zhao of selling unregistered securities and other regulatory breaches. Path Forward Without U.S. Markets Although Teng did not rule out a future return to the U.S., his comments made clear that Binance is prioritizing a broader global strategy . This approach comes as the industry anticipates clearer regulatory frameworks worldwide, providing an opportunity for Binance to strengthen its position across various jurisdictions. With its focus on compliance and global market expansion, Binance aims to rebuild trust and reputation amid ongoing legal challenges, while keeping its long-term options open.

Bitcoin has crossed the $100k milestone and crypto ETFs are gaining traction among traditional investors. Currently, analysts forecast the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) could hit $0.0000444. Also, Solana (SOL) and IntelMarkets (INTL) are aiming for new highs. While SOL could rally to $310, INTL might hit $0.1 in the coming weeks. Shiba Inu (SHIB) on the Verge of Breakout, Target Could Be $0.0000444 A top analyst called Whales HQ believes the Shiba Inu coin is about to break out of a triangular formation. The chart accompanying the tweet showed the upper part of the trend line is around $0.000033 Surpassing this level could kickstart the long-awaited Shiba Inu (SHIB) bull run. Investinghaven forecasts the value of the memecoin could hit $0.0000444 by mid-December. They noted that if the Shiba Inu crypto fails to breach this market, it would need to retrace and make another attempt next year. Currently, the Shiba Inu token is trading within a narrow range ($0.00003-$0.000033). CoinMarketCap price information shows the memecoin's value has increased by 58.1% in the past month and 17.3% in the past two weeks.

At the moment, data from CoinMarketCap reveals Solana (SOL) is trading between $217.96 and $244.36 on the weekly timeframe. The altcoin price has dipped by 8.9% on the biweekly chart following a price correction from its latest ATH. Nevertheless, analysts believe the correction might not last.

Also, the Stoch RSI (14) is displaying a buy signal which is a sign that more buyers are entering the market.

With PEPE’s market cap soaring past $10 billion, the question remains—can it sustain its momentum or falter at key resistance levels? Amidst this dog and frog meme crypto mania, a lightning-fast cat has entered the race— JetBolt (JBOLT), clawing its way to the top with its zero-gas technology and unstoppable presale momentum. Will Pepe Coin leapfrog Dogecoin to claim the meme coin crown, or will it croak under pressure and the king of memes is here to stay? Could JetBolt’s lightning-fast cat surge ahead in the meme coin race? Let’s unravel the clash of memes and innovation as PEPE, DOGE, and JetBolt battle for the crypto spotlight. Pepe coin: Can PEPE Breakout 10x and Dethrone Dogecoin? Pepe coin (PEPE) continues to pump, with its 1,531% year-to-date gains and a $10.45 billion market cap, positioning it as a top meme coin contender. Currently priced at $0.00002487, Pepe Coin recently hit new all-time highs of $0.00002825, fueled by listings on major exchanges like Binance.US and Coinbase. Over the past week, PEPE has shown steady upward momentum followed by periods of sharp volatility, culminating in a new high near $0.000028 before retracing to $0.000025. Technical analysis also shows a bullish pennant pattern, with possibilities for a 30% rally to $0.000036 if PEPE breaks the $0.00003 resistance. However, failure to sustain momentum could lead to retracements back to $0.000024. PEPE trading chart from the 4th to the 10th of December 2024 showing price fluctuations with a peak near $0.000028 In the past month, whales have accumulated over $1.14 billion worth of PEPE, resulting in reduced exchange supply and signaling bullish trends. Despite these gains, surpassing Dogecoin’s $60.15 billion market cap and mainstream adoption remains a challenge. While Pepe Coin’s path ahead looks bright, dethroning Dogecoin as the dominant meme coin will depend on sustained performance and community-driven demand. For now, Pepe Coin remains an ambitious competitor in the meme coin arena. Dogecoin: Can PEPE Steal DOGE’s Crown? Dogecoin (DOGE), currently trading at $0.4088 with a $60.15 billion market cap, remains a dominant force despite recent dips. Crypto analysts warn failure to break the $0.4250 resistance level could push DOGE back to $0.3650. Meanwhile, Pepe Coin (PEPE), surging 1,531% year-to-date, is challenging Dogecoin’s lead. However, Dogecoin’s real-world adoption, including use by Tesla and SpaceX, still keeps it ahead in the race for meme coin supremacy. Pepe Coin’s rapid ascent and tight supply might create short-term momentum, but overtaking Dogecoin’s established ecosystem will require sustained growth and broader utility. JetBolt (JBOLT): The Futuristic Cat with Revolutionary Zero Gas Tech JetBolt (JBOLT) is a next-gen altcoin that’s already turning heads even in the meme coin space with its revolutionary presale success. While JetBolt differs from the usual meme coin mold, its futuristic cat mascot has found a soft spot among meme coin enthusiasts by bridging the gap between serious blockchain advancements and the vibrant and playful culture that meme coins thrive on. Built on the Skale Network, JetBolt’s use of zero-gas technology eliminates the burden of gas fees entirely, providing users with accessible, high-speed blockchain transactions. This game-changer tech doesn’t just erase gas fees—it also unlocks a gateway for boundless innovation, streamlining dApps, blockchain gaming, SocialFi, and Web3 development into a frictionless, gas-free frontier for creators and pioneers alike. But JetBolt doesn’t just stop at zero-gas innovation—JetBolt’s easy-to-earn staking mechanism, made easy as pie to access through its intuitive Web3 wallet, transforms active participation into possibilities for rewards—creating an engaging ecosystem. JetBolt is also redefining utility by integrating a cutting-edge AI tool that displays AI-aggregated crypto news. JetBolt’s presale isn’t just hype—it’s resulting in stellar numbers. Since its presale launch, JetBolt has been making waves, with over 150 million JBOLT tokens already snapped up by eager Web3 users. Key presale perks include special Alpha Boxes, which include up to 25% additional JBOLT tokens for batch purchases. As JetBolt continues to show innovation and excitement, it’s setting a new blend of innovation amongst next-gen altcoins gathering popularity in the crypto space. Will JetBolt redefine crypto dominance? Only time will tell. Final Thoughts: Pepe Coin vs Dogecoin in Meme Coin Dominance as JetBolt Surges Ahead Pepe Coin (PEPE) has surged past $10 billion in market cap, aiming to challenge Dogecoin’s (DOGE) dominance. While Pepe Coin’s momentum is undeniable, its path to overthrow Dogecoin remains blocked by market hurdles. Meanwhile, JetBolt (JBOLT), though not a typical meme coin, is pulling in whale attention with its groundbreaking technology and over 150 million tokens sent flying off the shelves during its presale. As Pepe Coin and Dogecoin battle for meme coin supremacy, JetBolt’s meteoric rise signals that next-generation newcomers are also part of the new crypto narrative.

37465935,https://finbold.com/?p=218333,1733838257,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Anthony Scaramucci predicts China will be back in Bitcoin ‘by this time next year’,https://finbold.com/anthony-scaramucci-predicts-china-will-be-back-in-bitcoin-by-this-time-next-year/,"At the Bitcoin MENA conference in Abu Dhabi, SkyBridge Capital founder and former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci made a bold prediction: China will re-enter Bitcoin by the end of 2025. Speaking with conviction at the ADNEC Centre on December 10, Scaramucci laid out his forecast: “Now that the United States is open to this idea, I think it would be impossible to suggest that other countries wouldn’t do the same thing. I’m sitting here today in December 2024. I’ll make a prediction here: By this time next year, the Chinese will be back in the Bitcoin game.” He added : “They’re probably going to add it to their reserve assets. They’re probably going to allow people to mine it legally.” Scaramucci’s insights carry significant weight, given his background in both traditional finance and cryptocurrency investment. As the founder of the global investment firm SkyBridge Capital, Scaramucci has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin’s role in the future of finance and the presence of digital assets. China’s complicated relationship with Bitcoin China’s history with Bitcoin and crypto has been tumultuous. The country was once the epicenter of Bitcoin mining, accounting for as much as 65% to 75% of global hash power before the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) imposed a sweeping ban on cryptocurrency mining and trading in 2021. The ban was part of a broader effort to curb financial risks, regulate capital outflows, and promote China’s own central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan. Despite the crackdown, Scaramucci highlighted a significant anomaly in the enforcement of the ban. Many miners have relocated their operations to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions, but a notable percentage of activity still continues in China. “It’s ironic—10% of the mining is still happening in China despite the fact the CCP has disallowed it,” he remarked. Geopolitical dynamics and the U.S. influence Scaramucci’s prediction is rooted in the shifting global landscape around Bitcoin. The United States has taken steps toward embracing digital assets, with growing institutional adoption and increasing discussions about regulatory clarity. High-profile events like the potential approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and greater recognition of cryptocurrencies in financial systems are setting the stage for wider global adoption. Scaramucci elaborated on this trend, saying: “You’re going to see this opening. It’s almost like a match sailing race. You’re not going to be in a position in the world, in developing economies, where the U.S. is moving towards Bitcoin and you are not moving towards Bitcoin.” In other words, Scaramucci believes that if the U.S. continues to integrate Bitcoin into its financial system, other major economies—including China—will feel compelled to follow suit. The competitive nature of global finance and the desire to maintain economic dominance may drive China to reconsider its stance on Bitcoin. Finbold’s two cents on Scaramucci’s forecast Given Anthony Scaramucci’s proven track record and deep connections in high-level financial networks, his insights carry significant weight. Especially as someone who has successfully navigated both Wall Street and the political sphere. If his forecast proves correct, China’s re-entry into the Bitcoin market could have profound implications, driving up demand, legitimizing Bitcoin further, and potentially altering the global balance of financial power.

Notably, it has gained significant attention post-Trump’s win. Time to clean up this humongous mess! https://t.co/90RtL0vIsq — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 10, 2024 “Time to clean up this humongous mess” noted Musk. He reiterated the sentiment shared by DOGE that the Federal government spends 80% of its annual $100 billion IT budget on maintaining outdated systems. Earlier, he had raised similar issues regarding the excess federal spending, highlighting the need to cut costs. “Not only are older systems more expensive to maintain, but they are also more vulnerable to hackers,” read the message, that was shared by the official DOGE account. US Government’s IT Infrastructure Concerns In a seperate X post , Musk had shared that the Federal government computers & software are in such bad shape that they often cannot verify that payments are not fraud, waste or abuse. Musk has been vocal about the alarming state of the US government’s IT infrastructure. He further added “That’s why the government can’t pass basic audits. They often LITERALLY don’t know where your tax dollars went. It’s insane.” To support his concerns, Musk referenced a 2019 government watchdog report that identified 10 federal IT systems as outdated. The report highlighted that maintaining these systems costs approximately $337 million annually and that their continued use exposes the government to “known security vulnerabilities.” Musk argued that these challenges hinder effective governance and accountability. “The Volunteer IT Consultant” Musk revealed that his preferred title in the new administration is ‘Volunteer IT Consultant’. He emhasized the need to fix the IT infrastructure to make the government work. “This is a grind & hardly glorious, but we can’t make government efficient & fix the deficit if the computers don’t work,” he shared. After winning the US Presidential election, Donald Trump appointed Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the department, sparking discussions in the market. Musk’s recent comments have also sparked optimism among investors over Dogecoin, as evidenced by the surge in the recent Dogecoin price. Also, Musk has shared a series of cryptic posts recently, which has also pushed the DOGE price higher. Meanwhile, the market experts appear to have remained bullish on the top dog-themed meme coin despite the recent pullback. Experts predict Dogecoin price rally to $1.05 in the coming days.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-10 13:50:44

Altcoins have gained significant attention for their innovative uses and strong adoption rates. However, five altcoins stand out as the best choice for 2025. They are Rexas Finance (RXS), Tron (TRX), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and Solano (SOL). Tron (TRX): Leader in USDT Usage Tron has increased by up to 100% in the past month and 200% this year, highlighting its growth. The cryptocurrency attracted significant interest recently following the surge that temporarily pushed its market cap to $36 billion. Whales are demonstrating confidence in Tron’s future, with whale activities skyrocketing by 929%. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju recently highlighted Tron’s key role in the crypto space. According to him, Tron leads USDT transactions with its low cost and fast transfers. The USDT Tron holds more than three times its market cap. Its strong position as a leader in USDT usage set the stage for its growth in 2025, supported by a bullish narrative. Ripple (XRP): A Promising Path to $7 Ripple gained rapidly in November, quickly tripling its value in just one month. After more than 300% in a month, XRP peaked at $2.7. However, Ripple’s executives announcement that it’s still awaiting approval for its stablecoin launch has led to a dip. This was in response to speculation that it would launch on December 4. At press time, XRP trades at $2.30. Despite this fall, XRP is poised for further gains in December and beyond. Factors like Gary Gensler’s exit, the launch of its stablecoin, and the expected launch of the Ripple XRP ETF will fuel its surge. Cardano (ADA) Network Growth: A Bullish Narrative Cardano Hydra Layer-2 protocol hit a major milestone during the Doom gaming tournament. During the game, its transaction rate passed 1 million transactions per second (TPS). This success highlights Hydra’s scalability, with each game frame processed as a transaction. While the current TPS is at 507, with peaks over 807,000, these figures significantly outperform competitors like Solana and Ethereum. Cardano’s network has also grown in the decentralized finance applications and NFT sector, leading to increasing adoption. The project’s scalability and sustainability keep it at the top, making it a top pick for 2025. Solana (SOL): Ecosystem Growth Boost Momentum Solana (SOL) has been outstanding in 2024, garnering significant talks. Although SOL is below its all-time high, it has remarkably increased in 2024. Most importantly, Solana’s network activity and growing ecosystem fuel optimism. Solana has gained traction in 2024 by attracting meme token projects, DeFi, and NFTs. Technical indicators point to SOL seeing a price breakout to $300 in 2024. By 2025, it might finally explode to $500, leading to a notable rise. SOL trades at $241 at the time of this report. Should Solana ETF be approved in 2025, this would also enable it to set fresh highs. Rexas Finance (RXS): Redefining Real-world Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance (RXS) is a new crypto that will lead charts in 2025 after its token launches. Through its innovative approach to real-world asset tokenization, Rexas Finance has attracted a lot of interest in the crypto scene. Using blockchain technology, it converts real estate and commodities—physical objects—into digital tokens so that investors may own part of these valuable assets. The beauty of tokenization lies in its ability to lower the cost barrier. As a result, these assets can now be accessible to a wider audience, including smaller investors. A key feature of Rexas Finance is its Rexas Token Builder, which simplifies the process of converting physical assets into digital tokens. Paired with the Rexas QuickMint Bot, users can easily create tokens without technical knowledge from their smartphones or computers. This process ensures that even basic users with no technological foundation can become investors. Rexas also offers additional tools like the Rexas Launchpad, which helps asset owners raise capital for tokenized assets, enhancing liquidity and attracting more investors. Meanwhile, Rexas Estate lets individuals invest in fractional real estate, further expanding the platform’s offerings. The Rexas Finance presale has attracted investors , quickly gaining traction as it moved from stage one to nine in just three months. It has raised over $23 million, bringing it closer to its target. RXS is valued at $0.125 at stage nine and will rise to $0.150 in the next stage. Both CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko are tracking the token, and its upcoming listing on several major exchanges is expected to drive further expansion. Rexas Finance has also undergone a Certik audit to guarantee security and foster investor confidence. To celebrate its success, the project is giving 20 fortunate participants $50,000 each in prizes. Rexas is setting itself up for long-term success, intending to grow its offerings and stay relevant. Analysts expect the token to be worth $12 by 2025, offering early investors large returns. Conclusion Rexas Finance, TRON, Ripple, Cardano, and Solano have great prospects in the crypto industry. They are the best altcoins to purchase before 2025. However, Rexas Finance is unique in its innovative approach to tokenizing real-world assets. This lays a strong foundation for its growth, with analysts predicting an all-time high of $12 and above in 2025.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-10 13:52:00

Predictions suggest PEPE could reach $0.00006594 by year-end, reigniting interest in meme coins. Meanwhile, JetBolt continues to impress with its Zero-Gas Technology, eliminating transaction fees and drawing whales and reaching over 150 million tokens sold. With disruptive features that are readily available to every JetBolt holder, other whales have also been joining the presale. It’s an exciting time to be a crypto enthusiast this month, and what better way to end the year than with trending new crypto coins? Let’s break down the latest price predictions around Pepe Coin, and discover if JetBolt’s surge could continue in 2025. Pepe Coin Price Prediction: PEPE Gains Momentum as Ecosystem Expands Pepe Coin (PEPE) is being featured in news segments this December with an 18% weekly price surge, trading at $0.0000275. The rally is driven by rising open interest, bullish technical indicators, and growing investor confidence, especially from newer crypto buyers. Blockchain News cited in a tweet that Pepe was mentioned in mainstream television news together with Solana and Bitcoin. Source: X Pepe Coin was even mentioned in a recent TV news report, with a reporter calling PEPE a “good investment” alongside Bitcoin and Solana. A savvy trader recently deposited 121.75 billion PEPE tokens worth $3.22 million to Binance, securing a $2.13 million profit—a 197% gain in just 2.5 months. This marks their second major PEPE success, following a $1.23 million profit earlier this year, as whale activity continues. Following these positive developments, some analysts have made bold Pepe price predictions that the token could potentially climb to $0.0000336 in the short term and $0.00006594 by year-end. Investor interest in PEPE has reignited excitement around meme coins, with Reddit users increasingly discussing its potential. While its market performance highlights Pepe’s popularity, a growing number of crypto enthusiasts are also eyeing newer altcoins with a real-world utility like JetBolt.

Despite the correction, ADA has been one of the top-performing altcoins since November 5, showcasing its resilience amid market fluctuations. Investors remain optimistic that Cardano will continue outperforming as the broader crypto market gains momentum. Related Reading: PEPE Whales Increased Their Holdings By $1.4 Billion Yesterday – Details Top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting striking similarities between ADA’s current price chart and its 2020 performance—a year marked a bullish phase for altcoins. According to Martinez, this resemblance suggests Cardano might be gearing up for another significant rally. However, the next few weeks will be critical for confirming this trajectory, particularly as Bitcoin continues to drive the market with its strong upward momentum. The interplay between Bitcoin’s performance and altcoin activity will be pivotal in shaping ADA’s price action. If Bitcoin sustains its bullish cycle, altcoins like Cardano will likely “wake up” and follow suit. For ADA, holding above key support levels and breaking back toward its recent highs will be essential to sustain investor confidence and set the stage for a potential breakout as the market evolves. Cardano Rally Could Continue Cardano has delivered an extraordinary performance since November 5, surging over 300% in under a month. This impressive rally has captured the attention of investors and analysts, making ADA one of the standout performers in the altcoin market. However, the recent sharp drop has sparked concerns about the potential for a deeper correction, leaving many investors on edge. Analyst and investor Ali Martinez recently shared an optimistic perspective on ADA’s trajectory via X. According to Martinez, Cardano’s current price action mirrors its behavior during 2020, preceding a massive bull run. Martinez acknowledges the possibility of a dip to $0.76 but views it as a buying opportunity, underscoring his confidence by stating his plans to book profits between $4 and $6. His analysis suggests that the current pullback is a natural part of ADA’s larger bullish cycle rather than a signal of weakness. Related Reading: Dogecoin Pressing Range Highs – Can Bulls Push DOGE To ATH? Despite the recent retrace, key metrics and positive market sentiment support the case for ADA’s upward trajectory. Cardano’s robust performance over the past month highlights its resilience, and many investors remain optimistic about its long-term potential. As the crypto market evolves, ADA’s ability to hold key support levels and regain momentum will be critical in determining its next move. Price Holding Above Key Level Cardano (ADA) is trading at $1.01 after experiencing a sharp 20% dip yesterday. Despite this significant pullback, ADA has demonstrated resilience, holding firm above the critical support level of $0.87. This level has proven to be a strong foundation for ADA’s price action, suggesting that the asset remains well-positioned for further upward momentum. For ADA to continue its bullish trajectory, it must maintain its position above $0.90 in the coming days, solidifying investor confidence. However, the next critical milestone lies at the $1.25 resistance level. Breaking above this threshold will be crucial for ADA, as it would signal renewed buying interest and a potential continuation of its rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Quiet Breakout As Data Signals Rally Continuation Should ADA successfully hold above $0.90 and breach the $1.25 mark, the stage will be set for a massive continuation in its price. Such a move could attract more investors and further solidify ADA’s position as a top-performing altcoin. With the broader crypto market showing signs of strength, the coming weeks will be pivotal for ADA as it attempts to recover from recent volatility and push toward new highs.

Pepecoin Network ( PEP ), a Dogecoin ( DOGE ) hard fork, climbed to a high of $0.001736, pushing its market cap to over $151 million. The token has increased by over 3,000% since its launch in January this year. PEP’s surge has coincided with the recent rally of Pepe ( PEPE ), the third-largest meme coin in the crypto industry. Pepe has gained over 1,600% this year, and this week, its market cap rose to $10 billion. Pepecoin Network also saw gains as some crypto exchanges began listing the token. It was listed by CoinEx Global, a crypto exchange that handled over $953 million worth of coins on Dec. 10. CoinEx is the first mainstream exchange to list PEP, with others including XeggeX and Nonkyc. This development increases the odds that other exchanges such as Binance, MEXC, OKX, and Bybit may add it if the token continues to gain traction. 📢 #NewListing – $PEP 🗂 @PepecoinNetwork was created for one purpose, to create a new and fun community just like the original #Dogecoin community.

There are no confusing smart contracts that can be used by bad actors to… pic.twitter.com/7s2y2yvub5 — CoinEx Global (@coinexcom) December 10, 2024 Pepecoin Network is significantly different from Pepe in that it operates as a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that originated from a Dogecoin hard fork. A hard fork occurs when developers create a new coin from an existing one. For example, Bitcoin forked into Bitcoin Cash, while Ethereum forked into Ethereum Classic. Pepecoin, therefore, shares some features with other proof-of-work coins like Bitcoin. For instance, it has a halving mechanism that periodically reduces block rewards. Its third halving occured in November, and the next one is expected on Feb. 3 . Pepecoin aims to become the main currency for the Pepe ecosystem by offering low transaction costs. Additionally, unlike Pepe, it operates on its own blockchain, enhancing its security. You might also like: Here’s how this trader turned $3,000 into $73m with PEPE What next for the Pepecoin Network? Pepecoin Network price chart | Source: CoinGecko The PEP price has jumped sharply this month as attention shifted to Pepe’s entry into the $10 billion market cap club. This momentum has sparked more interest from investors, with its X page gaining users and its r/Pepecoin subreddit attracting over 18,000 followers. There is a strong possibility that Pepecoin Network will continue rising as long as the main Pepe token performs well. If this trend persists, the token could soar and reach a $500 million market cap during this bull run. A key driver for this growth would be the potential listing by more exchanges.

In his social media post, the renowned author predicted a potential financial market crash, which weighed on the traders’ sentiment amid the recent market selloff. Besides, he also urged investors to shift focus from traditional assets like stocks, bonds, etc. to risk-bet assets like Bitcoin, gold, and others. Robert Kiyosaki Urges Caution For Boomers In a recent post on X, Kiyosaki expressed his concern about the financial vulnerability of baby “boomers” as market conditions evolve. He argued that past trends like the real estate boom in the 1970s and stock market gains fueled by 401(k) plans have set unrealistic expectations. “When the stock market bursts, boomers will be the biggest losers,” he warned, emphasizing the need for a drastic financial shift. In addition, Kiyosaki urged younger generations to advise their parents to sell high-value assets, such as real estate and stocks, while prices remain favorable. He predicted these markets would soon face significant downturns. “The biggest crash in history is coming. Please be proactive and get rich before boomers go bust,” he said urging investors to buy Bitcoin, gold, and silver. This comment, amid the recent crypto market crash , highlights his trust in Bitcoin as a hedge against the anticipated collapse. Meanwhile, this isn’t the first time Kiyosaki has championed alternative investments. He has consistently advocated for Bitcoin, highlighting its potential to weather macroeconomic hurdles. However, his latest advice arrives amid increased volatility, with a $1.7 billion crypto market liquidation wave sparking concerns about broader market fragility. A Closer Look Into The Stock Market Kiyosaki’s dire forecast contrasts sharply with the current performance of the U.S. stock market. According to The Kobeissi Letter, the S&P 500 is on track for a historic 14th year of outperforming global markets. The index has risen 446% since 2009, far surpassing the 229% gain of the MSCI World Index. Source: The Kobeissi Letter, X Additionally, U.S. retirement savings accounts have flourished. The number of 401(k) millionaires reached 544,000 in Q3 2024, a 56% increase from the previous year. Despite this, nearly 40% of workers lack access to retirement savings plans, highlighting a growing wealth divide. Source: The Kobeissi Letter, X However, Kiyosaki’s outlook challenges the optimism surrounding these gains. He believes traditional assets are unsustainable in the long term and warns of devastating consequences if investors fail to diversify. His focus on Bitcoin, along with other hard assets like gold and silver, reflects his belief in their enduring value amid economic turmoil.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP drops to $2.39, but experts predict SEC overhaul may boost IntelMarkets, which surged 610% in presale, with AI-driven tech. Table of Contents XRP’s legal battle continues amid XRP price drop A potential turning point expected with SEC leadership change IntelMarkets: Hottest altcoin with a bright future in crypto market using AI automation New developments and future crypto space forecast Conclusion The cryptocurrency ecosphere recently faced high volatility as RIpple’s XRP price dropped to $2.39 after a peak sell-off preceded by its November rally. Crypto experts, however, still strongly believe that the SEC overhaul could create more interest among crypto enthusiasts for IntelMarkets. IntelMarkets (INTL) , which has already surged 610% in the presale stage, is looking forward to a massive 4x rise next year, due to its unique features such as AI-driven trading technology. With Paul Atkins being nominated as the upcoming SEC chair, there is a rise in optimism regarding pro-cryptocurrency policies in the United States. Let’s explore how XRP and IntelMarkets will perform in the future. XRP’s legal battle continues amid XRP price drop Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has spoken about his frustration over the media’s perception of the legal battle with the SEC. He suggested that the big outlets have fully ignored Judge Torres’s important ruling about not considering XRP as a security in Ripple’s favor. Despite this ruling, the XRP price has faced a low and is currently trading at $2.39. On-chain data indicates that XRP holders make profits after a considerable surge, creating additional selling pressure that indicates a pullback soon. According to Coinglass’s data, XRP’s long-to-short ratio of 0.85 is the lowest level in one month. The market overall indicates bearish sentiment reflected in this ratio, which is below one, explaining that more traders are expecting a fall in the price of the asset, thus hinting at the idea that a pullback might be coming for the Ripple price as well. You might also like: DOGE volume hits $10 billion, IntelMarkets leads weekly gains A potential turning point expected with SEC leadership change A potential turning point for XRP’s tough legal battle with the SEC is expected since the current chair will resign in the new year, and the power will likely be handed to Paul Atkins. Paul Atkins is a well-known advocate for regulation clarity in the cryptocurrency sector, and his nomination as the chair brings a wave of optimism for XRP’s tiff with SEC. Moreover, Atkins has a remarkable history of being pro-innovative policies, making his nomination a promising feat for cryptocurrencies, which are facing scrutiny due to the current SEC’s stand. If Paul Atkins leads SEC in the future, a more transparent and innovation-friendly approach can be expected, with clear guidelines for cryptocurrencies. IntelMarkets: Hottest altcoin with a bright future in crypto market using AI automation As Ripple is currently facing regulatory uncertainty, a new altcoin, IntelMarket , is emerging as a lucrative contender in the crypto trading sector. This cryptocurrency is currently in the seventh presale stage and has already experienced a massive 620% surge, becoming the hottest altcoin investment of the year. IntelMarkets is set to flip the space with its AI-enabled trading bots that execute high-frequency accurate trades. It uses unique AI algorithms to enable live data processing, market-related predictions, and automated trading strategies. Experts believe that the altcoin can see a major price surge in the upcoming year due to its special value proposition, and a growing demand in the crypto trading space for AI-enabled unique solutions. Since more investors look forward to automated trading solutions, IntelMarkets is in the right position to garner a considerate crypto market share. New developments and future crypto space forecast The two major crypto sector events that are set to happen in the upcoming year are the SEC’s leadership switch to Paul Atkins and IntelMarket’s new rise. Thus, a more positive year for the crypto market is expected. If Paul Atkins establishes more clear and pro-cryptocurrency regulations, Ripple could find relief from the battle and INTL could change the industry. IntelMarket’s AI-enabled trading solutions and dual-chain functionality on Ethereum and Solana’s blockchains highlight the need of the future. With 1000x leverage options, INTL is set to gather a big share with massive support from both traders and investors. Conclusion While the XRP price drop stemmed from regulatory struggle and post-November rally gains, the experts are highly positive about the explosive growth of IntelMarkets and this altcoin’s ever-growing demand among cryptocurrency traders and investors. As both assets navigate the crypto space, traders must stay vigilant and think about investing at the right time to enjoy massive growth in the future.

However, the Bank of Korea’s governor is doubtful the currency will reach past levels where it surpassed the US dollar in international trades. In a recent meeting with lawmakers, cited by Yonhap News, South Korea’s central bank Governor, Rhee Chang-Yong, said the market remains in a “wait-and-see” mode. The news comes amid fears of political instability, which has seen the country’s government ban several officials from traveling out of the country, including embattled President Yoon Suk Yeol. In the early trading hours of December 10, the USD/KRW exchange rate was reported at 1,430.53, marginally up from 1,430.30 in the prior trading session. Trading Economics forecasts suggest the won may fluctuate around 1,423.07 by the end of the current quarter but could strengthen to 1,438.53 within the next year. Won struggles amid geopolitical tensions South Korea’s declaration of martial law last Tuesday sent shockwaves through financial markets, with the crypto sector and its local currency experiencing a sharp downturn. According to crypto market research platform Kaiko, the BTC-KRW pair on South Korea’s leading exchanges, UpBit and Bithumb, experienced a dramatic drop. UpBit bore the brunt of the sell-off, with Bitcoin prices plunging 30% to 89 million Korean won, equivalent to approximately $63,000. 📊Competition on Korean markets is heating up. In this week's Data Debrief, we explore: 👉The fee war in South Korea 👉The market reaction to Uniswap Labs Wells Notice 👉Coinbase's growing dominance and more…. https://t.co/pVQvJfZIlS — Kaiko (@KaikoData) April 15, 2024 The South Korean won dropped to a two-year low of 1,443.40 per USD when President Yoon announced martial law. Analysts from MarketWatch say the price levels have dropped further as the US currency strengthens. In mid-2024, KRW had surpassed the US dollar to become the most traded currency globally. According to Kaiko, South Korea’s won surpassed the US dollar as the most traded currency against crypto in the first quarter of 2024. KRW accounted for $456 billion in cumulative trade volume on centralized crypto exchanges during this period, edging out the USD, which recorded $455 billion. At the end of April, KRW was trading at 1,465.00 per dollar. Analysts are attributing KRW’s struggles to lingering political instability and a cautious outlook among global investors. However, with China’s recent announcement of a “moderately loose” monetary policy for 2024, there’s growing optimism that the currency won’t drop further, given China’s role as South Korea’s largest trading partner. South Korean crypto market metrics South Korean crypto exchanges are showing signs of stabilization following the flash crash triggered by political turmoil last week. This is despite the initial market panic sparked by President Yoon’s martial law announcement . Bitcoin (BTC) on local exchanges, particularly UpBit, has bounced back from a sharp 30% drop during the height of the crisis when BTC briefly plunged to 89 million Korean won. As of the time of writing, BTC has stabilized near the 1,390,000 KRW range, while XRP is changing hands around the 3,000 KRW level, per Coinmarketcap data . Source: CoinMarketCap KRW has demonstrated significant volatility against Bitcoin over the past six months. Bitcoin’s KRW trading value is nearing a six-month high, up approximately 12% from its lowest point earlier this year. Year-to-date, Bitcoin has seen a positive shift against the won, with a price increase of roughly 10% compared to the crypto’s 123%.

A follow-through in BNB can take the price to a fresh high in uncharted territory. Sui blockchain recently hosted its first Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, Kage, developed by Chirp, an IoT-focused decentralized platform. This launch highlights Sui's role as a fast and secure blockchain for innovative Web3 applications. Meanwhile, Cutoshi, an ERC-20 token, is bridging the gap between conventional and digital finance and bringing it to the masses with the advanced platform. Cutoshi is not only a memecoin, bringing various utilities that solidifies its position in the market. Binance Retest Breakout Zone: Will It Continue The Momentum? Binance recently broke out of the multi-year resistance it has been facing since 2021. In June this year, it attempted another breakout; however, sellers took control immediately after the breakout. BNB was also lagging in this bull market but has now given a strong breakout associated with strong volume. On Tuesday, BNB took out the $700 psychological zone, increasing nearly 15% intraday. On Friday, Binance retested the breakout level and saw demand picking up from the breakout level. This is a clear sign of strength in Binance, indicating that momentum could soon increase. BNB is currently the sixth-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $108.38 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. It ranks just behind USDT and Solana. In November, reports revealed that sandwich attacks targeted 35.5% of the BNB Chain’s blocks, according to Decrypt. These attacks manipulate markets by exploiting decentralized exchange systems, highlighting security concerns on the BNB Chain. Despite the rise in sandwich bot activity, BNB's price showed little to no impact. Sui Blockchain Unveils Revolutionary DePIN Play-to-Earn Game The Sui blockchain has launched its first Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, bringing a fresh perspective to decentralized gaming. This groundbreaking game blends blockchain technology with physical infrastructure, allowing players to earn rewards by supporting decentralized networks. Using Sui's advanced features, the game connects real-world physical infrastructure with its ecosystem. Players can earn rewards through gaming and completing tasks that help operate and maintain decentralized networks. This adds a practical, real-world utility to P2E gaming while enhancing the in-game experience.

Meanwhile, Rollblock ($RBLK) continues to dominate the pre-sale space as industry insiders forecast stunning 50x gains as Rollblock scales this year! VeChain ($VET) Eco Chain Urges Web3 To ‘Ve Better’ VeChain is up an incredible 30% this week, as the VeChain price rises to hit $0.07. This has propelled the eco-focused VeChain to 29th place in the crypto rankings, with a market cap now in excess of $5.7 billion. In just one month, VeChain has recorded a truly impressive 260% pump, as it has been on a tear ever since bouncing from support at $0.019. VeChain recently launched NFT upgrades and node delegation for the VeChain ecosystem. This will provide greater utility for VeChain holders and offer greater governance power for the VeChain community. In VeChain's own words, ""Ve Better!"" Filecoin ($FIL) Holders Rejoice After Bullish ‘Moonvember’ Pump Filecoin has fallen by 9% today to reach $7.10. Recently, Filecoin has surprised even the most bullish of Filecoin holders after a weekly candle that added 4% to its market cap. ‘Moonvember’ truly delivered for Filecoin holders, who now find themselves up 82% in just 30 trading days. Filecoin will likely face continued resistance at the $8 level, which looks to be a serious sell wall for Filecoin traders. Recently, Filecoin worked with the Cardano chain to improve the decentralization of real-time data feeds. This should improve Filecoin adoption and further its market dominance. Rollblock ($RBLK) Looking Strong As Sports Betting Hits The Platform Rollblock ($RBLK) is delivering on its promise to bring new levels of fairness and transparency to the online gambling sector. There can be no risk of bet manipulation now that all Rollblocktransactions are secured onto the Ethereum chain. Rollblock offers a fully functioning gaming platform featuring over 7,000 community-backed classics, from blackjack to Monopoly and plenty of exclusive new launches from industry-leading developers. A brand new sports betting league will also add further revenue streams to this Gamblefi powerhouse. Now, sports experts can earn stacks of $RBLK with the accuracy of their sporting predictions. The native $RBLK token will rise to gaming dominance this cycle thanks to its highly innovative buyback scheme. This will take a percentage of Rollblock’s profits and use them to purchase $RBLK on decentralized exchanges. These buybacks will likely never see the light of day, as 60% are burned from the supply right away, and the remaining tokens are earmarked for stakersin the Rollblock holder community.

Table of Contents Uniswap introduces Uniswap V4 Binance Coin reaches a significant ATH Lunex Network shines with revenue-sharing model Lunex Network makes waves in the DeFi space This year, Binance Coin (BNB) is up 205%, while Uniswap’s performance has been underwhelming. As these established assets navigate the market, another contender has reared its head. Lunex Network (LNEX) offers low fees, interoperability, and powerful trading tools, making it a good choice for long-term investors. So how will these assets perform once 2024 ends and 2025 begins? Uniswap introduces Uniswap V4 Uniswap (UNI) has made some powerful technological advances with the recent introduction of ‘hooks’ in Uniswap’s new update, version 4. This upgrade will allow developers to create custom liquidity pools with personalized risk profiles and fee structures. This gives Uniswap users more flexibility while managing liquidity and bolsters Uniswap’s overall utility. Uniswap has seen minimal gains this year when compared with the broader DeFi sector. The question now is whether Uniswap v4 can revive investor interest.

In 2024, Shayne Coplan, founder of Polymarket, turned them into a multibillion-dollar business and a popular barometer of the political winds, cited by everyone from Donald Trump to CNN . In so doing, he demonstrated a real-world consumer use case for cryptocurrency – and, some argue, a new model for news media at a time when the public has lost trust in traditional sources of information. ""Most people I know were checking Polymarket for odds during the election,"" said Meltem Demirors, a crypto O.G. and early investor in the company. ""You're creating so much signal that you're getting people who don't care about crypto, and would never care about crypto"" to look at the site. Like many crypto founders – and even some successful tech founders – the 26-year-old Coplan also took what looks like a calculated risk in pushing the regulatory envelope. In mid-November, the FBI raided his New York home and confiscated his devices, reportedly as part of a Department of Justice investigation into whether Polymarket was operating illegally in the U.S. Coplan has laid low since then, and would not comment for this article. However that investigation shakes out, Coplan has brought unprecedented attention to an idea long advanced by academics: That the wisdom of the crowd, backed by skin in the game , can produce more accurate forecasts – or at least, more accurate gauges of sentiment – than traditional experts or polls. ""This man made prediction markets mainstream. Simple as that,"" said Hart Lambur, co-founder of UMA, the decentralized oracle service that Polymarket uses to resolve contracts. ""He's just been the guy that's grinded through the pain and been dedicated to the Polymarket concept for years."" A stubborn wunderkind Demirors recalls meeting Coplan in 2018, when the college dropout was about 18 years old, on the recommendation of a crypto colleague. ""Shayne came to my office, and we basically just argued with each other for two hours,"" Demirors said. ""I was like, 'wow, this kid is sharp.'"" Pratik Chougule, executive director of the Coalition for Political Forecasting , got a similar impression interviewing Coplan for the Star Spangled Gamblers podcast early in Polymarket's history. ""He's a very unique figure in the sense that he's this creative artist type, but he's also delved deeply into academic literature, and he really understands technicalities of building something on the blockchain,"" said Chougule. Demirors said that in addition to investing in an early Polymarket round during the pandemic, she has been ""a little bit of a big sis"" to Coplan, acting as a sounding board as he built the business. ""He's just an opinionated, stubborn little f*ck, and I love him,"" she said, adding that Coplan's headstrong personality served him well as a founder. Early on, ""people tried to pressure him to launch a token, and he was like, 'we're not doing that.' People tried to pressure him to open up markets before the infrastructure was ready. He was like, 'we're not doing that.'"" Volume and vindication Flip Pidot, a veteran prediction market trader and analyst, estimated that Polymarket racked up $3.6 billion in trading volume just from this year's U.S. presidential election, giving it a dominant, 74% market share. In previous election cycles, the entire prediction market industry never cracked $1 billion, he said. Many saw the election as a moment of vindication for Polymarket. In the weeks leading up to the event, Polymarket odds signaled a sizable lead for Trump while the polls showed a toss-up between the former president and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump won handily . Read more: Polymarket 'Manipulation' Claims Miss the Mark Yet a clearer validation of Polymarket's informational value arguably came in July, when President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris. For months, cable news' talking heads dismissed any talk of replacing Biden on the Democratic ticket, despite the 82-year-old's frequent public stumbles. Polymarket told a different story: Even after Biden won enough votes to clinch the Democratic nomination in mid-March, traders gave him only an 80% chance of being the nominee. A separate contract asking point blank if he would drop out gave low but nontrivial odds in the teens and 20s throughout the first half of the year. ""People were like, 'Oh, these [traders] are right-wing crypto bros, they're just conspiracy theorists . They don't know what's going on,'"" said a Polymarket user who goes by the handle CSPTrading. ""And they were completely vindicated."" Following Biden's disastrous, doddering performance in the June 27 debate with Trump, the narrative quickly changed, with Democratic leaders and donors calling for the incumbent to step aside, as he did a month later. More so than with the election, the pundits (who had nothing to lose from being wrong) got it wrong by claiming epistemic certainty. Polymarket's traders (who had money on the line) got it right by telegraphing a modicum of doubt. Spectrum of decentralization In prediction markets, traders bet on verifiable outcomes of events in specified timeframes. (Which movie will gross the biggest box office of 2024? Will this be the hottest year on record?) Questions are usually framed as yes-or-no propositions, for which traders can purchase ""yes"" or ""no"" shares. Each share pays $1 (or, in Polymarket's case, the equivalent in crypto) if the prediction comes true, bupkis if not. Bettors can buy and sell shares any time, and prices fluctuate like on stock markets. Expressed as cents on the dollar, these prices signal the market's assessment of an outcome's probability. On Dec. 4, for example, ""yes"" shares for the Detroit Lions winning the next Super Bowl traded at 18 cents on Polymarket, meaning bettors gave the team an 18% chance of victory. The corresponding ""no"" shares were priced at 82 cents. Prediction markets date back to the late 19th Century , when Wall Street traders would bet millions (tens of millions in today's dollars) on city, state and national elections. ""There was more money bet in presidential betting markets than in the stock markets at the time,"" said Robin Hanson, an economist at George Mason University. Since the late-1980s, Hanson has championed prediction markets as a way to aggregate information and thereby improve decision making by corporations and even governments. ""One of the obstacles, of course, was that betting markets had many legal barriers, and cultural barriers [because] many people disapproved of them and thought they had little social value,"" Hanson told CoinDesk. This is one reason why blockchains, decentralized financial systems with no central authority that a government can shut down, have long been seen as a natural home for prediction markets. They are one of the use cases Ethereum architect Vitalik Buterin described in his 2014 white paper for what would become the second-largest blockchain. (As a teenager, Coplan bought into the Ethereum crowdsale ; a decade later, Buterin invested in Polymarket.) The modern-day prediction markets Hanson inspired can be viewed on a spectrum. On one end there's the model used by Augur , one of the first projects built on Ethereum. ""One of the advantages is that it's 100% decentralized,"" said Joey Krug, who co-founded Augur in 2015. ""If you're building it, you're effectively writing code. It's effectively free speech, assuming you're not taking a fee for yourself, and it's also pretty flexible in the sense that anyone can kind of create a market on anything."" But as crypto veterans know all too well, decentralization requires trade-offs. Best of both worlds? ""It's really hard to market if you're building something decentralized,"" said Krug, who is now a partner at Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and led its investment in Polymarket's $45 million Series B round . (For whatever it's worth: Thiel was an early investor in Bullish, two years before that company acquired CoinDesk. Bullish has not disclosed a cap table since 2021, and CoinDesk journalists do not know the current roster of investors in its parent.) ""The whole point is that you don't want to take on the regulatory version of being this central operator that does everything,"" Krug said. ""And so you don't really market it. … You don't do all this stuff that you need to do to actually get usage."" Consequently, Augur had very little . (In fairness, Polymarket benefits from Ethereum infrastructure that wasn't around when Augur debuted). On the ""very centralized"" end of the continuum, there's Kalshi. Founded in 2018, the startup boasts about its status as the first (and, until recently, only) regulated prediction market platform in the U.S. This route has its own disadvantages. In 2023, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission denied Kalshi's application to list election-related contracts, and the company spent most of this year fighting the regulator in court for the right to do so – while watching Polymarket enjoy the volume and publicity from political betting fever. Only after an appeals court upheld a ruling in its favor in early October, a month before the election, was Kalshi cleared to list political contracts . Polymarket is in the middle of the spectrum. In some ways, it's decentralized. It uses smart contracts on a blockchain (Polygon, a layer-two, or auxiliary network, to Ethereum) and doesn't custody users' funds. Bets are denominated in USDC, a stablecoin that trades 1:1 for dollars. Early on, an internal market integrity committee resolved Polymarket's contracts, before Coplan's team delegated this job to the decentralized UMA protocol. ""If you are sufficiently sophisticated, you can interact entirely with Polymarket without ever touching the website,"" said Haseeb Qureshi, a managing partner at Dragonfly, another VC investor in Polymarket. ""The trades settle all on-chain. You can interact with everything through APIs."" But you don't have to. Unlike Augur (which co-founder Krug admitted ""kind of sucks to use"") or for that matter many crypto exchanges (decentralized or otherwise ), traders have found Polymarket easy to use and reliable. ""The platform's really smooth, it runs really well,"" said CSPTrading. ""On election night, it was basically up the entire time, which is crazy because… all the other sites were crashing."" 'Decentralized enough' One way Polymarket is centralized is that it curates markets. Community members can suggest ideas in the Discord server, but the team decides which ones get posted. With little fanfare, the platform recently debuted a "" creators"" page where big names like polling analyst Nate Silver (a Polymarket advisor ) and the financial blogger Zerohedge have their own branded markets. ""I think Polymarket is moving its way towards more decentralization,"" said Qureshi. ""They're also right to be doing this in a gradual, thoughtful way, rather than just turning everything on and saying, 'let the dogs of hell run loose.'"" In Demirors' view, Polymarket is ""decentralized enough."" The key to winning this game, she said, is amassing ""a large enough global pool of market participants,"" because traders want to be where the liquidity is. By building on crypto rails at the right time, that's what Polymarket has become. ""That's the beauty of crypto. It's global. Anyone with a wallet address can join,"" Demirors said. However, Polymarket wasn't decentralized enough for U.S. regulators to consider it untouchable. In January 2022, the company paid a $1.4 million civil penalty and entered into a settlement with the CFTC, which said the company had been operating an unlicensed derivatives exchange because its services were available to U.S. citizens and residents. Since then, the company has blocked U.S. IP addresses, but wily Americans have been using virtual private networks, or VPNs, to get around the geofencing. Apparently, the government thinks the company should have done more to keep Americans out, perhaps by requiring customer identification. (which Polymarket has requested only from a subset of users). ""Polymarket is required to adhere to the terms of the settlement they reached with the CFTC. Full stop,"" a CFTC spokesperson told CoinDesk in late October, two weeks before law enforcement officials raided Coplan's home. ""That means they cannot accept any business from people living in the United States."" In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Coplan called the raid a "" last-ditch effort "" by the lame-duck Biden administration ""to go after companies they deem to be associated with political opponents,"" though he reiterated that Polymarket is nonpartisan. Challenges ahead Polymarket's investors and supporters are hopeful the incoming Trump administration will end the probe as part of a broad pro-crypto agenda. Even if Polymarket receives clemency, Coplan faces other challenges, not least of all maintaining volumes without a galvanizing tent-pole event like a presidential election. The company, which currently doesn't charge trading fees, also must figure out a long-term revenue model. And a handful of outcome disputes , including for a market on whether Trump's son Barron was ""involved"" in a memecoin , suggest Polymarket needs to improve its resolution criteria . Yet, by at least one measure, Coplan has already succeeded. ""Shayne's vision has always been that this is a product that can disrupt traditional media and political discourse … and he achieved that"" said Chougule, at the Coalition for Political Forecasting. ""This was always the dream, that you would have major talk shows, cable news, places like Politico and Bloomberg citing prediction markets as a source of information, as something that can enlighten even people who know nothing or don't care about prediction markets.""",Tech|Most Influential 2024|Polymarket|Prediction Markets,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-10 15:48:50

The decision was announced by the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance Abdolnaser Hemmati at a national event in Tehran, where he said that they aim to minimize the risks associated with crypto while reaping all its benefits. The country’s Central Bank will be in charge of managing all the digital assets. From laying down the regulatory framework and helping financial institutions adopt digital assets to monitoring transactions and ensuring compliance, it’s all up to the Central Bank . It has already published a set of guidelines regarding tax compliance and anti-money laundering measures. Currently, Iranian investors hold between $30B and $50B worth of crypto assets, roughly one-third of the company’s total gold market. The Crucial Timing of the Decision The timing of this decision couldn’t have been better. Hemmati believes that will have several benefits: Attract domestic and foreign investors Create more job opportunities and drive employment among the youth Integrate Iran with the global economy and simplify its access to a much broader range of financial services (those that only allow crypto transactions) But there’s one major reason that beats everything else – protection from sanctions. As Donald Trump prepares for his second term in the White House, Iran must brace itself. The first time Trump was president, he withdrew the Iran nuclear deal. One of the reasons he cited was that the deal was one-sided, benefitting mostly Iran and not bringing much of the peace it promised to the other countries. Note : The Iran Nuclear deal , also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is a landmark agreement between Iran and the superpowers of the world (including the USA) under which Iran promised to dismantle its nuclear program and allow the other countries to closely inspect its nuclear facilities in return for relief from billions of dollars worth of sanctions. Will the US Impose Sanctions? With the sanctions back, Iran’s economy took a massive hit, and the country has been struggling ever since. Hence, now that Trump is back, there are rumors that he might revive his so-called ‘maximum pressure policy’ against Iran with more sanctions. The chances of a revival of this policy seem low. JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram states that imposing more sanctions on Iran can severely affect the global oil supply, removing approximately 1 million barrels of oil per day from the supply chain. But you never know with Trump, so Iran has wisely decided to buckle up . Iran is making other compromises as well. For instance, on Tuesday, the UN declared that Iran has decided to stop producing enriched uranium that it could use to make bombs. Also, new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian had previously said that establishing cordial relations with the West, getting relief from sanctions, and restoring ‘normality’ to Iranians is his primary goal for this term.",Cryptocurrency Market News|crypto|Donald Trump|iran,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|COMMODITY|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-10 15:49:16

Meet Donald Trump New Crypto and AI Strategist,https://coingape.com/trending/who-is-david-sacks-meet-donald-trump-new-crypto-and-ai-strategist/,"Amid Donald Trump’s mission to build a crypto-friendly administration this presidency, he has appointed David Sacks as the Crypto and AI strategist. This is exciting for the crypto industry, especially as the market is struggling on the charts. With this information, hopes are building for Trump’s presidency, as his winning alone has brought the crypto market rally, so his presidency might push it for even better. During his presidential campaigns, Donald Trump promised 11 things to the crypto industry, including making America the crypto capital and the Bitcoin superpower of the world. This and many other pledges have brought him to the 47th US President position, and he has already begun working for the same, as he is on a mission to bring a crypto-friendly administration. Who is David Sacks? David Sacks is a 52-year-old South African-American entrepreneur who has now gained the position to overlook crypto regulation with his position as Crypto Czar. He is even known for his popular All in Popular podcast, where he talks about politics, the economy, and various topics, but this is nothing compared to his venture capitalist and author attributes. David has invested as an angel investor for 20 years in world-famous tech businesses like Facebook, Airbnb, Uber, and many others. He was even Paypal’s COO and founder of Yammer. More importantly, he is one of the greatest pals with Elon Musk, the multi-billionaire Tesla founder and the D.O.G.E leader. Interestingly, he has recently shared key highlights about D.O.G.E and what is coming next. Getting back to the topic, David is the White House Crypto Czar and AI strategist under Donald Trump’s second presidency. In the last 52 years, David has experienced multiple sectors, including film production, where he produced the two Golden Globes and Best Motion Picture award winner film ‘Thank You for Smoking.’ David Sacks Enters Public Sector For The First Time For all of his life, David Sacks has invested his time in the private sector but is finally getting involved with the public sector as the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology and the White House AI and Crypto Czar. Trump has custom-created this role role to develop crypto regulation for the $3.44B crypto industry. As per Donald Trump’s official announcement, David Sacks would “Safeguard Free Speech online” and would work on legal frameworks for the crypto industry so that it and AI could thrive in the US. Interestingly, David Sacks was quite critical of Donald Trump a few years ago, but that has changed this year. He began associating with Trump at the beginning of 2024 and even hosted a fundraiser for Trump. Now, he is supposed to join him in this presidency. David has already shown enthusiasm about his new role and promised to look into Operation Choke Point 2.0 . However, this role limits David to an advisor position best, as David will only work to represent the crypto industry positively to Congress. Regardless, this new role is also receiving concerns and hate due to his limited experience in the public sector. Some even have commented on the conflict of interests due to the continuation of his involvement with the private sector, as he will be working part-time only. The Bloomberg report states that he is a “special government employee” who will work for around 130 days/ year. How Does His Appointment Affect the Crypto Market? The crypto industry has shown enthusiasm about David Sacks’ appointment as Crypto and AI Strategist. Crypto investors have taken it as a sign of crypto-friendly regulations. Such events pushed the Bitcoin price to $100K earlier, but the same is declining today, currently trading at $98.2k. Many crypto analysts claim that the crypto market lacks new stimulus to assist the market with further growth. Moreover, one even claimed to witness a downfall to Donald Trump’s inauguration in January 2025. However, despite the outcome, the market does show enthusiasm around Trump revealing his pick for his presidency. Now, the biggest stimulus will be Gary Gensler’s resignation in January.

The slump in the asset’s price comes amid a broader crypto market crash, indicating a waning risk-bet appetite of the investors. However, despite the recent pullback, the market pundits remain bullish about the future trajectory of Ripple’s native crypto. For context, in a recent X post, a renowned crypto market figure predicts XRP to hit $4.5 with a potential timeline. Top Expert Predicts XRP Price To Hit $4.5 The recent slump in the XRP price has weighed on investors’ sentiment, with many anticipating a further dip ahead. However, it appears that the recent crypto market crash is part of its ongoing rally. For context, a flurry of experts have previously said that some pullbacks in Bitcoin and the top altcoins are expected during the ongoing crypto market boom. However, despite that, market expert and renowned figure in the crypto market, Ben Armstrong, also known as The BitBoy, shared a bullish forecast for XRP. The influencer said that Ripple’s native crypto is gearing up for a breakout ahead. In a recent X post, BitBoy said that XRP is poised to hit $4.50 by this year’s end or as soon as January 2025. Source: The BitBoy, X This comment has fueled optimism in the market, especially after a robust rally in the crypto’s price recently. Ripple’s native crypto touched a high of $2.9 last week, indicating strong market confidence, but still waiting to break its ATH of $3.84 noted in 2018. Meanwhile, this comment also comes as anticipation soars towards a pro-crypto regulation in the US after Donald Trump’s election win. In addition, the resignation announcement of US SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whom many deem as an anti-crypto regulator, has further bolstered the market sentiment. What’s Next For Ripple’s Native Crypto? XRP price today was down nearly 12% and exchanged hands at $2.12, while its one-day trading volume soared 57% to $21.42 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high of $2.46. Furthermore, XRP Futures Open Interest plunged 22% amid a gloomy sentiment in the broader market. Notably, the broader crypto market has faced massive liquidation, as investors appear to be taking a pause after the recent robust rally. Besides, top crypto market expert Ali Martinez has recently highlighted a bullish path ahead for XRP. In a recent X post, Martinez said that Ripple’s native crypto is likely to retreat to the $2.25 level, which would provide a buying opportunity for investors at a lower price. Additionally, he said that following the dip, the asset’s price will target the $4.40 level, sparking market optimism. Source: Ali Martinez, X In addition, another prominent market analyst EGRAG CRYPTO also shared a critical analysis for XRP. The analyst noted that XRP could continue its upward run after closing above the $2.70 next. Besides, he also noted that $1.96 is a critical level for Ripple’s native crypto, and defending the mark is crucial. In other words, as long as XRP holds above the $1.96 level, it could continue its run toward the north, the analyst said.

Here Are the Striking Results!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/binance-and-coinbase-altcoin-listing-differences-listed-which-one-has-more-effect-on-price-here-are-the-striking-results/,"While stock market listings are very important for the relevant altcoins, there are big increases in prices. In these listings, the fact that the relevant altcoin is a memecoin ensures that there is a further increase due to the interest of investors. At this point, while investors closely follow the listings of exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase, on-chain analyst Ai shared his analysis of Coinbase's listing criteria and the path it followed. Accordingly, while Coinbase added 34 altcoins to its listing roadmap in 2024, it was stated that seven of them were memecoins and constituted 20.58% of the total rate. It was also stated that 71% of the altcoins listed by Coinbase have a market value of more than $500 million. At this point, the analyst analyzed the differences and paths of Binance and Coinbase in listings and compared the listings of the two exchanges. Accordingly, Coinbase has added a total of 34 tokens to its listing roadmap since 2024, while continuing its memecoin listings mainly with 7 memecoins after October. In contrast, Binance has listed a total of 14 memecoins since October. Which Altcoins Do Binance and Coinbase Prefer? According to the analysis, Binance mostly preferred Solana (SOL)-based memecoins in its memecoin listings, while Coinbase did not prefer SOL-based ones. 57% of Coinbase's listings were Ethereum (ETH)-based altcoins, while 28.6% were Solana and Base-based altcoins. Stating that another difference is related to the market value of the listed memecoin, the analyst shared that Coinbase lists altcoins with higher market values. At this point, the analyst noted that the entire market cap listed on Coinbase exceeds $100 million, with 71% even exceeding $500 million, adding, “There doesn't seem to be a small market cap token on Coinbase right now, like NEIRO/ACT listed on Binance.” Pointing out that Coinbase listed after Binance, the analyst stated that, with the exception of DEGEN, other memecoins were listed after Binance and at least a month later. Stating that Coinbase's stance towards memecoins is cautious, the analyst said that it is relatively more conservative than Binance in terms of listing. Listing Frequency! Noting that since October, the number of Memecoins listed on Binance has been twice that of Coinbase, the analyst said that Binance's stance on memecoin listing has become more open and positive. “….Binance seems to prefer to actively list new tokens that are popular in the community, even if their market cap is low.” Price Impact! Revealing that Binance is more effective in this regard, the analyst stated that Coinbase's listing effect is clearly lower than Binance. *This is not investment advice.

This decision allows licensed entities operating within the ADGM to offer services related to Tether USDT. The milestone positions the stablecoin for broader integration into the UAE’s growing digital finance ecosystem. Tether’s USDT Approved as Accepted Virtual Asset in Abu Dhabi Global Market According to a recent blog post, the ADGM has officially granted Tether USDT the status of an Accepted Virtual Asset. This approval marks an important step for stablecoin in its adoption across regulated financial markets. With Tether USDT boasting a market capitalization exceeding $138 billion, this recognition solidifies its position as a key player in the digital asset market. Licensed financial service providers within ADGM are now authorized to offer services related to Tether USDT, which include trading, storage, and other financial services. The approval is a move to foster the growth of digital assets in the UAE. Following the development, Paolo Ardoino, Tether CEO commented, “The UAE’s forward-thinking approach to virtual asset regulation sets a global benchmark, and we are proud that USDT can play a pivotal role in driving economic progress and digital transformation in the region. This approval highlights Tether’s dedication to building bridges between traditional and decentralized economies while ensuring security, trust, and efficiency for users worldwide.” Integration Into The UAE Financial Ecosystem The recognition of Tether USDT aligns with the UAE’s broader strategy to become a leading global hub for digital finance. The UAE has made substantial investments in blockchain technology and virtual asset regulation. Just last month, Ripple revealed its interest in launching a Dirham-backed stablecoin in the UAE, aligning with the country’s progressive digital asset regulations. The inclusion of Tether USDT in the ADGM framework offers increased opportunities for financial service providers in the UAE to integrate stablecoins into their operations. Stablecoins provide a bridge between traditional financial systems and the emerging digital economy. This is key for the region’s future growth in digital assets. Moreover, as of Q4 2024, USDT has achieved a notable milestone with over 109 million on-chain wallets holding the stablecoin. This level of adoption underscores the growing demand for stablecoins across global markets. Also, the number of wallets holding more than one cent of USDT has increased by 71% over the past year.

Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) crashed to a low of $0.3570, its lowest level since Nov. 23, and about 45% below its highest point this year. This decline is part of the ongoing meltdown in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin ( BTC ), which often sets the tone for the broader crypto industry, dropped to $97,700, significantly lower than last week’s high of $104,000. Stellar’s retreat also coincided with Ripple ( XRP ) dropping to a key support level of $2, down 25% from its all-time high. XLM often experiences larger swings than XRP. For instance, XLM surged by over 500% in November, compared to XRP’s 450% rise. You might also like: Hedera price prediction: can it continue its bullish momentum? Despite the current downturn, some potential bullish catalysts could push Stellar’s price higher in the long term. First, there are rising odds that Donald Trump’s administration may be more favorable to the crypto industry. In a statement this week, Eric Trump noted that his father was committed to make the US the crypto capital of the world. He has already nominated Paul Atkins , a well-regarded regulator, to be the next SEC chair. Second, there is growing anticipation of a spot XLM ETF in 2025, which could attract significant inflows from institutional investors. Additionally, more developers are adopting the Stellar blockchain, with the total value locked in its decentralized finance network rising to $46 million . Stellar’s stablecoin market cap currently stands at over $146 million. Stellar price analysis XLM price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart indicates that XLM’s price has suffered a harsh reversal, as previously predicted . This pullback followed the formation of a near double-top pattern at $0.6040, a well-known bearish market signal. Stellar’s price has fallen below the neckline at $0.4168 and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. This decline is partly attributed to the coin entering the markdown phase of the Wyckoff Method. According to Wyckoff’s theory, assets go through four phases: accumulation, markup, distribution, and markdown. The markdown phase is characterized by supply outpacing demand. If this trend continues, the next potential level to watch is $0.2900, corresponding to the 61.8% retracement point. This target also aligns with the double-top measurement. In the long term, however, there are odds that the Stellar price will bounce back and reach $1 . This view will become valid if it rises above the year-to-date high at $0.6355.

Optimism price prediction for 2027 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $9.19. In 2030, OP tokens will range between $25.03 to $30.96 with an average value of $25.93. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, which contributes to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon?

Resistance for OP is present at $2.64. Support for OP/USD is present at $2.20. The Optimism price analysis for 10 December shows a significant drop, with a decline from approximately $2.47 to $2.27. The trendline indicates a bearish momentum, with lower highs throughout the day. Support levels appear around $2.20, where the price found temporary stability during sell-offs. The nearest resistance is at $2.64, representing a point where buyers may face selling pressure if the price retraces upward. If Optimism breaks below $2.20, the next target could be around $2.10. Conversely, a recovery above $2.35 could propel it toward $2.50, provided bullish sentiment returns. Optimism price analysis 1-day chart: Bears are in control as OP prices fail to breakout The 1-day Optimism price analysis shows a bearish trend for today as the price has depreciated today as well. The bearish momentum has been continuing over the past few hours, and the coin has not seen any major bullish momentum. The price has been lowered to $2.27 and is currently trading below the $3.00 level. The coin is expected to remain bearish in the near term, as are the technical indicators. On the other hand, if the bulls can defend the $2.64 level, then the price could rise toward $2.50 in the coming days. Bears are in control as OP prices fail to breakout The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently trading around the 50 levels, indicating that there is no major momentum in favor of either the bulls or the bears. The MACD indicator is also showing a bearish divergence, suggesting that the price may continue to remain under pressure. OP/USD 4-hour price chart: Bears are in charge as OP’s price drop The hourly Optimism price analysis also shows that the coin is in a bearish trend and could drop to $2.00 if the current support level is breached. The immediate resistance is located near the $2.64 level, and if the bulls can break this, then the price could rise toward $3.00 in the near term. Bears are in charge as OP ‘s price drop The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently shows a bearish trend, indicating that the bears are in control of the market at this time, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) on the 4-hour timeframe is bearish as the signal line (blue) is above the MACD line (red). This indicates that the bears are in control of the market.

Optimism price analysis shows that the market is in a bearish trend and that prices are likely to continue decreasing in the near future. The resistance for the OP/USD pair is at $2.64, and if it breaks below this level, the market may experience further bearish pressure. On the other hand, if the buying pressure increases significantly, the market may be able to break out of this bearish trend. Technical indicators are also pointing to a bearish trend, with the RSI and MACD both in the bearish zone. Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility may lead to a breakout in either direction depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up on $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in the price of OP. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and would require an unprecedented level of growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Atkins, a seasoned SEC veteran and proud crypto advocate, said the US regulatory environment failed to accommodate blockchain, contributing to one of the most infamous crashes in financial history. Atkins didn’t deny SBF’s fraudulent behavior but argued that the government shares some of the responsibility. Speaking on a podcast, he said, “The collapse of FTX was this international debacle that happened because, I think, the U.S. didn’t make our rules accommodating to this new technology.” Paul Atkins had a front-row seat to the FTX disaster Atkins’ consulting firm, Patomak Global Partners, had direct ties to the defunct exchange. Court filings show that Patomak was listed as a creditor in FTX’s bankruptcy, tied to a board advisory agreement signed in January 2022, just ten months before the collapse. The company also served as a lobbyist for FTX. Despite his connections to the failed exchange, the SEC chair has doubled down on his criticism of the US government’s regulatory approach. He pointed out that unclear and overly restrictive rules forced major players like Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, to operate overseas. Binance had to pay $4 billion in penalties to settle US allegations of violating money-laundering laws and sanctions last year. “Binance is mainly overseas because they cannot comply with the regulations as written by the SEC and still operate with these decentralized distributed ledger-type assets,” Atkins said. Atkins isn’t just pointing fingers, though; he’s also proposing solutions. He’s endorsed SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s Token Safe Harbor Act, which would give blockchain developers a grace period to build decentralized networks before facing federal securities laws. Peirce, a longtime ally of Atkins, publicly praised his nomination, calling him the “ideal choice” to lead the SEC. A crypto-friendly administration Once skeptical of digital currencies, Trump has vowed to champion the crypto industry, a sharp contrast to the Biden administration’s hardline crackdown. With Atkins in charge, the SEC will take a more lenient approach to crypto regulation. Hours after the announcement of his nomination, Bitcoin surged past $100,000 for the first time ever. However, not everyone is thrilled. Critics argue that Atkins’ pro-crypto stance could embolden bad actors. Many anticipate fewer enforcement actions against crypto companies, though ongoing cases against Coinbase and Kraken may still proceed. John Reed Stark, a former SEC enforcement chief, said Atkins would likely “review a spreadsheet of all active litigation” and decide which cases to dismiss, settle, or push forward. Atkins’ critics argue that this could set a dangerous precedent. By easing regulatory pressure, they fear the SEC could lose its grip on an industry notorious for volatility and fraud. On the other hand, Atkins’ supporters, including Richard Breeden, a former SEC chair who worked with Atkins in the 1990s, see him as a fair and balanced regulator. “If I were in the crypto industry, I’d be thrilled to have someone with his knowledge in charge,” Breeden said .

Table of Contents Monero partnership with unstoppable domains enhances privacy AVAX analysis: Key resistance and support levels to watch Web3Bay’s 3BAY token presale shows 4250% ROI potential Wrapping up The push for privacy and decentralization in the crypto space has led to exciting developments this week. A Monero (XMR) partnership with Unstoppable Domains introduced the new .xmr domain, enhancing privacy and usability for Monero users. Meanwhile, a recent AVAX analysis shows potential for a breakout, with buyers pushing toward key resistance levels. With demand surging for secure, decentralized platforms, Web3Bay is set to redefine online transactions. This decentralized e-commerce platform bridges user-controlled markets and traditional shopping. Currently in its first presale stage, its native 3BAY token is priced at $0.003, with forecasts suggesting an impressive 4250% ROI as interest grows. Monero partnership with unstoppable domains enhances privacy Unstoppable Domains has launched a privacy-focused .xmr domain through its new Monero partnership with Cake Wallet. This collaboration introduces the .xmr top-level domain (TLD), allowing Monero users to create simple, human-readable addresses like “username.xmr” for streamlined transactions while maintaining Monero’s strong emphasis on privacy. With Cake Wallet integrating support for this TLD, Monero users can now manage assets more easily across Unstoppable Domains’ extensive network of 865+ supported applications. The Monero partnership is expected to enhance usability within the Monero community, though achieving broader adoption may pose challenges as privacy demands expand across multiple blockchain platforms. AVAX analysis: Key resistance and support levels to watch The recent AVAX price analysis shows that Avalanche’s price has turned upward, rebounding from $22.35 on November 5 to rise above the 20-day EMA at $25.59 on November 6. This movement suggests strong buying interest at lower levels. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates a potential rally, with AVAX/USDT possibly aiming for a key resistance line. If buyers push past this barrier, the next targets could be $33 and eventually $37.50. However, if sellers regain control and drive AVAX below $22.35, a further decline toward $20.50 may be expected. Web3Bay’s 3BAY token presale shows 4250% ROI potential As interest grows in secure, user-driven online platforms, Web3Bay introduces a decentralized marketplace designed to transform digital transactions. Unlike traditional e-commerce sites that centralize control, Web3Bay empowers users with a blockchain-based approach that emphasizes transparency, security, and user participation. The 3BAY token plays a central role in this ecosystem, enabling transactions, rewarding user engagement, and giving holders the ability to help shape the platform’s future. Priced at $0.003 in its first presale stage, the 3BAY token presents an enticing opportunity for early participants. Market forecasts suggest a potential 4250% ROI upon project launch, positioning early adopters to benefit from Web3Bay’s anticipated growth. This initial stage allows supporters to secure tokens at a low entry price as the platform builds momentum. Opportunities to get in at the ground level of a project like Web3Bay don’t come around often. As the demand for a secure, decentralized e-commerce platform rises, the 3BAY token could quickly become highly sought-after. Those who join the presale now have a chance to be part of a potentially groundbreaking shift in online transactions, before the platform reaches the wider market. Wrapping up Monero’s partnership with Unstoppable Domains strengthens its privacy focus, introducing the .xmr domain for secure transactions. AVAX shows potential for a breakout as buyers approach key resistance levels. Meanwhile, Web3Bay, a decentralized e-commerce platform, presents an appealing opportunity for early adopters. Now in its presale stage, the 3BAY token is priced at $0.003, with forecasts suggesting a potential 4250% ROI. With Web3Bay’s unique approach, early supporters have the chance to participate in a project that could reshape the future of online transactions.

Our dYdX price prediction for 2024 expects a maximum price of $2.8. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention late last year with the launch of its proprietary blockchain. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency dYdX Token dYdX Price $2 Market Cap $611.61M Trading Volume $36.99M Circulating Supply 643.93M dYdX All-time High $4.53 All-time Low $0.8067 24-hour high $2.2 24-hour low $1.98 dYdX price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $2 Price Prediction $ 5.72 (223.31%) Fear & Greed Index 76 (Extreme Greed) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 17.43% Green Days 18/30 (60%) 50-Day SMA $ 1.194069 200-Day SMA $ 1.4366 14-Day RSI 72.34 dYdX price analysis: dYdX faces a bearish pressure toward $2 TL;DR Breakdown: dYdX price analysis shows that dYdX is facing selling demand. Resistance for dYdX is present at $2.3454 Support for dYdX/USD is present at $1.6702 The dYdX price analysis for 10 December confirms that dYdX is facing increased selling pressure as the price drops toward $2. Currently, there’s a strong domination from both buyers and sellers. dYdX price analysis 1-day chart: dYdX price faces drop toward $2 An analysis of the daily dYdX price chart shows that the token is facing bearish pressure as it aims to hold on to its momentum. In recent hours, the price of dYdX has been declining toward $2; however, it is facing minor buying pressure from bulls. The 24-hour volume has declined to $112 million, plunging interest in trading today. dYdX is trading at $2, decreasing by over 1.4% in the last 24 hours. dYdX shows bullish volatility The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level but currently trades above the midline at 57, hinting that bullish pressure is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. dYdX/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour dYdX price chart suggests that bears are strengthening their position as they aim to hold the price below the EMA trend lines. Bulls are maintaining buying confidence as the dYdX price aims for further surges. dYdX price chart The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.42, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line and the indicator aims for a negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence. dYdX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 1.450985 BUY SMA 5 $ 1.535278 BUY SMA 10 $ 1.518048 BUY SMA 21 $ 1.401292 BUY SMA 50 $ 1.194069 BUY SMA 100 $ 1.070799 BUY SMA 200 $ 1.4366 BUY Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 1.368526 BUY EMA 5 $ 1.263628 BUY EMA 10 $ 1.139506 BUY EMA 21 $ 1.047047 BUY EMA 50 $ 1.012846 BUY EMA 100 $ 1.130664 BUY EMA 200 $ 1.485763 BUY What to expect from dYdX price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $2.3454, it will fuel a bullish rally to $2.7439. dYdX price chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.6702, beginning a bearish trend to $1.1171. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? Today, dYdX faced intense selling pressure as it failed to surge above $2.2. However, buyers are defending further declines and aiming for a quick recovery. Will dYdX price recover? If buyers hold the buying momentum of dYdX and send it past the $2.5 mark, we might see a significant recovery in the coming hours. The current low might be a good time to buy and this might create a strong support level for dYdX’s price. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiments, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years.

Recent news/opinion on dYdX dYdX announced a 35% cut in staff strength The decentralized trading platform dYdX, based in Switzerland, has announced a 35% cut in its core workforce. CEO Antonio Juliano shared the initial news in a short post on X, describing the decision as “sad” and committing to share a more detailed explanation later. dYdX price prediction December 2024 November was a bullish month for dYdX as the altcoin made robust surges following Donald Trump’s victory. dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $2 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $2.6 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $1.5. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction December 2024 $1.5 $2 $2.6 dYdX price prediction 2024 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $2.61 by the end of 2024.

CryptoQuant’s latest insights show the Coinbase Premium climbing, reflecting robust US investor activity during this volatile phase. Coinbase Premium Jumps The Coinbase Premium, a metric that tracks the percentage difference between Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase Pro and Binance, has surged following a sharp decline in BTC’s value. Negative Coinbase Premium values, observed as panic selling intensified on Binance – an exchange known for its higher proportion of retail investors – have historically signaled potential market rebounds. The recent rebound in the premium essentially highlighted strong buying pressure from US institutional investors, who heavily utilize Coinbase as their preferred spot exchange. This behavior suggests that institutional investors often capitalize on price drops by adopting aggressive buying strategies, especially when retail-driven panic selling occurs. Bitcoin was rocked by $1.5 billion in long liquidations before finding support at the critical $95,000 level. It had since stabilized, consolidating around $97,000-$98,000, before another price slump pushed it toward $95,000. Despite this turbulence, the Bitcoin market shows signs of strength, buoyed by a streak of eight consecutive days of net inflows into spot ETFs, as noted by QCP Capital in its latest update . Riot Platforms is also making waves, mirroring MicroStrategy’s strategy by issuing $500 million in convertible notes to acquire more Bitcoin, signaling strong institutional demand. Meanwhile, market watchers anticipate potential topside surprises, such as Microsoft shareholders voting on adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet or Amazon shareholders pushing for BTC as a reserve asset. With macro volatility slightly easing and Asia rallying on China’s stimulus measures, QCP Capital said that the market eagerly awaits a key catalyst to drive Bitcoin toward the coveted $100,000 mark. Consolidation Phase Matrixport’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin is currently in a consolidation phase, as indicated by its proprietary Greed & Fear Index. Over the past year, the index identified five significant entry opportunities when scores dropped below 10%, signaling extreme market fear. Recently, however, the index surpassed the 90% mark, entering Greed territory – traditionally a signal for investors to consider taking profits. Following the seven-month consolidation after the March intermediate peak, the index’s recent movement above 90% implies that Bitcoin is pausing for consolidation before potentially resuming its upward trajectory.

Details of the trade indicate that the investor made an initial investment of $3,000, which has surged into an eye-popping $73 million, according to data shared by cryptocurrency on-chain analysis platform Lookonchain on December 10. The analysis revealed that the investment journey began on April 15, 2023, when the trader purchased 4.91 trillion PEPE tokens. Their position skyrocketed as PEPE surged, breaking the all-time high of $0.000028. By strategically selling portions of their PEPE holdings over time, the trader cashed out 3.03 trillion tokens, pocketing $27.5 million in profits. Trader’s PEPE transactions.

Additionally, they sold another 100 billion PEPE tokens, netting $2.8 million in profit. The trader is among many who have tapped into the meme coin craze to profit . At the center of this craze are coins developed on the Solana ( SOL ) blockchain, which has gained massive popularity due to its low fees, high transaction speeds, and strong community engagement. Platforms such as Pump.Fun has also boosted the ecosystem by enabling seamless launches of coins, with the successful ones primarily leveraging trending social topics alongside listing on major exchanges . However, not all profits have been genuine, as concerns about insider trading have surfaced. PEPE records massive capital inflow Meanwhile, PEPE has witnessed notable capital inflows in recent weeks, surpassing some established names in the crypto market. With a market cap of $10.32 billion, PEPE now ranks 19th among cryptocurrencies, ahead of Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ), Uniswap ( UNI ), and Litecoin ( LTC ). As of press time, PEPE was trading at $0.0000243, with losses of about 8% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, the meme coin has rallied over 20%. PEPE one-week stock price chart.

For instance, on-chain cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez noted that whales increased PEPE holdings by $1.14 billion over the past weekend. Such transactions signal confidence in the token and could set the stage for further price growth. PEPE holding distribution.

Speaking at a financial conference in Abu Dhabi, Dalio expressed concerns about mounting debt in the United States, China, and other major economies, describing the trend as “unsustainable.” Debt assets, such as bonds, are financial instruments issued by governments or corporations to raise funds. Dalio’s warning stems from his belief that rising debt levels could lead to significant financial challenges, including the potential devaluation of money, according to the South China Morning Post. In the past, Dalio has suggested transitioning to inflation-linked currencies to address financial instability. In a 2023 interview with CNBC, he criticized fiat, Bitcoin ( BTC ), and stablecoins for their inability to stabilize economies, citing fiat overprinting and Bitcoin’s volatility. Dalio proposed the idea of an “inflation-linked coin” to help preserve purchasing power.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogen’s presale skyrockets 18,000%, sparking speculation it could surpass Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Table of Contents DOGEN: The ultimate meme token for real alphas who always win Dogecoin: The meme coin with growing popularity Shiba Inu: An Ethereum-based meme coin with growing utility Conclusion A newcomer to the crypto scene, Dogen has seen its presale skyrocket by a staggering 18,000% in its initial phase. This meteoric rise hints at the possibility of it surpassing major tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Crypto enthusiasts are keen to see if Dogen will reshape the market and become the next big sensation. DOGEN: The ultimate meme token for real alphas who always win Imagine living the dream life — luxurious cars, overflowing stacks of cash, and unforgettable experiences that leave everyone in awe. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle! Built for the real alphas who never back down, DOGEN is the meme token that’s changing the game and redefining what it means to win. You might also like: How a TikTok meme turned $1,000 into $1M— DOGEN poised to follow suit HODL like a beast, dominate the market DOGEN isn’t just another meme coin — it’s the chance to take the lead in the hottest altcoin season yet. With a projected 700% surge before the presale concludes, DOGEN is already proving its potential. But the excitement doesn’t stop there. This token is gearing up for the kind of thousand-fold returns that have become synonymous with meme tokens, making it the ultimate choice for those who play to win. Missed out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? Here’s the second chance DOGEN is carving its path as the new alpha in the Solana meme token ecosystem. It’s following the massive success of big names like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, which delivered staggering 1000% gains at their peaks. Still flying under the radar, DOGEN is poised to set new records this bull run, giving savvy investors an opportunity to ride the next big wave. Community rewards to build a DOGEN empire DOGEN isn’t just about holding a token — it’s about building a movement. With its unique airdrop system, users can amplify their rewards just by participating. Stack tokens during the presale, spread the word on social media, and recruit others with a referral link. For every recruit, users will earn a hefty 20% of their Golden Points from token purchases, ensuring their DOGEN Army grows while your rewards multiply. This isn’t just a meme token; it’s a lifestyle, an opportunity, and a ticket to dominating the crypto market. DOGEN is designed for those who demand the best, play to win, and refuse to settle for anything less than greatness. Dogecoin: The meme coin with growing popularity Dogecoin (DOGE) began in 2013 as a fun alternative to other cryptocurrencies. It uses the Shiba Inu dog as its logo. Dogecoin has no maximum supply, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. It was created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer as a joke. In 2021, its value surged. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap. This rise was driven by social media and support from Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s technology allows fast transactions with low fees. Its active community supports the coin. In the current market, Dogecoin’s popularity and accessibility may make it attractive to investors. Shiba Inu: An Ethereum-based meme coin with growing utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme coin inspired by Dogecoin. Unlike DOGE, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This allows it to interact with Ethereum applications. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, SHIB had a starting supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum. Buterin donated some SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum enables projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Plans include a future NFT platform and a governance system. These developments may increase SHIB’s utility in the crypto space. The coin’s attractiveness depends on market conditions. Conclusion DOGEN stands out as a meme token for those seeking luxury and success. With expected 700% growth by presale’s end and potential for huge returns, it mirrors the success of tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. Building a community of leaders and offering real benefits, DOGEN surpasses tokens like DOGE and SHIB in short-term potential.

The token is set to debut at $0.06, and analysts are already eyeing significant upside potential as demand intensifies.

With the momentum from its presale and a planned listing price of $0.06, the project is set to draw increased attention from both retail and institutional investors. As CYBRO prepares for its market debut, its combination of strong fundamentals and rapid growth positions it as one to watch in the evolving DeFi landscape. Prepare for Lift-Off: CYBRO’s presale success is just the beginning Sui (SUI) Surges Ahead: Eyes on Breaking $5.27 Resistance Sui (SUI) has been on a remarkable upward trend, gaining 81.88% over the past month and 19.41% in the last week. Currently trading between $3.45 and $4.75, the coin is approaching its nearest resistance level at $5.27. A breakout above this point could see SUI targeting the next resistance at $6.57, signaling significant growth potential. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 44.50, indicating that the coin is not yet overbought and may have room to rise. However, the MACD level of -0.011 suggests cautious momentum.

The nearest resistance level is at $0.22, and breaking through it could open the way to the second resistance at $0.26. Support levels are at $0.13 and $0.09, which could act as a floor in case of a price dip. Conclusion In summary, while tokens like SUI and KAS may offer less potential in the short term, CYBRO emerges as a standout opportunity.

It offers lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. Users benefit from seamless deposits and withdrawals, ensuring a superior experience.

This undoubtedly presents a huge blow to Bitcoin’s adoption among big US corporations. Microsoft Shareholders Vote Against Bitcoin Proposal Preliminary votes have shown that Microsoft shareholders voted against the Bitcoin investment proposal. If passed, the proposal would have allowed the top US company to diversify some of its assets to Bitcoin and hold the flagship crypto on its balance sheet. With this development, the company will unlikely adopt Bitcoin anytime soon. Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor had pitched to these shareholders why they should vote for the company to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet. However, Saylor’s pitch wasn’t enough to convince these shareholders, considering the vote against the proposal. While Microsoft opts against buying Bitcoin, other companies like MicroStrategy are actively accumulating the flagship crypto. Saylor’s company recently bought 21,550 BTC for $2.1 billion. Meanwhile, Amazon could soon be in the same position as Microsoft, where its shareholders would have to vote on whether to adopt Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) has submitted a shareholder proposal for the US retailer to allocate at least 5% of its cash reserves to the flagship crypto.

Among the worst-hit cryptos were XRP, Polkadot ( DOT ), Litecoin (LTC), Aptos ( APT ) and Cardano (ADA), down 15%-18% over the past 24 hours, extending Monday declines. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding memecoins, stablecoins and exchange coins — tumbled almost 10% Most cryptos in the index plunged by double-digit percentage amount at the minimum, though Ethereum's ether (ETH) and Solana's SOL fell just 8% and 9%, respectively. Bitcoin, in comparison, held up relatively well compared to the rest of the market, dipping to $95,000 and down nearly 3% over the past 24 hours.Cryptocurrencies had already plunged on Monday, triggering one of the largest leverage flushes in years liquidating over $1.5 billion of bullish derivatives positions. Tuesday's fall so far forced $450 million in liquidations across all digital assets, mostly bullish bets, CoinGlass data shows . Open interest for bitcoin futures remains at record high at almost $58 billion, though it has decreased 6.8% from Sunday. This week's sell-off followed a month-long breakneck rally in crypto prices after Donald Trump's election victory in early November. Some altcoin majors doubled or more in price, while bitcoin crossed the $100,000 threshold for time ever. Bitcoin's market cap dominance, which shows BTC's share of the total cryptocurrency market, spiked to 57.9% on Tuesday, its strongest reading since late November, underscoring the general risk-off move from altcoins towards BTC. The market moves could be in anticipation of inflation data coming on Wednesday, according to Youholder Chief of Markets Ruslan Lienkha. ""The market anticipates a slight uptick in inflation,"" he told CoinDesk in an email.

The Digital Chamber, which represents a diverse group of innovators and business leaders, cited several reasons for their opposition to Crenshaw’s reappointment, particularly her stance on cryptocurrency regulation. Concerns Raised by the Digital Chamber Against Caroline Crenshaw In a formal letter to the Senate Banking Committee, the Digital Chamber expressed its concerns about Commissioner Crenshaw’s tenure at the SEC. According to the organization, Crenshaw’s approach to digital assets regulation has been detrimental to market growth and innovation. TDC claims that her actions have stifled industry progress and investor confidence, pointing to her dissenting opinion regarding the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs). Crenshaw’s rejection of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s (GBTC) application to convert into a spot Bitcoin ETP was specifically noted as an example of her negative view of the digital asset space. The Digital Chamber argued that Commissioner Crenshaw’s regulatory actions have failed to align with the SEC’s core mission: protecting investors, ensuring fair markets, and fostering capital formation. The letter highlighted her use of outdated data and arguments in her dissent, which, according to the Chamber, did not reflect the maturity of the digital asset industry or the advancements made in market oversight and surveillance. Other Crypto Industry Leaders Oppose Crenshaw’s Reappointment Caroline Crenshaw’s reappointment has also garnered opposition from several other influential figures in the cryptocurrency sector. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, criticized her tenure, claiming that her stance on cryptocurrency was more hostile than even that of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Armstrong expressed frustration with her opposition to Bitcoin ETFs, which he believes could have provided broader access to crypto markets. Bill Hughes , a lawyer at ConsenSys, echoed similar concerns. He suggested that Crenshaw’s renomination might be seen as politically motivated, particularly as the U.S. government begins to shift towards more crypto-friendly policies. Shift Toward Crypto-Friendly Appointments Recent appointments by the U.S. government, including the nomination of Paul Atkins to chair the SEC, reflect a broader shift toward more crypto-friendly leadership. Atkins, known for his support of the digital asset industry, is seen by many as a figure who could foster a more collaborative regulatory environment. This has led some to view Crenshaw’s position as increasingly out of step with the changing regulatory landscape. David Sacks, the incoming Crypto Czar , also expressed concerns about the direction of regulatory crackdowns, particularly with the recent controversies surrounding “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” As part of this shift, Sacks has called for further investigations into regulatory actions that could harm the crypto sector. With the Senate Banking Committee set to vote on Crenshaw’s reappointment on December 11, the outcome of this decision could have significant consequences for the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States The post Digital Chamber Urges US Senate To Reject Caroline Crenshaw’s SEC Reappointment appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Regulation News|Caroline Crenshaw|Crypto Regulation|US SEC,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2024-12-10 17:21:37

Seize the Chance to Get in Early Before Demand for $CYBRO Skyrockets Bitcoin: A Decentralized Digital Currency Changing Transactions Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency, created to enable electronic cash without central control. It uses blockchain technology to allow peer-to-peer transactions directly between users. Instead of relying on banks, Bitcoin operates through a distributed ledger maintained by nodes in the network. Transactions are verified by miners who solve complex puzzles and receive bitcoins as rewards. This process ensures security and prevents fraud. The Bitcoin network undergoes a ""halving"" roughly every four years, cutting miners' rewards by half, which affects the total supply. With a capped supply of 21 million bitcoins, it offers an alternative approach to digital currency and finance. Conclusion While established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may see slower growth in the short term, opportunities are emerging elsewhere. CYBRO, a technologically advanced DeFi platform, offers investors unparalleled potential through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. With features like lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO provides a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. Its focus on transparency, compliance, and quality sets it apart, attracting strong interest from crypto whales and influencers. As the 2024 bull run gains momentum, CYBRO stands out as a promising project poised to deliver exceptional returns for those ready to seize the moment.

Speculation circles around a possible 15,000% increase, sparking curiosity among investors and enthusiasts alike. What factors could drive such unprecedented growth, and is this token poised to become the next big sensation in the crypto world? DOGEN: The Ultimate Memetoken for Real Alphas Who Always Win Imagine living a dream life — posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and women who turn heads. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle! If you’re the kind of guy who’s always looking to level up, you need to check out DOGEN. This meme token is for the real alphas who always win. 💎 HODL Like a Beast, Dominate the Market 💎 This thing is about to explode! We’re talking about a 700% surge before the presale even wraps up — and that’s just the beginning. DOGEN is heating up to those insane thousand-fold gains that memetokens are famous for this season. Get in early, and watch the others try to keep up while you’re already at the top! ⚡️ Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? ⚡️ DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain, running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat — all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point. Right now, DOGEN’s flying under the radar, but it’s about to set new records in this bull run. You don’t want to miss out on this one. Got that DOGEN spirit? Good, ‘cause they’re holding an airdrop! All you gotta do is flex on social, stack tokens during the presale, and start building your DOGEN army with your referral link. For every recruit, you’ll be snatching a fat 20% of their Golden Points from token buys. So what are you waiting for? Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! 🚀 Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin (DOGE). Unlike DOGE, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This allows it to interact with Ethereum applications. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, SHIB had a starting supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum. Buterin donated some SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply. SHIB's integration with Ethereum enables projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Plans include a future NFT platform and a governance system. These developments may increase SHIB's utility in the crypto space. The coin's attractiveness depends on market conditions. Conclusion While coins like SHIB show limited short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a meme token for those seeking luxury and success. With an expected 700% growth by the end of its presale and possible thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows the success of tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. Offering real benefits and building a community of leaders, DOGEN is set for remarkable success.

37472171,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-bitcoin-is-the-most-islamic-money-,1733851819,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/6/37472171.jpeg,Why Bitcoin is the Most Islamic Money,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-bitcoin-is-the-most-islamic-money-,"The Islamic conceptualisation of finance is built around a set of core principles which give primacy to honesty, fairness and accountability in trade and transactions. As such, Islamic finance seeks uphold justice, transparency, and shared prosperity in economic systems. Arguably, fiat currency achieves the exact opposite of these principles, since it introduces uncertainty, speculation and inequities that punish the poor, who earn and spend fiat, and favours the rich who invest in assets that benefit from inflation. In this backdrop, Bitcoin emerges as a solution that aligns remarkably well with Islamic finance principles. This article explores why Bitcoin, with its decentralization, transparency, and scarcity, represents the most Islamic form of money, offering transformative potential for the Muslim world. The foundational principles of Islamic finance include: 1. Prohibition of Riba (Usury): Interest-based lending, where money generates money without productive activity, is strictly forbidden in Islam. Riba fosters exploitation, concentrates wealth, and undermines social equity. 2. Prohibition of Gharar (Uncertainty): Transactions should be free from undue speculation or ambiguity. Clear terms and honest practices are paramount. 3. Asset-Backed Economy Trade and transactions should involve tangible assets or productive activities. Wealth must be earned through legitimate means, not through gambling or speculative bubbles. 4. Risk Sharing Islamic finance emphasizes equity-based partnerships where profit and loss are shared, ensuring mutual benefit and fairness in all financial dealings. 5. Justice and Equity: Wealth distribution should serve societal needs, promoting fairness and reducing economic disparities. One could very credibly argue that the current fiat-based monetary system flagrantly violates these tenets. Central banks set interest rates that underpin the entire fiat system, institutionalizing usury. Money created out of debt inherently generates unearned profits for lenders while indebting others, fostering exploitation and inequality. The fiat system disproportionately benefits those closest to the source of money creation (e.g., banks, governments) at the expense of ordinary people. This “Cantillon Effect” exacerbates wealth inequality, violating Islamic values of equity and justice. Fiat currencies are prone to inflation and devaluation due to their unlimited supply. This creates uncertainty and speculative behaviour, further destabilizing economies and harming the most vulnerable. Unlike gold or tangible assets, fiat money is not backed by any physical commodity. It is merely a promise of value, eroding trust and violating Islam’s emphasis on tangible, asset-backed wealth. Centralized control of money by a few institutions undermines accountability, fosters corruption, and allows governments to manipulate currencies to serve political agendas, often to the detriment of their citizens. These systemic flaws have led to financial crises, inequality, and the erosion of societal trust. Bitcoin, the world’s first decentralized digital currency, aligns closely with the ethical and economic teachings of Islam. Bitcoin operates without interest-based mechanisms. Its decentralized nature ensures that no central authority can create money out of thin air or profit unjustly through usury. Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on an immutable public ledger, the blockchain. This ensures honesty and accountability, eliminating the uncertainty associated with opaque fiat systems. Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, making it a deflationary asset. Its scarcity mirrors the attributes of gold, historically accepted as sound money in Islamic societies. Unlike fiat money, Bitcoin is not controlled by any government or institution. Its decentralized network empowers individuals and fosters equity, aligning with Islam’s emphasis on justice and fairness. Bitcoin is not a speculative promise; it is earned through “proof-of-work,” which requires significant energy and computational effort. This tangible cost of production imbues it with intrinsic value, resonating with Islamic financial principles. Bitcoin allows anyone with an internet connection to participate in the global economy. This inclusivity aligns with Islam’s vision of reducing economic barriers and promoting universal access to financial resources. Through its adherence to these principles, Bitcoin offers a viable alternative to the exploitative fiat system, paving the way for a more just and equitable financial future. Adopting Bitcoin on a wide scale could revolutionize the Muslim world, unlocking unprecedented economic opportunities. Many Muslim-majority countries suffer from chronic inflation, eroding the value of their fiat currencies and impoverishing their citizens. Bitcoin’s deflationary nature provides a hedge against inflation, preserving wealth over time. Millions of Muslims remain unbanked due to lack of access to traditional financial services. Bitcoin’s decentralized system allows individuals to store and transfer wealth securely without relying on banks, fostering economic empowerment. Muslim-majority countries are among the largest recipients of remittances. Bitcoin enables faster, cheaper, and more secure cross-border transactions, reducing reliance on costly intermediaries. By decentralizing money creation and eliminating the privileges of central banks, Bitcoin ensures a fairer distribution of wealth, addressing economic disparities that plague many Islamic societies. Bitcoin’s transparent system facilitates the development of Shariah-compliant financial products and services, promoting ethical investment opportunities in line with Islamic values. Bitcoin enables nations to reduce their dependence on the US dollar and other foreign currencies, strengthening their economic sovereignty and resilience. By enabling trustless, borderless transactions, Bitcoin fosters trade within the global Muslim community, encouraging innovation and economic integration across nations. Bitcoin is more than just a technological innovation; it is a financial system rooted in justice, transparency, and equity—values deeply embedded in Islamic teachings. As the Muslim world grapples with the challenges of fiat-based economies, Bitcoin offers a path toward economic independence, financial inclusion, and societal prosperity. By embracing Bitcoin, the Muslim world can align its financial systems with the timeless principles of Islam, paving the way for a fairer and more sustainable future.

These declines outpaced the broader crypto market sell-off, erasing much of the gains from a recent rally linked to former U.S. President Donald Trump. Market Cap Dips to Three-Week Low The memecoin sector's total market capitalization fell to $119.6 billion, marking its lowest point since November 27, when it briefly hit $118 billion. This represents a 21% drop in just 24 hours. At the same time, daily trading volumes for memecoins nearly doubled, reflecting heightened selling pressure as investors sought to cut their losses. .

Its competitor, Shiba Inu, fared worse, losing 10.4% during the same period. In contrast, Ethereum-based PEPE was the only major memecoin to buck the trend, gaining 1.7% Top memecoins’ price performance. Source: CoinMarketCap Read also: Think Tank Pushes Amazon to Adopt Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Open Interest Decline Precedes Memecoin Crash The steep drop in memecoin prices on Dec. 10 was preceded by a significant decline in open interest (OI) across major tokens. Open interest, which measures the total number of unsettled derivative contracts, saw sharp reductions as traders closed positions amid growing bearish sentiment.PNUT led the retreat with a 30% decline in OI over the past 24 hours, signaling waning confidence in the token. Dogecoin (DOGE) followed closely, with its OI dropping over 20% to $3.1 billion—still nearly six times higher than Dogwifhat (WIF), which experienced a 27% drop in OI, settling at $519 million. Ethereum-based PEPE saw a more moderate decline, with OI falling 11% to $302.4 million. Memecoin OI chart. Source: CoinGlass The decline in open interest reflects reduced market activity and confidence as traders exited their positions, further exacerbating the memecoin sell-off. Liquidation Event Shakes the Market The broader crypto market recently experienced a high wave of liquidations, with over $1.7 billion disappearing within 24 hours. Remarkably, $1.3 billion was liquidated in just 12 hours, making this event the largest of its kind since 2021, according to data from CoinGlass. Source: CoinGlass Among the most affected were memecoins, which saw significant disruptions. In particular, Dogecoin suffered the impact, with long positions valued at $72.6 million being wiped out. Shiba Inu was not spared either, as $22.35 million in long positions were liquidated. Additional losses included $7.9 million in PEPE longs and $3.6 million in WIF longs.This massive liquidation event parallels a similar situation during the flash crash on December 5, when $816 million in long positions vanished from the market. The recent turmoil seems to echo that tumultuous period, highlighting the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency landscape. Bearish Sentiment Grows The drop in open interest for memecoin derivatives indicates a bearish outlook, as traders closed leveraged positions in anticipation of further declines. This sell-off echoes the start of the 2021 bear market and highlights the volatility of memecoins. During the December 10 crash, Bitcoin’s price fell by 11%, triggering a broader altcoin sell-off. Memecoins alone lost $1 billion in market capitalization.As market participants navigate this turbulence, memecoins remain a stark reminder of the high-risk nature of speculative assets in the crypto space.

Leveraged ETFs like BITU underperform during volatility, making them unsuitable for mid- to long-term investments in highly volatile assets like Bitcoin. The IBIT ETF by BlackRock, a non-leveraged Bitcoin ETF, offers a more stable and suitable option for investors seeking long-term exposure to Bitcoin. This article is part of my ""Bitcoin ETFs Showdown"" series, where I compare various Bitcoin ETFs against the IBIT ETF. This article is part of my “Bitcoin ETFs Showdown” series, where I analyze several Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs and compare them to the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ). Today, I will analyze for the first time a leveraged Bitcoin ETF: the ProShares Ultra Bitcoin ETF ( BITU ), a leveraged fund offering 2x exposure to Bitcoin's daily performance. The reason why I am including BITU in this series is because some investors may wonder if using 2x leverage to gain Bitcoin exposure is viable for mid- to long-term investing (i.e. a ""HOLD"" strategy) . While investment theory suggests that leverage can make sense in traditional equity markets, its application to Bitcoin requires more careful consideration, in my view. This series does not seek to determine if now is the optimal time to invest in Bitcoin. In my view, Bitcoin remains a high-risk, asymmetric opportunity with the potential to evolve into a global reserve asset, even following its recent bull run. This risk is compounded by the leveraged nature of the BITU fund. Investors unsure about Bitcoin should evaluate its fundamentals and assess whether it fits their risk tolerance and long-term goals. This is especially true for investors considering leveraged funds, which amplify the volatility and risk of investing in an already volatile asset class. BITU: ETF profile The BITU ETF is a leveraged product, which, to quote its issuer : “seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to two times (2x) the daily performance of the Bloomberg Bitcoin Index”. As a leveraged fund, BITU does not invest directly in Bitcoin. Rather, this ETF invests in financial instruments such as Swaps, to replicate the direction of Bitcoin and amplify its movements. While this means that BITU is not subject to custodian risk (unlike “normal” Bitcoin ETFs), the fund is exposed to counterparty risk, in that the financial instruments it uses to gain exposure to Bitcoin are issued by financial institutions. For example, some of the Swaps held by the fund at the time of writing are issued by Nomura and Goldman Sachs. BITU at a glance (BITU WebPage) Looking at the issuer’s webpage for BITU, it’s clear to me that this product is designed for frequent traders. ProShares explicitly highlights, in the header for BITU, an alternative fund for bearish investors: the ProShares UltraShort Bitcoin ETF ( SBIT ), which shorts Bitcoin. This suggests, in my view, that ProShares is less focused on supporting Bitcoin itself and more interested in profiting from active trading activity - no matter the side of the trade. Another reason that makes me believe this is a fund for frequent traders is its relatively high Daily Average Trading Volume, which at $114.43 Million is a third that of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), an ETF that I previously covered in my Bitcoin Showdown series. This is despite BITU having only $1.27 Billion in Assets Under Management ((AUM)), compared to more than $19 billion in AUM of the FBTC ETF. This article does not cover short-term Bitcoin trading or assess whether Bitcoin is a suitable investment. Instead, the following sections will evaluate whether BITU is a better option than non-leveraged Bitcoin ETFs, such as IBIT. Readers interested in learning more about Bitcoin should take a look at my previous work in this regard. Key metrics at a glance At the time of writing, the BITU ETF has the following metrics: A 0.95% expense ratio, which I find reasonable for the nature of this ETF $114.43 Million in Average Daily Volume and $1.2 Billion in AUM A 0.06% Bid/Ask Spread, decent figure in my view considering the ETF's smaller size, supported by its higher liquidity due to frequent trading I believe investors considering BITU should not overly focus on these metrics, as its 2x leverage more than offsets the impact of slightly less efficient figures. The real question is whether using a 2x leveraged tool to invest in Bitcoin is something even worth considering. BITU: not preferable to IBIT or other non-leveraged ETFs for most investors The BITU fund was only launched in April this year. Despite its brief history, I think this is an interesting period to take into consideration because Bitcoin has experienced a bull run. BITU vs. IBIT performance, since inception (Seeking Alpha) The chart above compares the performance of BITU with IBIT, my favorite Bitcoin ETF (which has no leverage). BITU has trailed behind IBIT for the majority of the year, with its underperformance amplified during a stagnant phase when Bitcoin traded in the $70,000 to $55,000 range. This behavior might seem counterintuitive for readers unfamiliar with leveraged products - after all, if the underlying asset stays flat, why would a leverage product produce negative returns? The reason has to do with the way leverage works, which ends up amplifying downturns. Readers unfamiliar with leverage can understand the reason with a simple example: Assume a 2x leveraged ETF based on an asset worth $100. A -5% move in the underlying asset results in a -10% move for the ETF, reducing its value to $90. To recover to $100, the ETF needs to gain more than 10% because it’s now starting from a lower base. If the underlying asset recovers to $100 with a +5.26% move, the leveraged ETF will only gain +10.52%, bringing it to $99.47, not $100. Additionally, the higher expense ratio (and cost of leverage) of leveraged ETFs also contributes to the underperformance. This is why BITU has underperformed IBIT in a short time frame where Bitcoin traded sideways. BITU has only started overperforming IBIT in the last month, with Bitcoin experiencing a rapid increase in price, following Trump’s victory in the US election. Once again, due to the way leverage works, should Bitcoin stay at current levels for a long time, this overperformance will slowly erode. Because Bitcoin tends to be a highly volatile asset, I do not think a leveraged ETF is ideal for anyone except short-term traders. Conclusion Investors considering Bitcoin exposure—or those already invested—may question whether a 2x leveraged position is suitable for a long-term holding strategy. The answer is unequivocally no. Leveraged ETFs often underperform during periods of simple volatility, even in the absence of a bear market for the underlying asset. While long-term leverage might be viable for some assets, Bitcoin’s extreme volatility significantly amplifies the risks, making this strategy unsuitable. The BITU ETF is suited only for active traders, in my view. My “HOLD” rating reflects this reality and is not a recommendation for long-term Bitcoin holders to retain this fund in their portfolios. Risks of investing in BITU Investing in leveraged ETFs comes with significant risks, some of which I’ve outlined earlier in this article. These include potential underperformance due to simple volatility (even without a bear market), higher fees compared to standard ETFs, and dependency on third-party financial institutions. In the case of a leveraged ETF on Bitcoin—a highly speculative and volatile asset—these risks are magnified. Additionally to risks specific to leverage, investing in Bitcoin is in itself still a speculative gamble on its potential to evolve into a global reserve asset. While I find this prospect compelling for myself, it represents a key risk that anyone must carefully assess. In my opinion, BITU is only suitable for active traders attempting to time Bitcoin's price movements. For investors seeking Bitcoin exposure, IBIT is a more appropriate choice and should be preferred.",BTC-USD|IBIT|BITU,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-10 17:34:02

He said in line with this, he has given the team a goal of creating a meaningfull demo by Bitcoin 2025 in May 2025.

This latest update comes weeks after Cardano inked a partnership with BitcoinOS Bridge to bring DeFi to the top coin. In an earlier ADA price analysis , the correlation between BTC and Cardano was re-emphasized, underscoring the need to drive Bitcoin’s growth. Scaling the Right Way To Support BTC Onboarding new solutions to boost the decentralized finance capabilities of Bitcoin is a big ask for IOG. However, other the past few weeks, the started has conducted a series of upgrades to enhance its mainnet. One of the latest features the Cardano Hydra Doom testing. Following this testnet showcase, the Proof-of-Stake (POS) recorded a 1 million Transaction Per Second (TPS) milestone. This massive scaling potential is good for the projected linkup as Bitcoin has a considerably large userbase that may want to explore the DeFi products.

A tale of caution for developers,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-happened-with-and-to-hamster-kombat/,"When Hamster Kombat first launched, the gaming and crypto communities had high hopes for the project. Months down the line, with little to no “new” announcements and pin-drop silence from developers, investors’ confidence in the tap-to-earn game’s long-term prospects has dropped tenfold. Hamster Kombat first entered the crypto scene in March 2024, leveraging the Ton blockchain network. Designed as a Telegram-integrated “clicker” game, developers convinced the crypto enthusiasts that Hamster Kombat had a unique premise. In the game, players could assume the role of an entrepreneur and CEO of a crypto exchange, tasked with developing the platform through strategic investments in improvement cards, completing tasks, and interacting with the game’s iconic hamster mascot. By mid-summer 2024, after launching its token, $HMSTR, the game had amassed over 239 million users. This success was so pronounced that it caught the attention of Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, who praised the game on his channel. Durov’s endorsement made the player base surge further, surpassing 300 million users by the end of September. So, where did it all start going downhill? How did a project that was initially lauded by the crypto community start trending for the wrong reasons? Here’s the story of one of the most popular tap-to-earn crypto games lost all its social credit. Hamster Kombat: The good old days On September 20, the Telegram-based blockchain game announced the conclusion of its first season rollout. According to IntoTheBlock data, the game had amassed a massive global audience of over 300 million players, and active addresses within the network had reached 1.59 million by September 27. Source: IntoTheBlock To mark the season’s end, the platform took a snapshot of all players’ progress at 6 PM UTC on the same day, laying the groundwork for its much-awaited $HMSTR token airdrop. Hamster Kombat’s team also announced that its’ token will be listed on several major exchanges, including Binance, Bybit, OKX, KuCoin, MEXC, and Gate.io between September and October 2024. 👏 SNAP, SNAP, CLAP, CLAP 👏 CEOs, we're letting you know the snapshot was successfully taken! 🫡🐹 📲 Reminder: You still have time to choose your AirDrop withdrawal method, but only until September 21, 8 am UTC. Make sure to choose a withdrawal method! Please double-check… pic.twitter.com/tTyptrr1vK — Hamster Kombat (@hamster_kombat) September 20, 2024 The news about the airdrop and listings sparked a lot of excitement in the community. Analysts were optimistic $HMSTR would do well considering the project’s huge fanbase. Unfortunately, Hamster’s CEOs were in for a rude awakening. Flipping good times for sad tales The excitement surrounding Hamster Kombat quickly soured after its highly publicized token launch and airdrop. The rollout was marred by technical hiccups and accusations of fraud. The TON blockchain, already under strain from other high-profile token launches, faced additional pressure during the game’s airdrop, raising questions about its scalability. Hamster Kombat’s highly anticipated $HMSTR token airdrop took place on September 26, 2024. Of the total supply of 100 billion tokens, 60% were allocated for this initial airdrop. Over 300 million players participated in the game since its launch. Yet, the project revealed that only 131 million qualified for the distribution after anti-cheating measures disqualified 2.3 million accounts. According to several sources, eligible users received 88.75% of their allocated tokens immediately, while the remaining 11.25% was locked and set to vest monthly over ten months after the token’s listing. This approach angered some participants who expected full distribution upfront. ✍️ HAMSTER MATH ✍️ 🔥 The results of Season 1 have been finalized: 🚀 Over 300 million people have joined Hamster Kombat since March 26, 2024, 131 million qualified for the airdrop on September 26th and around 2.3 million were banned as cheaters. 📤 30.6 million of qualified… pic.twitter.com/LH5eD3i8al — Hamster Kombat (@hamster_kombat) September 22, 2024 Dissatisfied players accused the developers of manipulating token allocations and operating unethically. On X, the crypto community created a hashtag meant to encourage users to boycott Hamster Kombat. One user stated, “No one will be there who has not worked hard. All of these folks belong to your community. All of them can bring it down.” Another user pointed out that Hamster Kombat had “bootlicked” YouTubers and influencers for referrals to get users to toil for keys in their games, only to give small rewards and wrongfully ban millions. They asked the community to unfollow influencers who supported the project, claiming YouTubers “misused the community.” Will Hamster Kombat survive until season 2? Since the airdrop mishap, the number of Hamster Kombat members on its Telegram channel has dropped at a shocking rate. IntoTheBlock data also shows that daily active address totals have gone down by more than 80%. The team had announced that Hamster Kombat’s season 2 airdrop and game overhaul would happen in October. However, it has gone completely silent, and the date of the launch remains unknown. The story of Hamster Kombat best defines a cautionary tale to developers. Its team, whom the community generally doesn’t know much about, seemingly leveraged investor enthusiasm to generate income through player engagement and promotional content on platforms like YouTube. Hamster Kombat has cheated the community 📌 It's time to give them back. They have allocated a large portion of airdrops to bootlicking YouTubers and influencers for referrals. They’ve implemented vesting without informing the community. They’ve made people work like labour,… pic.twitter.com/Mw3UrDdHxl — Crypto with Khan ( SFZ ) (@Cryptowithkhan) September 22, 2024 Many in the community felt under-compensated and underappreciated for their efforts, with several users claiming they were wrongfully banned and excluded from the airdrop and referral rewards. This mismanagement has resulted in dwindling engagement; frustrated participants are losing trust in the project, and we can’t say their grievances are unjustified. If there’s anything we’ve all learned in the last two years in crypto, evident in what happened to beleaguered crypto exchange FTX, it’s that you can only fool people for so long. Without addressing these wrongdoings and breaking the silence over upcoming events, Hamster Kombat could collapse into oblivion before its planned season 2 rollout. There have been rumblings of developers conniving with hackers to drain projects and share revenues. Perhaps, some Web3 developers are the scourge of the industry. What is undeniable is that Hamster Kombat has become a cautionary tale for any developer introducing a product to digital market investors.

Despite the correction, analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term outlook, with projections pointing toward a potential peak of $400,000 by 2026. Notably, TradingShot , in an analysis on TradingView , highlighted that Bitcoin’s bullish cycle remains intact, supported by historical patterns and key technical indicators . 50-week moving average: A critical foundation for the bull run According to the analysis, Bitcoin has managed to maintain its broader bullish structure, defined by a green arc pattern that has shaped its trajectory for over a year. This pattern continues to hold, with BTC trading consistently below the Cyclical Pivot trend line, which originated from the bottom of the 2018 bear market. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView One of the most significant indicators supporting this optimistic outlook is the 50-week moving average (1W MA50). Historically, this trend line has consistently acted as a strong support level during Bitcoin’s bull cycles, holding firm until the market transitions to a bearish phase. In August, Bitcoin successfully bounced off the 1W MA50 twice during a period of market turbulence, reaffirming its role as a critical level for sustaining upward momentum. TradingShot emphasizes that as long as Bitcoin holds above this trend line, the bullish structure of the cycle remains intact. Moreover, Bitcoin’s historical price movements reveal a cyclical symmetry, where the duration of the pre-halving phase often mirrors the post-halving bull cycle. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin could peak between December 2025 and January 2026, potentially reaching as high as $400,000 along the Cyclical Pivot trend line. Even under a more conservative scenario modeled after the 2015–2017 cycle, Bitcoin is projected to reach a top slightly above $200,000. Relative Strength Index signals room for further growth The 1W Relative Strength Index (RSI) lends further credibility to this optimistic outlook. After reaching an overbought high of 88.50 in March 2024, the RSI corrected to a bearish low of 45 in September, signaling a temporary pullback. Historically, Bitcoin’s RSI during bull cycles forms a series of peaks, each closely aligned with significant price highs. If the current cycle mirrors the 2015–2017 bull run, Bitcoin could experience multiple RSI peaks before reaching its ultimate high, highlighting the strong growth potential and the likelihood of sustained upward momentum. Road to $400,000: Key drivers Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory remains aligned with historical bullish patterns, supported by macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions, and institutional adoption. While short-term corrections are expected, the broader structure points to significant long-term growth potential, positioning Bitcoin as a key asset to watch ahead of its next rally. However, market sentiment has been dampened by news of Google’s quantum computing chip Willow, which raises concerns about the future of Bitcoin’s encryption vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, caution persists ahead of a critical week for economic data releases, including the US CPI, PPI, and jobless claims reports, which could influence the Federal Reserve’s interest rate outlook. With markets pricing in an 88% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut according to the CME FedWatch tool, a lower interest rate environment could provide support for risk assets like Bitcoin due to increased liquidity. Analyst Ali Martinez has also raised concerns, cautioning that Bitcoin must maintain a price above $96,000 with relative consistency to avoid a potential collapse to $85,000. As market participants weigh economic uncertainties and emerging technological challenges, Bitcoin’s ability to hold key support levels will remain crucial in the short term.

Path To $1 Million: Eric Trump’s Prognosis Speaking at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 10, Eric Trump lauded Bitcoin as a “financial paradigm”. Eric stressed that Bitcoin is “not just another asset” and “not just an investment”, calling it instead a “global asset.” “It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” he quipped. One key feature that gives Bitcoin an edge is its scarcity, as the asset’s supply is capped at 21 million, Eric observed, explaining: “I can tell you a hell of a lot more eyes are going to be opened when Bitcoin hits $1 million. And I’m confident it’s going to hit $1 million. I think we’re all confident in this room that it’s going to hit a million.” It’s worth mentioning that Eric is not the only crypto industry pundit predicting Bitcoin will hit the ambitious $1 million milestone. Bitcoin uber-bulls like MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor and ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood have also predicted Bitcoin’s rocket surge to $1 million . Comparing Bitcoin And Internet Adoption Eric Trump also claimed that the world has adopted Bitcoin slowly, explaining that it’s no surprise given that disruptive technologies like email took time to garner widespread popularity. Email was created back in the 1970s but took 25 years to achieve mass adoption, Eric posited, asserting that people are “slow as hell to adapt to new technology.” On top of his sunny optimistic $1 million forecast, Eric voiced confidence that Bitcoin could exceed borders and institutions. Those who do not adopt Bitcoin are bound to lose: “We’re going to see that banks have to adapt. We’re going to see that governments have to adapt, and governments will adapt. Those who embrace Bitcoin, those who embrace this digital revolution, those who embrace digital currency, the people who come in early are going to be the people who win.” Eric also made it clear that the Trump family will continue to be the “greatest cheerleaders and champions” of cryptocurrencies.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-10 17:45:38

This milestone follows Bitcoin’s historic surge past the much-coveted $100,000 price, peaking at $103,900 on December 5. According to data from Arkham Int elligence, Tesla, the electric vehicle giant, currently holds 11,509 BTC valued at approximately $1.17 billion, while SpaceX owns 8,285 BTC, worth $842 million. The companies acquired their Bitcoin at an average price of $34,980 per BTC, meaning their combined unrealized gains amount to $1.3 billion, a 186% return on investment. This surge marks a significant leap from last month, when Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings first surpassed $1 billion. According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, the latest price rally solidifies Tesla’s position as the fourth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder. Elon Musk’s bold Bitcoin strategy has been a rollercoaster ride since Tesla’s initial $1.5 billion investment in early 2021. While Musk initially described the move as “quite risky,” the gamble paid off handsomely. Although Tesla liquidated 75% of its holdings during the crypto winter of 2022, the company retained a core position, now yielding extraordinary returns. The combined holdings of Tesla and SpaceX now rival those of governments like El Salvador, whose Bitcoin holdings currently sit at 5,957 BTC, valued at around $593 million. Notably, the Central American country, which continues to buy 1 BTC per day, is now sitting on a substantial profit of over $300 million from its Bitcoin investments, as per a figure recently shared by President Nayib Bukele on X. Bitcoin’s ascent past $100,000 marks a transformative moment for the cryptocurrency market. The digital asset, long touted as “digital gold,” has now achieved unparalleled mainstream acceptance. Analysts attribute the rally to a combination of institutional adoption, dwindling supply, and growing geopolitical interest in Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional currencies. MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, also benefits from this rally. The firm’s 402,100 BTC holdings are now valued at over $40 billion, yielding unrealized profits exceeding $16 billion. Beyond Musk’s companies, other players have seen mixed fortunes in the Bitcoin market. Governments like Germany and the United States have faced criticism for missing out on billions by prematurely selling confiscated Bitcoin.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|Elon Musk|Tesla|XBTUSD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ARKM,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-10 17:47:59

He confidently declared that Bitcoin will someday reach a value of $1 million per BTC. “I am confident that Bitcoin is going to hit $1 million.” JUST IN: 🇺🇸 President Donald Trump’s son, Eric Trump says, “I am confident that #Bitcoin is going to hit $1 million.” 🚀 pic.twitter.com/1SqScvddl2 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 10, 2024 Trump’s keynote address showcased his belief in Bitcoin as a revolutionary “financial paradigm” with the potential to reshape the global economy. He expressed certainty that its value will soar in the years ahead. Bitcoin: A Global Asset and Hedge Trump described Bitcoin as far more than a typical asset, emphasizing its role as a “global asset” that safeguards against economic uncertainty and unforeseen disruptions. “It’s a store of value. It’s a hedge against inflation. It’s a hedge against political turmoil, political instability, acts of God, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, guys. That’s what makes it so powerful,” Trump stated. He also highlighted Bitcoin’s decentralized system, which operates without traditional intermediaries, contrasting it with the inefficiencies and high fees associated with conventional financial systems. Scarcity Driving Value Trump pointed to Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million as a critical factor behind its enduring appeal. Scarcity, he argued, is a defining feature that ensures its long-term value and places it in a league of its own. A Familiar Pattern of Adoption Drawing parallels to the slow adoption of groundbreaking technologies like email, Trump argued that hesitation to embrace change is nothing new. He shared a story about a friend who dismissed Bitcoin only to see his own bank adopt it shortly afterward. “People are slow as hell to adapt to new technology,” Trump remarked, underscoring the importance of early adoption.

We’re going to see that governments have to adapt, and governments will adapt.

Armstrong argues on the social media platform X that Caroline A. Crenshaw has been “a failure” as commissioner and should be voted out. “She tried to block the Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and was worse than Gensler on some issues (which I didn’t think was possible). The Senate Banking Committee should take note – the crypto community is watching this vote. I’m told it will be factored into Stand With Crypto scorecards for politicians.” Stand With Crypto is a digital asset advocacy group backed by Coinbase. Crenshaw is a Democrat who was nominated to her role by former President Donald Trump and unanimously confirmed by the Senate in 2020. Her term expires this year. In January, she dissented against the SEC’s decision to greenlight spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), calling the approvals “unsound and ahistorical.” Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett reports that the Senate Banking Committee will meet this Wednesday to vote on Crenshaw’s renomination. No more than three members of the SEC’s five-person board of commissioners can belong to the same political party. The SEC currently has three Democratic and two Republican commissioners, though Chair Gary Gensler and Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga, both Democrats, have announced their plans to step down in early 2025.

According to Lookonchain, who first revealed the feat in a December 10 post on X, the unidentified trader first bought 4.1 trillion Pepe tokens on April 15, 2023. Strategic Sales Amid Market Highs Per on-chain data, the investor sold off just over 3 trillion Pepe, pocketing about $27.5 million in the process. However, with 1.88 trillion tokens still held in their wallet, boasting a market value of $45.66 million, their total profit now stands at an eye-popping $73 million. An analysis of the trader’s activities shows that they timed their sales during market peaks, especially when Pepe skyrocketed to an all-time high (ATH) of $0.000028 on December 9, 2024. The sharp price rally allowed the investor to maximize profits before the meme coin’s value dropped, demonstrating a keen understanding of market cycles. At that time, their largest single transaction involved the sale of 100 billion Pepe tokens for $2.8 million. Pepe’s volatile nature has made it a favorite among speculative traders, especially considering that its price has registered extreme swings since its launch in early 2023, with gains of more than 1,487% in the last 12 months alone. At the time of writing, the meme coin, #23 on the list of highest-capped cryptocurrencies, was trading at $0.00002436, a 4.2% drop from 24 hours ago. However, it is still up 20.7% across seven days and 103.3% over a month. While Pepe is currently trading at 12.9% lower than its ATH, it is still more than 44,000% higher than its lowest-ever recorded price, attained on April 18, 2023, only days after the mysterious trader bought his stash. The coin has outperformed the broader crypto market, which is down 1.70%, as well as similar meme tokens, which are generally up 12.70% per data from CoinGecko. Crypto Success Stories Stories of dramatic profits aren’t new to crypto. Recently, a viral squirrel incident led to the creation of a meme coin dubbed Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT). One investor took advantage of its booming popularity to turn $450,000 of Solana (SOL) into nearly $8 million in profits. According to Lookonchain, the trader bought 16 million PNUT tokens at $0.045 and sold them for $1.34 a piece days later, marking a 1,772% return on their investment. Earlier in the year, another investor reportedly made more than $46 million from trading Pepe. Starting in April 2023, the trader bought 4,9 trillion tokens when the meme coin barely registered on people’s radars. However, as its price catapulted, the investor sold portions of their holdings, making about $7.4 million in profits. Still, they had more than 3.5 trillion Pepe coins, valued at over $39 million, transforming their bet into a $46 million windfall.

The CSI 300 Index rose by 3.3% as the market positively responded to the policymakers’ promise to implement a ‘more proactive’ monetary policy. Chinese leaders agreed that a ‘moderately loose’ monetary policy would revive economic growth in the world’s second-largest economy. Bank of America analysts said the readout from the politburo meeting helped confirm that top Chinese leaders were fully aware of the aggregate demand weakness and were serious about addressing it. China to use unconventional stimulus measures to boost economic growth China’s politburo, the Communist Party decision-making body chaired by President Xi Jinping, pledged to adopt a more ‘proactive’ and ‘unconventional’ fiscal policy to revive the country’s economy. According to the Financial Times, markets interpreted the pledge to implement favorable monetary policy positively. Notably, yields on China’s benchmark 10-year bonds dropped five basis points to a record low of 1.86%. It indicated that investors were betting on more interest rate cuts from China’s central bank since bond prices move inversely to yields. Policymakers also vowed to ‘vigorously boost consumption’, indicating strong support from the Chinese government. Investors were looking for more signs that Beijing was stepping up to boost consumer demand as the country’s economy faced deflationary pressure for the better part of 2024. Trade data from December 10 showed a YoY 3.9% decline in China’s November imports, the most recorded since February, which reflected weak demand. Inflation data from December 9 also revealed a YoY 0.2% consumer price increase in November. “The politburo meeting yesterday signalled [a boost to] domestic demand next year. The market is anxiously waiting for details on what exactly the government will do.” – Zhiwei Zhang , president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management Zhang claimed that the contraction of imports was consistent with the weak consumer price data. Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, said China had full confidence in achieving this year’s economic growth target. He added that the country would continue playing its role as the world’s largest economic growth engine. China’s export growth slows down in November amid trade war concerns with the U.S. Capital Economics noted that China’s export growth had slowed significantly in November but doubted whether this signaled the end of the country’s recent export boom. Experts from the economics research company expected exports to accelerate again in the coming months. Capital Economics disclosed that the acceleration would be supported by increased export competitiveness exporters’ front-running tariffs. China’s November exports rose 6.7% from a year earlier, below what Capital Economics analysts had predicted in dollar terms. Chinese leaders are due to hold the Central Economic Work Conference this month to set the agenda for the country’s economy in 2025. Beijing is also expected to prepare for a possible fallout with Washington as Trump’s trade policy changes threaten to widen China’s trade surplus with the U.S., which increased from $33.5 billion in October to $34.9 billion in November. President Xi said China was willing to maintain dialogue with the U.S. government to expand cooperation and manage differences. He asked the U.S. side to meet China halfway in developing healthy and stable U.S.-China relations.

Polygon price prediction for 2024 expects the price of MATIC to surge toward $1.03. By 2030, we expect the MATIC price to record a maximum price of $10.51. Polygon, an Ethereum side chain and layer two scaling solution, has experienced substantial uptake by enterprises and industries in the last year. Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, MATIC. This raises the question: Can MATIC’s price reach $10? This forecast for Polygon’s price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the MATIC price prediction from 2024 to 2030.

Currently, the bears are aiming for a drop below Fib channels. MATIC price analysis 1-day chart: Polygon aims for immediate decline MATIC witnessed a bearish rally after bulls failed to push the altcoin above immediate Fib levels. Over the last 24 hours, the price dropped toward $0.55. However, buyers are strongly defending a decline on the price chart. The 24-hour volume surged to $315K, showing increased interest in trading activity. The price is trading at $0.53, decreasing by over 5.3% in the last 24 hours. Matic/USD price chart.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the MATIC price from an immediate surge. However, if MATIC’s price successfully breaks above $0.5984, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.7615. POL/USDT Chart If bulls cannot initiate a surge, MATIC’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.5273, resulting in a correction to $0.4215. Is MATIC a good investment? MATIC token can be a good investment option in the long run as the project develops a roadmap for its Polygon 2.0 version. Polygon collaborates with diverse industries to enhance adoption, focusing on NFT solutions and Ethereum scalability. Partnerships include Starbucks for an NFT loyalty program and collaborations with Adidas, Prada, and Disney to develop NFT offerings. Why is Matic price down today? Following intense sell off around $0.64, MATIC price failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a break below immediate Fib channels. Will MATIC price touch $1? Yes, Matic price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2024. However, this depends on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will MATIC Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and MATIC gains regulatory recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2030. Is MATIC a good long-term investment? As Polygon continues to expand its offerings, it gains a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, MATIC can be a good long-term investment option. Recent news/ Opinions on MATIC According to Ali Charts, Polygon whales have accumulated more than 59 million POL tokens within the past 48 hours. This significant increase in activity from large holders suggests a growing confidence in the Polygon network. MATIC price prediction December 2024 Following Donald Trump’s victory in the elections, the crypto market witnessed a robust surge in prices. As a result, the altcoin market skyrocketed and touched a peak in market cap, resulting in a bull run in the Polygon price. However, analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices following a bearish October. We expect MATIC to record a minimum price of $0.57 and a maximum price of $0.72, with an average of $0.6 in December. MATIC Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high MATIC Price Prediction December 2024 $0.57 $0.6 $0.72 MATIC price prediction 2024 Based on our thorough technical analysis of MATIC’s historical price data, we anticipate Polygon’s price in 2024’s end to range between a minimum of $0.57 and a maximum of $0.72, with an average trading price around $0.6.

That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $1.34. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year. MATIC price forecast for 2026 Polygon has made PolygonzkEVM available to everyone, making it one of the first ZK Rollups to do so. This is a big step forward for Polygon and gives it an advantage. With its growing use by businesses, innovative technology, and past success, Polygon could reach a new all-time high in 2026. According to the forecast and technical analysis, Polygon’s price is expected to hit a minimum of $2.07 in 2026. The maximum price projection is $2.39, with an average value of $2.12. Polygon (MATIC) price prediction 2027 In 2027, one Polygon is anticipated to reach a minimum price of $3.03. The maximum projection for MATIC price is $3.60, with an average price of $3.11 for the year. Polygon price prediction 2028 For 2028, the price of Polygon is predicted to attain a minimum value of $4.28. The maximum value could soar to $5.36, with an average trading price of $4.43 throughout the year. Polygon price prediction 2029 In 2029, Polygon’s price is forecasted to bottom out at $6.08. The maximum possible level for MATIC price could hit $7.41, with an average forecast price of $6.26. Polygon (MATIC) price prediction 2030 Looking ahead to 2030, Polygon’s price is expected to reach a minimum of $8.93. The maximum projection is $10.51, with an average trading price of $9.18.

We anticipate Polygon’s price in 2024 to range between a minimum of $0.9012 and a maximum of $1.03, with an average trading price of around $0.9298. However, its future market sentiment entirely depends on the SEC’s stance, global regulation, and investor interest. MATIC historic price sentiment MATIC price history MATIC debuted in 2019, initially valued below a cent. Maintained a steady level around $0.02 for the following two years. The transformation of MATIC into Polygon in 2021 led to significant growth. Surged past the $1 mark in May 2021, eventually peaking over $2. Notably, on December 27, 2021, Polygon reached an all-time high of $2.92. However, in 2022, the token struggled, dipping below $1 in May. It experienced several market crashes throughout the year, falling below $0.50 in June. There was a brief resurgence above $1 in August. By the end of 2022, Polygon closed at $0.7585, reflecting a significant 70% decline. The following year, 2023, saw mixed performance for Polygon. It broke the $1 threshold in February but faced setbacks, such as dropping to $0.5593 in June due to Crypto.com news. Nonetheless, it peaked at $0.8775 on July 13. The token then experienced a decline to $0.4946 on September 11. Recovering momentum, it reached $0.9789 on November 14. As of January 16, 2024, Polygon was trading at approximately $0.8514.

To read full editions, subscribe . The Interchain Foundation (ICF) has acquired Skip, a 20-person team deeply embedded in the Cosmos ecosystem, signaling a transformative shift in its operational model. The acquisition establishes a new subsidiary, Interchain Inc., which will oversee product development, ecosystem strategy and execution, led by Skip co-founders Barry Plunkett and Maghnus Mareneck. The move departs from ICF’s previous model of funding independent teams to develop parts of the Cosmos stack. Instead, it centralizes development efforts to align work across the Cosmos Hub, its tech stack and the broader ecosystem. Ethan Buchman, Cosmos co-founder and an outgoing ICF Foundation Council member, praised the acquisition as a pivotal step forward. “[It’s] time to realize all the latent potential seething beneath the surface of the [Cosmos] and the [Cosmos Hub],” Buchman said . His company, Informal Systems, previously coordinated major upgrades like Interchain Security (ICS) and had identified Skip as its top choice for leadership in the ecosystem. Informal Systems had made a “small angel investment” in Skip in 2022, but Buchman emphasized that the investment was repurchased by Skip to eliminate any perceived conflict of interest. Plunkett described the acquisition as a deeply emotional moment for Skip, rooted in his ideological alignment with Cosmos’ mission. “Cosmos is the last ecosystem and stack that truly upholds the values of our movement: sovereignty for users and developers, permissionlessness, and trust-minimization,” Plunkett said on X. Tackling Cosmos’ ‘liquidity crisis’ Skip aims to resolve what Plunkett calls a liquidity crisis in Cosmos. The lack of liquidity has hindered developers, driving many to alternative ecosystems. The Cosmos Hub and its native token, ATOM , will play a central role in addressing this issue. The Cosmos tech stack — including the Cosmos SDK, IBC protocol, and CometBFT consensus — is utilized by over 115 interconnected blockchains and secures billions in assets. However, fragmentation, political strife and a lack of unifying leadership have created challenges for developers in recent years. “The Cosmos Hub right now doesn’t serve any kind of functions for the broader ecosystem, and it’s extremely hard to build on,” Plunkett told Blockworks. “We need to fix that by making it easier for builders and ensuring the Hub provides services to grow and scale chains, especially in terms of liquidity.” The acquisition is part of ICF’s broader strategy to centralize engineering, growth and marketing efforts, creating a cohesive vision for the development of the Cosmos Hub and the Interchain Stack. Skip and ICF will seek endorsement from Cosmos Hub governance for their plan in January. “But ultimately, we don’t have control over that at all,” Mareneck said.
