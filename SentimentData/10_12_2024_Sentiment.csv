Analyzing Bitcoin’s bull market signals,https://crypto.news/from-100k-to-250k-analyzing-bitcoins-bull-market-signals/,"Who would have thought we’d see Bitcoin shoot through the roof this quickly, soaring past $100K, albeit retreating slightly at present? As we move forward into 2025, the main question on our minds is: what lies ahead? Is Bitcoin ( BTC ) a bubble about to burst, or are we on track for $150,000–$200,000 soon? Are there any rational tools to predict its trajectory, or are we left to just play guessing games? From what I’ve observed, the fog starts to lift when you examine on-chain and technical indicators, while also factoring in the macro perspective. Let’s layer these three types of analysis in this article to see what picture emerges for Bitcoin’s next move. Table of Contents Extreme greed, rising active addresses, and record hash rate Weekly Golden Cross signals bull market with $150K-$250K potential RSI signals overbought conditions, hints at pullback or consolidation Fibonacci levels and Bollinger Bands signal key support and potential cooling Visualizing Bitcoin’s market behavior through key indicators Potential crypto space developments in 2025 Closing thoughts Extreme greed, rising active addresses, and record hash rate The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is currently at 78, indicating Extreme Greed, which often signals potential tops in the short term. However, sustained levels of extreme greed during bull markets often align with parabolic price increases before final peaks. This typically precedes short-term pullbacks due to market exuberance, which appears to be what we’re witnessing now as Bitcoin’s price hovers around the $100K level. Crypto Fear & Greed Index | Source: Alternative.me The number of active addresses is increasing and, as of Dec. 8, stands at 855,153, suggesting heightened interest and usage of the Bitcoin network. Number of active BTC addresses | Source: Glassnode As of Dec. 9, 2024, Bitcoin’s hash rate is approximately 850.70 EH/s, reflecting a significant recovery from recent fluctuations but remaining below its all-time high of 949.98 EH/s, recorded on Nov. 26, 2024. While the current hash rate hasn’t yet reclaimed the ATH, this sustained strength reflects miner confidence and network security—long-term bullish signals. Bitcoin’s price tends to follow the hash rate; the more confident miners are about price appreciation, the less likely they are to sell. BTC hash rate | Source: CoinWarz Weekly Golden Cross signals bull market with $150K-$250K potential The weekly Golden Cross, where the 50-week moving average crosses above the 200-week MA, is a highly significant signal for long-term investors because it often marks the start of major bull markets and the conclusion of prolonged bearish phases. The previous instance of this signal occurred when Bitcoin recovered from the 2018 bear market and eventually surged to an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021. Mirroring its behavior in previous bull cycles, this signal reappeared in early 2024 and preceded Bitcoin’s parabolic rise to its recent all-time high of $103,647. Previous bull cycles following weekly Golden Crosses have led to gains of 300%–600%. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin could potentially reach $150,000 to $250,000 before the next major cycle correction. Meanwhile, the next Golden Cross is unlikely until 2026 or 2027, assuming Bitcoin undergoes a complete cycle of price appreciation, correction, and consolidation. BTC Golden & Death Cross pattern | Source: TradingView RSI signals overbought conditions, hints at pullback or consolidation On the weekly timeframe, the Relative Strength Index is at 74.47, consistent with overbought conditions. However, this does not imply a trend reversal right away but rather reflects the possibility of a short-term pullback or a period of sideways price action. In the past, many bull cycles saw similar RSI readings, followed by temporary pullbacks that were then succeeded by renewed rallies to higher highs. In the 2021 bull cycle, the RSI reached similar levels multiple times before peaking above 90, after which Bitcoin experienced a significant correction. Assuming Bitcoin stays in the most recent consolidation range around $100K and the RSI retraces back to a healthier range of 60–65, the next leg upward could occur. A healthy correction of 10%–20% or a sideways period would allow the markets to reset before experiencing sustained growth. For reference, a 10% correction from the all-time high of $103,647 would bring Bitcoin’s price to approximately $93,282. Relative Strength Index | Source: TradingView Fibonacci levels and Bollinger Bands signal key support and potential cooling Fibonacci retracement levels, used in technical analysis to identify potential support and resistance zones, help indicate where a price might retrace before continuing its trend. Based on the chart below: Key Levels: $71,858 (0.618): Major retracement level, acting as a strong support zone (a 30.67% pullback from the all-time high of $103,647). $103,135 (0.786): Significant resistance zone, near the all-time high. Bitcoin’s price is currently trading slightly below the upper Bollinger Band, signaling strong bullish momentum. However, this position also indicates potential overextension, as prices often retrace or consolidate when deviating significantly from the midline (20-week simple moving average, currently at $71,858). A pullback to $71,858 or further consolidation near the current price of $99,249 would represent a normal cooling-off period within the Bollinger Band framework and prepare the market for potential further gains. Fibonacci retracement levels & Bollinger Bands | Source: TradingView Visualizing Bitcoin’s market behavior through key indicators To further visually represent Bitcoin’s market behavior, let’s look at this colored chart below. It includes a color-coded bar at the top that reflects RSI conditions. The currently visible purple and green color blocks suggest periods of oversold or bullish divergence, reflecting bullish momentum and aligning with RSI overbought levels. The second bar shows market structure trends (e.g., ranging, bullish, or bearish). From the chart, we see green blocks that suggest the market is in a bullish phase, confirming breakout behavior. Next, the main oscillator displays the Awesome Oscillator with divergences and pivot points, where the green peaks above zero and brown regions below confirm positive momentum and bullish pivots. The secondary oscillator below the AO displays similar momentum indications, with positive bars (green above zero) suggesting accelerating upward momentum and a strong bullish bias. Bitcoin Rainbow Indicators | Source: TradingView Potential crypto space developments in 2025 Post-halving supply shock, increasing retail and institutional participation, institutional accumulation (companies like MicroStrategy and other corporate treasuries adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset) could push demand for it to new highs. The proportion of institutional investors will likely grow, stabilizing price movements but also making Bitcoin more correlated with traditional markets. Bitcoin’s dominance (currently around 55%) could rise further as investors favor its “digital gold” narrative over altcoins, especially if regulatory scrutiny tightens around smaller tokens. Bitcoin wallet growth will continue as adoption in emerging markets increases, with Bitcoin used as a hedge against local currency devaluation. Major corporations could start settling cross-border transactions in Bitcoin, while in regions with high inflation or de-dollarization trends central banks may increase interest in Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Countries like the U.S., the EU, and the UAE are likely to finalize crypto-friendly regulations , while other jurisdictions may clamp down on decentralized finance and self-custody to maintain control over financial systems. Closing thoughts With a loud explosion of excitement, Bitcoin shattered the $100K barrier, an achievement deemed nothing short of astonishing. Technical indicators, including the weekly Golden Cross and RSI, point toward the possibility of further growth, with projections suggesting a potential climb to $150K–$250K in this bull cycle. However, a healthy period of consolidation or correction would likely provide a stronger foundation for future price action. By 2025, Bitcoin may achieve what was once considered nearly impossible—establishing itself as a major player in the global financial system.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2024-12-09 23:01:13

In a recent X thread, Hougan explained that the regulatory uncertainty is hurting the industry and preventing it from reaching its full potential. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan Stance On Crypto Regulation Clarity Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan pointed out that the U.S. regulatory framework divides financial assets into two categories: securities and commodities. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates securities, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversees commodities. According to Hougan, this division exists because securities often have insiders—entities that hold crucial information unavailable to the public. In contrast, commodities like gold or oil do not have insiders in the same way. This is why they are regulated differently, with the CFTC focusing on ensuring fair markets rather than requiring detailed financial disclosures, as the SEC does for securities. In his X thread, the Bitwise CIO emphasized that decentralized projects, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, cannot have traditional insiders due to their inherent design. These projects are decentralized by nature, meaning there are no central authorities or entities with inside information. Therefore, attempting to classify cryptocurrencies as securities, as is often done in current U.S. regulatory discussions, does not align with the reality of how these networks function. Echoing Hougan’s sentiment, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse had also criticized current crypto regulatory frameworks , arguing that existing securities laws do not align with the technological advancements crypto represents. Decentralization and Regulation Challenges The core idea behind cryptocurrency is decentralization, which is a challenge when it comes to traditional regulatory frameworks. For example, Hougan explained that traditional securities require disclosures like financial statements or ownership structures to prevent insiders from taking advantage of the public. However, in decentralized networks, there is no single entity to disclose such information, making it difficult to fit them under current securities laws. As Hougan points out, the problem is not that crypto lacks transparency but that the current regulatory approach doesn’t consider the unique nature of blockchain technology. Instead of trying to fit crypto into outdated frameworks, Hougan advocates for a more tailored regulatory approach that takes into account the decentralized nature of these projects. This would ensure that investors are protected while allowing for innovation to thrive. The Case for CFTC Regulation One key point Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan made is that instead of trying to regulate decentralized crypto projects as securities under the SEC, there is a growing argument to have the CFTC oversee them. He explained that the CFTC’s focus on creating fair markets, rather than requiring insider disclosures, makes it a more appropriate regulatory body for decentralized networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Hougan pointed out that some in the industry, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse , have argued for CFTC regulation. They believe that the SEC’s current stance on crypto as securities is not only ineffective but also counterproductive. Meanwhile, Garlinghouse took issue with former SEC official John Reed Stark’s claims that cryptocurrencies, including Ripple’s XRP, are securities. Garlinghouse strongly disagreed, calling Stark’s comments “provably false” and asserting that XRP is not a security. Concurrenctly, he criticized the lack of media fact-checking, pointing out that the segment omitted crucial parts of his interview, including his clarification that XRP is not a security under current laws. Subsequently, the US SEC’s strict approach, according to Matt Hougan, could stifle innovation and harm the industry, especially when good projects are caught in the regulatory crossfire alongside bad actors.

Technical indicators suggest potential for more growth. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 42.97, indicating the coin isn’t overbought yet. A Stochastic level of 34.17 implies momentum may be building. Although the MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0006291, it could be poised for a reversal. If JasmyCoin breaks through the nearest resistance level at $0.0596, it might target the second resistance at $0.0625. This move would represent an increase of about 31%. On the downside, if the price drops, it may find support at $0.0197 or even $0.0121. XRP Over the last month, the XRP price surged by 359.68, and by 415.82% in the last six months. Currently, XRP trades between $1.60 and $2.67. The coin is approaching its nearest resistance level at $3.00. Breaking through this point could lead XRP to the next resistance level at $3.61. On the flipside, the closest support level is at $0.9099, which could help stabilize the price if it starts to fall. Technical indicators provide further insight. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.54, slightly above the 100-day average of $2.42, suggesting a potential uptrend in the short term. The RSI is at 56.65, indicating that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic value is 50.66, reflecting a neutral stance. A MACD level of 0.0159 suggests continued price increases for XRP. You might also like: Experts highlight XRP, Cardano, PEPE, and XYZVerse as top bets Pepe Pepe has been on a remarkable run lately.

Interested investors join the DOGEN circle through its presale . Dogecoin: From meme to market contender Dogecoin launched in 2013 as a playful alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply and generates 10,000 new coins every minute. While originally considered just a meme coin, Dogecoin surged in value in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market cap exceeding $50 billion. This growth was largely driven by social media buzz, particularly endorsements from Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s popularity underscores the power of community and social media in shaping financial markets. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin’s appeal continues to hinge on social media influence and overall market sentiment. You might also like: How a TikTok meme turned $1,000 into $1M— DOGEN poised to follow suit Pepe PEPE is a deflationary meme coin on the Ethereum network, inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme. Launched without transaction taxes, it maintains a pure meme coin identity without utility features. In mid-2023, it reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion, attracting significant attention in the crypto community and sparking a meme coin trend. Pepe features a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and a redistribution system to reward long-term holders. Its roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. As an ERC-20 token, PEPE benefits from Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake security. It is available on platforms like Uniswap, Binance, and KuCoin. PEPE’s popularity and community support contribute to its prominence in the current market cycle. Dogwifhat Dogwifhat is a new meme coin on the Solana blockchain, inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. WIF stands out among dog-themed tokens in the crypto space, focusing on creating a sense of community and fun. In the current market cycle, interest in meme coins continues and WIF’s popularity is growing. The coin leverages Solana’s fast and low-cost transactions, which may attract users. Its appeal lies in the combination of meme culture and blockchain technology, which some investors find intriguing. BONK BONK is another meme coin on the Solana blockchain, featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. After a Coinbase listing, BONK surged over 100%. 50% of Bonk’s supply was airdropped to Solana’s NFT and DeFi participants, serving as a “community coin.” In mid-December 2023, BONK was the third-largest meme coin by market cap, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like a high total supply and the volatile nature of meme coins, BONK’s integration into the Solana ecosystem and involvement in dApps like BonkSwap make it a notable player. In the current market cycle, BONK shows potential due to its community focus and ecosystem integration. Conclusion Although DOGE, PEPE, WIF, and BONK may have limited immediate potential, DOGEN stands out. Tailored for those pursuing the best in life, it embodies luxury and success. With an expected 700% presale growth and potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN follows the successful paths of tokens like BONK and WIF. It seeks to gather a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters. For more information on DOGEN, visit their website , Twitter , or Telegram .

On Monday, these analysts raised the price target for Coinbase Global, Inc’s stock COIN to $420 per share. The revised estimate represents a notable increase from the firm’s $375 target. This increase reflects the growing optimism around Coinbase’s performance. This is largely driven by strong activity in the crypto market, particularly in December. Crypto Market Activity Drives Coinbase Price Target Increase The analysts attributed the boost to a major surge in retail activity within the crypto market. The exchange’s trading volumes are on track to reach record levels. This makes it one of the most active months for crypto trading in Coinbase’s history. The analysts pointed to Bitcoin’s volatility, particularly as its price approached $100,000, as a key factor driving the surge in market activity. They also highlighted the growing interest in altcoins , contributing to the boost. This combination of factors has led to a significant increase in trading volume across the crypto market. Coinbase’s Strong Year and Surge in Share Price Coinbase’s stock has soared more than 80% in 2024, reflecting the broader growth in the crypto market. The company saw a significant sharp uptick in its share price. This surge follows Donald Trump’s unexpected victory in November’s presidential election. Trump’s victory catalyzed a rally across digital assets, pushing Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark. This sparked renewed investor interest in crypto. Many investors view Coinbase’s stocks as an easy way to access the crypto market. Its strong infrastructure and market dominance make it a popular choice for those wanting to profit from crypto’s rise without managing digital assets directly. Looking Ahead: Strong Predictions for Q4 and 2025 Needham’s analysts expressed optimism about Coinbase’s financial trajectory. The analysts forecasted significant results for Q4 2024 and into 2025. Needham’s analysts predicted that Coinbase will continue to post strong financial results in the near future. For the fourth quarter of 2024, they predict the company will report $435 billion in trading volume and generate $2.1 billion in revenue. They expect the company’s stock earnings to reach $2.37 per share. Looking ahead to 2025, they forecast the company will earn $8.9 billion in revenue and report earnings per share of $9.61. Despite these optimistic predictions, Coinbase’s stock fell 8% on Monday, trading at $316.01 by midday. However, this dip does not overshadow the strong growth the company has experienced this year. Its share price has surged from under $200 to over $300, especially following the election. This highlights the strong momentum behind the company’s stock.

Or how Cosmos is shaking things up with its new interoperability features that connect blockchains like never before? These breakthroughs are turning heads in the crypto world. Amidst these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) emerges as a fresh contender with a bold vision. Unlike others, Qubetics addresses real-world issues that have held back blockchain adoption. With its presale already attracting attention, $TICS is a strong pick for anyone looking for the best coins with 1000X potential . Qubetics Redefines Blockchain Development with QubeQode IDE Qubetics is set to change the game with its innovative QubeQode IDE , an all-in-one tool for simplifying blockchain application development. Whether you’re a tech-savvy entrepreneur or someone with no coding experience, this platform empowers users to create decentralised applications with ease. Imagine a small retail business wanting to launch a blockchain-based loyalty programme. Instead of hiring expensive developers, the owner can use QubeQode’s drag-and-drop features to create a smart contract and manage customer rewards effortlessly. Or picture a logistics company needing better transparency for supply chains. QubeQode provides form-based configurations that allow managers to track goods and authenticate records—all without dealing with complex code. By offering pre-built blockchain functionalities, like token management and user authentication, and a library of pre-written code snippets, QubeQode eliminates the barriers that often keep businesses from exploring blockchain solutions. Qubetics has already sold over 300 million $TICS tokens to more than 8,000 holders, raising $5.3 million in its 12th presale stage. Currently priced at $0.031, $TICS is set to see a 10% price jump in the 13th stage starting this weekend. Each stage lasts just seven days, wrapping up every Sunday at midnight. Now, let’s look at the numbers. An investment of $36,000 at the current price would yield approximately 1,161,290 $TICS tokens. If the price reaches $0.25 by the presale’s end, that investment could grow to $290,322—equating to a 703.21% ROI. Post-presale projections suggest even higher gains, with the token potentially reaching $15, offering returns of 48,092.91%. To learn more about this project, take a look at this video . Litecoin’s Upgrades and Expanding Appeal Litecoin has long been known as Bitcoin’s “silver,” but its recent developments are helping it carve out its own unique identity. With faster block times and reduced transaction fees, Litecoin is positioning itself as a go-to option for everyday payments and digital transfers. The latest upgrade enhances its transaction processing capabilities, making it a reliable alternative for merchants looking for quick settlements. Its focus on scalability and reduced energy consumption also aligns with growing demands for eco-friendly crypto solutions. Litecoin is also gaining traction in cross-border transactions, providing a cost-effective and efficient way to transfer money internationally. With its robust network and practical use cases, Litecoin continues to solidify its position in the market as a high-potential investment. Cosmos Connects Blockchains with Seamless Interoperability Cosmos is taking blockchain communication to the next level with its new interoperability features. By allowing blockchains to share data and assets seamlessly, Cosmos eliminates the silos that have long hindered blockchain innovation. This development is a game-changer for developers and users alike. Decentralised apps can now operate across multiple networks, opening up endless possibilities for creating new solutions. For example, financial apps can leverage data from multiple chains, offering users a more connected and efficient experience. Cosmos’s focus on scalability and usability ensures its place as a forward-thinking platform. Its commitment to interoperability is set to attract more developers and users, further boosting its adoption in the blockchain space. Which Coin Offers the Best 1000X Potential? Qubetics, Litecoin, and Cosmos each bring unique strengths to the table. While Litecoin focuses on fast transactions and secure payments, Cosmos excels in blockchain interoperability. However, Qubetics stands out with its QubeQode IDE and its ability to simplify blockchain adoption across industries. For those eyeing exponential growth, Qubetics’ $TICS token is hard to ignore. Its presale offers a promising entry point, and its innovative solutions make it a contender for the best coins with 1000X potential. Just remember to do your research and invest wisely in this dynamic and ever-evolving market.

If Amazon embraces digital assets, it will join other business titans exploring the inclusion of Bitcoin in their asset portfolios. Related Reading: Countdown To $5 XRP: Engineer Predicts Milestone On ‘Strong Fundamentals’ Bitcoin As Financial Reserve Option Shareholders of Amazon urged the online retail store to evaluate the possibility of adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, saying that the firstborn cryptocurrency could enhance the investors’ value in the long term because it is one way of protecting it from inflation. A US-based think tank told Amazon to assess the prospect of using a portion of its financial reserve to hold Bitcoin to increase its shareholder’s value and fight off inflation. According to a recommendation made by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), the shareholders of the company are asking its Board to investigate if including cryptocurrencies into the treasury of the online retail store serves the best long-term interests of shareholders. HISTORY: SHAREHOLDERS ARE PETITIONING $2.3 TRILLION AMAZON TO BUY #BITCOIN BTC IS IN THE BEST “LONG-TERM INTEREST OF SHAREHOLDERS” 🚀 pic.twitter.com/Nj2wCNrVUn — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) December 9, 2024 The NCPPR submitted the shareholder proposal to Amazon to consider the crypto strategy during the company’s 2025 annual shareholders’ meeting. The American think tank suggested that Amazon should assess the benefits of holding some Bitcoin, encouraging the company to allot even 5% of its $585 billion assets to the cryptocurrency. “Though Bitcoin is currently a volatile asset – as Amazon stock has been at times throughout its history – corporations have a responsibility to maximize shareholder value over the long-term as well as the short-term,” NCPRR stated in the document. The researchers said that including some Bitcoins can diversify the company’s balance sheet, solving this problem without taking on too much volatility. Fighting Inflation The NCPRR said that the inflation rate in the US is going up, adding that cash and bonds are no longer the best approach to protect Amazon’s money. The US-based think tank cited that in the last four years, the average inflation rate in the country is pegged at 4.95%, which even went up to 9.1% in June 2022. It added that the true inflation rate is significantly higher, saying that several studies showed that it is nearly double the Consumer Price Index on occasion. “Amazon should – and perhaps has a fiduciary duty to – consider adding assets to its treasury that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short term,” NCPPR remarked. Simple. Accept bitcoin payments? 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/ud5PVNYHrj — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) December 8, 2024 Bitcoin A Good Option The NCPPR believes that Amazon could preserve billions of dollars of shareholder value by simply holding Bitcoin. The researchers explained that the alpha crypto has been increasing in value unlike cash and bonds whose value is lower than the “true inflation rate”, adding that the digital asset surged by 130% this year, which is performing better than bonds.

He shared his thoughts via a LinkedIn post. Nearly 75% of available Bitcoin is held by 2% of its addresses According to the presentation, a paltry 2% of BTC addresses hold 74% of the digital asset. This highly concentrated power, Aggarwal says, contradicts BTC’s founding principles. He explained: Bitcoin was supposed to be decentralized, step away from the central banks, a freedom from authorities. Do you know it is actually the opposite of that? ~ Aggarwal The analyst also said the concentration could spell trouble for the coin and its network should the few BTC whales decide to dump it. He gave the example of an unnamed Chinese firm that triggered a $649 million flash crash when it sold its holdings. Contrasting thoughts on BTC decentralization Aggarwal’s post received a lot of comments on the issue with some people criticizing his claims while others supported him. Maureen Salim is one of those in support. She depicted the 2% as dragons guarding the gold (BTC). To her, investing in BTC is a high-stakes poker game in which small-scale traders are the chips. She agreed they’d suffer most of the whales decided to sell their stashes. But to Olivier C., Aggarwal was missing the point. He explained that by decentralization, Bitcoiners meant the consensus protocol, which protected the BTC platform. Meanwhile, distribution refers to the amounts held by the wallets. He added that the anti-BTC propaganda was TradFi’s way of continuing to control the financial system. Olivier insisted that BTC was the key to unlocking the free economy. What next for BTC decentralization? The debate on BTC decentralization has remained thorny for a long time. However, it’s coming back to the fore following increased interest in the asset by institutional investors. Some say that shift is beneficial to the coin as it shows the confidence of large-scale investors in BTC. Meanwhile, other crypto users are wary that the entry of big-monied players in the space makes the coin inaccessible to retailers. As the debate rages, there’s a growing need to audit Bitcoin’s evolution to ensure it stays true to the creator’s intentions.

These tokens have gone from niche internet jokes to major players with life-changing potential, sparking attention from seasoned traders and everyday dreamers alike. Think of them as that surprise street snack you grab during a long day—unexpected, exciting, and exactly what you needed when you least expected it. And right now, the market is abuzz with opportunities that are shaping up to be some of the best meme coins for massive return potential. BTFD Coin is one of the standout names on this list, as its presale has proven to be a roaring success. With 44 billion tokens sold and over $2.6 million raised, this token is creating waves that investors can’t ignore. At its current stage, priced at $0.0001, BTFD Coin’s potential price surge could position it as a frontrunner for anyone aiming to get their hands on the best meme coins for massive return potential. Neiro and Non-Playable Coin are also stepping into the spotlight, offering unique opportunities that are exciting investors hungry for explosive returns. Whether it’s meme culture, community engagement, or just sheer market momentum, these coins are riding trends that could change the game for investors. Let’s break down these coins and see what makes them stand out. BTFD Coin: A Presale That Proves the Hype Is Real BTFD Coin has had quite the journey. Its presale numbers are nothing short of legendary—44 billion tokens in the bag and $2.6 million raised. That’s a lot of investor confidence, and it paints a picture of how much potential this token has going forward. The price currently sits at $0.0001, but here’s where things get exciting: analysts are projecting that BTFD Coin could climb to $0.0006 after its launch. That’s a hefty price jump and makes it one of the best meme coins for massive return potential. Think about this—if you were to take a bold step and drop $10,000 into BTFD Coin at this stage, you’d secure a jaw-dropping 100 million BTFD Coins. Now, if it climbs to $0.0006, your initial $10,000 would turn into a cool $60,000. And let’s not forget that BTFD Coin offers a staking reward system averaging a staggering 90% APY . This token isn’t just about market trends; it’s backed by a vibrant community (known as the Bulls Squad), strong staking opportunities, and an innovative approach to the market. If you’re on the hunt for exciting, trendsetting opportunities, BTFD Coin is a no-brainer. Neiro: The Next Market Challenger with a Vision Neiro is the cool little sister of Doge, carrying forward the spirit of meme coin culture while carving out its own path. Adopted by the same woman who previously owned Kabosu—the dog behind the iconic Doge meme—Neiro represents heritage and community spirit. Neiro made headlines as the first meme coin to deploy on the Ethereum blockchain, capturing the attention of Vitalik Buterin on August 4th, 2024 during the New Moon. Vitalik confirmed a generous donation of over $500,000 to an animal welfare fund shortly after, marking the second time he has interacted with a meme coin (the first being the SHIB token in 2021). Originally abandoned and sent to a stray shelter, Neiro’s journey mirrors resilience and recovery—much like the cryptosphere itself. Now fully community-owned and managed, Neiro prioritises collaboration and charitable giving. The team has already donated to the shelter that once cared for her and has plans for more initiatives in the future. Today, it’s trading at $0.0019, showing strong market momentum with exciting potential ahead. With its unique story, charitable impact, and growing presence, Neiro is emerging as one of the best meme coins for massive return potential. Non-Playable Coin: A Meme Revolution in the Making With its name derived from one of the most iconic gaming references—those quirky NPCs that always seem to be stuck on repeat—Non-Playable Coin has successfully carved out a unique niche in the meme market. And while it may seem playful or even a bit offbeat at first glance, this token is backed by an ambitious roadmap, creative investor interest, and a strong community vibe that could lead to remarkable returns. The market has a funny way of rewarding meme coins that tap into pop culture nostalgia and storytelling. Non-Playable Coin does this brilliantly. Predictions are already pointing toward Non-Playable Coin’s potential for explosive price gains as more people tune into its charm and vision. It’s worth $0.03623 today and is estimated to rise to a range of $0.036903 to $0.174123 in 2025. So, whether you’re gaming-obsessed, meme-savvy, or just love the idea of participating in niche internet trends with investment potential, NPC could become one of the most exciting opportunities in your portfolio. Why These Tokens Matter Right Now The crypto market can feel unpredictable at times, much like a high-stakes cricket match where momentum swings with every ball. That said, tokens like BTFD Coin, Neiro, and Non-Playable Coin are proving they can not only adapt but thrive in a volatile market. These tokens have the community backing, market trends, and features to ensure they are more than just a passing fad. Whether you’re drawn to BTFD Coin’s presale success and potential price hike, Neiro’s strong utility-driven vision, or Non-Playable Coin’s meme-friendly community, each coin offers something unique. Investors who act quickly could position themselves to make significant returns as these tokens climb further up the market ladder. The Final Play: Your Next Step If you’ve been on the sidelines wondering which tokens to explore, the market isn’t going to wait.

The campaigns are led from two ends, with CEDAR Innovation Foundation leading an online onslaught in social media, while Blockchain Association and DeFi Education Fund are writing to the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Through X, Crenshaw is accused of being anti-crypto more than the outgoing chair of the commission, Gary Gensler. The advocacy group launched a new five-figure digital ad campaign that will be shared across all social media platforms in Washington, DC. The ad addresses lawmakers, urging them to reject Democratic commissioner Crenshaw’s renomination to the SEC. The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to vote on Crenshow’s renomination on Wednesday morning. If the House confirms her, Crenshaw will serve on the commission until June 2029, which advocates feel will undermine cryptocurrency as a whole. Blockchain Association and DeFi Educational Fund write to the committee As the campaign against Crenshaw is picking momentum in social media, the Blockchain Association and DeFi Education Fund have written a letter to the Senate to do their representation duty by voting against Crenshaw’s renomination. The letter details several justifications as to why Crenshaw is not fit to hold a seat on the SEC. The group feels like Crenshaw can not uphold the rule of law. They cited a case where she has operated with impunity while overlooking the court’s position. Crenshaw blatantly refused to approve spot Bitcoin ETP despite the DC Circuit Courts confirming that there is no justifiable reason for them to reject it. According to the advocacy groups, Crenshaw’s character doesn’t embody the SEC’s merit-neutral mission or the needs of American investors—including the one-fifth of Americans who own digital assets. America’s incoming administration is taking an interest in crypto The Senate is urged to reject her and the failed policies of the past instead of approving the nomination, which will have extreme consequences for crypto lovers. President-elect Donald Trump appears interested in digital assets and has committed to forming a special crypto reserve. Trump said that America must start warming towards crypto, or it will be left behind. He highlights how other countries are leveraging crypto for their growth. He pointed to the United Arab Emirates as a valid example of a nation that has embraced crypto and has made progressive policies in the sector.

It is worth noting that its price rally has been accompanied by a significant spike in its funding rates, a critical metric reflecting sentiment in the futures market. The metric, analyzed by CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC, has reached levels not seen since January 2024. This surge in funding rates suggests a growing optimism among traders, with many anticipating the possibility of Ethereum reaching new all-time highs. Related Reading: Large Ethereum Transactions Grow As ETH Breaks Yearly Highs But Is A Correction On The Horizon? Despite this enthusiasm, the market’s current state raises questions about sustainability. Historically, such spikes in funding rates have often preceded short-term corrections, stabilizing the market. According to Shayan, the current situation mirrors January 2024, when Ethereum saw an 88% rally following similar market conditions. The analyst suggests that while the current rally may pave the way for further gains, a pullback could be essential for healthier long-term growth. Funding rates serve as a barometer for market sentiment, particularly in the futures market. A positive funding rate indicates a preference for long positions, with traders expecting higher prices. Ethereum Funding Rates Hit Multi-Month High “Funding rates are at levels last seen in January 2024, when Ethereum rallied by 88%. This reflects increased long-position interest as optimism grows. Similar to January, this sharp increase suggests the likelihood of a pullback.” –… pic.twitter.com/euKGhIqNKO — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 9, 2024 As Ethereum’s funding rates hit multi-month highs, this trend signals a surge in bullish sentiment. However, history shows such sharp increases can create short-term market imbalances, leading to corrections. Shayan noted: While Ethereum’s rally is underpinned by bullish sentiment, the spike in funding rates signals the need for a short-term correction, paving the way for healthier and more sustainable price growth. Ethereum Market Performance Ethereum remains below the $4,000 mark after falling below this level last week. Currently, ETH is trading at $3,819, reflecting a 4.9% decline in the past 24 hours. Despite the recent drop, the asset has gained nearly 30% over the past month. However, ETH’s latest dip further distances it from its all-time high of $4,878 in 2021, leaving it 20.5% below that peak.

In a new interview with Real Vision’s Raoul Pal, Tapiero says that he thinks US-based decentralized finance (DeFi) could explode in size after previously being pushed outside the country due to hostile regulators. Tapiero, the founder of multiple venture capital firms in the space, says that institutions are on the edge of discovering just how small the DeFi world is compared to the rest of the financial markets. “So if I’m looking out over the next two years, the thing that I think could really take off is US-based DeFi. So DeFi two years ago basically got pushed outside of the US. And so, the first step for everybody is through a centralized exchange, they come on their Kraken, or Gemini, Coinbase, and they buy their Bitcoin. But now, especially Coinbase, Kraken too, they’ve made it easy to port over into DeFi, not everyone is going to buy a Ledger and go through Ledger Live or MetaMask. But I do think that once these institutional guys, they’re going to own their Bitcoin through the ETF, they’re going to own their Ethereum. They’re then going to start to understand as they focus on it that it’s really the decentralized financial world that has the ability to grow. I mean TVL (total value locked) in DeFi is I think $100 billion, which is very small. The total value in the space today if I add up all the cryptocurrency and all the equities is around $4 trillion. So of that $4 trillion sitting there, only really 2% of it is actually active in DeFi. And I think that’s going to change.” TVL is a metric representing the amount of assets staked or locked in a platform. At time of writing, DeFi TVL stands at $136.232 billion.

Anton Tkachev, a deputy from the “New People” party in the State Duma, submitted an official appeal to Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, urging the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve similar to traditional state reserves that hold foreign currencies such as the US dollar and euro. Bitcoin as an Alternative Reserve Asset In his letter, Russian lawmaker Anton Tkachev highlighted the limitations of traditional foreign exchange reserves, which are vulnerable to volatility, inflation, and sanctions. These challenges, he argues, pose a risk to Russia’s financial stability. He proposed Bitcoin as an alternative reserve asset, noting that digital currencies are not subject to the controls or financial systems of individual countries. This makes them more resilient in the face of geopolitical tensions. This move precedes an enonomist Peter Schiff motion projection that the Biden admin should sell all US government’s Bitcoin holdings. “With limited access to international payment systems for countries under sanctions, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could become essential tools for global trade,” Tkachev wrote. He emphasized that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature makes it an ideal asset for Russia to store its reserves, enabling it to bypass traditional financial systems and avoid sanctions. Russian Lawmaker Stance On BTC’s Growing Investment Appeal Tkachev also pointed out Bitcoin’s strong investment performance in recent years, noting that the cryptocurrency reached a value of $100,000 in December 2024. He argued that Bitcoin’s high returns make it not only a stable store of value but also an opportunity for significant financial gain. Given this growth, Tkachev suggested that Russia could benefit from holding Bitcoin in its reserves, similar to the way nations hold gold or foreign currency reserves. In line with this, companies like MicroStrategy, have already adopted Bitcoin as part of their investment strategy. MicroStrategy has been consistently purchasing Bitcoin, most recently acquiring 21,550 BTC for $2.1 billion in December. This brings its total holdings to over 423,000 BTC, further cementing the company’s commitment to Bitcoin as a long-term investment. Similarly, Hut 8, a Bitcoin mining company, announced plans to raise $500 million through stock sales, with a portion of the proceeds earmarked for additional Bitcoin purchases. Russia’s Cryptocurrency Strategy and International Trends Russian lawmaker Anton Tkachev’s proposal aligns with Russia’s broader strategy to develop alternatives to traditional financial systems. The Central Bank of Russia is already preparing to launch an experiment to use cryptocurrencies in cross-border payments, aiming to facilitate international trade while bypassing Western sanctions. This initiative is part of a global trend where countries are exploring the potential of digital currencies to maintain economic stability. Russia’s interest in Bitcoin as a reserve asset is also in line with broader international developments. In the United States, Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced the “Bitcoin Act of 2024,” which proposes the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve to strengthen the U.S. dollar and increase the country’s influence in the global cryptocurrency market. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has also voiced support for a Bitcoin reserve, with some of his campaign promises including the idea of holding a strategic reserve of Bitcoin to further the U.S. economy’s resilience in the digital age. While Russia’s proposal is still in the early stages, it reflects a growing trend among countries to explore Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has speculated that countries like China could eventually create their own Bitcoin reserves, especially as global economic pressures continue to rise. He noted that smaller nations might be the first to adopt such a strategy, but larger economies could eventually follow suit.

Anton Tkachev, Duma state deputy of Russia , has urged the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve in the country after the Russian economy and business were sanctioned by the U.S. In his proposal, Tkachev mentioned that Bitcoin ( BTC ) should be treated in the reserves as any other traditional currency as well due to the borderless system of blockchain. “I ask you to assess the feasibility of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve in Russia by analogy with state reserves in traditional currencies. If this initiative is approved, I ask you to submit it to the government of the federation for further implementation,” The deputy stated, on RIA Novosti local news platform This reserve will not only serve as a currency but also contribute as an alternative instrument for storing the value of money. Yet traditional currencies are also threatened by inflation and sanctions, but Bitcoin is not. He also noted that the central bank has been preparing for the launch of a cross-border payment settlement for cryptocurrency , which indicates that the reserve is also possible.

On December 10, 2024, PEPE is outperforming major cryptocurrencies and defying the market trend with its impressive performance. PEPE Current Price Momentum PEPE is trading near $0.00002725 at press time, having recorded a price gain of over 3.50% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume increased by 16%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. However, this modest price surge comes during a period when the majority of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL), are struggling to gain momentum. PEPE Technical Analysis With this recent price surge, PEPE has reached a crucial level of $0.00002750, which currently represents a make-or-break situation for the meme coin. According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, if PEPE closes a four-hour candle above $0.00002750, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 30% to reach $0.000036 in the coming days. Source: Trading View On the other hand, if PEPE fails to hold above the $0.000024 level, this bullish thesis may be invalidated.

Table of Contents XRP attempts $3 but faces resistance PropiChain: A formidable XRP rival Why PropiChain’s presale is creating FOMO Conclusion The XRP price came close to the $3 milestone, reigniting interest in Ripple’s technology. However, the token has seen volatile price swings since then, sparking speculation of a potential crash. Amidst this uncertainty, traders are turning their attention to an emerging Ripple rival, PropiChain , which is predicted to have a 32,039% rally. XRP attempts $3 but faces resistance XRP is known for its ability to facilitate instant and cheap international transactions, with financial institutions around the globe widely adopting it. This widespread adoption was a major factor in the recent XRP price surge. Ripple’s recent legal victories against the SEC also fueled the fast rise of the XRP price. Investors were hopeful that XRP’s momentum would continue, driven by Ripple’s ongoing partnerships and developments in the financial technology sector. However, XRP price’s rise has not come without challenges, as it has suffered a decline again. The drop has raised concerns, with market analysts pointing out that such rapid price increases often precede sharp declines as the market adjusts to correct overinflated values. As such, many traders are on edge, worried about a further XRP price crash and looking for ways to secure their investments.

Metaverse integration: PropiChain will enable virtual property tours and global networking opportunities through its metaverse platform, connecting stakeholders worldwide. Why PropiChain’s presale is creating FOMO PropiChain’s presale has emerged as a hotspot for investors seeking high returns.

Target price by 2025: $2+ (a 32,039% rally). For investors who missed out on XRP price’s early gains, PropiChain presents a second chance. PropiChain’s credibility is enhanced by its BlockAudit security audit, which ensures the platform’s robustness. Its listing on CoinMarketCap has also provided greater visibility, attracting retail and institutional investors.

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crying Kamala on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crying Kamala by entering its contract address – 5eCJhSGBUN4YwJHLU9ZcWjrjmoufVznjzNBHfo4TN1P7 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CRYKAMA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-10 02:00:04

During a recent interview, Peirce identified three major priorities she believes will provide much-needed clarity and foster growth in the crypto industry. Hester Peirce Unveils SEC’s Crypto Agenda for Reform Under Donald Trump According to a Fox Business interview , Hester Peirce made it clear that the SEC’s regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies must evolve under Donald Trump’s leadership. One of her primary points was to halt what she referred to as the “regulatory suppression” of the crypto industry. She argued that the SEC should cease restricting crypto’s access to necessary services, such as custody, which are vital for the sector’s growth. Peirce stressed that such services are essential for crypto businesses to function properly and continue their expansion. Her call for ending the blockages on custody and other services aligns with a broader vision of enabling the crypto market. Moreover, most recently, David Sacks, the incoming Crypto Czar, addressed the growing concerns around Operation Chokepoint 2.0. His comments followed an account from Chris Lane, the former CTO of Silvergate Bank, who claimed that regulators, rather than the collapse of FTX, led to the bank’s downfall. Lane described how regulatory actions severely limited Silvergate’s ability to hold deposits from digital asset clients, ultimately forcing the bank to shut down. Consequently, Sacks suggested that these allegations warrant further investigation, signaling a possible probe into Operation Chokepoint 2.0. Providing Clarity on SEC Jurisdiction Another central issue raised by Hester Peirce was the need for clearer guidance on what falls within the SEC’s jurisdiction. She highlighted the importance of providing clarity on which activities and assets the SEC should regulate. Peirce explained that clear delineations are needed to identify what qualifies as a security and what does not. Peirce argued that clear definitions will help crypto businesses better understand their obligations. This clarity will allow them to navigate crypto regulations more effectively, reducing the risk of legal errors. In addition, Hester Peirce also stressed the need for collaboration between the SEC and crypto industry stakeholders. She proposed that the SEC work directly with the industry to figure out how existing rules apply and where adjustments should be made. Peirce suggested that this collaboration should be a public, open process, where all parties involved can participate. Coincidentally, these remarks come as Coinbase exposed FDIC “pause letters” obtained through a FOIA request. The letters show the agency’s role in restricting banking services to crypto businesses in 2022. According to the documents, FDIC instructed banks to pause crypto-related activities for further review. Coinbase’s CLO, Paul Grewal, emphasized that these letters confirm the existence of coordinated efforts to limit crypto banking access.

With so many options available, it’s easy to get lost in the noise. However, some projects stand out for their potential, unique features, and real-world utility. Among these, one platform quickly gains attention for its innovation and the excitement surrounding its presale: Qubetics ($TICS). But before diving into its thrilling presale details, let’s take a quick look at the recent developments of other notable coins in the market. Binance has made waves with its listing of Across Protocol (ACX) and Orca (ORCA), pushing these tokens into the spotlight. Meanwhile, Quant continues to maintain a strong presence in the market, providing blockchain interoperability with impressive performance. This article will explore why Qubetics is not just another altcoin but one of the best altcoins to invest in now, alongside these other rising stars. Qubetics: The Future of Blockchain Development is Here Qubetics is not just another blockchain platform. It’s a game-changer, offering tools and features that make blockchain development accessible to all. One of the standout features of Qubetics is the QubeQode IDE , which provides a visual development environment that makes blockchain app creation simpler than ever. With drag-and-drop components, users can seamlessly integrate pre-built functionalities such as user authentication and token management. This eliminates the need for complicated coding, allowing developers to focus on innovation rather than the technicalities of blockchain creation. Add the form-based configuration options to this, and you have a user-friendly way to define application logic and smart contract parameters. For those who need more advanced tools, Qubetics provides a code snippet library packed with pre-written code to speed up the development process for common blockchain tasks. But Qubetics isn’t stopping there. The platform also leverages AI-driven development to enhance the experience further. AI-powered smart contract generation ensures developers can create secure and efficient contracts based on their needs. At the same time, code completion and error detection functionalities make the development process faster and more reliable. AI also suggests optimisations, ensuring that applications are as efficient and secure as possible. Recently, Qubetics launched an AMA session to give its community deeper insights into the platform’s capabilities. For anyone curious to learn more, this session is a must-watch. With such cutting-edge features and a community-driven approach, Qubetics is undoubtedly one of the best altcoins to invest in now. Binance Boosts ACX and ORCA: Big Gains and Big Risks In the world of crypto, listings on major exchanges can send a coin’s price soaring, and that’s exactly what happened when Binance added Across Protocol (ACX) and Orca (ORCA) to its platform. Following the announcement, ACX surged by an impressive 131%, while ORCA rose over 90% in just 24 hours. This strong performance has caught the attention of many, but Binance’s decision to tag these tokens with a “Seed Tag” signals the high volatility and risks involved. Users must take a risk-awareness quiz every 90 days to continue trading these tokens, adding an extra layer of caution for potential investors. With both tokens already gaining traction, it’s clear that they have become one of the best altcoins to invest in now for those prepared to manage the risks. Quant: Leading the Charge in Blockchain Interoperability While other projects rise and fall, Quant remains a stalwart in the crypto market. Known for its ability to enable seamless interoperability between different blockchain networks, Quant is consistently regarded as one of the most promising projects in the space.

Stellar (XLM) is on the verge of a breakout, with analysts setting sights on a potential rally to $0.90. Meanwhile, Monero (XMR) holds its ground as the undisputed king of privacy coins. But here’s the twist: a new contender, Qubetics ($TICS) , is shaking up the game with a mind-blowing presale, surpassing $5.3 million in investments. With analysts forecasting jaw-dropping ROI figures, everyone’s buzzing about whether this could be the next big thing. So, what’s the fuss about Qubetics? This isn’t just another flashy token with big promises and no backbone. It’s diving deep into real-world asset tokenisation, a fancy way of saying it’s bridging the gap between your tangible assets and the blockchain. But more on that later. For now, let’s explore why these three coins might just be the best coins to join for short-term gains and beyond. Qubetics ($TICS): The Real-World Asset Tokenisation Revolution If you’ve ever wished for a simpler, more accessible way to manage your assets, Qubetics has entered the chat. This blockchain powerhouse focuses on real-world asset tokenisation (RWAT) . What’s that? Think about transforming physical assets—like property, fine art, or even wine—into digital tokens that can be easily bought, sold, or traded. It’s not just futuristic; it’s here and shaking up how we think about ownership. Imagine this: You own a vintage car, a piece of land, or even a rare baseball card. Traditionally, selling or even leveraging those assets would involve tedious paperwork and loads of middlemen. Enter Qubetics. Their platform lets you tokenise these assets, breaking them into fractionalised ownership. That means you could sell just a piece of your property instead of the whole thing—unlocking liquidity without giving up full control. Businesses are already catching on. Real-estate developers could tokenise luxury apartments, allowing investors from across the globe to own shares. Small businesses could tokenise equipment or intellectual property, turning their assets into accessible investment opportunities. Heck, even local art galleries could tokenise their collections, opening doors for everyday investors to own a Picasso—well, part of one. Click here to watch how real estate investors can get the best out of their investments using Qubetics. But the real kicker? Qubetics’ presale is taking off like a SpaceX rocket. With over 300 million tokens sold to 8,000 holders, the project has already raised a staggering $5.3 million. And the current price of $TICS at $0.0311 is about to jump by 10% when Stage 13 kicks in this weekend. Analysts are predicting a meteoric rise—$0.25 by presale’s end, $1 shortly after, and a mind-bending $15 post-mainnet launch. If you’re looking for the best coins to join for short term, $TICS might just be the golden ticket. Stellar (XLM): Ready for Liftoff at $0.90 Stellar is no stranger to the limelight, and for good reason. This blockchain project has been making waves in financial circles, providing fast and affordable cross-border payments. Stellar’s mission? To connect people and financial institutions seamlessly, especially in regions where traditional banking falls short. Now, with two bullish patterns lighting up its charts, analysts are eyeing $0.90 as the next big target. Let’s paint a picture: In the past month, XLM saw a 300% price surge, outperforming many top-tier cryptos. Sure, it cooled off with a 3% dip last week, but that’s not unusual after such a meteoric rise. What’s interesting is how traders are treating the dip as a buying opportunity, with volumes spiking. These signals suggest Stellar’s bulls are far from done. Technical indicators are backing the hype, too. A symmetrical triangle pattern suggests consolidation, while a falling wedge on the RSI points to a potential breakout. If XLM can push past its $0.56 resistance level, it’s off to the races. The target? $0.90—and possibly higher if market momentum aligns. For short-term traders, Stellar’s blend of strong fundamentals and promising technicals makes it a no-brainer. But even long-term holders can smile; Stellar’s role in financial inclusion keeps it relevant. Whether you’re in Buenos Aires or Bogotá, Stellar’s fast, cost-effective remittance capabilities resonate with folks tired of paying exorbitant fees to send money home. Monero (XMR): Privacy First, Always In a world where every click, swipe, and purchase is tracked, Monero is like that friend who says, “Relax, I’ve got your back.” Known as the ultimate privacy coin, Monero enables completely anonymous transactions. For anyone worried about nosy governments, creepy corporations, or plain-old hackers, XMR is the go-to. But Monero isn’t just a tinfoil hat for crypto enthusiasts. It’s practical, too. Think about e-commerce platforms that cater to a global audience. By accepting Monero, they offer customers a level of privacy no credit card or bank transfer ever could. For freelancers in countries with restrictive banking systems, Monero provides financial freedom and security. Monero’s resilience is worth a shout-out. Despite facing regulatory heat—sometimes praised, sometimes vilified—it remains a top pick for privacy-focused investors. Its development community is no slouch either, rolling out regular updates to keep Monero ahead of the curve. Whether you’re hodling or using it for everyday transactions, XMR is a solid choice for anyone prioritising discretion. Now, is it the best coin to join for short-term gains? Maybe not for quick flips. But its steady growth and loyal community make it a strong contender for those playing the long game. After all, in a world obsessed with data collection, privacy is priceless. Conclusion: The Clock’s Ticking—Make Your Move So, there you have it. Qubetics is making headlines with real-world asset tokenisation and a presale that’s smashing records. Stellar is flirting with $0.90, and Monero continues to champion privacy in a digital world. Whether you’re chasing short-term gains or long-term growth, these three projects are worth your attention. Here’s the deal: If you’re serious about making moves, don’t wait too long. The Qubetics presale is a ticking clock, with prices set to rise by 10% this weekend. Stellar’s breakout could happen at any moment, and Monero? It’s the steady rock every diversified portfolio needs. So, what’s it going to be? Dive in, grab some $TICS, and ride the wave—or watch from the sidelines as others cash in. The choice is yours. Don’t let FOMO be the story of your crypto journey.

MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor made a controversial suggestion that the US should sell its gold reserves to build the nation’s reserve. Exchange Gold For Bitcoin Saylor once again brought an eccentric proposal that would surely earn a lot of criticism, urging the US government to swap its gold reserve for Bitcoin. The MicroStrategy executive, known as a staunch advocate of Bitcoin, told the US to rethink its economic strategy and shift towards the firstborn cryptocurrency. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Saylor made a bold recommendation that the country’s leadership should dispose of all its gold reserves so the government can buy more Bitcoin. “Dump your gold, sell all the US gold, and buy Bitcoin because you can buy 5 million Bitcoin for the cost of the gold,” he remarked. Don’t Buy More Gold Saylor dissuaded the US government from purchasing more gold for its national reserve. The Bitcoin supporter has previously noted that gold is an ineffective store of value, saying that gold is “antiquated” and has many vulnerabilities. The United States should buy #Bitcoin and sell Gold. pic.twitter.com/HD69iy1EAO — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 7, 2024 For instance, he explained that moving a significant volume of gold would have logistics challenges which is, according to him, the opposite of Bitcoin which is highly portable and secure. Saylor said that trading gold for Bitcoin would lift the country’s assets to $100 trillion, adding that it is also a strategy to improve the nation’s economic dominance. “You’ll demonetize the entire gold asset class and our enemies hold gold in their banks, and so their asset(s) would go to zero, while our asset(s) go to trillion dollars,” he explained. Data showed that the US is among the countries with the largest gold reserves, which is estimated to comprise 72% of the country’s financial reserves. According to TradingEconomics, the US government has 8,133 tons of gold and commanded international commodity trading. Bitcoin Could Replace Gold Analysts have previously predicted that gold might be replaced by Bitcoin as the premier store of value by the end of the decade. Bernstein Research explained that Bitcoin is a superior alternative to gold because it possesses a technological edge and growing adoption. Earlier, Saylor suggested that Bitcoin would surpass gold in market capitalization, saying that the crypto’s market capitalization would reach $280 trillion as compared to the gold market capitalization of $45 trillion. US President-elect Donald Trump is keen on establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve to make cryptocurrency the dominant national asset and propel the US as the most successful nation in cryptocurrency.

Here’s What Analysts Say,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-finally-set-for-a-new-all-time-high-heres-what-analysts-say/,"Ethereum (ETH) continues to hover around the critical $4,000 resistance level, a price point many believe could determine the cryptocurrency’s next major move. However, a strong weekly close has sparked optimism among analysts, suggesting that ETH could be on track to reach a new all-time high (ATH) soon. Ethereum Heading To New ATH? Experts Weigh In While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP have experienced explosive growth this year, ETH’s price momentum has been relatively subdued. According to CoinGecko, Ethereum has recorded gains of 62% over the past year, falling short compared to other trending digital assets. Related Reading: Analyst Confirms Ethereum Golden Cross As ETH Surges Past $4,000 – Is Altseason In Sight? However, ETH’s performance relative to other cryptocurrencies has not deterred ETH bulls from aiming for new ATHs for the cryptocurrency. For instance, seasoned crypto analyst Pentoshi recently took to X to explain the significance of ETH’s “structural changes” and the consistently large inflows attracted by spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Pentoshi noted that Ethereum has not only recorded a higher high on the weekly chart, but also had its highest weekly close of the year. The analyst added that, given its current price of slightly below $4,000, there is not much resistance to ATH, which “should act as a magnet” for further gains. Another crypto analyst, @CryptoPoseidonn highlighted that ETH is set to break out of its “4-year, 1,460-day range to the upside.” In a chart, the analyst marked out the different Fibonacci extension levels to identify potential price targets for ETH. According to the chart, ETH can rise to $6,000 at the 1.272 extension level, $7,400 at the 1.618 extension level, and $11,400 at the 2.618 extension level. ETH can rise “much higher, far beyond your worst nightmares,” the analyst added. In a shorter time frame, Satoshi Flipper, another well-known analyst, emphasized that ETH attempts to break through an ascending channel in the 4-hour chart. He suggested that the current price, sitting on diagonal channel support, might present a “nice entry” point, predicting that the next impulsive move could take ETH to $4,400. ETH Bulls Cautiously Optimistic Although there is high anticipation for a new ETH ATH, some experts opine that there may still be a few hurdles before the digital asset records a new ATH price. For instance, ETH crossing the $4,000 level may lead to increased risks of profit-taking, potentially resulting in a short-term correction. Related Reading: Ethereum Risk-Reward Ratio Is Now Attractive, Brokerage Firm Explains However, Ethereum’s fundamentals remain robust, adding to its bullish outlook. For instance, ETH active addresses and large value transactions have shown an uptick, reflecting increased on-chain activity during the recent rally. Additionally, some analysts believe ETH could follow a trajectory similar to Bitcoin’s 2021 bull run, with the potential to reach $10,000. ETH trades at $3,847 at press time, down 3.9% in the past 24 hours.

Trump’s Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tesla on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tesla by entering its contract address – 8T1qq1DxSqWqoR8J9hi3ULGCCoMJdqQBev4WAvJg9awR – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMTESLA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-10 02:43:00
