This surge is not merely a speculative dream; it is grounded in a confluence of market dynamics, technological advancements, and growing institutional interest. Meanwhile, RCO Finance (RCOF) , an emerging altcoin, is capturing attention with its ambitious trajectory from $0.1 to an astonishing $3 within the same timeframe. Built on the Ethereum ecosystem, investors believe its potential surge will be within the same timeframe. Ethereum Price Journey to $10,000: Institutional Backing and National Reserve Speculation The Recent Ethereum price performance has positioned it as a top contender for institutional investors, sparking discussions of its price reaching $10,000. Currently oscillating at around $3,087, Ethereum’s market capitalization has surpassed $410 billion, with trading volumes increasing by 34% to $34 billion daily. Bullish sentiment is evident as Ethereum futures open interest hit $33 billion, signaling strong confidence among traders. The driving force behind this optimism is Ethereum’s potential inclusion in the United States’ national digital asset reserves, a development that could dramatically increase demand. World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance project with ties to Donald Trump, has accelerated its accumulation of Ethereum, amassing 74,228 ETH, nearly half acquired in just three days. This institutional interest underscores Ethereum’s growing recognition as a valuable asset. With technical patterns indicating an impending rally and institutional demand soaring, the Ethereum price seems poised for explosive growth. Analysts widely expect it to challenge $10,000 within months. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Altcoin on Whale’s Radar Set to benefit from the potential Ethereum price surge, RCO Finance (RCOF) uses Ethereum’s network to build a unique, AI-integrated DeFi project. This innovation improves user engagement and boosts trading returns, making RCOF an attractive investment option for all investors.. At the core of RCO Finance’s appeal is its AI Robo Advisor, designed to simplify investing for everyone. Imagine a new trader unsure where to begin, this tool analyzes market trends, historical data, and live price movements from sources like Reuters to create personalized strategies tailored to individual goals.

Even those with little market experience can achieve efficient results, making RCOF a game-changer in DeFi, bridging the gap between innovation and user accessibility. Moreover, RCO Finance addresses a critical challenge in cryptocurrency trading: the need for diversification. By offering access to over 120,000 asset classes, including traditional stocks, bonds, ETFs , and tokenized real-world assets like real estate, RCOF empowers investors to build well-rounded portfolios. Enhancing its appeal, RCO Finance introduces an Automated Market Making (AMM) system powered by ML algorithms, ensuring a fast and profitable trading experience. Additionally, RCOF provides leverage options of up to 1000x, allowing traders to significantly amplify their potential returns, even with modest initial investments. With its recent beta launch , RCO Finance has introduced a sleek, cutting-edge interface that’s already turning heads, drawing over 10,000 users in record time. While the current features are impressive, the buzz is building around the upcoming alpha phase, now in testing, which promises game-changing upgrades. Security and user privacy are paramount in today’s crypto landscape, and RCO Finance excels in this area with its no-KYC policy. Regular audits by SolidProof further bolster user confidence in the platform’s reliability and integrity. The Lucrative RCO Finance (RCOF) Presale As RCO Finance prepares for the alpha launch of the platform, the presale is significantly gaining traction. The RCOF token presale has raised over $12 million, with its Stage 5 public presale picking pace.

Moreover, analysts project the potential surge of the platform to over $3 translating to over 25000% in ROI from the current price. Investing now allows you to benefit from discounted prices and grants access to exclusive features such as staking opportunities that yield attractive returns and quarterly dividends based on holdings. Moreover, holders of the RCOF token have access to governing rights, which play an important role in key decision-making.

With Bitcoin holding strong above $100,000 and a surge of interest in decentralized solutions, the opportunities for profit are abundant. This article highlights the best cryptos to buy now, focusing on projects that combine innovation, scalability, and real-world utility to position themselves as leaders in the next wave of blockchain growth. 1. Web3Bay (3BAY) Web3Bay (3BAY) is transforming the online shopping experience with its innovative decentralized platform. Built on a secure Layer-1 blockchain, Web3Bay empowers users with full control over their transactions and data, offering a refreshing alternative to traditional e-commerce giants. By utilizing smart contracts and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), Web3Bay ensures secure and transparent transactions while minimizing the risk of data breaches. This creates a trustworthy and efficient marketplace where buyers and sellers can connect directly, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing costs. But Web3Bay’s appeal goes beyond just security and efficiency. Its native token, 3BAY, offers a range of benefits for users, including a 5% discount on purchases, staking rewards, and voting rights on key platform decisions. This fosters a strong community and incentivizes user engagement, creating a thriving ecosystem around the Web3Bay platform. The ongoing presale of 3BAY has already demonstrated strong investor confidence, raising over $950,000 across four stages. With over 250 million tokens sold and a projected launch price of $0.1959, early investors are looking at a potential 6,430% return on investment. This impressive performance underscores the demand for decentralized e-commerce solutions and positions Web3Bay as a leading contender in the Web3 space. 2. TRUMP ($TRUMP) The recent launch of the $TRUMP meme coin has generated significant attention, highlighting the influence of public figures and market sentiment on the crypto world. After an initial surge that saw the coin’s price peak at $75, $TRUMP has stabilized around $38.64, reflecting the inherent volatility of meme coins. While the long-term trajectory of $TRUMP remains uncertain, some analysts predict a potential rise to $132.11 by February 2025, fueled by ongoing developments and political influences. However, investors should approach meme coins with caution, recognizing their speculative nature and the potential for significant price fluctuations. 3. Raydium (RAY) Raydium is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM) built on the Solana blockchain, known for its high speed and low fees. As of January 2025, RAY is trading at $7.53. Raydium’s recent introduction of perpetual futures trading has significantly expanded its offerings and attracted a surge in trading volume. With over 70 trading pairs and up to 40x leverage, Raydium is becoming a key player in the DeFi space, providing users with advanced trading tools and opportunities. 4. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that plays a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem. By enabling smart contracts to securely interact with real-world data, Chainlink provides a vital link between the blockchain and the physical world. Currently priced at $24.64, LINK has experienced a slight decline from its previous close. However, Chainlink continues to expand its ecosystem and form strategic partnerships, strengthening its position as a foundational component of the blockchain infrastructure. As the demand for reliable and tamper-proof data integration grows, Chainlink’s importance will only increase, making it a compelling long-term investment. Investing in the Future of Crypto February 2025 presents a unique opportunity for crypto investors to capitalize on the growing momentum in the market. Whether you’re seeking the stability of established platforms like Chainlink or the explosive potential of emerging projects like Web3Bay, there are ample opportunities to diversify your portfolio and potentially achieve significant returns. By focusing on projects with robust ecosystems, proven utility, and forward-looking roadmaps, you can align your investments with the evolving dynamics of the blockchain world and position yourself for success in the exciting future of crypto.

Analyst Weighs In,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoins-next-move-a-final-leg-up-or-just-the-beginning-analyst-weighs-in/,"Bitcoin is showing signs of a gradual recovery following its earlier pullback. After dipping below the $100,000 mark, the cryptocurrency has regained ground, currently trading above $102,000. This represents a 6.3% increase over the past two weeks. Amid this upward trajectory, a CryptoQuant analyst has assessed the patterns of Bitcoin’s realized capitalization and UTXO age bands for clues about what might come next. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hovers Above $104K—Analyst Reveals What’s Next Based on Funding Rates What the Data Suggests About Bitcoin’s Future IT Tech, a contributor to the CryptoQuant QuickTake Platform, recently shared insights on Bitcoin’s current cycle behavior. According to the analysis, the proportion of younger UTXOs—coins that have moved recently—has begun to rise. Historically, high levels of younger UTXOs have coincided with cycle tops, as seen during the peaks of 2013, 2017, and 2021. Although the current cycle has not yet reached these extreme levels, the increase in younger UTXOs suggests that newer market entrants are becoming more active. According to IT Tech, based on historical trends, a high proportion of young UTXOs typically signals increased speculation, which can lead to heightened volatility and a potential market top. If this trend continues, Bitcoin could see another leg up before significant distribution takes place. Conversely, if long-term holders maintain their positions, the current rally may still have room to grow. IT Tech emphasized that while current indicators point to increased market activity, the younger UTXO levels remain below historical peaks. Bitcoin’s Next Move: Are We Approaching a Cycle Top or Just Gaining Momentum? “Suggests that we are entering a phase of increased market activity, but the proportion of young UTXOs is not yet at the historical peak levels.” – By @IT_Tech_PL Link 👇https://t.co/fVO3Kuavlw pic.twitter.com/pxegbBrpBX — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 28, 2025 This provides room for Bitcoin to continue its upward trajectory, but market participants should remain vigilant. IT Tech concluded by noting: The chart suggests that we are entering a phase of increased market activity, but the proportion of young UTXOs is not yet at the historical peak levels. This could mean that Bitcoin still has room for further upside, but traders should closely monitor the ratio of young coins to long-term holdings for potential warning signs of a top. Bitcoin Market Performance At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at a price of $102,768 marking a 1.3% increase in the past day. This slight surge in price has boosted BTC’s market cap back above $2 trillion—a notable surge from $1.96 trillion seen on Monday. Interestingly, despite this increase, Bitcoin’s daily trading volume has seen an opposite trend currently sitting at a valuation of $50.2 billion, a notable decrease from over $100 billion seen last week.

According to the company announcement shared with Cryptonews , the campaign will feature a variety of learning modules, engaging challenges, and interactive experiences. A Deep Dive Into the Soneium Ecosystem Soneium Conquest invites creators, developers, and blockchain enthusiasts to explore the Soneium ecosystem and discover the potential of Web3 . The campaign, hosted on the Galxe platform, will focus on four key areas: creativity, connection, joy, and immersion. We’re thrilled to announce our latest integration with @soneium !

The second week will focus on how Soneium works with its community and boosts communication and collaborations within the digital realm. Weeks three and four will delve into the world of blockchain gaming , showcasing how Soneium leverages entertainment and fosters user engagement. Soneium Aims to Empower Creativity and Openness Soneium, an Ethereum Layer-2 developed by Sony BSL, is a platform designed to empower creativity and foster a more open and inclusive internet. On Jan. 14, Sony launched the mainnet for Soneium to streamline blockchain interactions and provide a more user-friendly Web3 experience. Built on the OP Stack from the Optimism Foundation, the platform incorporates Sony’s non-fungible token (NFT ) -based Fan Marketing Platform and Soneium Spark, which support creators, developers, and fans. Soneium also leverages partnerships with Sony Pictures, Sony Music, and Sony Music Publishing. These collaborations utilize NFTs to grant fans access to exclusive content and foster deeper engagement with their favorite artists and entertainment. Mixed Reactions and Clarification on Blacklisting The mainnet launch has received a mixed response from the community. While some users praised the platform’s potential, others expressed concerns regarding the “blacklisting” of certain contract addresses.

These claims stem from Soneium’s policy of restricting addresses suspected of intellectual property (IP) infringement, which is outlined in their official documentation. . @soneium rugged users >$100k in ETH on launch day I've never seen anything like it Want to be a permissioned chain? fine.

The company confirmed that users and developers have the right to appeal these decisions and that proactive communication is ongoing. According to Soneium, no funds were frozen, and the blacklist only restricted public RPC interaction with the flagged contracts.

According to blockchain “de-anonymizing” platform Arkham , the UK government holds about $6,270,000,000 worth of Bitcoin, most of it from when it seized coins belonging to convicted money launderer Jian Wen. Prosecutors say Wen converted Bitcoin into cash and property, though her lawyers allege that someone else was the brains behind the operation. Now, with holes in the UK’s fiscal situation, the Daily Mail reports that Rachel Reeves, the UK’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, has been instructed by insiders to consult with experts on when to sell the BTC to achieve the best deal for the British taxpayer. Says Chris Etherington, a partner at accounting firm RSM, “There is a strong case for selling the Bitcoin right away. The currency is too volatile, too speculative. Rachel Reeves will be looking at it given the political pressure she is under as she waits for the Office For Budget Responsibility forecasts. Germany cashed in last year. Let’s face it – it is a get out of jail free card for her.” Says lawyer Quentin Hunt, “It [forfeited crypto-currency] gets paid back into the public purse to the Consolidated Fund, which is where all the monies go to which are effectively seized. That money is managed by the Treasury – so it effectively goes back into the public purse.” Last year, the German government sold off 50,000 of its BTC under similar circumstances.

Over the years, blockchain technology has evolved, and with it, the crypto market has grown into a diverse ecosystem of tokens, projects, and use cases. From smart contracts to decentralized finance (DeFi), crypto projects now serve as alternative investment instruments, offering both innovation and significant returns. For investors seeking to escape the volatility of traditional stocks or diversify their portfolios, crypto has proven to be an attractive option. It’s not just about speculative trading anymore; it’s about tapping into the future of digital economies and decentralized systems. Among the growing pool of projects, some names have established themselves as cornerstones in the industry. In this article, let’s explore three standout crypto projects: Qubetics , Hedera, and Ethereum. Each has carved its niche and continues to shape the investment landscape. From disruptive presales to well-established giants, these projects cater to different appetites and investment strategies. Qubetics: The Best Crypto Presale to Buy for 2025 Qubetics is revolutionizing the crypto market as the world’s first Web3 aggregator , designed to simplify and enhance access to decentralized applications (DApps), DeFi services, and blockchain networks. By focusing on interoperability, Qubetics enables seamless communication across multiple blockchains, removing the friction that typically bogs down the Web3 experience. Imagine a world where businesses, professionals, and individuals can interact with different blockchains as easily as opening apps on a smartphone. That’s what Qubetics is aiming for. For example, a logistics company operating in South America could use Qubetics to track shipments on a Hedera-based supply chain network while simultaneously processing payments on an Ethereum-based DeFi app. Such interoperability isn’t just a fancy buzzword; it’s the foundation for real-world efficiency and innovation. Now, let’s dive into the numbers that are making waves. As of January 28, 2025, Qubetics is in its 19th presale stage, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.0606. Over 449 million tokens have already been sold, raising an impressive $11.2 million from more than 16,900 token holders. Analysts predict the $TICS token could reach $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering early investors a potential return of 312.18%. Looking further ahead, predictions for $TICS range from $1 to $15 post-mainnet launch, translating into returns as high as 24,630.58% for early adopters. Such numbers highlight why Qubetics is considered the best crypto presale to buy for 2025. Its emphasis on interoperability, coupled with its groundbreaking Web3 aggregation capabilities, positions it as a must-watch project. Whether you’re a business streamlining operations or an individual exploring blockchain use cases, Qubetics is redefining what’s possible. Hedera: The Enterprise Blockchain Solution Hedera Hashgraph has always stood out for its enterprise-grade solutions and eco-friendly design. Leveraging its unique Hashgraph consensus algorithm, Hedera offers a fast, secure, and energy-efficient alternative to traditional blockchains. With transaction speeds exceeding 10,000 TPS (transactions per second), Hedera has attracted enterprises seeking scalability without compromising on security. In recent developments, Hedera integrated with MetaMask via HIP-583, enhancing accessibility to its DApps. This move opens the door for MetaMask users to explore Hedera’s ecosystem seamlessly. Additionally, Hedera’s stablecoin remittance pilot with Shinhan Bank and SCB TechX has demonstrated the network’s capability in cross-border transactions, settling payments in real-time across multiple fiat currencies like the Thai Baht and South Korean Won. Hedera’s market position is solidified by its governing council, which includes industry giants such as Google, IBM, and Boeing. These partnerships bring credibility to the project and underscore its commitment to building a sustainable, decentralized future. For investors, Hedera’s $0.32 price point as of January 28, 2025, offers a gateway into a high-performance network that’s reshaping industries ranging from finance to healthcare. Known for its transparency and low environmental impact, Hedera remains a go-to project for businesses and developers looking for reliable blockchain solutions. Its success proves that crypto isn’t just about speculation; it’s about solving real-world problems. Ethereum: The Pioneer of Smart Contracts Ethereum needs no introduction. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum has set the standard for what a blockchain network can achieve. Its introduction of smart contracts laid the foundation for decentralized applications, fueling the rise of DeFi, NFTs, and countless innovations. While Ethereum’s early days were marked by scalability challenges, the network’s transition to Ethereum 2.0 has significantly improved its performance. The move to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) has reduced energy consumption by over 99%, making it more environmentally friendly and future-proof. With an active developer community and ongoing upgrades, Ethereum continues to be the backbone of the blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum is trading at $3,205.44, reflecting its robust market position. Investors often see Ethereum as the “blue chip” of crypto, a stable and reliable asset in a volatile market. Its versatility—from hosting DeFi protocols to powering metaverse projects—has made Ethereum a favorite among developers and institutions alike. Ethereum’s dominance in the blockchain space is a testament to its innovative spirit and adaptability. While newer projects like Qubetics and Hedera offer niche solutions, Ethereum remains the generalist that continues to expand the boundaries of what’s possible in crypto. Conclusion: Why Qubetics Stands Out Qubetics, Hedera, and Ethereum each offer unique value propositions, making them standout players in the crypto world. However, for those looking to get in early on a project with groundbreaking potential, Qubetics is the best crypto presale to buy for 2025 . With its focus on interoperability, Web3 aggregation, and jaw-dropping analyst predictions, $TICS is setting itself apart as a game-changer. Don’t miss out on what could be one of the most lucrative opportunities in the crypto space. The presale is already generating significant buzz, and every stage brings it closer to reshaping how blockchains work together.

Table of Contents Analysts split between $500 and $50 for Solana Toncoin’s potential to hit $20 1Fuel positioned for growth Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON) are known for their high growth potential, with analysts predicting substantial increases. However, traders are preferring a new altcoin, 1Fuel (OFT), over these already popular cryptocurrencies. 1Fuel is also set to achieve massive growth this year, and this growth is expected to be especially better because it’s still in the presale stage. Analysts split between $500 and $50 for Solana Solana has had ups and downs lately, although the token increased by 21.11% in the past month. Analysts have both bearish and bullish forecasts for SOL, and there’s no telling which one is more likely. The bullish forecasts expect SOL to hit the $500 mark, supported by the Solana ecosystem growth. If this happens, SOL might remain a leading crypto investment for this year. On the other hand, critics suggest concerns over market volatility and competition from other altcoins can drive SOL down to $50. Toncoin’s potential to hit $20 Toncoin is currently valued at $4.79, with an 8.23% decline over the past week. Most analysts suggest it’s unlikely for TON to leap to $20, as this would be an increase of over 250% from its current price. However, they are optimistic that it will continue to surge owing to its ecosystem, which is elevating among other top Layer-1 blockchains.

It has already sold over 159 million tokens, a significant milestone that has boosted investor confidence. 1Fuel is growing even further because of its DEX wallet, offering an edge over MetaMask and Trust Wallet. Traders are picking 1Fuel over tokens like Solana and Toncoin, relying on its robust DeFi ecosystem to drive further growth after its public listing in Q2 2025. 1Fuel will support diverse financial tools in its DEX wallet, which will make it easy for users to manage their assets. These include a P2P exchange, crypto debit and credit cards, and AI tools. What’s more, users can transact across blockchains with the cross-chain swap, which offers another edge over established platforms like MetaMask. To keep user information safe and private, the 1Fuel DEX wallet will feature an inbuilt privacy mixer, disposable wallets, and more. These features make 1Fuel a potentially leading crypto in 2025.

The ministry will draft an amendment to the Enforcement Decree of the Prosecutors’ Office Act. And the ministry’s move could also “adjust the number of prosecutors” assigned to the unit. This, it reportedly says, will allow the prosecution to “respond to virtual asset crime efficiently and systematically.” The unit, as its name suggests, comprises more than just prosecutors. Its members also belong to regulatory bodies like the Financial Supervisory Service and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). Other government bodies are also involved, including the National Tax Service, the Korea Customs Service, and the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation.

In a memo reportedly sent on Jan. 24, the Navy informed personnel that the generative AI model must not be used “in any capacity,” citing serious security and ethical risks tied to its Chinese origins. The directive applies to both work-related and personal use, according to a Jan. 28 report by CNBC. This strict decision comes as DeepSeek’s AI technology crashes global financial markets and triggers debate about the future of AI and US dominance in it. But the Navy’s warning, which was distributed to all operational personnel, actually came days before the markets went ballistic over DeepSeek’s latest model, R1, which rivals tech from US companies like OpenAI. Navy sees security risks The memo, distributed under the Operational Navy (OpNav) system, left no room for ambiguity. CNBC claims it read: “We would like to bring to your attention a critical update regarding a new AI model called DeepSeek. It is imperative that all personnel refrain from downloading, installing, or using DeepSeek’s AI in any capacity. This includes work-related tasks and personal use.” The message was signed off by the Naval Air Warfare Center Division Cyber Workforce Manager, showing the high-level concerns over DeepSeek. Unsurprisingly, the concern comes mainly from DeepSeek’s status as an open-source model, meaning it is accessible to developers worldwide, including those operating in high-risk environments. America thinks that’s a problem, likely because they are not familiar with open-source at all. DeepSeek claims the R1 was built in just two months with a modest $6 million budget. The app has since skyrocketed to the top of Apple’s App Store, overtaking OpenAI’s ChatGPT in popularity. But according to the report, the Pentagon has gotten more and more wary of the AI’s rapid adoption, particularly given its origins in a country under heavy US tech sanctions. The ban also comes as DeepSeek temporarily restricted user registrations earlier this week, citing “large-scale malicious attacks” on its systems. Operations resumed shortly afterward, but the incident heightened concerns over the security vulnerabilities of open-source. Trump calls DeepSeek a ‘wake-up call’ “DeepSeek is a wake-up call,” President Donald Trump, who took office just last week, declared during a press briefing on Jan. 27. “America’s tech companies need to step up. This is not the time to get comfortable.” David Sacks, a venture capitalist and Trump’s newly appointed AI and crypto czar, also commented on the situation, saying, “DeepSeek R1 shows just how competitive the AI race has become. I’m confident in the US, but we cannot afford complacency.” The Trump administration’s first major AI deal was last week’s announcement of Stargate, a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. The project will funnel over $500 billion into AI infrastructure in a mission to solidify America’s AI dominance. DeepSeek has done a lot of damage though. On Monday, Nvidia suffered its worst trading day since March 2020, with shares plummeting by 16.9%. Broadcom followed closely, with its stock falling 17%. Together, these two giants lost $800 billion in market value, making the worst kind of history. Micron Technology and Arm Holdings dropped over 11% and 10%, respectively, while AMD and Broadcom saw losses of 6% and 17%. Even power infrastructure companies tied to AI development, like Constellation Energy and Vistra, faced massive declines of up to 28%. Nvidia did come out and acknowledge DeepSeek’s innovation that very same day. In a statement to CNBC, the chipmaker said, “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. Their work shows how new models can be created using widely available models and export-compliant compute.” Meanwhile, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has reportedly launched four “war rooms” within its generative AI department to address the competitive threat that is DeepSeek. These teams are gonna be developing strategies to defeat their newfound Chinese rival, according to a Jan. 27 report by The Information.

This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Fuks Robots can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Robots could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Robots launched with over $40,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Robots on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Robots by entering its contract address (CA) – 9yuANCwHs443YpCDnUr2GfSkDSTxUweQL1m2vMaYnTT5 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-28 23:40:00

Arctic Pablo is Your Opportunity Among the Top New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns,https://thecoinrise.com/skip-goatseus-maximus-arctic-pablo-is-your-opportunity-among-the-top-new-meme-coins-for-exponential-returns/,"Meme coins have overtaken the crypto world, turning everyday investors into overnight millionaires. From Dogecoin’s initial days to Shiba Inu’s rise, the frenzy around meme coins is undeniable. But what about the missed chances? Remember when Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) first launched? Early adopters saw meteoric returns. If you’re feeling the FOMO, it’s not too late to get in on the next big thing. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) has arrived to rewrite the script. Its unique presale structure and explosive ROI potential make it the perfect opportunity for anyone seeking the top new meme coins for exponential returns. Arctic Pablo: The New Frontier in Meme Coins In the frigid, mythical expanse of the Arctic, a daring adventurer named Pablo embarks on an extraordinary journey. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) captures the magic of this story, combining it with an exciting new presale model that has the crypto world buzzing. Unlike traditional meme coins, Arctic Pablo isn’t just a token—it’s a movement. Each phase of its presale represents a new location on Pablo’s epic journey, creating urgency and excitement. Currently in Glacier Grove, the seventh location of the presale, Arctic Pablo Coin is priced at just $0.000043. With over $550,000 already raised and a final presale price of $0.0008, early investors can secure incredible returns. Upon its listing price of $0.008, APC promises an ROI of 18,546%. Let’s break that down. Investing $500 now gives you 11,627,835 APC. At launch, that investment would be worth a staggering $93,022.68. If that doesn’t grab your attention, nothing will. Arctic Pablo’s deflationary tokenomics add even more value. With weekly token burns for unsold coins, the total supply is continually reduced, creating scarcity and boosting demand. Investors can also participate in staking, earning an eye-popping 66% APY. This staking program locks tokens for two months post-launch, rewarding long-term holders while fueling the ecosystem’s growth. Arctic Pablo isn’t just a coin; it’s a story you don’t want to miss. It is one of the Top New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns . The Rise and Missed Opportunity of Goatseus Maximus Goatseus Maximus entered the meme coin scene with a bang, offering a mix of humor, community-driven appeal, and massive potential. During its early days, GOAT’s price was less than a fraction of a cent, but as word spread, its value skyrocketed. Investors who bought in during the initial phase saw gains they could’ve only dreamed of. From its presale days to its peak, Goatseus Maximus minted millionaires. However, not everyone was so lucky. Despite its success, GOAT’s appeal as a fresh opportunity has waned. With a market cap near $200 million and over 999 million coins in circulation, the once underdog has cemented its position, leaving little room for exponential growth. It’s no longer the low-entry giant it once was, and for those seeking the next breakout star, it’s time to look elsewhere. This is where Arctic Pablo Coin comes into play. While Goatseus Maximus might have been the meme coin of yesterday, Arctic Pablo is shaping up to be the meme coin of tomorrow. If you missed GOAT, Arctic Pablo offers a fresh chance to capitalize on an icy-hot opportunity. Conclusion: Your Chance to Ride the Arctic Wave Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin is the ultimate opportunity among the top new meme coins for exponential returns. Its presale structure, deflationary tokenomics, and staking rewards make it a once-in-a-lifetime chance to enter the crypto market at the ground level. The story of Pablo’s journey and the coin’s explosive ROI potential set Arctic Pablo apart from anything else in the meme coin universe. Don’t let this chance slip away. With weekly price increases and token burns, the window to secure Arctic Pablo at its lowest price is closing fast. Join the presale now and become part of the legend. This isn’t just an investment; it’s an adventure.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With Bitcoin and Cardano’s momentum waning, an expert suggests including Panshibi in portfolios. Table of Contents More chops for the Bitcoin price Cardano shows big sell-offs Panshibi: The new frontier in memecoins Conclusion In 2024, Bitcoin (BTC) experienced significant growth. However, its price is currently consolidating. Additionally, recent news regarding Cardano (ADA) indicates a bearish outlook. In contrast, Panshibi (SHIBI) is getting attention as a promising option. A prominent expert suggests that the new altcoin could experience a massive rally following its launch, with a target of 100x gains. More chops for the Bitcoin price The Bitcoin price is currently trading sideways. An analyst shared that new capital has been going to BTC these past weeks, even though its price hasn’t really moved. This isn’t very surprising as it takes millions of dollars actually to move the Bitcoin price in any direction. Because of this, experts believe that BTC will continue to chop. Cardano shows big sell-offs According to recent data, Cardano whales have sold over 180 million ADA tokens. ADA is currently trading at $0.91, with a dip of over 8% in the past week. This drop in price is mainly because of the recent sell-offs. Experts believe Cardano whales are selling because of ADA’s slow movements, with the crypto failing to go back above $1 after the post-elections rally. This shows that Cardano is losing strength and maybe even interest from the market. As such, experts believe that ADA’s price will continue to fall or remain in its current range for the coming weeks.

As a new memecoin, Panshibi has massive potential ahead, with its launch coming at a time when memecoins are still dominating the market. Panshibi also brings a new vision to the market, combining three huge communities – Asia, pandas, and memecoins. Panshibi isn’t just a regular memecoin. This project comes with utility and long-term potential. Its tokenomics show that 60% of the total SHIBI supply will be allocated to the presale and another 15% for staking and community rewards. The rest will be set aside for marketing and CEX listings. As for the roadmap, Panshibi plans to grow its community by offering lucrative staking rewards, access to NFTs, and participating in charities. All of these are set to boost Panshibi’s visibility and allure to the general population. Conclusion SHIBI is currently in Stage 1 of its presale, offering tokens at $0.002. Joining in Stage 1 could bring 1,200% presale gains, as SHIBI is set to launch at $0.026. However, these gains could be short compared to what SHIBI might bring after it launches. Since SHIBI has potential and is focused on growth, experts see its price rising by 100x. They also believe that SHIBI will continue its run after that, potentially becoming a major player in the crypto space. For more information on Panshibi, visit their website , Telegram , or Twitter .

BTC open interest declined by 17,225 BTC, the largest daily decline. Analysts at K33 Research estimate that the decline in OI was driven by active market participants who reduced their exposure by 14,875 BTC tokens. Data shows that January contracts expiring on Friday could push OI lower. Though premiums may have returned to slightly positive territory, CME activity is a clear indicator of bearish sentiment among derivatives traders and favors caution this week. Bitcoin’s Monday decline could be considered noise on the longer timeframe, however the aggressive derisking on CME fuels a narrative of caution among traders as BTC premium slipped into the negative territory for the first time.

Bitfinex analysts identified the 30-day rolling Pearson correlation between Bitcoin, the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ as 0.7. The numbers are coincidental but likely an indicator of traders treating BTC as a risk-on asset, moving in lockstep with traditional equities. Over the course of last week, Bitcoin options implied volatility reduced by 13%. It can be interpreted as traders expecting no major movements in BTC price this week. Bitcoin traders keep their eyes peeled for the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision this week. Considering the impact of the previous FOMC meeting, the sentiment has shifted towards derisking ahead of the announcement, traders can gear for a decline in BTC price prior to the announcement. Bitcoin price has noted heightened volatility within the first 20-30 minutes post U.S. macro releases since the beginning of the bull run in 2024. DeepSeek’s launch impacted NVIDIA negatively, and BTC was not immune to the event. DeepSeek therefore eclipsed the “Trump effect” on Bitcoin, even as traders await updates on the national Bitcoin stockpile and strategic reserve, events in tech and AI continue to jolt BTC and altcoins, alongside equities. Top 5 altcoins to watch during the shifting AI and tech tide Data from SoSoValue, an AI-powered crypto investment platform, shows that the DeFAI and AI agents category has corrected the most in response to DeepSeek’s arrival in the U.S. market. The DeFAI sector’s market cap corrected 28.73% in 24 hours. The top four tokens in the sector suffered double-digit corrections, over 20%. Among DeFAI tokens, Griffain ( GRIFFAIN ), Orbit (GRIFT), Hive AI (BUZZ) and Neur.sh (NEUR) noted steep corrections on Monday; the tokens have started their recovery in the past 24 hours. Top 5 tokens in the DeFAI category on CoinGecko | Source: CoinGecko In the AI agents category, leading projects such as Fartcoin and mainstream AI tokens, ai16z, AIXBT, and AI Rig Complex were corrected in double-digits. The meme coin sector was not immune to DeepSeek’s release and suffered over 8% decline in its market capitalization within a 24 hour timeframe. Pepe ( PEPE ) observed the steepest correction in the top meme coins, down by 11.33% on Monday, offering sidelined buyers an opportunity to buy the dip. Layer 1 tokens suffered the least among other categories, and tokens like Jupiter ( JUP ) and Onyxcoin bucked the trend, emerging as key altcoins to add to a portfolio to tackle similar events in the future. Expert insights on AI market trends, crypto portfolios Jawad Ashraf, CEO of Vanar, a decentralized Layer 1 blockchain focused on RWA adoption, believes crypto’s short history and frequent “regime shifts” offer limited data to train predictive AI models for portfolio management. Commenting on the use of AI in crypto portfolio management, Ashraf told Crypto.news: “Geopolitical wildcards compound the challenge, introducing unexpected market conditions that AI can’t easily anticipate, making human oversight and risk management essential.” Discussing Trump’s executive orders and actions in crypto, Ashraf said: “Despite no major executive actions on crypto in Trump’s first 100 orders, the administration’s openness to digital assets was hinted at when both Trump and Melania dabbled in meme coins—blurring lines between personal ventures and government influence. Combined with a strong “America First” attitude toward tech, this can accelerate a “Wild West” environment if certain tokens receive overt government endorsement or implicit backing.” Ashraf believes U.S. based AI and crypto projects could benefit from a more favorable policy stance on the sector, and foreign initiatives could face headwinds in adoption. Alvin Kan, COO of Bitget Wallets told Crypto.news in an exclusive interview: “The Trump administration is expected to promote AI innovation by reducing regulatory constraints, potentially boosting AI tokens and the broader AI sector. The repeal of Biden’s AI executive order might shift focus from ethical considerations to rapid development, influencing market dynamics. Industry sentiment is mixed, with optimism for growth but concerns about oversight and ethical AI use.” The rivalry between Huawei and NVIDIA is fueling a high-stakes “arms race” in AI hardware — driving down costs and encouraging faster innovation. Meanwhile, new entrants from other major tech giants are racing to release specialized chips, widening the competitive field. On one side, NVIDIA remains the global GPU market leader; on the other, Huawei benefits from strong domestic support within China, potentially giving it a leg up in certain markets. This competitive push should accelerate Gen AI’s expansion across industries, including blockchain applications. However, geopolitical tensions and supply-chain uncertainties — amplified by the U.S.-China tech rivalry — could temper how quickly these benefits reach the broader market. Discussing the Huawei and NVIDIA rivalry, Ashraf cites the example of an “arms race.” According to the Vanar CEO: “The rivalry between Huawei and NVIDIA is fueling a high-stakes “arms race” in AI hardware—driving down costs and encouraging faster innovation…On one side, NVIDIA remains the global GPU market leader; on the other, Huawei benefits from strong domestic support within China, potentially giving it a leg up in certain markets.” The competition between the two giants continues to weigh heavily on Bitcoin and crypto, given the impact of AI-related developments on the sector. Noting the massive correction in the AI agent category amidst their rising relevance this week, Ashraf predicts rapid evolution in architecture and possible integration with LLMs, making the current agent designs obsolete. For traders and investors, Ashraf’s advice is to: “Distinguish between short-term hype and genuine utility: scrutinize the underlying tech, project roadmaps, and real-world partnerships. Portfolio-wise, small, diversified positions can be prudent, while keeping an eye on the sector’s broader evolution toward more advanced AI-driven networks.” Bitget Wallet COO Kan believes that the AI agents sector could continue to expand in the first half of 2025, potentially reaching a market capitalization of $20 to $25 billion. Kan warns traders, “…However, there’s a risk of market correction which could see the cap drop to around $12B if growth was largely speculative. The actual outcome will hinge on broader market trends, regulatory developments, and real-world adoption of AI agents.” Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Conversely, Ethereum (ETH) price faces downward trends, as bearish signals indicate likely short-term stabilization and reduced market strength. BlockDAG (BDAG) , however, is capturing significant interest. Its active partnership with Inter Milan showcases blockchain capabilities worldwide, engaging countless football enthusiasts with its innovative technology. Currently identified as the best crypto to buy, BlockDAG boasts over 170,000 holders, with its presale approaching the $600 million goal, and a price increase of 2380% since launch. XRP Bullish Outlook: Possible Rally Upon Resistance Break The XRP bullish outlook depends on overcoming significant resistance levels and maintaining momentum above crucial support. Trading at $3.17, XRP could consolidate yet holds long-term upward potential. Analysts point to $3.40 as a critical breakout point, with goals at $4.20, $5, and $6.60 achievable if surpassed. Meanwhile, supports at $2.52 and $2.32 are vital for continued upward movement. Despite recent price adjustments, the XRP bullish outlook suggests that surpassing $3.40 could trigger a rally, echoing broader market expectations for additional increases. Ethereum Price Challenges: Insights from Technical Indicators The Ethereum price is challenged by bearish indicators predicting continued downward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 41.6, showing diminishing strength yet above the oversold territory. Further, the Directional Movement Index (DMI) indicates growing selling activity, with the -DI surpassing +DI, although a low Average Directional Index (ADX) of 14.1 signals a weak trend. Critical support lies at $3,158, with a potential decline to $2,927 if broken. While near-term stabilization is probable, Ethereum price needs to break through the $3,334 resistance to hint at a trend shift. BlockDAG Enhances Global Presence with Inter Milan BlockDAG’s collaboration with Inter Milan connects the blockchain to a global audience through the allure of a top football club. Utilizing Inter Milan’s broad international following, BlockDAG showcases its advanced blockchain technology, which is based on the DAG structure for quick, safe, and clear transactions. This approach appeals to sports enthusiasts worldwide, providing an accessible gateway to understanding blockchain technology. This alliance significantly raises BlockDAG’s profile and establishes its credibility as a premier Layer 1 blockchain initiative. The partnership ensures extensive exposure via LED displays at Inter Milan’s stadium during matches, broadcasting the BlockDAG brand to a vast audience of fervent supporters and international spectators. Such enhanced visibility leads to increased interest in BDAG coins, impacting their demand and value. With $185.5 million collected in its presale and over 18.2 billion BDAG coins distributed, the presale is already among the largest in the cryptocurrency sphere, drawing over 170,000 holders. This trend highlights BDAG’s growing influence in the blockchain space. BlockDAG’s unprecedented presale is close to reaching its $600 million goal. At its present rate of $0.0248, BDAG is recognized as one of the best cryptos to buy , providing an affordable entry for those aiming to benefit from its increasing demand. With its limited supply and extensive global reach, BDAG is poised to be a unique opportunity in today’s cryptocurrency market. End Notes The XRP bullish outlook continues to captivate, with crucial resistance levels posing a chance for a substantial rally if overcome. Conversely, Ethereum price faces near-term hurdles, with indicators suggesting limited room for growth. Meanwhile, BlockDAG capitalizes on its international appeal through its collaboration with Inter Milan, introducing blockchain technology to millions of soccer enthusiasts worldwide. This exposure boosts BDAG coin demand and fast-tracks BlockDAG’s presale toward its $600 million mark, now with over 170,000 holders involved. With BDAG currently priced at $0.0248, its emerging status as the best crypto to buy encourages early and strategic engagement.

Cardano is making a serious push towards a $4 valuation, fueled by impressive network growth and a series of upcoming upgrades. But while Cardano grabs the headlines, a new player is quietly making waves: Web3Bay (3BAY) . This blockchain-powered e-commerce platform is turning heads with its innovative approach to online shopping, and its presale has just surpassed a whopping $950,000. Let’s dive into the latest crypto news and see why these two projects are capturing the attention of savvy investors. Cardano’s Hydra Upgrade: Speed Boost for the Blockchain Cardano (ADA) is on a mission to become a major player in the blockchain space, and its recent progress is certainly turning heads. Despite a recent dip in price, Cardano’s network activity is booming, with daily active addresses hitting over 50,000. This suggests that more and more people are using the Cardano blockchain, which is a great sign for its long-term growth. Analysts are keeping a close eye on Cardano, and many believe that it could hit $4 in the near future. But it’s not all smooth sailing for Cardano. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, and there are always challenges to overcome. Cardano faces some short-term headwinds, including bearish sentiment in the futures market. However, if it can maintain its current momentum and continue to attract new users, Cardano could be well on its way to reaching that $4 milestone. Decentralized Marketplace: Web3Bay’s User-Centric Approach While Cardano focuses on building a robust blockchain infrastructure, Web3Bay is tackling a different challenge: revolutionizing the online shopping experience. This blockchain-powered e-commerce platform is turning the traditional marketplace model on its head, offering users a secure, transparent, and user-friendly alternative. One of Web3Bay’s key innovations is its integration of Layer-2 rollups. This technology allows for lightning-fast and cost-efficient transactions, making it a game-changer for online shopping. And with plans to launch an NFT marketplace, offer staking rewards, and enable cross-chain compatibility, Web3Bay is building a comprehensive ecosystem that caters to the needs of both buyers and sellers. But perhaps the most exciting aspect of Web3Bay is its commitment to decentralization. The platform is transitioning into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which means that token holders will have a direct say in shaping its future. This is a truly revolutionary approach that puts the power back into the hands of the users. Web3Bay’s presale is generating a lot of buzz, and it’s easy to see why. The platform has already raised over $950,000, and with its native token, 3BAY, currently priced at just $0.004562625, investors are eager to get in on the action. And with a projected launch price of $0.1959, those early investors could be looking at a staggering ROI of 6,340%. That’s the kind of return that can make even the most seasoned crypto investor’s heart skip a beat. Cardano & Web3Bay: Two Sides of the Same Crypto Coin Cardano and Web3Bay represent two different but equally exciting facets of the crypto world. Cardano is focused on building a powerful and efficient blockchain infrastructure, while Web3Bay is using that infrastructure to revolutionize the e-commerce industry. Both projects are attracting significant attention from investors and are poised to play a major role in shaping the future of the crypto landscape. Whether you’re interested in the technical advancements of Cardano or the user-centric approach of Web3Bay, these two projects are definitely worth keeping an eye on. The Crypto World is Heating Up As the crypto market continues to evolve, projects like Cardano and Web3Bay are leading the charge with their innovative solutions and ambitious visions. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just starting your crypto journey, these two projects offer compelling opportunities to participate in the exciting world of blockchain technology. So, stay tuned, do your research, and get ready for the next chapter in the crypto revolution.

Bitcoin (BTC) changed the lives of early investors with its groundbreaking returns, and Ethereum (ETH) reshaped the crypto world with its smart contracts. Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin, is being called the next big opportunity for exponential growth. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Ultimate Choice 1. A Fresh Entrant With Massive Potential: As a newly launched coin, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors the chance to enter at the ground floor. Its early-stage momentum makes it one of the most promising opportunities to achieve life-changing gains. 2. Record-Breaking Presale Success: Raising $1 million almost instantly, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven itself as a high-demand asset. This presale success has cemented its place as a token with unmatched growth potential. 3. Exclusivity That Drives Demand: Unlike ETH, MATIC, or APT, which are widely traded on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity creates urgency and scarcity, increasing its value to early adopters. How It Stands Up Against Competitors XRP: A leader in payments, but it no longer offers the early-stage returns seen with this new coin. Solana (SOL): Strong in scalability but can’t match the momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Optimism (OP): A rising Layer-2 solution but lacks the excitement surrounding this token. SEI: Innovative but doesn’t have the same presale success or exclusivity. Secure Your Position Before It’s Too Late With its record-breaking presale and massive growth projections, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly becoming the most talked-about investment of 2025.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. The Rexas Finance presale is expected to surge faster and higher than Shiba Inu in 2021. Table of Contents The rise of Shiba Inu Rexas Finance Conclusion With its amazing surge, Shiba Inu (SHIB) created history and became among the most unforgettable success stories ever among cryptocurrencies. From its presale price of $0.00000006 to an all-time high of $0.00008845 in October 2021, SHIB registered an unprecedented 147,000% increase in just over a year. This explosive rise made early investors millionaires. Crypto watchers suggest there’s another chance for those who missed Shiba Inu’s historic surge. The Rexas Finance (RXS) project is expected to surge and create millionaires faster than SHIB. The rise of Shiba Inu Shiba Inu became well-known thanks to a low entry price, organic community marketing, and the meme-coin frenzy in 2021. Early SHIB investors saw their holdings skyrocket as the token acquired popularity and use. This shows the advantage of early adoption in crypto investment. Although SHIB’s narrative is amazing, the crypto market is changing, and new initiatives with even more transforming power are coming up. You might also like: Shiba Inu millionaire forecasts next move, 2 coins to be the next SHIB Rexas Finance Rexas Finance is a new, transformative cryptocurrency designed to close the distance between digital assets and the actual world. With just one click, the creative platform will let consumers purchase and tokenize actual assets with either full or fractional ownership. Real estate, artwork, and intellectual property are examples of which RXS users will be able to tokenize and trade effortlessly, providing countless opportunities. Rexas Finance distinguishes itself with a utility-driven ecosystem featuring the Rexas Token Builder, Rexas Launchpad, Rexas Estate, QuickMint Bot, and Rexas GenAI. All while streamlining difficult procedures, these tools will let users create and manage tokens, start projects, and access tokenized real-world assets. Drawing analogies to SHIB’s early success but with considerably more practical uses, this value proposition distinguishes RXS in the crypto world. The RXS presale has been remarkable. In its 11th presale round, Rexas Finance has already sold about 414 million RXS tokens, generating an amazing $39.07 million. Reflecting great investor demand and project confidence, the presale phases have regularly sold out ahead of schedule. You might also like: 2025’s leading crypto presale with growth potential revealed Early investors in Rexas Finance have already enjoyed notable gains; the token price has surged almost 500% from the start of the presale stage to its present price.

The Certik audit of Rexas Finance guarantees the security and openness of the project, increasing investor confidence.

Rexas Finance is leveraging a multi-trillion-dollar industry by providing a platform on which anybody may tokenize and trade assets worldwide, guaranteeing continuous demand and price momentum for its token. Analysts estimate that RXS could match SHIB’s iconic surge but at a faster speed. RXS’s capacity to serve retail and institutional investors is expected to drive this rapid expansion. Conclusion For those who regret missing Shiba Inu’s meteoric rise, Rexas Finance offers a second chance to potentially achieve massive returns. Strong presale performance, creative technology, and real-world use cases indicate RXS’s potential to exceed SHIB in speed and size.

Bearish Pressure Mounts,https://coinpedia.org/news/suis-35-crash-incoming-bearish-pressure-mounts/,"The post SUI’s 35% Crash Incoming? Bearish Pressure Mounts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Amid this bearish market sentiment, SUI, the native token of the Sui blockchain appears bearish and is likely headed for a double-digit price drop, as it has formed a bearish price action pattern on its daily time frame. This bearish outlook on SUI has shifted as it fails to hold the crucial support from the ascending trendline that it has been witnessing for a prolonged period. SUI Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to the expert technical analysis, with today’s price decline, SUI has successfully confirmed its bearish breakdown and has shifted the entire sentiment toward the bearish side. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action and historical momentum, if SUI holds itself below the $4 level, there is a strong possibility it could drop by 35% to reach the $2.30 level in the future. On the positive side, SUI’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 35.5, indicating that the asset has sufficient room for further price declines. SUI is currently trading near $3.66 and has witnessed a price decline of over 8.50% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 55%, indicating lower participation from traders. $18.5 Worth of SUI Outflow Besides, SUI’s bearish price action and strong bearish market sentiment, long-term holders seem to be accumulating the token, indicating a potential buying opportunity, as revealed by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from the spot inflow/outflow revealed that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of over $18.5 worth of SUI tokens. This substantial outflow from the exchanges indicates a potential accumulation and can cause buying pressure and further price surges, which seem hard to experience due to the bearish sentiment.

According to m, DOGE’s price is gearing up for a move that could send it above $2. Dogecoin Gears Up For 600% Run Above $2 In an X post, Javon Marks predicted that Dogecoin could record a 600% price rally and surge above $2. This came as he provided some optimism despite the recent pullback, with DOGE dropping to as low as $0.30. He stated that the price action is “refreshing” because prices still look on track for another great bullish performance. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts When Dogecoin Price Will Hit $3 This Cycle Marks added that history suggests that another run of 600% or more could happen, sending the Dogecoin price above $2.28. In line with this, he remarked that the next wave can be historical. The analyst had previously alluded to DOGE’s historical performance when he predicted that the meme coin could rally above the 1.618 Fib extension, which is currently at $2.2. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade also recently alluded to Dogecoin’s historical performance when he predicted its price could rally to as high as $20 in this market cycle. The analyst noted that Dogecoin experienced bull rallies after surpassing the previous candle body high in 20217 and 2021, with gains of 3,000% and 8,000%, respectively. Therefore, he remarked that DOGE could reach this $20 target if a similar pattern plays out again. However, in the short term, the Dogecoin price could still drop to as low as $0.26 before it records any parabolic rally to the upside. This is based on crypto analyst Behdark’s DOGE analysis, in which he explained that the drop to $0.26 is part of the C wave corrective move. Once the price correction is done, the analyst predicted that the meme coin could rebound to $0.50. DOGE Failed To Touch The Trendline During The Recent Drop Crypto analyst Master Kenobi noted that the Dogecoin price failed to touch a trendline he highlighted on the charts during this latest drop. In line with this, he questioned if it meant that DOGE could still witness more pullbacks or a bullish reversal from its current price level. While he didn’t provide an answer, the analyst alluded to an earlier analysis, in which he predicted that DOGE could record a 3x price increase and reach $1.05 between February and March. Related Reading: Dogecoin Traders Remain Extremely Bullish Despite Price Crash, Here Are The Numbers Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s price action might have shifted from bearish to bullish following this recent pullback. In an X post, Trader Tardigrade stated that DOGE’s MACD bullish crossover was approaching on the 4-hour chart. He explained that this signals a short-term momentum shift for DOGE from bearish to bullish.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. IntelMarkets emerges with the potential to push Shiba Inu from the top 10 list with its AI-blockchain combination. Table of Contents IntelMarkets: The next big thing in crypto trading Shiba Inu Why IntelMarkets could outperform Shiba Inu Conclusion Shiba Inu (SHIB) has had its moment of glory. However, as the market evolves, investors are paying more attention to coins with real utility alongside a high rate of growth. One of them is IntelMarkets (INTL) – a trailblazing DeFi project powered by Artificial Intelligence. IntelMarkets: The next big thing in crypto trading In contrast to SHIB’s meme origins, IntelMarkets enters the market with a clear vision: to share actionable insights for disrupting crypto trading through the adoption of AI technology and decentralized finance concepts. IntelMarkets is entirely different from conventional exchanges in the way it uses powerful AI to study market trends and provide INTL users with profit maximizing strategies. Composed of a team from MIT and Open AI experts, IntelMarkets is a leader in both blockchain and AI development. The INTL presale has raised $7.72 million in a few weeks, demonstrating the market’s belief in the further development of the project. Entering the 9th stage of the presale, INTL tokens can be bought for $0.082. Planned for a Q2 2025 release, industry experts anticipate a possible 5x growth once INTL tokens get listed on tier-1 exchanges like CoinBase, Binance, Uniswap and Bybit. You might also like: Red alert as Shiba Inu price forms two risky patterns Shiba Inu The Shiba Inu token was created in August 2020, and its price began to grow, becoming one of the most successful tokens on the market. The Shiba Inu price rose to its record high of $0.00008845 in October 2021, mainly due to mania within the community and the support of celebrities. SHIB’s ecosystem has grown into ShibaSwap, Shib.io, Shibarium , and NFTs. However, its price has undergone tremendous crashes from its ATH. Currently, SHIB is trading at around $0.00001801, with a 15% decline over the last month. Though the token maintains value and utility, its price has little room for massive growth due to a high market cap and limited institutional capital inflows. Nonetheless, analysts suggest that a SHIB ETF could result in a rally for the Shiba Inu price. Why IntelMarkets could outperform Shiba Inu The strength of the SHIB token is based on community support and meme-style advertising while IntelMarkets has a long list of application-based features. For example, users will gain access to the Intell-M algorithms with AI-driven insights into the best trading strategies. Furthermore, IntelMarkets will run on a dual-chain solution that combines two different blockchains: Ethereum and Solana. This feature increases scalability while expanding the platform’s use for a large audience. While Shiba Inu has many drawbacks because of its meme coin status, IntelMarkets provides a competitive and efficient tool for today’s traders. Conclusion Shiba Inu is still mainstream and has significant potential for growth, but at the same time, this pace is significantly lower than that of IntelMarkets. Given its unique approach to deploying AI to help in the trading process, IntelMarkets has a chance to rise in market ratings and oust SHIB from the top ten.

39631623,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/solana-blockchain-proves-highly-valuable-to-trump-coin-but-is-1fuel-the-next-step,1738112067,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/39631623.jpeg,Solana Blockchain Proves Highly Valuable To Trump Coin But Is 1Fuel The Next Step?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/solana-blockchain-proves-highly-valuable-to-trump-coin-but-is-1fuel-the-next-step,"Investors are buzzing with excitement as Solana blockchain surged back into the spotlight, thanks to the launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin. While Solana’s rise reminds investors of its lightning speed and cost efficiency, another contender, 1Fuel (OFT) , is making waves with its innovative cross-chain wallet and unmatched utility. In a market where sustainability and massive profits are prized, analysts are forecasting that 1Fuel (OFT) is all set to deliver over 100x returns on launch. Let’s find out why! The trump effect: How one meme coin revitalized Solana Last weekend, Solana's SOL token soared following the launch of a meme coin tied to Donald Trump, a self-proclaimed ""crypto president."" The market was shaken by Trump's announcement that he is launching a meme coin named Official Trump (TRUMP) on the Solana blockchain. The selection of Solana as an issuance network increased demand and sentiment for SOL coins. Following the debut, SOL trade volumes skyrocketed to over $26 billion. That is an almost 3,000% increase from December 2022, when confidence for Solana was damaged by the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its well-known investor Sam Bankman-Fried, which brought the market to three-year lows of $9. In the meanwhile, Solana has consistently been marketed as an Ethereum alternative that is ""faster, cheaper."" Since last year, the blockchain, which is home to several DeFi projects, has emerged as the global hub for meme coins. A few of the meme coins that have now made Solana essential to its business include PEPE, WIF, PENGU, and MOTHER. Real utility, real returns: What sets 1Fuel apart from the crowd Big profits and long-term sustainability are the two main factors that crypto investors are always on the lookout for. 1Fuel (OFT) is one such project that provides real-life utility and massive returns, appealing to investors of all levels. 1Fuel’s one-click cross-chain cryptocurrency wallet allows its users to store and exchange digital assets across several blockchain networks, without the need of having multiple wallets and paying hefty fees. Through this, it streamlines the digital assets management process, an easy game that investors of all experience can play. The platform further ensures that each user's assets are safe and secure. It does this by providing cold storage options for offline storage saving them from online threats. Furthermore, it has an integrated privacy mixer to make transactions anonymous ensuring user’s privacy. Why are analysts predicting 100X growth for 1Fuel? The whole 1Fuel ecosystem is powered by OFT tokens, which are currently available to be bought in its presale. With nearly $1.5 million from the sale of over 160 million tokens, investors are purchasing tokens at an unparalleled momentum. At $0.017, each OFT token provides its users with a low-cost entry point. Analysts are quite excited about 1Fuel's future potential. They anticipate a 100x increase upon the project's listing on tier-1 exchange platforms. These opportunities and 1Fuel's innovative offerings set it apart from the heavy competition in the market. Final thoughts While Solana proves its resilience with the TRUMP coin rally, 1Fuel (OFT) is carving out its niche as the ultimate crypto wallet solution. Its focus on cross-chain functionality, security, and passive income opportunities positions it as a frontrunner in the race for innovation. With analysts predicting exponential growth, the question isn’t if 1Fuel will succeed, but how far it will go. Secure your financial future with 1Fuel’s cutting-edge technology, act now!

Since their trades can move prices significantly and create ripples felt across the market, knowing what they are up to sometimes offers clues about market trends, potential price changes, and helps uncover market opportunities. Recently, a new trend has been noticed among Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales. These SHIB early adopters are migrating to Remittix (RTX), a new crypto they believe has multi-billion-dollar potential. Many experts argue that Remittix could be the next crypto to 100x, providing both short-term and long-term opportunities for investors. But what is it about Remittix that is attracting such significant whale interest? Could this new crypto project live up to market expectations? Let’s uncover the details. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Early Success and Current Struggles Launched in 2020, Shiba Inu burst into the market with a vibrant community of dog lovers and memecoin faithfuls shortly after. Due time has seen SHIB grow from a mere speculative asset into a utility-driven ecosystem. Last week, Shiba Inu unveiled ShibOS , a blockchain-based OS with the goal of improving Web3 adoption. This operating system would aid developers in building scalable and privacy-conscious applications optimized for various use cases. This launch marks a major milestone, introducing 36 different chambers to develop apps, each tailored for a specific purpose. Despite this exciting development, SHIB has been struggling in the market. Currently valued at $0.00001856 , SHIB suffered a steep 11.52% decline in a single day after moving sideways last week. The token’s price is now 18.4% lower than its value a month earlier. On Monday, SHIBsaw a new monthly low after slipping past the critical $0.00002 support level. SHIB’s bearish behaviour has raised concerns among investors. Interestingly, buyer sentiment remains hesitant as the market evaluates SHIB’s troubling trajectory. By observing whale movements, investors tend to gain insight into the trend of the market. Analysts have noticed that some early movers of Shiba Inu are now changing their focus and accumulating Remittix, a new crypto project with huge profit potential. These movements have triggered the increased interest of retail investors, and many are willing to follow in their footsteps. Why Are SHIB Whales Accumulating Remittix? On-chain metrics indicate a significant influx of SHIB whales into Remittix. The primary reason for this shift is the compelling use case offered by Remittix in solving one of the most pressing issues in the financial sector—cross-border payments. Remittix provides an efficient and cost-effective alternative to improve B2B and B2C relations. With a flat fee structure, businesses and customers can make crypto-to fiat transactions and receive the exact amount sent by the recipient. Thus, eliminating hidden charges and offering lower fees when compared to its market competitors. The Future of Remittix and Market Opportunities As the presale of Remittix continues to heat up, RTX’s target of raising $36 million through its ongoing ICO would be over in a little less than two weeks. The realization of this has left investors scrambling to get in early. They are willing to hop the project and follow the lead of SHIB whales. Moreover, Remittix successfully passed a smart contract audit with no issues, further revealing its commitment to security and transparency and blowing off concerns of a rug pull.. With an imminent boom on the horizon, SHIB whales are confident that Remittix will offer them both short-term gains and long-term stability. The compelling use-case of the new crypto project and its growing adoption make it one of the best altcoins to buy this season. Conclusion Sometimes, identifying the best altcoins to buy could require careful observation of whale activity. The recent accumulation of Remittix by SHIB whales signals strong confidence in its potential. Investors looking for the next crypto to 100x should look too far away, as Remittix could very well be the next multi-billion-dollar project this year.

Their significant trades can impact prices and create market waves, so understanding their actions can sometimes reveal market trends, potential price shifts, and hidden opportunities. Recently, a new pattern has emerged among Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales. These early investors in SHIB are now shifting towards Remittix (RTX), a new cryptocurrency they believe holds multi-billion-dollar potential. Many analysts suggest that Remittix might be the next crypto to 100x, offering lucrative opportunities both in the short and long term for investors. So, what is it about Remittix that draws such considerable interest from whales? Can this new crypto project meet market expectations? Let’s explore the details. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Early Success and Present Challenges Introduced in 2020, Shiba Inu quickly gained attention with a lively group of dog enthusiasts and memecoin supporters. Over time, SHIB transformed from just a speculative investment into a utility-focused ecosystem. Recently, Shiba Inu introduced ShibOS , a blockchain-based operating system aimed at boosting Web3 adoption. This OS is designed to help developers create scalable, privacy-oriented applications that are optimized for diverse use cases.

The token’s value is now 18.4% less than a month ago. On Monday, SHIB hit a new monthly low after falling below the critical $0.00002 support level. SHIB’s downward trend has caused concern among investors. Interestingly, buyer sentiment remains cautious as the market scrutinizes SHIB’s challenging path. By tracking whale patterns, investors typically gain insights into market trends. Analysts have observed that some early Shiba Inu investors are now redirecting their attention towards Remittix, a new cryptocurrency project with significant profit potential. These movements have sparked increased interest among retail investors, many of whom are keen to follow suit. What Draws SHIB Whales to Remittix? On-chain data shows a notable entry of SHIB whales into Remittix. The main reason for this shift is the attractive use case provided by Remittix in addressing a critical issue in the financial industry—cross-border payments. Remittix offers a streamlined and budget-friendly solution to enhance B2B and B2C relationships. With its flat fee model, both businesses and consumers can conduct crypto-to-fiat transactions without any hidden costs, ensuring the recipient receives the exact amount sent. This makes it a cost-effective option compared to its market rivals. The Prospects for Remittix and Market Potential As the presale of Remittix gains momentum, RTX aims to raise $36 million through its ongoing ICO, which is expected to conclude in just under two weeks. This has prompted investors to act quickly and join the project, following the lead of SHIB whales. Additionally, Remittix has successfully completed a smart contract audit without issues, highlighting its focus on security and transparency, and alleviating fears of a rug pull. With potential growth on the horizon, SHIB whales are optimistic that Remittix will deliver both immediate profits and long-term stability. The project’s promising use case and increasing adoption rate make it one of the top altcoins to purchase this season. Conclusion Sometimes, identifying the top altcoins to purchase requires careful monitoring of whale activities. SHIB whales' recent acquisition of Remittix demonstrates strong confidence in its potential. Investors seeking the next crypto to 100x should not overlook Remittix, which could indeed be the next multi-billion-dollar venture this year.

Pseudonymous trader Credible tells his 459,900 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum may be in the midst of carving a local bottom before igniting fresh rallies. According to the analyst, Ethereum bulls should hold ETH’s immediate support at around $3,000 otherwise the leading smart contract protocol could plunge to below $2,800. “Here we are. The first of two levels that I believe will mark our bottom on ETH. Moment of truth here, let’s see if it holds. If it’s lost, then we hit the monthly demand below which should mark our HTF (high time frame) bottom. Many other coins also hitting key/pivotal levels right now.” Source: Credible/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that ETH could rally above $4,000 after bottoming out. At time of writing, ETH is worth $3,170. Turning to Bitcoin, the analyst thinks that the current BTC correction is a positive rather than a negative for the crypto king. According to Credible, the retracement is setting the stage for a potential Bitcoin short squeeze. A short squeeze occurs when a sharp rise in the price of an asset forces traders who had previously sold short to close their positions, fueling more rallies. Short selling means selling borrowed shares of a stock with the expectation that the price will fall. Says Credible, “BTC is simply heading down to one end of our range that we’ve been trapped in for the last week, nothing to be freaking out about. In fact, I’m glad we’re going for the lows first because it’s healthier for us to take liquidity from the lows of this range while leaving liquidity behind at the highs. Eyes on the range lows to see if this is just a liquidity grab at one end of the range before going for the other…” Source: Credible/X While Credible believes BTC is positioned to spark a short-term rally, he predicts that Bitcoin may witness one more leg down after the surge before launching a parabolic upside move en route to $150,000. “In a perfect world…” Source: Credible/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $102,080.

BONK: The Shiba Inu Memecoin That’s Energizing Solana’s Scene BONK is a fresh memecoin on the Solana blockchain, boasting a Shiba Inu mascot that's drawing attention. Unlike other tokens dominated by large investors, BONK aims to empower the community. It achieved this by airdropping half of its total supply to participants in Solana's NFT and DeFi projects. Following its listing on Coinbase, BONK's value more than doubled, reflecting the excitement surrounding this community-focused coin. Despite hurdles like a massive total supply and typical memecoin volatility, BONK is making its presence felt. It’s becoming integrated into Solana’s expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications, including the launch of its own exchange, BonkSwap. This engagement signals potential for BONK's future. In a market where memecoins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have made significant impacts, BONK offers something distinctive by empowering its users. Its rapid ascent and novel approach make it a coin to watch in the current market cycle. From Frog Meme to Cryptocurrency Hit: Discover PEPE PEPE is a new digital currency that began as a homage to the iconic Pepe the Frog meme. Built on Ethereum, it's a deflationary memecoin with the goal of becoming a leading meme-inspired cryptocurrency. PEPE embraces the playful side of crypto, with no taxes and a straightforward approach. Between late April and May 2023, PEPE's value soared, reaching a market cap of $1.6 billion. Early investors gained substantial returns, and a dedicated fan base formed around the coin. This surge initiated a ""memecoin season,"" with other meme tokens experiencing dramatic price fluctuations. Many question whether PEPE has further growth potential. Its roadmap includes listing on major exchanges and a strategy for a ""meme takeover."" While it lacks new technology, its strength lies in its community and the allure of internet memes. Compared to other meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PEPE maintains simplicity and fun. In the current market cycle, with anticipation of Bitcoin’s halving and potential bull runs, PEPE appears appealing to those who believe in the power of memes and community-driven initiatives. The memecoin trend illustrates that sometimes, enjoyment and simplicity can captivate the market's attention. Conclusion Though BONK and PEPE have their merits, XYZVerse, the trailblazing all-sport memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth, is stepping up as the next crypto giant.

Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) has seen notable price activity recently. Over the past week, its price dipped by 1.53%, but the overall trend remains positive. In the last month, SOL's price rose by 21.94%, and it has climbed 38.74% over the past six months, demonstrating strong upward momentum despite short-term fluctuations. SOL is currently trading between $222 and $265.87, with the nearest resistance at $291.3. Breaking past this could lead to a target of $335.17, representing around a 26% gain from the upper range. On the downside, the closest support is at $203.56, with a potential drop to the second support at $159.69, about 28% from the lower range. Technical indicators show a mixed picture. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 53.18, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is $238.34, slightly below the 100-day SMA of $247.87, hinting at possible consolidation. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) stands at 0.7619, suggesting mild bullish momentum.

In the last week, its price increased by 26.57%, with a monthly rise of 40.82% and an 18.72% gain over six months. These positive trends suggest strong momentum for this cryptocurrency.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 62.09, indicating an approach to overbought territory but still suggesting growth potential. The Stochastic oscillator is at 72.30, underscoring this perspective. Looking forward, the nearest resistance is $1.55. Surpassing this could lead to targeting the second resistance at $2.07, a notable percentage increase from current levels. On the downside, the nearest support is $0.51, providing a buffer if prices retreat. Based on the current data, JUP's price might continue to rise, but traders should monitor these crucial levels closely.

Looking ahead, the nearest resistance is at $5.91. Moving above this could suggest an increase of about 11% from the current high. On the downside, the nearest support is at $4.17, a potential decrease of around 7%. The second resistance and support levels are at $6.78 and $3.30, marking critical points for future movements. Based on this information, NEAR may face ongoing challenges but could find opportunities for growth if it surpasses key resistance levels. TRON (TRX) TRON (TRX) has experienced a remarkable ascent over the last six months, climbing by 92.13%. Currently trading between $0.23 and $0.26, TRX has demonstrated resilience in the crypto market.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 56.76, pointing to bullish sentiment. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is positive at 0.0008241, supporting the possibility of a price increase. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are at $0.25, indicating price stability. TRX is nearing its closest resistance level at $0.28. Breaking above this could target the second resistance at $0.32, suggesting a potential gain of about 23% from current levels. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.21, with further support at $0.17. If bullish momentum continues, TRX could reach higher levels, but traders should remain vigilant for possible pullbacks.

With its revolutionary wallet, focus on security and privacy, and jaw-dropping presale gains, this project has captured the attention of risk-takers eager to ride the wave to potential 100X returns. The buzz is real, and early adopters are already reaping the rewards. Let’s take a closer look at these projects. PENGU plunge: What’s behind the 36% drop? As the market continues to hit lower lows, PENGU investors are left with no option but to decrease their exposure to the assets. According to CoinMarketCap, PENGU investors have lost 36% in the last month as the market narrative has shifted against them. PENGU has fallen after failing to breach the resistance level of 0.025364, and if sideline whales start selling, this decline might get worse. The PENGU netflow on Coinglass indicates that $801,340 worth of the asset has been sold, adding to the rejection at the prior resistance, indicating that certain cohorts of market whales have already started selling. PENGU investors are now turning their heads towards 1Fuel's (OFT) ongoing presale which has managed to grab their attention through its phenomenal growth rate, as clear by its total funding which currently stands at over $1.5 million. Leadership crisis: Kusama’s exit and its impact on SHIB The sudden resignation of Shiba Inu's leading figurehead, Shytoshi Kusama, shocked the cryptocurrency community. Shiba Inu changed from a meme coin to a robust ecosystem under Kusama's leadership, but his exit has left the market unsure. Investors' worries about the project's trajectory as it shifts to a new leadership model were reflected in the 6% decline in SHIB's pricing on the last day. His departure underlines the problems of maintaining innovation and community trust in the fast-paced sphere of Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi). According to analysts, Shiba Inu has established a solid foundation, but how well the community can carry out its plan without Kusama leading the charge will determine how successful it is in the long run. Meanwhile, SHIB investors are exploring 1Fuel (OFT), an upcoming project that is offering massive returns alongside revolutionary technology. Why 1Fuel’s presale is a must-join opportunity 1Fuel (OFT) is an upcoming cutting-edge crypto wallet that will simplify and secure all of your crypto transactions. In contrast to conventional cryptocurrency exchanges, 1Fuel's distinctive and user-friendly design is intended to make managing and trading digital assets across several blockchains easy and economical. The other two main features that the 1Fuel ecosystem offers are asset safety and anonymity. In order to ensure optimal security, it provides cold wallet alternatives that enable assets to be kept offline and out of the reach of hackers. The integrated privacy mixer in 1Fuel will let investors interact anonymously and maintain total control of their assets. The project is currently in its presale phase and its trajectory is evidence of 1Fuel’s rapid adoption. Analysts anticipate 500% presale gains ahead before the token gets officially listed. Since the smart early investor acquired OFT tokens at the initial price of $0.01, they have already reaped 70% ROI, and are all set to gain further. Additionally, 1Fuel provides investors with the opportunity to generate passive income from their long-term investment through staking incentives of up to 30% annually. Before its official listing, early supporters have a chance to reap the greatest rewards. Final thoughts In a market fraught with uncertainty, 1Fuel (OFT) is a center of innovation and promise. As Pudgy Penguin and Shiba Inu struggle with investor confidence, 1Fuel is blazing its trail with an ecosystem built for privacy, security, and profitability. Its presale success and groundbreaking wallet technology is proof of its potential to dominate the crypto landscape. Say goodbye to high fees and complex transactions, and join 1Fuel’s game-changing platform!

Trump Buys SUI (TRUMPSUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPSUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Buys SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys SUI launched with over $29,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Buys SUI by entering its contract address (CA) – 7chY3Yw9cArR4CGQQ2N6mciszZvWB3rW6WoBNTfwyitu – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|SUI|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-29 01:08:00

JP Morgan Analyst Believes It's Possible. Hedera Price Predicted To Drop 20% In February,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/could-payfi-star-remittix-become-the-next-ripple-xrp-jp-morgan-analyst-believes-its-possible-hedera-price-predicted-to-drop-20-in-february,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, experts and market analysts are always on the lookout for emerging projects that could challenge well-established coins. A major player in cross-border payments, Ripple (XRP), has caught the attention of PayFi Star Remittix as a potential competitor. This development has sparked discussions about its viability as a crypto investment, with analysts drawing comparisons between XRP and PayFi Star Remittix. Is PayFi Star Remittix Poised To Rival Ripple? With its focus on revolutionizing the remittance industry, PayFi Star Remittix is gaining traction as a promising alternative to Ripple (XRP). Like Ripple, the platform aims to leverage blockchain technology to facilitate fast, secure, and cost-effective international transactions. Experts discussing the top crypto investments suggest that PayFi Star Remittix's innovative approach could lead it to achieve a level of success similar to XRP in the years to come. J.P. Morgan analysts have also acknowledged the potential of PayFi Star Remittix, highlighting its inventive use of blockchain technology to tackle inefficiencies in cross-border payments. They believe its growth strategy aligns well with emerging trends in the remittance sector. This viewpoint has heightened investor interest in Remittix as a formidable competitor to Ripple (XRP). Industry experts, however, are confident that the scalability of PayFi and its underlying blockchain will eventually enable PayFi to rival XRP’s dominance in this arena as a leading cryptocurrency, according to a commentary on top crypto investments. Hedera's Price Prediction for February 2025 While investors are increasingly interested in PayFi Star Remittix, Hedera (HBAR), another key player in the blockchain industry, is facing challenges. Recent forecasts for February 2025 suggest that Hedera's value might decrease by 20% due to worsening market conditions. This prediction highlights the risks and market volatility that cryptocurrency investors must navigate. If this adverse scenario materializes, Hedera might find it difficult to attract new developers and investors, especially with growing interest in other blockchain projects. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, investors are becoming more selective in choosing the top crypto investments, favoring projects with robust use cases and scalability. Future Prospects for Ripple XRP: What Lies Ahead? Ripple (XRP) has faced significant challenges due to its ongoing legal dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite this, XRP's solid market presence and global partnerships continue to make it one of the most popular cryptocurrencies. Analysts foresee considerable growth in Ripple XRP's future trends. The outcome of this legal battle will be crucial for XRP's future. Ripple XRP's future trends may experience an investment and usage surge if Ripple wins its case against the SEC. Increased institutional investment and legal clarity would likely benefit Ripple (XRP), potentially leading to its classification as a utility token rather than a security. Could Remittix Transform Cross-Border Payments? Remittix is quickly gaining recognition for its innovative approach to overcoming inefficiencies in the global remittance industry. Designed to facilitate seamless, secure, and low-cost international payments, Remittix is well-positioned to emerge as a major player in the blockchain payment space. Its transaction speeds are nearly instantaneous, and the minimal fees distinguish it from traditional methods. Analysts have drawn parallels between Remittix and Ripple (XRP), noting their market success and emphasizing Remittix's disruptive potential in the industry. As interest from banks grows and with scalability as a primary goal, the platform could very well become a dominant force in cross-border payments. Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market evolves, PayFi Star Remittix emerges as a potential rival to Ripple (XRP), offering groundbreaking solutions for international transfers. With XRP's established position and Hedera's current difficulties, this highlights the sector's complexity, yet Remittix shows promise to disrupt the market.

A prominent digital currency recognized for its cross-border payments, Ripple (XRP), has drawn interest in PayFi Star Remittix as a possible competitor. This advance has led to the discussion of its potential as a crypto to invest in, analysts have compared XRP to PayFi Star Remittix. Is PayFi Star Remittix The Next Ripple? Due to its emphasis on transforming the remittance sector, PayFi Star Remittix is becoming more and more popular as a viable substitute for Ripple(XRP). Like Ripple's use case, the platform seeks to harness blockchain technology for quick, safe and affordable cross-border transactions. According to experts discussing the top crypto to invest in, PayFi Star Remittix's creative strategy may help it achieve comparable success to XRP in the upcoming years. The potential of PayFi Star Remittix has also been recognized by J.P. Morgan analysts, who point to its creative application of blockchain technology to address inefficiencies in cross-border payments. Its expansion plan, they believe, fits in nicely with new developments in the remittance business. This perspective has increased investor interest in Remittix as a strong rival to Ripple (XRP). Industry observers, however, are betting that the scalability of PayFi and blockchain that underlies it will ultimately permit Pay Fi to compete with XRP's dominance in this space as one of the top cryptocurrencies to buy, argues a commentary on top crypto to invest in topics. Hedera Price Outlook February 2025 Forecast Investors are taking notice of PayFi Star Remittix but Hedera (HBAR), another significant competitor in the blockchain market, is going through a difficult time. Recent estimates state that the February 2025 Hedera price prediction indicates a possible 20% decline in value as market conditions deteriorate. In this prognosis, the importance is put at the forefront of the risks that investors have to deal with as well as of the volatility of the market associated with cryptocurrencies. Hedera may struggle to attract new engineers and investors if this doomsday scenario is true, especially with the spike of interest among other blockchain projects to name a few. With the development of the crypto market, investors become more and more discriminating in selecting the top crypto to invest in, tending to focus on projects with strong use cases and scalability. Ripple XRP Future Trends What’s Next? In view of the current legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple (XRP) has struggled extensively. Nevertheless, XRP's strong on-market and global partnerships remain to be one of the most favored cryptocurrencies. Analysts predict that there will be significant growth in Ripple XRP future trends. The resolution of this legal issue will have a significant impact on XRP's future. Ripple XRP future trends could see a spike in investment and usage if Ripple prevails in its lawsuit against the SEC. More institutional investment and legal clarity would probably be advantageous for Ripple(XRP), which has the potential to be recognized as a utility token rather than a security. Could Remittix Redefine Cross-Border Payments? Remittix is rapidly becoming known for its novel way to address the inefficiencies in the global remittance market. Designed to streamline, secure and cheaply conduct cross-border payments, Remittix is well poised to become a key player in the blockchain payments landscape. Its speed of payments processing is almost real time and the low transaction/fee make it unlike standard methodologies. Analysts have made a comparison between Remittix and Ripple (XRP) and their success in the market is discussed, emphasizing Remittix's disruptive role in the industry. In the wake of growing interest from banks and with the scalability of Remittix as one of its main objectives the platform may well be the next force in cross-border payment. Conclusion As the cryptocurrencies market develops, PayFi Star Remittix is a potential contender to Ripple (XRP) offering disruptive solutions for cross border payments. During the time of XRP's entrenched leadership and Hedera's struggles this showcases the complexity of the industry but Remittix remains to show a potential to upend the market.

Once soaring with the meme coin craze, its recent losses and struggles have left investors questioning its long-term viability. But with 2025 fast approaching, a new contender is emerging, 1Fuel (OFT) . Offering groundbreaking cross-chain capabilities and real-world utility, 1Fuel is gaining traction as the next big thing in DeFi. Analysts are forecasting 100x returns for this DeFi leader. Let’s find out why! PEPE down 30%: Is this just a dip or the end of an era? PEPE has been a chaotic trip for investors. After a difficult month in which it lost 30%, PEPE is currently down a staggering 13% last day, currently trading at $0.00001295. Despite its recent victories, PEPE's crypto analysis reveals flaws in its foundation. Speculative trading and community-driven buzz, two important components of the coin's success, are starting to wane. Technical indicators suggest a negative trend as the RSI approaches the overbought zone. Its progress was made worse as it failed to hold its significant support levels of $0.0000167 and $0.000014. The true issue is the oversaturation of meme coins in the market. Meme tokens' viral appeal and cultural significance, which previously set them apart, are now lost in a sea of copycat projects. PEPE still has a lot of support from the community, but it will need more than memes to survive in the meme currency market in the long run like creativity and utility. Without these, PEPE and its competitors could find it difficult to stay relevant in a market that is becoming tired of hollow promises. In the same landscape, 1Fuel (OFT) emerges as a promising project that is not only promising but delivering big returns backed with solid technology. 1Fuel: The DeFi revolution everyone’s talking about 1Fuel (OFT) is a new project that has recently emerged in the DeFi landscape capturing investors' attention from all around the globe giving tough time to coins with no real-life utility like PEPE. Its ground-breaking ecosystem distinguishes it from its direct competitors like Core Wallet and Ledger Wallet. 1Fuel streamlines digital asset management through the combination of user-friendly tools and sophisticated DeFi technologies. 1Fuel's DEX wallet, which allows one-click cross-chain transactions, is one of its most notable features. With this, users don't require numerous wallets or tokens to transfer assets between different blockchains, unlike traditional wallets. Complex transactions across different networks happen with the ease of one click only. As security is a primary concern in this age of blockchain transactions, 1Fuel with its integrated privacy protocols like built-in mixers and disposable wallets guarantees user anonymity and protection. Furthermore, by including useful financial instruments like cryptocurrency credit and debit cards, 1Fuel is influencing the direction of decentralized finance beyond trading. These encourage DeFi to become a part of daily life by enabling users to make cash transactions in the real world straight from their digital currency holdings. Through 1Fuel's integrated P2P exchange, users may purchase cryptocurrencies directly from one another without the need for centralized middlemen. In keeping with the core principles of decentralization, this functionality allows users complete control over their assets when trading. 1Fuel presale success: $1.6M raised and early investors reaping rewards With prices climbing from $0.01 to $0.017, 1Fuel, which is now in its presale stage, has already raised over $1.6 million and sold over 160 million tokens. Gains of more than 70% have been reaped by early investors and a 20% bonus in the current third presale stage on every purchase increases 1Fuel’s overall allure. Given the anticipated surge in DeFi usage, 1Fuel's cutting-edge ecosystem is all set for rapid expansion. Final thoughts While PEPE struggles to maintain its foothold in a rapidly evolving market, 1Fuel is charging forward with innovation and a clear vision for the future. The rise of decentralized finance is creating an ideal environment for projects like 1Fuel, which combines real-world utility, cutting-edge technology, and user-focused design.

This decline comes after the altcoin teased the $3.50 mark with a bullish run. Many XRP holders were riding high on this uptrend, but now it’s over, and they are seeking the best crypto coin to buy for more significant profits. A new project drawing massive interest from investors is Remittix, a fast-rising PayFi project set to revolutionize the global payments industry. Inefficiencies, pricey fees, and inaccessibility have long plagued these payment systems. Remittix (RTX) aims to transform this sector with a project developed for real-world applications. Providing a bridge between blockchain and traditional finance, Remittix is attracting interest in solving these challenges head-on while providing global practical value for users. This article details how the Ripple price and the Remittix platform are expected to perform in Q1 2025. Analysts Foresee Ripple Price Decline Amid Ongoing Legal Issues Recent crypto news updates highlight a new development in Ripple’s legal conflict with the SEC. Ripple’s developers and investors thought they were in the clear after a favorable court ruling. Yet, the SEC has now appealed the decision, with fresh briefs set to be filed soon. According to crypto news, this latest twist could potentially impact Ripple price efforts to stabilize recently. This legal uncertainty makes it challenging to predict Ripple price movements. Meanwhile, Ripple price recent dip is cause for concern. Analysts suggest that if selling pressure persists and buyers hesitate, Ripple price might drop below the crucial $2.45 support level. Some traders anticipate a rebound at that point, but that won't occur if demand doesn't pick up. Nevertheless, a renewed sense of investor confidence or a bullish market could propel a Ripple price rise toward its peak of $3.41. However, with the recent crypto news, sentiment around XRP remains wary, and analysts are staying vigilant. This uncertainty is precisely why savvy investors are favoring Remittix over Ripple as the best crypto coin to buy. Experts Evaluate Remittix (RTX) and Its Exciting Prospects Remittix (RTX) is a leading PayFi initiative aiming to streamline cross-border transactions by enabling crypto-to-fiat exchanges and worldwide payments. Early investors are drawn to this approach as it eliminates the hefty fees and processing lags typical of conventional remittances. By tackling this real-world issue, Remittix (RTX) is poised to attract a wider audience than many other tokens. Additionally, Remittix’s presale success underscores the project’s potential for growth. Having raised over $8.4 million and sold 390 million tokens in just four weeks, experts anticipate Remittix will be a valuable addition to investors’ portfolios as it continues to gain momentum. This is why some long-term Ripple (XRP) holders are switching allegiances, aiming to capitalize on a newer project set to surpass the XRP coin this year. While Ripple price movements have consistently made it a favored choice for many crypto investors, experts now caution about imminent sell-offs that could destabilize the asset. Many traders now see Remittix as the best crypto coin to buy to weather Ripple’s potential downturn. They prefer Remittix (RTX) due to its practical payment solution and ongoing presale success. Whether the Ripple price recovers or continues to drop remains unclear. Nonetheless, the shift towards Remittix (RTX) highlights how rapidly market sentiment can shift. Experts remain optimistic that this new altcoin can outperform the established XRP coin. Now is the time to get involved! Join the presale and community now!

This decline comes after the altcoin teased the $3.50 mark with a bullish run. Many XRP holders were riding high on this uptrend, but now it’s over, and they are seeking the best crypto coin to buy for more significant profits. A new project drawing massive interest from investors is Remittix, a fast-rising PayFi project set to revolutionize the global payments industry. Inefficiencies, pricey fees, and inaccessibility have long plagued these payment systems. Remittix (RTX) aims to transform this sector with a project developed for real-world applications. Providing a bridge between blockchain and traditional finance, Remittix is attracting interest in solving these challenges head-on while providing global practical value for users. This article details how the Ripple price and the Remittix platform are expected to perform in Q1 2025. Analysts Predict Ripple Price Dump Amid Legal Battle Latest crypto news headlines reveal a new phase in Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC. Ripple’s developers and investors assumed they were out of trouble, having gained a victory through an important ruling. However, the SEC has now appealed this verdict, with new briefs opening soon. According to crypto news, this latest twist in the legal battle could potentially affect Ripple pricejourney toward stability in recent days. This legal tension makes it difficult to forecast Ripple price trajectory. Meanwhile, Ripple price recent decline leaves worrying signs. Analysts believe if selling pressure continues and buyers remain uncertain, Ripple price could plummet below the critical $2.45 support. Several traders expect a bounce at that level, but that will not happen if demand doesn’t improve. Regardless, the possibility of renewed investor confidence or the market getting bullish could inspire a Ripple price surge toward its all-time high of $3.41. But with recent crypto news, the mood around XRP remains cautious, and analysts stay attentive. This tension is precisely why savvy investors tip Remittix over Ripple as the best crypto coin to buy. Experts Assess Remittix (RTX) and Its Promising Potential Remittix (RTX) is a top PayFi project seeking to simplify cross-border payments by facilitating crypto-to-fiat conversion and global payments. Early adopters find this concept appealing as it takes away the huge fees and processing delays that commonly plague traditional remittances. By solving this real-life problem, Remittix (RTX) is primed for a broader user base than many other tokens. Moreover, Remittix’s presale success clearly shows the project’s impending surge. With more than $8.4 million raised and 390 million tokens sold in just four weeks, experts believe Remittixwill be a successful addition to investors’ portfolios as it continues to go from strength to strength. This backing explains why some long-term Ripple (XRP) holders have jumped ship, hoping to make the most of a newer project set to outshine the XRP coin this year. Though Ripple price actions have always made it a top pick for many crypto portfolios, experts now warn of impending dumps that could rattle the digital asset. Many traders now believe Remittix is the best crypto coin to buy to survive Ripple’s impending dump. They prefer Remittix (RTX) for its real-world payment approach and ongoing presale success. Whether the Ripple price recovers or declines further remains uncertain. Still, the ongoing transition to Remittix (RTX) emphasizes how quickly market sentiment can change. Experts remain confident that this new altcoin can outperform the more established XRP coin. Now is the time to get on board! Join the presale and community now!

Is New Competitor A Diamond In Your Portfolio,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/why-has-xrp-grown-so-much-in-the-last-few-months-is-new-competitor-a-diamond-in-your-portfolio,"Ripple (XRP) remains one of the top crypto investments, and has experienced shocking growth in the past month. This has increased investor confidence, and also directed whales to other altcoins also offering top growth. One of these is 1Fuel (OFT) . A new cryptocurrency in its presale, 1Fuel OFT has shown great promise right from an early stage. Its DeFi ecosystem makes it an interesting investment to watch this year, especially for those who want high returns. XRP’s Growth Trajectory Shocks Investors Ripple’s (XRP) growth in the last few months has left investors excited for what is coming. Ranked as one of the leading crypto investments out there, XRP has achieved a whopping 41.30% growth in the past month alone. For a more short-term outlook, you can see that it’s up by 0.26% in the past seven days and 10.37% in 24 hours. As XRP continues to soar, it is gaining the interest of many investors including Ledger and Core Wallet holders. Its current value is $3.08 but some really optimistic investors are setting their price target at $15. Others are more conservative, expecting it to increase to $5 or surpass this level in 2025. New Altcoin Reveals Impressive Potential in 2025 Although XRP has grown in the past months, investors are interested in 1Fuel (OFT), which has an even better potential this year. 1Fuel stands as a top new altcoin in the crypto space, and is backed by a reliable DEX wallet which offers an edge over names like Ledger and Core Wallet. This has attracted many investors to the presale stage, as it has already sold over 160 million tokens in record time.. What’s more, 1Fuel has raised over $1.6 million, another proof of investor confidence. The presale price is currently $0.017 although it is expected to rise in the next stage. With analysts predicting 88x growth for 1Fuel this year, much higher than that of Ripple, investors have been accumulating the OFT token in the past weeks. 1Fuel (OFT) Stands Out with DeFi Ecosystem 1Fuel’s (OFT) growth potential is not a coincidence but is made possible with its robust DEX wallet, which is the center of its DeFi ecosystem. As an all-in-one cryptocurrency wallet and exchange, 1Fuel is positioned as a reliable investment for those who want a top new altcoin. The crypto wallet supports cross-chain transactions, which allows investors to interact with multiple blockchains from a single wallet. These transactions are completed with a single click, which makes 1Fuel a strong contender to wallets like Ledger and Core Wallet. 1Fuel is changing digital asset management as we know it, and supports crypto debit and credit cards which can be used for real life payments, P2P exchange and AI tools. It also features a cold storage and privacy mixer, anonymizing transactions in a way platforms like Ledger and Core Wallet can’t. The 1Fuel DeFi ecosystem is attracting the attention of many traders, making it a leading crypto investment for 2025. Due to this ecosystem, 1Fuel (OFT) might just grow by 88x this year. Join Investors to Accumulate 1Fuel OFT Crypto whales, including Ripple investors, are taking advantage of the low presale price to buy 1Fuel (OFT) ahead of its public listing. With positive analyst predictions, 1Fuel might just dominate the crypto space this year, and investors are looking out for its DEX wallet features. The 1Fuel presale is the best chance to make your investment before the price increases again.

Remittix (RTX), a fresh contender in the market, is making headlines with its groundbreaking crypto presale, while established players like Cardano (ADA) continue on their own paths. Having secured over $9 million from its presale, industry experts suggest that Remittix is on track to outpace well-known cryptocurrencies like Cardano (ADA). Read on to discover why it may be a smarter investment than Cardano. Expert Insights: Cardano’s Price Drop Could Be Near Cardano's price trends have always intrigued technical analysts, and the latest patterns present a mixed scenario. Earlier this month, ADA hit a double bottom at $0.882, triggering a brief upward surge to $1.16. However, this momentum didn't last; a double-top pattern emerged at $1.152, with a critical support level at $0.882 forming the neckline. A bearish cross between the 50-day and 100-day moving averages adds to the looming negative sentiment. Cardano has also slipped below the $1 psychological threshold, often a precursor to further declines. If the price breaks $0.882, the next target could be $0.762, marking a 20% drop from current levels. Remittix Positioned for Significant Expansion Remittix (RTX) is transforming global payments by combining blockchain technology with traditional fiat transactions, offering efficient and fast cross-border solutions. Supporting over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, the platform allows instant conversion to fiat currencies such as USD and GBP, facilitating direct deposits into recipients' bank accounts. By bridging the gap between crypto and fiat, Remittix surpasses conventional payment giants like Stripe and Wise and crypto-only systems like Coinbase Wallet. With support for more than 30 fiat currencies and over 50 cryptocurrency pairs, Remittix promotes inclusivity and accessibility for both businesses and individuals, streamlining global trade with its wide array of options. Moreover, the platform's straightforward flat-fee model offers cost savings and transparency compared to the high fees and poor exchange rates typical of traditional banks. This model ensures that the full amount reaches the recipient, positioning Remittix as a disruptive force in a payment industry often plagued by dubious practices. Currently available at $0.0418 during its presale, the RTX token represents an enticing investment opportunity. Projections indicate substantial growth, with an anticipated 25x increase during the presale and potential gains exceeding 5,000% post-launch, as demand for cutting-edge cross-border payment solutions continues to escalate. Remittix provides investors a chance to engage with a project exhibiting strong growth potential from an early stage as the cryptocurrency market progresses. RTX may not only match the success of leading altcoins but also redefine standards for blockchain-based financial solutions with rising adoption, a robust foundation, and clear market demand.

With its innovative crypto presale, Remittix (RTX), a new player, is creating waves as well-known cryptocurrencies like Cardano (ADA) navigate their own courses. After raising over $9 million in presale funds, experts believe Remittix will outperform established players like Cardano (ADA). Read in to learn why it is a better investment than Cardano. Expert Analysis: Cardano’s Price Decline is Imminent Technical analysts have long delighted in examining Cardano's price research, and recent trends seem to create a mixed picture. ADA made a double bottom earlier this month at $0.882, which sparked off a positive turnaround that briefly drove the price to $1.16. Still, the momentum was short lived; by $1.152, a double-top pattern developed with the neckline anchored by a pivotal support level of $0.882. The emergence of a bearish crossing between the 50-day and 100-day moving averages accentuates the forebative atmosphere. Cardano has also fallen below the psychological $1 level, which has always been a sign of upcoming declines. Should the price breach $0.882, the next stop, a 20% drop from the current levels, would be $0.762. Remittix is Set for Explosive Growth Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by integrating blockchain technology with fiat transactions, offering fast and cost-efficient cross-border solutions. With support for over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, the platform provides instant conversions into fiat currencies like USD and GBP, enabling seamless deposits into recipients' bank accounts. As a bridge between crypto and fiat, Remittix is the superior counterpart to traditional payment providers such as Stripe and Wise and crypto-exclusive platforms like Coinbase Wallet. Supporting 30+ fiat currencies and over 50 crypto pairs, Remittix ensures accessibility and inclusivity for businesses and individuals, simplifying global commerce with its extensive range of options. Furthermore notable is the platform's open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over exorbitant costs and inadequate exchange rates of conventional banks. This approach guarantees that the full amount sent reaches the recipient, making Remittix a game-changer in the payments industry, where shady practices are unfortunately all too common. Currently priced at $0.0418 during its presale, the RTX token offers a compelling investment opportunity. Forecasts predict significant growth, with a 25x multiplier expected in the presale phase and over 5,000% gains after launch, as demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions continues to rise. Remittix offers investors a chance to interact with a project with high growth potential at an earlier stage as the bitcoin market develops. RTX might not only equal the success of other top altcoins but also alter the benchmarks for blockchain-based financial solutions with increasing acceptance, a solid basis, and evident market demand.

With its presale already raising $1.5 million in just days, 1Fuel is quickly gaining traction as a top DeFi contender. Offering cutting-edge features like cross-chain transactions and AI-driven asset management, 1Fuel attracts retail traders and whale investors. Could 1Fuel’s upcoming listing be the next big move for DOGE gamblers seeking massive returns? Dogecoin could rally to $1 by Q1 2025 Dogecoin peaked above $0.40 before consolidating at approximately $0.33. The meme token’s market cap exceeded $50.7 billion in the last thirty days and has gained over 4% in value. Analyst Ali Martinez shared a chart suggesting Dogecoin might soon break out from a multi-year ascending channel. Martinez tipped a price target of $15, 30 times its current value. However, most traders think Dogecoin will hit $1 by the first quarter of 2025. The return of President Donald Trump to the White House has raised speculation regarding much more crypto-friendly laws that may increase the functionality of meme coins like Dogecoin. Elon Musk remains one of Dogecoin's biggest fans. As its most prominent advocate, his influence on the meme coin is undeniable. With Musk starting his term in the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), analysts believe Dogecoin could exceed expectations in the coming years. Elon’s DOGE gamblers are rushing to 1Fuel After Dogecoin's abysmal market performance, Elon’s DOGE gamblers are shifting focus to the 1Fuel (OFT) presale for big returns. 1Fuel garners attention with its innovative DeFi and digital asset management solutions.

The platform’s privacy mixer ensures complete anonymity for every transaction, supported by disposable wallets and military-grade cold storage. These features provide more protection than traditional privacy tools like Ledger and Core Wallet, giving users confidence in a secure transaction environment. 1Fuel’s storage functionality is just one aspect of its transformative approach to crypto asset management. The platform also offers a crypto debit and credit card for instant fiat exchanges, a peer-to-peer exchange for direct transfers, and AI-powered asset management tools. These features create a versatile, robust solution that appeals to investors seeking convenience and advanced functionality. 1Fuel could be the best ICO project in 2025 Whale investors are turning to 1Fuel for its high-profit potential in the rapidly growing DeFi sector. The ongoing presale sold over 160 million tokens and raised over $1.5 million. Analysts predict that 1Fuel’s price could surge 100x after launch, making its current low price of $0.017 a steal for early backers.

With projections of 30,000% returns by 2025, the AI token has become the focal point of investors seeking exponential growth. Its groundbreaking features, coupled with a fast-selling presale, are fueling its rise to prominence. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Future Of AI Tokens According To Goldman Sachs Analysts The Goldman Sachs analysts’ bold prediction that WallitIQ (WLTQ) will surpass Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) to deliver 30,000% returns by 2025 has sent shockwaves across the crypto community. The prediction hinges on observed facts. At just $0.0420 , the AI token’s presale offers an entry price that’s hard to ignore, especially as early investors will enjoy 406.5% ROI at its launch. Long-term projections further point to a staggering 30,000% growth in Q1 2025. This jaw-dropping potential attracts Goldman Sachs analysts, institutional investors, and retail traders alike, all eager to be part of the next big thing in crypto. While Solana (SOL) currently trades around $247.52 due to market volatility, analysts believe its high-speed blockchain capabilities could push it past $500 in the coming years. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, surged from just $10 in 2016 to a peak of $4,878 in November 2021 and is now trading near $3,199 . Analysts believe it has the potential to cross the $5,000 mark. However, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) unique AI utility and innovative features give it a noticeable edge as Goldman Sachs analysts predict. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale: Redefining Crypto Investments WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) presale is a resounding success, having raised $7 million and gearing towards its $4.5 million third-stage target. Starting at $0.0171, the price has climbed to $0.0420 , delivering 71.43% growth. Early adopters are already celebrating 261% profit gains, and the fourth stage promises an additional 48.15% jump, taking the price to $0.0620. The presale is on track to sell out, with Goldman Sachs analysts predicting a market debut price of $0.15. This trajectory means early investors will enjoy 406.5% returns upon launch, with long-term forecasts pointing to 30,000% growth. What drives this success? The recently announced MVP build of WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App is one of the key differentiators. The app offers an intuitive interface and powerful Wallet Management tools. It simulates the management of ETH and USDT wallets and instant crypto transfers to external addresses. The platform’s Scan & Pay QR feature , which displays QR codes for a user’s receiving wallet address, makes the Goldman Sachs analysts’ confidence in the AI token’s ability to outperform Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) unsurprising. Another feature is the Live Market Data that caters to real-time price tracking powered by the CoinGecko API , with interactive candlestick charts for trend analysis across multiple timeframes. These features, coupled with WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) SolidProof audit , highlight its commitment to practicality, innovation, transparency, and security. They make it a standout among AI tokens and a worthy rival to giants like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH), as indicated by Goldman Sachs analysts. Its ability to raise $7 million and deliver 261% returns during the presale underscores the AI token’s market potential. With projections of 30,000% growth by 2025, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is on track to redefine the crypto landscape and outpace heavyweights like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH). Secure Your Stake in WallitIQ (WLTQ) an AI Token With Unparalleled Growth Potential The crypto market is buzzing with Goldman Sachs analysts’ prediction that WallitIQ (WLTQ) will deliver 30,000% returns by 2025, surpassing Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) in the process. Currently priced at $0.0420 in its third presale stage, this AI token offers investors a rare opportunity to secure life-changing gains. Waiting for the fourth stage’s price jump to $0.0620 is delaying your chance at success. Join the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale today and be part of the future of crypto.

Currently trading at $0.13 , the Kaspa price has experienced a steady increase over the last year. Analysts believe its innovative technology and growing adoption are the driving forces behind this growth. Kaspa also boasts an active community and significant mining activity, with a hashrate exceeding 1.26 EH/s. These metrics highlight the network’s strength and reliability. In terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), Kaspa is expanding its ecosystem with Wrapped Kaspa (wKAS), which bridges Kaspa to Polygon and Binance Smart Chain. This integration is a game-changer, enabling interoperability and potentially boosting the Kaspa price as more users leverage the network. Web3Bay: Revolutionizing Decentralized E-Commerce While Kaspa focuses on revolutionizing blockchain technology, Web3Bay is tackling inefficiencies in traditional e-commerce. Built on blockchain, Web3Bay eliminates high fees, ensures transparency, and offers users complete control over their data. The platform’s hybrid payment system allows seamless transactions using both cryptocurrencies and fiat options, such as PayPal and Apple Pay. One of the most exciting aspects of Web3Bay is its 3BAY token , which powers the ecosystem. Early investors have flocked to the ongoing presale, which has raised over $830,000 and sold more than 250 million tokens at a price of $0.004562 . With a projected launch price of $0.1959 , investors are eyeing a staggering 6,340% ROI . Web3Bay’s roadmap includes NFT marketplaces, staking rewards, and decentralized governance, making it a comprehensive solution for the future of online shopping. Comparing the Growth Potential Both Kaspa and Web3Bay offer immense growth potential, but their approaches and use cases differ. Kaspa is ideal for those looking to invest in cutting-edge blockchain technology. Its ability to process transactions quickly and securely makes it a strong candidate for adoption in various industries, from financial services to supply chain management. On the other hand, Web3Bay appeals to investors seeking real-world utility in a market they understand—e-commerce. With the global e-commerce market projected to reach $8.1 trillion by 2026 , Web3Bay’s decentralized approach could disrupt the industry in much the same way Amazon did two decades ago. Investors are particularly drawn to Web3Bay’s community-driven governance model. Token holders will have a say in shaping the platform’s future, ensuring that it remains aligned with user needs. This level of empowerment is rare in the crypto space and adds to the platform’s appeal. Kaspa Price Prediction for 2025 The Kaspa price has shown resilience despite recent market fluctuations. Analysts predict that its unique blockDAG technology and growing adoption could push the price to $0.50–$0.75 by the end of 2025. The introduction of Wrapped Kaspa is expected to further enhance its ecosystem, attracting more developers and users. However, like all cryptocurrencies, Kaspa is not without risks. Short-term volatility and market sentiment could impact its price. That said, its innovative architecture gives it a competitive edge, making it a solid long-term investment for those who believe in its vision. Why Web3Bay Is a Must-Watch Project While Kaspa’s growth potential is rooted in its technological innovation, Web3Bay is driven by its ability to solve real-world problems. The platform’s use of Layer-2 rollups ensures fast and cost-efficient transactions, addressing one of the biggest challenges in e-commerce today. Web3Bay’s presale success is a testament to its strong investor confidence. As the platform transitions into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), it will empower users to shape its future, making it a true community-driven project. Early investors stand to benefit significantly from the token’s projected ROI, making Web3Bay one of the most exciting opportunities in the crypto market. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Both Projects The Kaspa price and Web3Bay’s presale performance highlight the immense potential of these projects. While Kaspa offers cutting-edge technology for blockchain enthusiasts, Web3Bay provides a practical solution for e-commerce challenges, appealing to a broader audience. Both projects are poised for significant growth in 2025 and beyond. Kaspa’s innovative blockDAG architecture and Web3Bay’s disruptive approach to online shopping make them standout investments. For those looking to diversify their portfolios, these two projects offer a blend of technology and utility that could redefine their respective industries.

Bitcoin MPI Has Seen Its 90-Day MA Cross Above The 365-Day As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin MPI momentum has recently given a bullish signal for Bitcoin. The “MPI” refers to an on-chain metric that keeps track of the ratio between the total miner outflow and its 365-day moving average (MA). Related Reading: $54 Million In Dogecoin Exits Binance As Price Crashes 9%: Sign Of Buying? The miner outflow here is naturally the amount of the cryptocurrency (in USD) that is being transferred out of the wallets associated with the network’s validators. When the value of the MPI is high, it means the miners are making more outflows than usual. Generally, the main reason why this cohort transfers tokens out of its wallets is for selling-related purposes, so this kind of trend can be bearish for the asset’s price. On the other hand, the indicator being low suggests the miners are withdrawing a lower number of coins than the average for the past year. Such a trend could be a sign that this group is preferring to hold for now. In the context of the current topic, the Bitcoin MPI itself isn’t of interest, but rather a derivative indicator known as the MPI Momentum. Like other momentum metrics, this one also involves two MAs: 90-day and 365-day. Below is a chart for the BTC MPI Momentum over the past few years. As displayed in the graph, the 90-day MA of the Bitcoin MPI recently broke above the 365-day one. This suggests miner selling has been gaining positive momentum. While this may sound bad, the cryptocurrency has actually historically benefited from the pattern. From the chart, it’s apparent that the crossover generally signals the start of an extended bullish period for the asset’s price. The last time that the two MAs of the MPI displayed this trend before the latest instance was back in December 2022. Related Reading: Solana Plunges 12%, But This Pattern Could Mean Decline Isn’t Over Yet So far since the most recent crossover, the 90-day and 365-day MAs have continued to diverge away from each other, implying that the momentum in the metric remains strong. Bitcoin has usually only hit tops when the 90-day has gained a large amount of distance over the 365-day. Thus, considering the current placement of the two lines, it’s possible that the cryptocurrency has some room remaining in this cycle, before miner selloff leads to a top. BTC Price Bitcoin fell towards the $98,000 mark during yesterday’s crash, but the asset appears to have found a rebound since then as it’s now back at $102,500.

Bitcoin (BTC) changed the game for early investors, delivering life-changing returns, and Solana (SOL) is recognized for its exceptional scalability. Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin in the market, is grabbing headlines with predictions of 55,000% growth potential. Having raised $1 million during its presale in minutes, it’s being closely watched by experts who see it as the next breakout token alongside top contenders. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is Creating a Buzz 1. Fresh Entry, Massive Upside Being new to the market, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers a rare opportunity to invest before its value skyrockets. Early investors stand to benefit from the kind of exponential returns only seen in the early days of tokens like SOL and XRP. 2. Exceptional Presale Success The presale success of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN , raising $1 million almost instantly, is a clear indicator of its high demand and market appeal. Its early momentum positions it as a leader among emerging cryptos. 3. Exclusivity Fuels Demand Unlike XRP, LINK, and DOT, which are widely available across exchanges, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively sold at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This controlled access ensures scarcity, increasing its value for early adopters. How It Stands Against Competitors XRP: Dominates payments but lacks the early-stage growth potential of this new coin. Solana (SOL): Scalable and fast, but its growth is already stabilizing compared to this fresh token. Chainlink (LINK): Strong in decentralized oracles but can’t match the excitement surrounding THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An emerging project, but its momentum falls short of this token’s presale success. Don’t Miss This Game-Changing Opportunity With experts predicting up to 55,000% gains, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is becoming the most talked-about crypto of 2025. Its record-breaking presale, exclusivity, and high-growth potential make it a must-watch token alongside Solana. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and join the revolution!

Amid this whirlwind of innovation, three names are turning heads: Qubetics, Sonic, and Solana. These aren’t just digital currencies; they’re the backbone of a technological evolution that’s changing how we think about finance, data, and global connectivity. What makes these projects stand out? Each tackles unique challenges with creative solutions. Whether it’s Qubetics solving blockchain interoperability issues, Sonic spearheading decentralized finance, or Solana pushing transaction speeds to new limits, these cryptos offer massive growth potential for investors and enthusiasts alike. Among these powerhouses, Qubetics is stealing the spotlight. Its presale is a runaway success, already selling over 449 million tokens to more than 16,900 holders and raising $11.2 million. But it’s not just about numbers. With game-changing interoperability features and the upcoming Test Net launch, Qubetics is shaping the future of blockchain technology in a way that older systems couldn’t. Qubetics: Redefining Blockchain with Unmatched Interoperability Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project—it’s a movement. With interoperability as its core feature, Qubetics connects diverse blockchain networks seamlessly. This isn’t a minor convenience; it’s a fundamental shift in how blockchains communicate. Imagine sending assets or data from one network to another without intermediaries, delays, or compatibility issues. That’s the power of Qubetics . Consider real-world scenarios: A multinational corporation operates on multiple blockchains for supply chain management, payment processing, and customer loyalty programs. Qubetics’ interoperability lets these networks work together, streamlining operations and cutting costs. Or think about developers—they can create dApps that interact with various blockchains without learning different coding languages for each. It’s like having a universal translator for blockchain. The ongoing presale is the perfect entry point. At $0.0606 per token, $TICS is accessible to anyone looking to get in on the ground floor of a transformative project. With its interoperability focus, Test Net launch, and growing adoption, Qubetics is poised to be one of the top cryptos for massive growth. Sonic: The DeFi Powerhouse Revolutionizing Finance If decentralized finance (DeFi) is the future, Sonic is the architect. This crypto project is laser-focused on creating a robust, accessible, and user-friendly DeFi ecosystem. Sonic’s platform offers lending, borrowing, staking, and yield farming, all designed with an intuitive interface that even crypto newcomers can navigate. Why is Sonic making waves? It’s all about accessibility and innovation. Picture a small business owner who wants to secure a loan without dealing with traditional banks. Sonic’s DeFi platform enables peer-to-peer lending, cutting out middlemen and reducing costs. Investors, meanwhile, can earn passive income through staking and yield farming, creating financial opportunities that traditional markets can’t match. Sonic’s community-driven governance is another highlight. Token holders can vote on platform updates, ensuring the ecosystem evolves in line with user needs. This decentralized approach fosters trust and engagement, making Sonic a standout in the crowded DeFi space. As DeFi adoption grows, Sonic’s user-friendly platform and innovative features position it as a leader in the field. For those seeking a crypto with real-world applications and growth potential, Sonic is a name to watch. Solana: The Speed Demon of Blockchain Speed is Solana’s calling card. This high-performance blockchain has redefined what’s possible in terms of transaction throughput, processing over 65,000 transactions per second. For comparison, Ethereum handles around 15 transactions per second, highlighting Solana’s game-changing capabilities. Imagine you’re an NFT collector participating in a hotly anticipated drop. On slower networks, delays or failed transactions can ruin the experience. With Solana, transactions are lightning-fast, ensuring you secure that coveted piece of digital art. Developers building dApps for gaming, finance, or other high-demand industries also benefit from Solana’s speed and efficiency. Solana’s scalability is another key advantage. While many blockchains struggle with network congestion, Solana’s architecture ensures consistent performance, even under heavy loads. This reliability makes it a go-to platform for projects that demand speed and scalability. From decentralized exchanges to NFT marketplaces, Solana’s ecosystem is thriving. Its commitment to speed, efficiency, and developer support makes it a top contender for massive growth in the crypto space. Interoperability: The Future of Blockchain Connectivity Interoperability isn’t just a buzzword; it’s the backbone of blockchain’s next evolution. Qubetics is leading the charge with a system that allows different blockchains to communicate effortlessly. This isn’t just about convenience—it’s about unlocking new possibilities. Think about cross-border payments. Traditional systems are slow and expensive, while blockchain promises speed and transparency. But when blockchains can’t talk to each other, the process hits a wall. Qubetics breaks down these barriers, enabling seamless transactions across networks. For businesses, this means faster settlements and lower costs. For individuals, it’s a more inclusive financial system. Qubetics’ interoperability also fuels innovation. Developers can build dApps that pull data or assets from multiple networks, creating richer, more versatile applications. It’s a game-changer for industries ranging from healthcare to supply chain management, where data integration is critical. Conclusion: The Time to Act Is Now Qubetics, Sonic, and Solana aren’t just cryptos; they’re catalysts for massive growth and innovation. Each project addresses unique challenges, offering solutions that set them apart in a crowded market. Whether it’s Qubetics’ interoperability, Sonic’s DeFi revolution, or Solana’s unmatched speed, these cryptos are shaping the future of blockchain. Qubetics’ presale is a golden opportunity. With over $11.2 million raised and 449 million tokens sold, it’s clear that investors recognize its potential. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this groundbreaking project. Visit the official site, join the presale, and position yourself for what could be the investment opportunity of a lifetime.

Trump Fuks DeepSeek (TRUMSEEK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMSEEK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Fuks DeepSeek can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fuks DeepSeek could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fuks DeepSeek launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fuks DeepSeek on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fuks DeepSeek by entering its contract address (CA) – 3QtYU6QPQPGbzHX9evKdxVHsoTnXyjUwY8xkaVnZ9QPc – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMSEEK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-29 02:33:00

While privacy coins like Toncoin and meme coins like Dogecoin have enjoyed their moments in the sun, investor attention seems to be pivoting toward Remittix (RTX), a game-changing blockchain platform with the potential to rival Ripple’s impact on global payments. Toncoin Rides Privacy Hype but Struggles to Hold Ground Toncoin (TON) recently crossed the $5 mark, fueled by significant events in the privacy coin sector. President Donald Trump’s pardon of Ross Ulbricht and the reversal of the Tornado Cash ban sent ripples through the market, spotlighting privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. Toncoin, created by the Telegram team, benefited from this surge of optimism, with whale investors reportedly snapping up $2.3 million worth of TON in the lead-up to these announcements. Despite these tailwinds, Toncoin’s rally appears precarious. While the coin’s double-bottom pattern hints at a possible 45% rally to $7.70, a bearish reversal looms if it dips below $5.30. The privacy coin cryptocurrency market trends are inherently volatile which makes TON’s future uncertain, leaving investors searching for more stable, high-growth opportunities. Dogecoin Faces Market Uncertainty Amid DOGE ETF Filing Dogecoin (DOGE), formerly the cryptocurrency world’s darling, has seen a sharp decline in value, dropping 6% in a single day. Optimism surrounding recent DOGE ETF filings has failed to translate into sustained price momentum. Adding to the bearish sentiment, the removal of Shiba Inu imagery from the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) website, a surprising nod to the meme coin, has left many Dogecoin enthusiasts disheartened. The D.O.G.E. ETF filings by major players like Bitwise and REXShares initially sparked excitement, with some analysts predicting DOGE could soar to $15. However, the removal of visual ties to its mascot and a steep 75% drop in trading volume signal waning interest. Even with predictions of short-term recovery to $0.39, Dogecoin’s long-term prospects remain clouded by uncertainty. Remittix, The 50x Gem Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments Remittix (RTX) has become a strong contender that has the potential to revolutionize international payments as Toncoin and Dogecoin struggle. Through the integration of blockchain technology with conventional currency systems, Remittix provides a smooth and economical way to conduct cross-border transactions. Over 40 cryptocurrencies are supported by RTX, including Ethereum, Cardano, and Dogecoin. Funds are put straight into recipients’ bank accounts and may be instantly converted into fiat currencies like USD and GBP. Slow transaction times and exorbitant costs are two major issues facing the remittance sector that this invention attempts to solve. Remittix is drawing interest from investors looking for a business with significant development potential due to its distinctive combination of speed, efficiency, and interoperability with numerous cryptocurrencies. Because it focuses on facilitating financial inclusion and cross-border solutions, early adopters have compared Remittix to Ripple (XRP). With the remittance market worth over $600 billion a year, Remittix’s ability to upend the status quo makes it a unique project with substantial long-term potential. Ripple XRP Maintains Its Momentum With a 530% surge in price after Donald Trump’s election victory, Ripple (XRP) has become a hot topic. The growing use of rIPPLE XRP’s stablecoin, RLUSD, and its partnerships with financial institutions further increase its use. Despite ongoing regulatory challenges, rIPPLE XRP has performed better than most, and many investors have staked their money on its long-term viability. However, compared to up-and-coming initiatives like Remittix, Ripple’s high price and established market position may limit its potential for explosive development because of its emphasis on institutional use cases. Investors Eye the Next Big Opportunity The cryptocurrency market trends’ evolving dynamics show the need for innovation and adaptation. While Toncoin and Dogecoin struggle to sustain their pace, Remittix has emerged as a viable challenger, with a daring vision for the future of global payments. With its state-of-the-art technology, broad cryptocurrency support, and focus on efficiency, Remittix has established itself as a high-growth potential that could surpass even well-established rivals like Ripple.

BTC is facing resistance at $103,000 and might aim for an upside break. Bitcoin started a decent upward move above the $100,000 zone. The price is trading below $103,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $102,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another decline if it stays below the $103,000 zone. Bitcoin Price Holds Support Bitcoin price started a fresh decline below the $103,000 and $102,500 levels. BTC even dipped below the $100,000 level before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $97,688 and the price is now correcting losses. There was a move above the $99,800 and $100,500 levels. The bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $107,080 swing high to the $97,688 low. However, the bears are active near the $103,000 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $102,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin price is now trading below $103,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $102,500 level.

The next key resistance could be $103,500 and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $107,080 swing high to the $97,688 low. A close above the $103,500 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $105,000 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $107,000 level. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $103,000 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $101,200 level. The first major support is near the $100,500 level. The next support is now near the $100,000 zone.

One such story is that of Book of Meme, a cryptocurrency that started humbly but skyrocketed into the stratosphere. In its early days, few believed in its potential. But those who did? They’re now reaping massive gains, basking in their foresight, while others are left wishing they had jumped in at the ground level. The question is: What if another chance like that comes along? Meet Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), one of the top new meme coins to invest in this week, currently making waves with its unique presale structure and sky-high ROI potential. If you’re among those who missed the early days of Book of Meme, Arctic Pablo might just be your redemption story. Book of Meme: The Missed Opportunity That Still Haunts Investors When Book of Meme first launched, few could have imagined it would achieve its heights today. Back then, the coin traded at mere fractions of a cent—around $0.00002. Many dismissed it as “just another meme coin,” a risky gamble in a volatile market. However, a small but savvy group of investors saw its potential. They believed in its quirky branding, community-first approach, and viral appeal. Fast forward to today, and those same investors are now sitting on life-changing returns. With its value surging over 1,000,000% from its early days, Book of Meme proved that the right meme coin at the right time can deliver jaw-dropping gains. But here’s the thing: missed opportunities don’t define you. Learning from them does. And right now, Arctic Pablo presents a strikingly similar chance to get in on the ground floor of what could be the next big crypto success story. Arctic Pablo: A Presale Adventure Packed with Potential While Book of Meme is a “what could have been,” Arctic Pablo is your fresh opportunity. Unlike traditional presales that roll out in stages, Arctic Pablo takes a storytelling approach, tying its presale phases to different locations in its adventurous narrative. Currently, the presale is in Glacier Grove , with the token priced at an accessible $0.000043. For those wondering why Arctic Pablo is one of the top new meme coins to invest in this week, let’s break it down: Massive ROI Potential: By the time the token’s launch price of $0.008 hits, early adopters could see a staggering 18,546% ROI. Staking and Rewards: During the presale, investors enjoy an impressive 66% APY, with opportunities to earn rewards by staking tokens or participating in referral programs. Deflationary Mechanism: Unsold tokens are permanently burned weekly, reducing supply and boosting scarcity—a win for long-term holders. Community Competitions: Active participation in the Arctic Pablo community comes with rewards, whether in APC tokens or USD. These features don’t just set Arctic Pablo apart—they create excitement and anticipation, drawing in investors who recognize its potential to be the next big thing. Why Arctic Pablo Stands Out as One of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in This Week Arctic Pablo isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a movement. With its adventurous theme and unique approach to presale, it bridges the gap between myth and reality, capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts. The narrative element—tying presale phases to locations like Glacier Grove—keeps investors engaged while building a story around the token. Additionally, the presale is already making waves, with over $550,000 raised so far. Compare this to Book of Meme’s early days, and it’s clear that Arctic Pablo has hit the ground running. By the time the presale concludes at a final price of $0.0008, those who got in early will already be sitting on gains. And once it launches at $0.008, the growth trajectory could mirror—or even surpass—that of early meme coin successes. What’s Next for Arctic Pablo? The current presale location, Glacier Grove, is just one stop on Arctic Pablo’s exciting journey. As the presale progresses, the coin’s value and community buzz continue to grow. But here’s the kicker: tokens become increasingly scarce thanks to the deflationary burn mechanism. The longer you wait, the more you risk losing a lucrative entry point. Arctic Pablo is one of the top new meme coins to invest in this week , with every element—from its pricing to its ROI potential—crafted to maximize value for early investors. If you missed Book of Meme, Arctic Pablo might be your second chance to turn small investments into substantial gains. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Arctic Pablo – Your Next Big Opportunity Awaits Book of Meme taught us that early belief in a project can lead to monumental returns. While the regret of missing that chance stings, Arctic Pablo offers a fresh opportunity to rewrite the story. With its innovative presale structure, deflationary mechanics, and a promising ROI that could rival the greats, Arctic Pablo stands out among the top new meme coins to invest in this week. So, the question is: Will you let this chance slip by, or will you grab it and secure your spot in what could be the next big meme coin success story? Don’t wait too long—opportunities like Arctic Pablo don’t stay on the ground floor forever.

Recently, a crypto billionaire has brought attention to two notable ventures: Dogecoin (DOGE), the popular meme coin, and Lightchain AI , an innovative project combining blockchain and artificial intelligence. Currently in its presale stage at $0.005625 per token, Lightchain AI has already secured $12.8 million in funding, reflecting significant investor enthusiasm. This combination marks a shift in blockchain investment, merging widespread appeal with advanced technology to drive future success. Why Dogecoin Continues to Attract Billionaire Investors Dogecoin continues to captivate billionaire investors due to its unique blend of community-driven appeal and high-profile endorsements. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has been a prominent advocate, frequently expressing support that has significantly influenced Dogecoin’s market performance. The cryptocurrency’s lighthearted origin and widespread recognition have fostered a robust community, enhancing its attractiveness as a speculative asset. Additionally, Dogecoin’s increasing acceptance for transactions, including its use by companies like SpaceX, underscores its growing utility. The combination of influential backing, community enthusiasm, and expanding real-world applications makes Dogecoin a compelling choice for investors seeking both engagement and potential returns in the evolving crypto landscape. Lightchain AI- Next Big Opportunity in Blockchain Lightchain AI is revolutionizing blockchain technology with its forward-thinking innovations, making it a standout opportunity for investors. Its adaptive performance optimization ensures seamless AI-driven computations, addressing latency issues that traditional blockchains struggle with. The platform also pioneers real-time AI workflows, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) to execute complex tasks efficiently. Unlike many projects, Lightchain AI integrates dynamic resource allocation, optimizing network performance by allocating computational tasks based on complexity and node capacity. Its tokenomics emphasizes sustainability, with a balanced allocation of resources for staking rewards, development, and liquidity, fostering long-term growth. Additionally, its community-driven governance model ensures decisions align with collective goals. These groundbreaking features position Lightchain AI as a transformative force in blockchain, capturing investor attention for its innovative and practical approach. Lightchain AI is Golden Opportunity for Investors Lightchain AI is where two powerhouse technologies—blockchain and artificial intelligence—come together, creating an exciting opportunity for investors. With its unmatched versatility and scalability, this project is set to deliver impressive long-term returns. Right now, its presale price doesn’t reflect its true potential, making it the perfect moment to get in early and ride the wave of future growth. Even crypto heavyweights who backed Dogecoin are showing confidence in Lightchain AI, proving it’s more than just hype—it’s a game-changing venture. Combining cutting-edge innovation, strong community support, and real-world practicality, Lightchain AI is paving the way for a new era of blockchain investments.

The Russian Ministry of Finance in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Ludvig14 [CC BY-SA 3.0]) Media outlets say that the Central Bank wants to roll the coin out by early July this year, despite pushback from the nation’s commercial baking sector . Finance Minister Anton Siluanov first began speaking about his ministry’s intentions to test the CBDC’s budgetary capability over a year ago. The Central Bank says its testing “is ongoing.” It did not reveal any of the details of the pilot’s “budgetary” transactions. The Ministry of Finance has said that “so far” there are “no plans to make government payments to citizens” using the digital RUB. However, Siluanov has repeatedly talked up the use of the digital ruble to “ensure the targeted use of budget funds.” Two oil tankers hauling crude from Russia made U-turns as they sailed past France and are now at a standstill near the northern port of Cherbourg https://t.co/nYodJ1oMK7 — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) January 27, 2025 July Launch for Russia’s CBDC? Moscow officials have previously spoken about the coin’s potential in helping to eliminate public sector corruption. They also think they could mark or “color-code” certain digital ruble welfare payments to ensure citizens use government handouts correctly. This, they think, could help wipe out benefits fraud. Meanwhile, lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov, the head of the State Duma’s Committee on the Financial Markets, has suggested that the Chuvash Republic (Chuvashia) could become a major testbed for “budgetary”-themed digital RUB projects. Aksakov is the State Duma representative for the Cheboksary constituency in the Chuvash Republic, in the center of European Russia. The Chuvash Republic on a map of Russia. (Source: Marmelad [CC BY-SA 2.5]) The lawmaker is also the chief architect of Russia’s crypto, blockchain, and CBDC-related legislation.

Testing on the digital ruble started in August 2023. The Central Bank has since announced that all “systemically important credit institutions” (the nation’s biggest banks) will launch CBDC transactions “from July 1, 2025.” On December 4, 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his own intentions to ensure that Moscow begins using the digital ruble “in settlements within the federal budget” in 2025. Citizens Concerned About CBDC The Central Bank has previously urged citizens not to fear the digital RUB, despite multiple surveys demonstrating Russians’ distinct lack of appetite to adopt a CBDC. The Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina speaking in December 2024. (Source: Bank of Russia/YouTube/Screenshot) However, Putin, Moscow officials, and the Central Bank think they will be able to use the coin to trade with BRICS nations and other partners without the need for the US dollar. While the Finance Ministry believes Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoin payments can help Russian trade firms bypass US, UK, and EU-led sanctions, the Central Bank has long pursued a digital RUB-based solution instead. The bank says that the digital RUB will become Russia’s “third” form of currency, after cash rubles and “non-cash fiat.” The post Digital RUB: Moscow ‘Pilots Use of CBDC in Budgetary Payments’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|News|Central Bank Digital Currency|Russia,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-01-29 03:00:00

Recently, an analyst who made a massive profit by buying Solana (SOL) at its formative stage resurfaced to buy an AI token, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , which crypto experts believe has the potential to outperform Solana (SOL) by Q2 2025. Let’s discuss why Solana Price Dips Below All-Time High Solana (SOL) launched in 2020 as a fast, secure, scalable, developer-friendly blockchain platform. The blockchain platform sold its native token SOL to crypto community members in a public auction at $0.04, and soon its price rose to $0.22. Within this time, an analyst who saw its potential bought Solana (SOL) at that low price. In the first several hours of trading, Solana (SOL) hit an all-time high of $1.33, resulting in a massive yield for the analyst. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) continued to grow in value, reaching another all-time high of $259 in the crypto bull run of 2021. But Solana (SOL), alongside other assets in the crypto market, suffered a massive dip during the crypto winter that followed in 2022. However, by January 2025, Solana rallied to another all-time high of $293, making the analyst who bought the token around $0.11 a crypto millionaire. According to CoinGecko , Solana (SOL) has dipped to $247, ranking 5th in the crypto market, but before the dip, the analyst had taken profit and shifted attention to another token with the potential to make him a crypto billionaire. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Poised For Explosive Growth Amidst Presale As the climate began to turn bearish for Solana (SOL), the analyst shifted attention to WallitIQ (WLTQ) , which is currently offering its native token, WLTQ, at a low price of $0.0420 per coin to crypto community members. The analyst rushed into this presale, comparing how Solana (SOL) quickly rose from barely a dollar to $293. Thus, the analyst is confident that the token will surge to $10 by Q2 2025, surpassing Solana’s (SOL) gains. Several crypto market experts share the same sentiment with the analysts, even speculating a more ambitious prediction of $20 for the token. A surge to $20 will result in a 50,000% ROI for all early investors, including the analyst, making investors from all regions hurry to buy the token at its formative to secure their chances of profit. Aside from the ambitious prediction by crypto market experts on the platform’s native token, WallitIQ (WLTQ) also features an AI-powered crypto wallet designed to accommodate crypto experts and newbies with little or no knowledge of crypto wallets. The AI crypto wallet also has cool features like AI-driven smart suggestions, which take users to the next level, as AI algorithms offer recommendations and trading tips based on market conditions and individual wallet activities. In addition, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has unveiled an MVP launch of its crypto wallet management mobile app , which offers cooler features like simulated crypto trading and detailed transaction history for all wallet activities. WLTQ, the platform’s native token, will be instrumental in how both the platform and the mobile app operate, increasing their use cases and inherent value. However, everyone who buys and holds the native token will gain voting rights to participate in the platform’s governance. Aside from that, token holders who use the token as gas fees on the network will become eligible for discounts on their transactions. Conclusion Like Solana (SOL), the analyst is confident that he will profit massively from the WallitIQ (WLTQ) ecosystem by buying its native token in presale. Several other investors share this bullish sentiment, which is why millions of the tokens have already been sold. As a cherry on top, SolidProof , a world-renowned blockchain security firm, has thoroughly audited the platform’s smart contract, and the WLTQ token has been listed on Coinmarketcap. So, the analyst is calling on everyone to buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) today to secure their chances of becoming a crypto billionaire.

While Dogecoin (DOGE), the beloved memecoin, has captured the hearts of many, its recent price volatility has driven investors to find alternatives in the growing AI altcoin market. RCO Finance (RCOF) , a rising AI altcoin, stands out by offering stability and the potential for generational wealth. With its innovative features and strategic market positioning, RCOF is well-equipped to take advantage of the current Dogecoin price dynamics, presenting a compelling investment opportunity in the altcoin space. Dogecoin Price Faces Resistance Amid Market Turbulence The recent crypto market sell-off has dealt a significant blow to the memecoin sector, with Dogecoin (DOGE) facing sharp declines. The Dogecoin price dropped by 10.85% within 24 hours, settling at $0.3133, while SHIB mirrored the downturn with a 10.15% decline. This Dogecoin price drop comes as Bitcoin (BTC) briefly dipped below the $99,000 mark, triggering widespread liquidations of over $630 million, primarily impacting long positions. Market fear has been compounded by global economic concerns, including a looming Western stock market crash tied to China’s AI advancements. Dogecoin’s valuation, currently hovering at $99.8 billion, faces downward pressure as investor sentiment wavers. These developments have prompted traders to reconsider their positions in memecoins, with the AI altcoin market presenting prospects like RCO Finance , poised to take advantage of the shifting market dynamics and position itself as a next-generation wealth creator. RCO FInance (RCOF): Is it Time for AI Altcoins to Shine As the Dogecoin price faces hurdles, attention is gradually shifting toward innovative AI altcoins like RCO Finance.

The platform further distinguishes itself with its Automated Market Making (AMM) capabilities. By automating trade executions using AI and machine learning technologies, RCO Finance minimizes human error and emotional biases that often plague manual trading methods.

Prioritizing on security, the platform operates under a KYC-free policy, allowing users to engage in trading without compromising their anonymity. Coupled with regular audits conducted by SolidProof , RCOF ensures that user funds are safeguarded against potential threats.

ETH is now consolidating losses and might face resistance near the $3,200 zone. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $3,150 zone. The price is trading below $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,250 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start another decline if it stays below the $3,220 level. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price started a fresh decline below the $3,250 and $3,200 levels, like Bitcoin . ETH even declined below the $3,050 level before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $3,021 and the price recently corrected some losses . There was a move above the $3,120 and $3,150 levels. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,425 swing high to the $3,021 low. However, the bears were active near the $3,220 resistance. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,250 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,150 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,220 level, the trend line, and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,425 swing high to the $3,021 low. The main resistance is now forming near $3,270. A clear move above the $3,270 resistance might send the price toward the $3,350 resistance. An upside break above the $3,350 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,420 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,220 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,050 level. The first major support sits near the $3,020. A clear move below the $3,020 support might push the price toward the $3,000 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,950 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,880.

This marks a 2.3% increase over the past day. However, the asset remains in a state of overall decline, down 3.3% over the week. While this modest rebound offers some relief, Ethereum is still grappling with the effects of an overall bearish trend. The ongoing price movement has prompted some analysts to revisit Ethereum’s underlying on-chain metrics to understand what may lie ahead for the cryptocurrency. One key area of focus is Ethereum’s spot exchange reserves. According to a recent analysis by Cryptoavails, a contributor to the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, the total reserves of Ethereum held on spot exchanges have been steadily declining. This long-term trend points to a shift in how market participants are managing their holdings. Related Reading: Ethereum Foundation Sells Another 100 ETH, But There’s Still ‘Hopium’ For Holders Ethereum Spot Exchange Reserves Trend According to Cryptoavails, Ethereum reserves on spot exchanges have gone through significant changes over the years. During the 2017-2018 bull market, reserves reached their peak, driven by a surge in investor interest. The 2020-2021 period saw another substantial increase, fueled by the rise of the DeFi ecosystem and Ethereum-based projects. However, starting in late 2021, reserves began a sharp decline as large withdrawals from exchanges became more common. By 2023, reserve levels hit a low point, and by 2024, these reduced levels persisted, signaling a potential supply shortage. This reduction in reserves often indicates that holders are withdrawing Ethereum from exchanges for long-term storage, rather than leaving it available for immediate trading. As a result, the diminished supply on exchanges can create upward pressure on prices. Cryptoavails noted that from 2022 onward, as reserves decreased, Ethereum’s price started to stabilize at higher levels. This pattern suggests that low reserve levels could support further price increases, potentially triggering a new upward trend. Technical Analysis Of ETH From a technical standpoint, Ethereum has shown patterns that analysts interpret as bullish. Several prominent figures in the crypto community have shared their insights. One renowned analyst known as Crypto Ceaser recently highlighted a bounce in Ethereum’s price as a significant opportunity, expressing a view that the cryptocurrency is undervalued and may be poised to reach new all-time highs. $ETH – #Ethereum bounced as expected. This was a huge opportunity. Send it. In my opinion Ethereum is heavily undervalued. I think we will see new ATH’s soon. pic.twitter.com/ljMa1lEpJO — Crypto Caesar (@CryptoCaesarTA) January 28, 2025 However, not all analyses paint a uniformly optimistic picture. Anup Dhungana, another crypto analyst, pointed out a divergence between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s market behavior. While Bitcoin has maintained a steady uptrend, Ethereum’s performance against Bitcoin has been less robust, with the ETH/BTC pair forming lower lows. This divergence reflects reduced investor interest in Ethereum relative to other assets. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised To Test $2,800 Support Level If Market Downtrend Persists – Analyst According to Dhungana, the next technical support level for ETH/BTC may lie between 0.028 and 0.026. A rebound from this level could potentially revive broader interest in Ethereum and altcoins, paving the way for another phase of growth.

Polkadot’s focus on multi-chain capabilities and developer engagement demonstrates how blockchain ecosystems can achieve scalability and utility. Similarly, World Chain leverages Chainlink’s CCIP to solve cross-chain communication challenges, improving interoperability within decentralized networks. However, Web3Bay sets itself apart by blending robust security measures, such as multi-signature wallets and encryption protocols, with cross-chain compatibility. Its strategic presale model further reinforces its commitment to fostering growth while prioritizing user trust. Together, these platforms highlight diverse approaches to advancing blockchain technology and reshaping its practical applications. Why Security and Presale Strategy Make Web3Bay a Standout Platform Web3Bay is redefining decentralized e-commerce with security and strategic innovation at its core. To begin with, to ensure user trust and safety in financial transactions, the platform employs a multi-layered approach. Specifically, key security measures include rigorous third-party audits for its smart contracts, minimizing vulnerabilities and safeguarding user assets. In addition, multi-signature wallets provide an added layer of protection by requiring multiple authorizations for fund access, reducing risks of unauthorized activity. Furthermore, coupled with two-factor authentication (2FA) and robust encryption protocols, Web3Bay prioritizes secure access and user privacy, setting a benchmark for decentralized platforms. At the same time, this commitment to safety is matched by Web3Bay’s innovative fundraising strategy. Currently, in Stage 4 of its 28-stage presale, the platform has already raised $950,000, selling over 250.52 million 3BAY tokens. As a result, early participants are benefiting from incremental price increases, with the current price at $0.004562625. Thus, this dynamic model not only rewards early supporters with cost advantages but also ensures a steady foundation for the platform’s long-term growth. Looking ahead, Web3Bay’s cross-chain compatibility with Ethereum and BNB Chain promises to elevate its ecosystem by enabling seamless asset transactions across multiple blockchains. Consequently, this strategy enhances liquidity and broadens the platform’s utility, positioning it as a bridge between fragmented blockchain networks. In summary, by combining robust security protocols, a user-centric presale strategy, and a visionary approach to interoperability, Web3Bay is laying the groundwork for a transformative e-commerce experience. World Chain Adopts Chainlink’s CCIP for Seamless Blockchain Connectivity World Chain has adopted Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to revolutionize its cross-chain operations. Notably, this integration empowers World Chain to enable secure and seamless communication across multiple blockchains, addressing the long-standing challenges of interoperability within decentralized ecosystems. By adopting CCIP, World Chain aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of its decentralized applications, providing users with unified access to diverse blockchain networks. This development highlights the increasing demand for interoperability solutions, as blockchain projects strive to bridge the gaps between isolated networks. To this end, Chainlink’s CCIP offers robust security and scalability, ensuring reliable data transmission and token movements between chains. Moreover, World Chain’s adoption of this protocol demonstrates its commitment to innovation, as it seeks to elevate user experience and broaden the scope of its decentralized services. Ultimately, this integration not only positions World Chain as a forward-thinking blockchain but also reinforces Chainlink’s role as a leader in cross-chain technology. Polkadot’s Breakout: A New Era of Growth for DOT Polkadot (DOT) has recently captured the spotlight with a significant price surge, signaling a potential upward trend. To begin with, this momentum is largely driven by increased developer engagement, particularly with its innovative parachain technology, which has become a hub for decentralized application (dApp) development. As a result, as the cryptocurrency market rebounds and interest in altcoins rises, Polkadot’s unique multi-chain capabilities position it favorably for future expansion. In addition, strategic alliances with various blockchain projects further enhance its ecosystem and utility. For instance, analysts are eyeing key resistance levels, notably the $8 to $10 range, as indicators of DOT’s trajectory. Consequently, a sustained bullish trend could propel the token to the $12 to $15 bracket, with long-term prospects potentially reaching $20, contingent on ongoing adoption and developer support. Final Say The advancements seen in platforms like Web3Bay, Polkadot, and World Chain reflect the ongoing evolution of blockchain technology. Polkadot’s multi-chain focus and World Chain’s integration of Chainlink’s CCIP address the critical challenges of scalability and interoperability, fostering greater connectivity across networks. Web3Bay distinguishes itself by integrating security, user trust, and strategic growth into a single platform, exemplifying how a holistic approach can redefine decentralized e-commerce.

Garlinghouse said that the U.S. reserve should include a diverse array of cryptocurrencies, rather than solely relying on Bitcoin. Garlinghouse expressed his belief that a diversified crypto portfolio would benefit the U.S. and support American crypto companies. He also dismissed claims that he was trying to undermine Bitcoin in favor of XRP, saying that the opportunities in the crypto space are large enough to allow for multiple winners. “The opportunities are so large, there will be many winners,” Garlinghouse said, stressing the importance of diversification. .

He recently addressed the issue of maximalism, criticizing those who insist on a one-token approach. “Maximalism remains the enemy of crypto progress,” he said, stressing that the future of crypto relies on cooperation rather than competition. He also said that he owns a variety of cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. He reiterated that the crypto industry should work together to achieve shared goals, rather than tearing each other down. “This is not, and never will be, a zero-sum game,” he added. Trump Recognizes Innovation Previously, Garlinghouse shared his thoughts on the relationship between the crypto industry and Donald Trump. He stated that after a period of conflict, the crypto industry has finally found a strong ally in Trump, who has also embraced the sector. Garlinghouse said that Trump recognizes the potential of innovation and entrepreneurship within crypto, and he’s optimistic about what the future holds. Garlinghouse pointed out that XRP has surged massively since the election, noting that the best-performing crypto assets are coming from U.S. companies and technologies.

Bitwise has officially filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a Dogecoin ( DOGE ) exchange-traded fund (ETF). The company submitted an S-1 registration on Jan. 28, which formalizes its intention to offer a spot Dogecoin ETF. Earlier, on Jan. 22, Bitwise had filed a registration in Delaware, signaling its plans to introduce the product. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted on X that while the filing had been anticipated, this step makes the proposal official with the SEC. We knew this was coming because they filed to register the trust last week but this makes it official with the SEC. https://t.co/J7GuVqujJw — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 28, 2025 Bitwise is not the only asset manager who filed for a DOGE ETF. Earlier, on Jan. 21, Rex Shares and Osprey Funds, a firm that focuses on ETFs and ETNs, filed Form N1-A for DOGE and many other cryptos, including Official Trump ( TRUMP ), Solana ( SOL ), Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ripple ( XRP ). ETFs offer investors a range of benefits, including diversification, cost efficiency, liquidity, and transparency, making them a convenient way to manage investments. A Dogecoin ETF would provide investors with exposure to DOGE’s price movements in a regulated environment, without the need for crypto wallets or exchanges. You might also like: Nasdaq seeks to allow ‘in-kind’ redemptions for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF As per CoinDesk , Bitwise’s ETF was filed under the “33 Act” and Rex and Osprey under the “40 Act”, says Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.

Rex has on e filed under 40 Act but that isn’t the same true blue physically backed structure — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 28, 2025 The 40 Act’s primary distinguishing feature is that it imposes tighter SEC oversight and better governance and limits on riskier manoeuvres like leverage and short-selling, offering investors stronger protections. In contrast, the 33 Act is commonly utilized for speciality ETFs like commodity-based ETFs with less stringent regulatory requirements. However, while a DOGE ETF would ease access for investors to gain exposure to DOGE without having to deal with crypto exchanges, it also raises eyebrows because meme coins often face criticism for their volatility. On Jan. 16, Max Buwick of Burwick Law pointed out that meme coins are the “ultimate evolution of multi-level marketing scams”. Burwick believes meme coins prey on human desperation and is not backed by strong fundamentals. However, as CryptoQuant CEO puts it, Trump has convened a new era of meme coins , like it or not!

39638283,https://nulltx.com/?p=141514,1738126374,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,World Liberty Financial: A Key Player in Cryptocurrency Accumulation,https://nulltx.com/world-liberty-financial-a-key-player-in-cryptocurrency-accumulation/,"World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the financial venture associated with Donald Trump and his family, and focused on cryptocurrency , is quickly establishing itself as a force to be reckoned with in the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Through its public wallet, the venture is making bold—and even some might say reckless—strokes in not only building but also flaunting an impressive cryptocurrency portfolio, as if to suggest it’s just a hair’s breadth away from having a solid digital cash equivalent. Significant Cryptocurrency Holdings The wallet of WLF has become a point of interest for both crypto lovers and analysts. Why? Because its holdings have grown substantially and because the kind of growth it has seen—and that WLF has seen overall—reflects the way to leverage blockchain technology properly. As of now, WLF’s wallet holds $370.4 million in total assets spread across 44 different cryptocurrencies. Among its most important assets are: – Ethereum (ETH): 59,269 ETH, representing a jaw-dropping 3,921% increase since pre-inauguration. Ethereum, with its virtual machine that runs smart contracts, remains WLF’s top choice, indicating that WLF is quite confident in its continued relevance in the DeFi space and as a driver of blockchain innovation during the next wave. – Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC): 647 WBTC, reifying a 3,570% surge since pre-inauguration. This tokenized form of Bitcoin enables its use within Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, making WBTC emblematic of WLF’s overall focus on DeFi. – Staked Ethereum (stETH): 19,399 stETH, up 309% from pre-inauguration. This asset highlights WLF’s interest in Ethereum’s staking ecosystem, which has grown in popularity since the network’s transition to proof-of-stake. In addition to its core holdings, the wallet contains some other well-known cryptocurrencies, including USD Coin (USDC), Tether (USDT), Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), and Ethena (ETHA). Surprisingly, WLF has even begun investing in meme coins like Pepe and Mog, signaling a diversification strategy that’s hard to beat. A Commitment to DeFi Leadership The considerable increase in WLF’s asset portfolio demonstrates its desire to emerge as a major force in the DeFi sector. Indeed, the venture’s strategy seems closely aligned with Donald Trump’s prior statements about making America the global leader in crypto and blockchain. WLF is not only diversifying its investments but also, by accumulating a substantial portfolio of assets, strengthening its position as an advocate of decentralized financial systems. This assertive accumulation plan highlights confidence in the long-term promise of the crypto market. WLF has 44 different assets in its portfolio and seems to demonstrate a good understanding of the need for diversification in the dangerously volatile crypto space. Its portfolio contains near-equal parts stablecoins; utility, governance, and other non-security tokens; and “meme” coins. This indicates a far-reaching yet well-considered diversification strategy that seems to presume at least some ongoing existence for a wide range of types of crypto assets. A Reflection of Policy and Market Confidence Many consider WLF’s behavior through its wallet to be a signal of the venture’s confidence in the strength and growth of the cryptocurrency market. Analysts have noted that this accumulation might also be a sign of something else—that WLF is expecting new, blockchain-friendly policies to emerge in the United States. The previous administration under Donald Trump indicated an interest in placing the U.S. at the leading edge of blockchain and currency digital innovation, and the steps taken by the newly formed WLF appear to mesh with that aim. By establishing a strong portfolio of digital assets, WLF might be attempting to set the stage for institutional investors considering an entry into the space. WLF’s participation in staking assets like stETH shows that it’s cognizant of the shifting dynamics of the crypto ecosystem—especially that of the increasingly popular proof-of-stake systems. Those familiar with the crypto space understand that staking is an alternative to mining in terms of how new transaction blocks are generated and how the network is secured, which means that lots of tokens (like ETH) are being used in yield-bearing activities. World Liberty Financial (WLF), the cryptocurrency-focused financial venture linked to Donald Trump and his family, continues to accumulate cryptocurrencies aggressively via its public wallet. Among key assets, the venture's holdings now sit at: 59,269 ETH (+3,921% since… pic.twitter.com/qeDbqpePAh — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 27, 2025 The Road Ahead The crypto accumulation by World Liberty Financial, aggressive as it is, has not escaped notice. As the venture lab works to amass assets and expands its reach in DeFi, it has made itself into a major player in the cryptocurrency market. The venture’s growth, particularly in Ethereum and Wrapped Bitcoin, speaks to a thoughtful movement—using the opportunity presented by the blockchain revolution. The future path of the crypto market is not yet clear. However, the actions of WisdomTree’s WLF in this space show a strong conviction in its potential. As regulations and policies come into place and the sector really begins to grow up, WLF’s diversified portfolio and huge commitment to DeFi innovation could make it a trailblazer for other institutional investors looking to venture into this new asset class. World Liberty Financial is more than a financial venture. It has $370.4 million in assets and a laser-like focus on decentralized finance. It makes clear the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Whether the WLF strategies will yield long-term success remains to be seen. One thing is certain: It has already made a significant presence felt in the world of digital assets. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Other firms, including Osprey Funds and Rex Shares, have also submitted proposals, highlighting the growing demand for a regulated investment vehicle for Dogecoin. However, the price dropped 4% following the news, which shows investors are not sure of memecoins due to unclear regulations. Yet, Dogecoin’s resurgence is linked to Trump’s pro-crypto administration. The creation of the Department of Government Efficiency under President Trump has fueled speculation about increased crypto adoption. Last week, Trump signed an executive order forming a working group to develop a federal regulatory framework for digital assets. He also appointed crypto-friendly Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, further signaling potential regulatory shifts in favor of digital assets. Dogecoin’s Market Position Dogecoin is no more a joke, it currently trades at around $0.32, with a market cap of $47 billion. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan emphasized the strong demand for Dogecoin investments, noting that it is the sixth-largest cryptocurrency and sees daily trading volumes exceeding $1 billion. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Time to Buy DOGE? Whale Buys 175 Million Dogecoin , Despite a slight 0.8% decline in the past 24 hours, Dogecoin remains a popular choice among retail traders. Being a low-cap asset, the Dogecoin ETF could boost its credibility and drive institutional interest if approved. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicts that Dogecoin’s price could surge to $15 if the ETF gains approval. It will be a best buying opportunity as the prices are still below $1 and stacking this memecoin may give good returns as per the analyst. With the changing regulatory scene and political support for ETFs, the market may open to new heights in the coming months. Memecoins have gained attention since Trump and the First Lady launched their meme tokens, showcasing a strong interest in them. While the market is taking memes as a serious investment option many analysts warn of them going zero as they are of no real-world use and pose a threat of regulatory scrutiny. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

What should interest us about this market ebb is how it reflects on our current understanding of investor behavior and unrealized losses now more common in discussions of Bitcoin. This is not just a Bitcoin narrative, as much of this talk involves the state of the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole. Following the correction to $99k, the #Bitcoin Seller Exhaustion Composite flashed an exhaustion signal, highlighting severe unrealized loss and investor capitulation across the weekly-monthly timeframe. pic.twitter.com/J8E7PBeGhF — glassnode (@glassnode) January 28, 2025 Seller Exhaustion Signals and Unrealized Losses The Seller Exhaustion Composite for Bitcoin, a key indicator used to assess market stress, has been flashing a warning sign to investors. In both the weekly and monthly timeframes, it has signaled investor exhaustion. What this means is that a growing number of people are thought to be holding onto severe unrealized losses. The result has been a failing market that has seen both retail and institutional investors give up and throw in the towel—in other words, capitulate. This trend centers on a downturn in the ratio of wealth held by novice Bitcoin investors—those who have joined the market within the last day to three months. Right now, this ratio is at 50.2%, and it’s a lot lower than the previous high points in the market cycles, like in 2017. At the pinnacle of the bull market in 2018, 85% of Bitcoin riches were owned by newly arrived investors. At 50.2%, the proportion of wealth held by new #Bitcoin investors (24H to 3 months), is still well below the levels seen during previous ATH cycle tops: 2018 peak: 85% 2021 peak: 74% https://t.co/hkTSpFVAPG pic.twitter.com/6gcOgIIlvM — glassnode (@glassnode) January 28, 2025 This figure peaked at 74% in 2021. The diminished wealth concentration among new investors underscores a more somber market atmosphere that is apparently in contrast to recent cycles. One could even say that the new normal is sustained market consolidation punctuated by the occasional breakout. Price Action and Key Support Levels The price of Bitcoin has encountered rejection at vital resistance levels, amplifying the trials faced by bullish investors. The cryptocurrency was turned away at the upper red pricing band of $109,400, a key marker that, in the past, has delineated overheated market sentiment. #Bitcoin $BTC was rejected at the upper red pricing band at $109,400. Failing to reclaim this level shifts focus to the next critical support at the orange MVRV pricing band, currently sitting at $91,700. pic.twitter.com/h0EgU11fWO — Ali (@ali_charts) January 28, 2025 Since Bitcoin has not been able to return to this level, our eyes are set on the next major support zone. And now, on the next major support zone analysts have got their sights on, which is the orange MVRV. MVRV stands for Market Value to Realized Value, and this band is at $91,700. The MVRV serves as a crucial marker for assessing whether Bitcoin is really undervalued or overvalued relative to what we call its “realized price.” A breakdown below this level could trigger selling pressure, but a bounce could reignite bullish momentum. ETF Outflows Signal Shifting Investor Sentiment Pushing market sentiment further toward caution is the recent outflow of funds from Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As of January 27, Bitcoin ETFs had a total net outflow of $457 million. That figure is a marked turnaround from a week of net inflows that had some observers thinking we were returning to a more bullish situation. The principal ETFs responsible for these outflows are: FBTC: Noteworthy outflow, $268 million. – GBTC: Faced a total net outflow of $108 million. Bitcoin spot ETF had a total net outflow of $457 million on January 27, the first net outflow after the net inflow in the past 7 days. FBTC and GBTC had outflows of $268 million and $108 million respectively. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG pic.twitter.com/DRemg2Laju — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 28, 2025 This development indicates that institutional investors, who usually delegate assets to ETFs, are being careful in the face of the broadly declining market. ETF inflows are down in part because many investors are uncertain about Bitcoin’s short-term price prospects and are reducing their asset exposure. Historical Context and Market Outlook The present market situation of Bitcoin recalls earlier times of consolidation that came after significant rallies in the bull market. By historical precedent, conditions of this sort have been followed by accumulation periods—during which long-term holders invest more in Bitcoin because they are attracted by its lower price. Nevertheless, compared to prior cycles, new investors hold a lower percentage of wealth, which could raise questions about the sustainability of the retail-driven rally. And when you put it together with the apparent investor exhaustion and the ETF inflows that seem to be tapering off, what the market is moving into looks a lot like Caution with a capital C and an E for Earnings on the cover of Fortune. Conclusion The $99,000 correction and subsequent $109,400 rejection emphasize why Bitcoin has a tough hill to climb in terms of upward momentum. Several indicators—notably the Seller Exhaustion Composite and ETF outflows—paint a picture that is anything but rosy for our favorite digital currency. They suggest that the current landscape is teeming with cautious investors who are reluctant to venture forth until we reclaim a landscape devoid of unrealized losses and diminished retail participation. As Bitcoin nears its next critical support at the $91,700 MVRV band, the concentration of attention will be on whether this can serve as a bottom and prevent the asset from sliding any further. Present conditions mandate that investors exercise an abundance of caution—that much is a given. Still, this does provide a likely window for long-term investors to really take a good look at the strategies they have in place and to figure out just where they stand in terms of the present market being a likely short- to medium-term opportunity. The next few weeks will be crucial in deciding what direction Bitcoin takes, as investors consider big-picture elements like the state of the macroeconomy, regulatory changes, and signals sent by the blockchain itself. No matter how the price might oscillate in the immediate future, Bitcoin’s status as the dominant digital asset remains under challenge and thus offers insights to both old hands and neophytes in the market.

While Bitcoin (BTC) also dipped to a low of $97,777, the flagship cryptocurrency has since recovered most of its losses, trading above the key $100,000 price level. Bitcoin Holding Strong Despite NASDAQ Sell-Off Bitcoin’s resiliency amid the stock market sell-off is ‘extremely bullish’, says Bitwise’s European Head of Research, Andre Dragosch. They highlighted that the leading digital asset has outperformed NASDAQ over the past two days and is currently showing limited downside risk. It is worth noting that BTC has gained close to $5,000 since yesterday’s dip to $97,777, trading at $102,758 at the time of writing. In contrast, the S&P 500 closed yesterday’s last trading session down 1.5%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profit-Taking Drops 93% From December Peak – What’s Next For BTC? The decoupling between BTC and the stock market is further evidenced by differing investor sentiments. According to the ‘Fear & Greed Index’, the stock market currently sits at 44/100, indicating lingering fear among investors after yesterday’s market downturn. Conversely, the Index’s reading for the crypto market stands at 72/100, suggesting a sentiment of greed toward digital assets. However, this could also indicate that the crypto market is lagging behind the stock market and may experience a further drawdown while the stock market seeks stability. Meanwhile, Keith Alan, co-founder of Material Indicators, shared a post on X, viewing BTC’s brief slump as a dip-buying opportunity and adding to his BTC position. Alan noted: That wick to $97,750 should not shake your confidence in this Bitcoin bull run, but it should remind you that a deep correction can, and most likely will, develop when the market gets over hyped. Similarly, seasoned crypto trader and analyst Rekt Capital shared insights on Bitcoin’s current price momentum, stating that it is “still relatively early” in BTC’s parabolic phase for this market cycle. Historically, this phase has lasted about 300 days on average, and BTC is currently at day 82. BTC Top Not In Yet? Although BTC reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $108,786 on January 20, some analysts believe the top is not yet in for the cryptocurrency. According to analysis by Stockmoney Lizards, BTC could reach a cycle peak of $400,000 by November 2025.

Most recently, those confident institutions have shown themselves to be big players in the so-called “Ethereum Name Service” (ENS). Active Addresses Hit a Record High The past week saw the average number of active Ethereum addresses shoot up beyond 620,000—the loftiest level seen since March 2024. This gathering momentum around activity highlights the burgeoning use cases and acceptance of the Ethereum blockchain—by means of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and creative layer-2 answers (which Ethereum seriously needs). The average number of active Ethereum addresses surpassed 620k last week, the highest since March 2024! pic.twitter.com/BzMQHr6tmP — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 28, 2025 An increase in active addresses shows that Ethereum isn’t just back; it’s healthier and more robust than ever. This unstoppable network is registering renewed interest from participants, with the DeFi and NFT sectors driving much of that interest. And that interest seems to be translating to very real engagement with Ethereum’s ecosystem—an ecosystem that appears to be thriving even amid the broader crypto downturn. Whale Activity Signals Accumulation The excitement surrounding Ethereum is heightened by the recent influx of large-scale investors. In just the last 24 hours, we’ve seen the addition of 13 new mega whales to the Ethereum network—each holding more than 10,000 ETH. This is a clear sign of strong accumulation, and it very likely points to a significant degree of confidence—on the part of these investors—in Ethereum’s long-term value. A clear trend in this accumulation is being set by World Liberty Financial (WLF), a venture focused on cryptocurrency and closely associated with some of the most prominent names in finance and politics. Just five hours ago, WLF invested $10 million to buy 3,247 ETH at a low point in the market. In the last 24 hours, 13 mega whales, each holding over 10,000 #Ethereum $ETH , have joined the network. This signals significant accumulation activity! pic.twitter.com/ODIMeCO4Ry — Ali (@ali_charts) January 28, 2025 This recent buy is part of a larger buying spree by WLF. Over the past week, the fund has plunked down $129.95 million to acquire 39,242 ETH at an average price of $3,312. Yet, despite stout and consistent uptrending price action over the past eight months, with Ethereum’s current price dipping, this investment has faced a temporary unrealized loss of $5.12 million — a 3.94% hit, to be precise. WLF’s rapid gathering of Ethereum indicates the firm’s long-term faith in the asset’s potential, even when it seems to be lobbing along at the short-term price extremes of a roller coaster. World Liberty Financial ( @worldlibertyfi ) spent $10M to buy 3,247 $ETH at the dip ~5 hours ago! Over the past 7 days, the fund has spent $129.95M to buy 39,242 $ETH at an average price of $3,312, now down by $5.12M (-3.94%).

As of January 27, Ethereum spot ETFs had experienced a total net outflow of $136 million, showcasing a sentiment shift among the institutions that put their money where their mouth is. Grayscale’s Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETHE) alone took a single-day net outflow of $84.24 million, but this was not an isolated instance. ETHE’s performance has largely mirrored the overall trend that we have been seeing in the ETFs that track Ethereum. Despite being down, these ETH ETFs still boast fairly hefty total net asset values (NAVs). Grayscale’s latest published ETH NAV is at almost $6 billion, and the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (VETHE) is at about half that. Navigating Market Volatility Ethereum’s recent performance underscores the dualism between on-chain activity and market mood. Accumulation by whales and an uptick in active addresses point to fundamental bullishness, yet the outflows from Ethereum ETFs show that institutions are not yet ready to dive back into Ethereum. In a market defined by volatility and swift price movements, this sentiment is not unusual. The average price of the cryptocurrency over the past week is $3,312. This figure illustrates the difficulty still being encountered in the navigation of a market that is not only maturing but also one that is under the influence of macroeconomic factors. Ethereum spot ETF had a total net outflow of $136 million on January 27, Grayscale ETF ETHE had a single-day net outflow of $84.2445 million. The current total net asset value of Ethereum spot ETF is $11.30 billion. https://t.co/Tvs2oCSxTg pic.twitter.com/C1zYV2KNen — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 28, 2025 Looking Ahead The rise in active addresses and whale accumulation highlights Ethereum’s strength as a top blockchain network. While Ethereum is now changing through network upgrades and innovations, it remains a bedrock of the greater cryptocurrency ecosystem. The recent outflows from ETFs and the short-term price volatility have been affecting investor sentiment. For long-term investors, these periods of price consolidation often present opportunities to accumulate assets at discounted prices. The utility and adoption of Ethereum are expanding rapidly. Yet its future still depends on a complex interaction of on-chain metrics; institutional interest; and, of course, broader market trends and events. Ethereum is not immune to the kind of short-term challenges that can afflict any crypto asset, typically arising from the fallout of key positive or negative developments. That said, the fundamentals of the network—decentralized, unfettered, and interoperable—put it in a position to deliver long-term growth and innovation. In the next few weeks, the market will be keeping a close watch for any signs that the situation might be stabilizing or that we might have renewed upward momentum. With our active address count really moving and some very significant whale action, Ethereum is still the centerpiece of the cryptocurrency landscape, trading its way through market waters that are as dynamic as they are uncertain.

This sudden rise has investors and analysts closely examining its potential. The surge, fueled by prominent players’ activity, has attracted financial professionals and casual traders. Baden Bower, a cryptocurrency agency , is helping craft the narrative, building confidence in a volatile yet exciting area. Dogecoin’s Unique Journey Launched in 2013 as a lighthearted take on Bitcoin, Dogecoin’s growth has surprised many. Its value has jumped by 6,000 percent since January, outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum in percentage growth. This has made it a standout among digital currencies. Several factors have contributed to its rise. More businesses now accept it as payment, and endorsements from well-known figures have brought it into the spotlight. Once considered a joke, Dogecoin now attracts a wide range of investors. Dogecoin’s story is different from that of Bitcoin and Ethereum. While those currencies are often viewed as more traditional, Dogecoin’s community-driven energy and rapid price changes offer a fresh perspective on digital investing, making it an ideal candidate to promote crypto to new audiences. Big Investors Drive Momentum The activity of large investors, often called “whales,” has fueled Dogecoin’s recent rise. For example, one day saw $258 million worth of Dogecoin exchanged, showing serious interest from major players. These transactions affect prices and encourage smaller investors to invest. Institutional interest is helping Dogecoin gain credibility as a long-term financial option. Similar dynamics apply when promoting an NFT project , where both large-scale backers and grassroots engagement contribute to traction and visibility. How PR Makes a Difference The rise of cryptocurrencies has made effective communication more important than ever. Baden Bower, a global firm with experience in finance and technology, helps clients share their stories in ways that align with different audiences. The firm’s PR team breaks technical concepts into simple, relatable messages, ensuring clarity for seasoned investors and newcomers. “It is important to break down technical concepts into simple, relatable messages,” says AJ Ignacio, CEO of Baden Bower. The firm balances Dogecoin’s playful beginnings with its growing role as a serious investment option. For individual investors, Baden Bower focuses on community engagement and growth potential. For institutions, the focus is on regulations and strategic benefits. These tailored messages help connect with all types of audiences. With thousands of published stories and strong ties to platforms like Forbes and Business Insider, Baden Bower helps clients gain visibility. This reach allows businesses to stand out and gain trust. What’s Ahead for Dogecoin? Dogecoin’s rise and the involvement of major investors show how quickly the cryptocurrency scene can change. As digital currencies blend more with traditional finance, clear and relatable communication will remain essential. Baden Bower supports clients by breaking down complicated ideas and helping them build trust with their audiences. Its efforts to help clients get featured in top-tier media outlets enhance credibility and create opportunities in the growing digital currency space.

She has a net worth ranging from $20 million and $75 million. On her son-in-law's advice, she purchased Bitcoin and became the first U.S senator to possess cryptocurrency. She possesses no less than $230,000 worth of Bitcoin. She adopted office on January 3, 2021, the term terminates on January 3, 2027. She has always been focused on advocating for Wyoming's future. She struggled her entire career fighting for Wyoming families, communities, businesses, and values. Beginning at the halls of the Wyoming House to the Halls of the U.S. House. Lummis was born on September 10, 1954, and graduated from the University of Wyoming, earning a bachelor's degree in animal science, and biology. She also achieved a Juris Doctor from the University of Wyoming College of Law. Her career experience comprises working as general counsel to previous Wyoming Governor Jim Geringer, Wyoming House of Representatives, as a treasure of Wyoming, and in the United States House of Representatives from Wyoming's at-large congressional district. In 1990, she also worked as the chair of Mary Mead's gubernatorial campaign and Ray Hunkins's gubernatorial campaign, in 2006, also served on Bob Dole's presidential steering committee in Wyoming. Through her firmly beneficial crypto position, she developed the reception and fair guidelines of computerized resources in the United States. She voluntarily organized a great foundation for herself as a significant Bitcoin financial backer. She is professed to continue encouraging the developing cryptocurrencies industry in the United States and all over the world in 2022. Her urge for transparency on cryptographic forms of money and stable coins in U.S. regulation will maintain on becoming tremendous. She had been always looking for a store of value, and she believes bitcoin specifically is a great store of value and knew that scarcity will protect its value going into the future, unlike the U.S. dollar that they are printing more of every single day. Investor has stepped in to support the crypto exchange. She has filed an amicus brief , accusing the SEC of abusing its power and bypassing Congress to impose unclear rules on digital assets. Lummis Challenges SEC’s Regulatory Tactics On January 24, Senator Cynthia Lummis submitted an amicus brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, siding with Coinbase in its legal dispute with the SEC . In her filing, Lummis criticized the regulatory approach taken by the agency under former Chair gary gensler gary gensler Gary Gensler is a pioneer and the current chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He has extensive experience that spans Wall Street, government regulation, and an angel teaching about cryptocurrencies and blockchain at MIT. Gary S. Gensler was on born October 18, 1957, in Baltimore, Maryland.He graduated from Pikesville High School in 1975, where he was later given a Distinguished Alumnus award. He also earned a degree in economics.Gensler served in the United States Department of the Treasury as Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets from 1997 to 1999, then as Undersecretary for Domestic Finance from 1999 to 2001He has expressed his desire to present crypto-related approach changes later on that include token commitments, decentralized finance, stablecoins, guardianship, exchange-traded resources, and advancing stages. Chairman stating that it lacks transparency and undermines the separation of powers. https://t.co/Jn8FiEMLM4 — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) January 28, 2025 Lummis argues that the SEC has been unfairly reinterpreting existing securities laws without clear guidelines and imposing those rules on crypto firms without prior notice. Meanwhile, Lummis’s filing strengthens Coinbase’s case, noting that the SEC has misapplied the Howey Test, which determines whether an asset is a security. She believes Congress, not the SEC, should decide how digital assets are classified and regulated. SEC’s Leadership Change Could Alter Its Stance? The timing of Lummis’ intervention is significant, as the SEC is experiencing a leadership shift. With Mark Uyeda now serving as Acting Chair, there is speculation that the agency might take a more balanced approach. Uyeda has already introduced a dedicated crypto task force to develop a clearer regulatory framework, signaling a potential change in direction. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Just In: French Investigation Opens Probe into Binance for Money Laundering, Tax Fraud and More , Coinbase’s Fight Continues Amid Global Expansion The SEC first sued Coinbase in 2023 , accusing the company of operating as an unregistered broker, exchange, and clearinghouse.

Despite its legal battle in the U.S., Coinbase continues to expand globally. Recently Coinpedia news reported that the exchange secured a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license in Argentina, allowing it to legally operate and grow its presence in the region.

39639073,https://coinpedia.org/?p=411677,1738128053,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,XRP Price Prediction For January 29,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-january-29/,"The post XRP Price Prediction For January 29 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP has shown strong performance recently, but it remains below the all-time highs on the long-term chart. Although the price has formed marginally higher highs in some cases, it hasn’t sustained a definitive break into all-time high territory. As a result, it i s still in a phase of consolidation. Key Price Levels to Watch Currently, XRP is consolidating just below the $3.40 level, which has been a significant resistance point. While there hasn’t been a confirmed breakout into new highs, experts are closely watching for a move towards the $4.20 and $5 targets in the near future. These are key milestones for XRP to hit, with further upside potential possibly reaching $6.62 if the bullish momentum continues. For now, price action is creating an unclear microstructure, but it’s important to understand that the overall trend is still upward. Even with some short-term volatility, the bigger picture remains positive for XRP. Short-Term Patterns: Volatility and Key Support Levels On the smaller time frame, XRP had been in a triangle pattern that was completed around January 13, 2025. After the breakout, the price hit resistance below the all-time high area, which isn’t surprising given its importance in the market. Similar to Bitcoin’s struggle with the $100,000 mark, XRP might take multiple attempts before breaking out convincingly above its current resistance. The key support area to watch is at $2.52. If XRP holds above this level, it could mean a successful bounce from the correction. However, should the price drop below this support level, XRP may see a potential move towards $2.32, and possibly even as low as $1.96. While further downside is always a possibility, the $2.52 support level will act as a critical point for validation. If the price manages to stay above this level, the price might see an immediate breakout to the upside. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Gary Gensler will be a member of both the Global Economics and Management Group and the Finance Group, where he will work on artificial intelligence, finance, financial technology, and public policy, says the MIT press release , dated on Jan. 27. In addition to being a professor, he will also be the co-director of the FinTechAI at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT’s largest research lab. Before taking on the role of SEC Chair during the Biden administration and overseeing the $120 trillion U.S. capital markets, Gensler served as a Professor of the Practice at MIT Sloan from 2018 to 2021. He also served as Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under President Obama, overseeing the implementation of the post-2008 reforms of the $400 trillion swaps market. You might also like: Trump’s ‘golden age’ can be for crypto, too | Opinion Gensler’s anti-crypto stance Within the crypto industry, however, Gensler has been famous for his harsh “Everything is a Security” stance. Gensler has had a contentious relationship with Congress and other U.S. regulators and criticized bills that would codify a clearer crypto regulatory framework. He’s repeatedly said that most cryptos other than Bitcoin ( BTC ) should qualify as securities, thereby falling under SEC jurisdiction. In Jan. 2022, Gensler said , “The fact is, most crypto tokens involve a group of entrepreneurs raising money from the public in anticipation of profits—the hallmark of an investment contract or a security under our jurisdiction.” at Penn Law Capital Markets Association Annual Conference. The result of such strict regulations has left projects working in the U.S. in legal limbo, which President Donald Trump is now rolling back.

Crypto.com has announced it will remove USDT from its platform by January 31, 2025. This follows coinbase coinbase - support@coinbase.com Wallet Centralised Exchange decision to drop Tether last year. The future of its $138 billion USDT in the EU is uncertain, and the possibility of other regions delisting is spreading like fire, all because of the strict new rules under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations . Crypto analyst Jacob King broke the news, highlighting how this could impact stablecoins and crypto trading. BREAKING: Crypto com, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has just announced it will delist Tether (USDT) on January 31, 2025. — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) January 28, 2025 Nothing is going in the right direction for Tether and these regulatory problems can severely impact the stablecoins movement globally. Why is Tether Being Delisted? MiCA’s new rules make it tough for stablecoins to stay in the European market. One key requirement is that stablecoins must keep over 60% of their reserves in recognized banks and get an e-money license. Moreover, Tether hasn’t met these rules , leading major exchanges to remove it. USDT is the most-used stablecoin in the world, but its lack of transparency has always raised concerns. Unlike other stablecoins, Tether doesn’t provide frequent or detailed audits of its reserves. This has led to doubts about whether it holds enough assets to back all the USDT in circulation. What Happens Next? Tether’s removal could shake up the crypto market. USDT is a major player in trading, helping traders move funds quickly between crypto and fiat. Without it, liquidity—how easily assets can be bought or sold—could take a hit. To be on the safer side, some traders are already switching to fiat trading pairs, but this could create new problems. With fewer stablecoin options, trading might become less efficient, and prices could fluctuate more. USDC vs. Tether – Who Wins? USD Coin (USDC) could benefit from Tether’s struggles. USDC is seen as more trustworthy because it provides monthly audits and keeps its reserves in regulated banks. It also follows strict U.S. financial laws, making it a safer bet for exchanges looking to stay compliant with MiCA. If more exchanges follow Crypto.com and Coinbase, USDT could lose its dominance, and USDC might take its place as the go-to stablecoin in Europe. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinbase vs. SEC: Senator Cynthia Lummis Fights Back Against Regulatory Overreach , The Future of Stablecoins in Europe Stablecoin issuers will have to follow MiCA’s rules or risk being pushed out of the market. More exchanges may delist non-compliant stablecoins, leading to a shift toward regulated alternatives. For now, Tether remains the world’s top stablecoin, but its future in Europe looks uncertain. The next few months will be crucial in shaping the stablecoin market under these new regulations. Global Scenario In other news, Senator Elizabeth Warren is challenging Howard Lutnick, Trump’s Commerce Secretary nominee, over his firm’s ties to Tether. She’s demanding details on Cantor Fitzgerald’s investments and whether it ensured Tether complied with anti-money laundering laws. Warren argues that Tether’s links to illicit transactions pose a national security risk. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Storm has been charged with conspiracy to facilitate money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitter, and violating sanctions in relation to his work on the Tornado Cash protocol. “The government’s prosecution raises larger civil liberties concerns that could chill the future development of privacy-enhancing technologies more broadly,"" the EFF wrote in the brief. The EFF argues that Storm's prosecution threatens open-source innovation as the core issue in the case of holding developers responsible for how their tools are used, instead of prosecuting bad actors directly, could have a chilling effect on privacy-focused software development. ""Nearly all privacy and anonymity protective software tools are dual-use tools. Like a physical mask or paper cash, they provide needed, often critical protections for users, but can also be used by bad actors to help hide their crimes,"" the EFF wrote. In the prosecution of Storm, the government is relying on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which allows it to impose economic sanctions and restrict transactions during national emergencies. This application, the EFF argues, is inappropriate. “If the government believes it is appropriate to criminalize these technologies, it must seek relief from Congress and not rely on IEEPA and the other laws deployed in this prosecution, or, worse, attempt to bootstrap ancillary activities even further removed from any criminal acts into the ambit of these laws,” the EFF wrote. If Congress wants to regulate tools like Tornado Cash, the EFF argues, it has the authority to pass a law that clearly distinguishes legal from illegal use, but the prosecution in this case fails to provide that clarity. The TORN token is up nearly 50% in the last month, according to market data , on optimism of a favorable outcome for Storm.

Understanding its price movements is essential for many in the crypto world. TRON price data is valuable for traders, developers, analysts, and businesses. Accurate price data helps traders make better buying or selling decisions. Developers can use this data to build tools like trading bots, portfolio trackers, or crypto payment platforms. Analysts rely on price data to study market trends and gain insights into TRON’s performance. Businesses that deal with cryptocurrencies can benefit from using TRON price data to price goods, services, or transactions. In this blog, we’ll explore the top 10 solutions for accessing TRON price data, making it easier for everyone to stay informed and make smarter decisions. TRON Price APIs Overview TRON price APIs allow users to access accurate and up-to-date information about the value of TRON (TRX). These APIs act as bridges, connecting users with real-time price data, historical trends, and market statistics. They are an essential tool for anyone looking to interact with TRON’s ecosystem or make informed decisions about trading or development. Whether you’re a trader monitoring the latest price fluctuations or a developer integrating TRON price data into an application, these APIs simplify the process by offering reliable and fast access to data. These APIs also provide additional features, such as blockchain analytics, transaction data, and token performance insights, which are particularly valuable for building dApps or conducting market research. Top 10 Tron Price APIs Here are the best Tron Price APIs that you can use to get critical information: 1. Bitquery Bitquery specializes in delivering rich, actionable blockchain data through its versatile platform. It empowers users to access real-time and historical data, enabling deep analysis and efficient decision-making. With over 40 blockchains, including TRON , Bitquery offers a seamless way to explore, monitor, and extract valuable insights from blockchain ecosystems. Bitquery’s advanced APIs provide comprehensive insights into the TRON network, with features tailored for developers, traders, and analysts seeking detailed data on token prices, DEX trades, and memecoin activity. Its subscription and streaming options ensure rapid access to high volumes of data without delays, making it a leading choice in blockchain analytics. Key Features 1. Price Tracking and OHLC Data Live Token Prices : Bitquery’s API provides real-time token prices on the TRON network, including USD pricing . The API delivers OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data, perfect for plotting charts like TradingView. 2. Tron DEX Trades API Real-Time Trade Updates: You can monitor every trade on Tron-based decentralized exchanges like SunSwap and Justswap . 3. Memecoin Data ( SunPump ) Buy & Sell Event Tracking: Receive real-time updates on all buy and sell events for memecoins like SunPump, helping you respond quickly to market changes. Real-Time Token Creation Alerts: Get notified whenever new tokens are created on SunPump so you can stay ahead of new memecoin launches. 4. Subscription-Based Access via GraphQL Streamlined Data Retrieval: Subscribe to specific events like new token creation without repeatedly calling the API. Customizable Filters: Tailor your queries to track only the tokens or events you care about. 5. Zero Latency Kafka Streams Instant On-Chain Data : You can access Tron USD price data with zero delay using their Tron Kafka Streams. This helps you consume high volumes of data without interruptions or performance bottlenecks. Why Bitquery Stands Out Bitquery sets itself apart by focusing on versatility, speed, and data depth. The platform’s ability to deliver instant insights through Kafka streams and subscription-based GraphQL APIs ensures users can handle even the most demanding use cases. Bitquery’s real-time updates for meme coin activity and decentralized exchange trades make it invaluable for traders who need to act quickly. Its multi-chain support and advanced filtering options make it ideal for developers building custom blockchain solutions. 2. TronGrid TronGrid is the official API platform for the TRON blockchain. It is designed to provide seamless access to network data. Developers can interact with the TRON ecosystem to fetch transaction data, monitor innovative contract interactions, and track wallet activities. TronGrid’s infrastructure supports dApp development, making it an essential tool for building decentralized applications on the TRON network. With reliable node access and real-time data, it simplifies integrating TRON blockchain features into various applications. Pros Official Support : TronGrid is the official API of the TRON blockchain, offering reliable and authenticated access to TRON network data. Developer-Friendly : TronGrid is tailored to app developers. It includes comprehensive documentation and tools for interacting with TRON’s smart contracts and transactions. High Availability : The platform ensures consistent uptime and reliability, making it a dependable choice for accessing TRON data. Cons Limited Multi-Chain Support : TronGrid is exclusively focused on the TRON network, which may limit its usability for projects requiring multi-chain data. Lack of Advanced Analytics : TronGrid primarily provides raw data, with minimal support for advanced analytics like memecoin tracking or token-specific insights. No Streamlined Data Subscription : TronGrid does not offer event subscription capabilities. This requires frequent API calls for updated data, which increases costs and complexity in data retrieval. 3. CoinGecko API The CoinGecko API is one of the most widely used cryptocurrency data APIs.

It now joins a growing list of corporate Bitcoin adopters. Meanwhile, Japan’s Metaplanet is raising $745 million to expand its Bitcoin holdings, and plans to accumulate 10,000 BTC by late 2025 and 21,000 BTC by 2026. In the US, Arizona lawmakers advanced the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which will allow government entities to allocate up to 10% of their capital towards Bitcoin. Nuvve to Invest in Bitcoin Nuvve, the Nasdaq-listed clean energy electric vehicle charging technology firm, announced plans to allocate a portion of its treasury into Bitcoin (BTC). It will set aside up to 30% of its excess cash reserves to buy Bitcoin. The company stated in a press release on Jan. 28 that its move to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet is part of a strategy to diversify its holdings and offer Bitcoin as a payment option for customers and suppliers. Gregory Poilasne, founder and CEO of Nuvve, pointed out that accepting Bitcoin will expand payment choices while also reducing transaction friction that is associated with traditional digital payment methods. By integrating Bitcoin into its treasury strategy, Nuvve joins a growing list of publicly traded companies that turned to the cryptocurrency to boost financial stability and share value, especially as Bitcoin has surged 150% over the past year. After the announcement, shares of Nuvve (NVVE) saw a brief increase, and closed at $2.81 with a 1.81% gain on Jan. 28. It is still down from a daily high of over $4. After hours, the stock continued its modest upward movement by climbing another 1.42% to $2.85. However, the company’s stock is still in a long-term decline, down 10% in value so far this month. Nuvve share price (Source: Google Finance ) Financially, Nuvve reported $1.92 million in revenue for the third quarter of 2024, which was a 29.3% decline from the previous quarter. Its latest financial filings show it holds $325,425 in cash, which, if 30% were allocated to Bitcoin at its current price of $101,836, would amount to just under one BTC. Bitcoin Treasuries data reveals that 62 publicly traded companies collectively hold 618,615 BTC, which is valued at over $62.6 billion. MicroStrategy is still the largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 471,107 BTC, while Tesla, the leading electric vehicle manufacturer, owns 9,720 BTC. Metaplanet Plans Another Massive Bitcoin Buy Metaplanet, a publicly traded company in Japan, also recently announced an ambitious plan to raise more than 116 billion yen (approximately $745 million) to expand its Bitcoin holdings. On Jan. 29, the company issued 21 million shares of 0% discount moving strike warrants to generate the necessary funds to buy additional Bitcoin. Metaplanet described this as the largest capital raise in Asian equity markets dedicated to Bitcoin acquisition. The company’s decision to increase its Bitcoin reserves is part of its strategy to hedge against the declining value of the yen and position itself as a leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption. This fundraising initiative is also the first phase of Metaplanet’s larger Bitcoin strategy, with a goal of buying 10,000 BTC by the fourth quarter of 2025. This investment is expected to exceed $1 billion at current market prices. By the end of 2026, the company plans to increase its holdings even more to 21,000 BTC, worth approximately $2.1 billion. (Source: Metaplanet ) Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet’s representative director and president, stated that the company is now recognized as “Tokyo’s preeminent Bitcoin company” and is taking advantage of its momentum to solidify its position in the market. Metaplanet first purchased Bitcoin on April 8 of 2024, and integrated it as a core treasury asset. Since adopting a Bitcoin standard, the company experienced exponential growth, and reported a 309% BTC yield in the fourth quarter of 2024, after a 41% yield in the third quarter. The firm also reported large unrealized gains from its Bitcoin holdings. Beyond its Bitcoin investments, Metaplanet has seen rapid expansion in other areas as well, including a surge in the number of shareholders, which is now over 50,000. Its share trading volume increased 430 times year-over-year. Arizona Lawmakers Advance Bill to Create a Bitcoin Reserve Arizona lawmakers took a big step toward integrating Bitcoin into the state’s financial strategy by advancing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB1025). The bill is co-sponsored by Senator Wendy Rogers and Representative Jeff Weninger, and passed the Arizona State Senate Finance Committee with a five-to-two vote on Jan. 27. It will now move to the Senate Rules Committee for further debate and amendments. If approved by the Senate, it will proceed to the House of Representatives. The bill proposes the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve that will be managed by the US Treasury, which would store government Bitcoin holdings and allow other public funds to deposit their digital assets in a secure, segregated account. It will also permit government entities and public funds to allocate up to 10% of their capital into Bitcoin and other digital assets. This shift could attract increased public interest, particularly among younger generations. In fact, recent reports show that up to 20% of Gen Z and Alpha are open to receiving pensions in cryptocurrency, while 78% have a lot more trust in alternative retirement savings over traditional pension funds. (Source: Bitget ) The move could set a precedent for other states also considering similar legislation. Blockchain expert Anndy Lian stated that Arizona’s initiative might encourage states like Texas and Pennsylvania, which have already explored Bitcoin adoption, to accelerate their own efforts. However, he also warned that incorporating Bitcoin into state reserves requires a lot of safeguards because of the cryptocurrency’s volatility. Overall, he pointed out the potential risks for taxpayers similar to those faced by crypto investors. The bill’s advancement happened at a time of growing discussions about a national Bitcoin reserve. Wyoming Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has been a very vocal advocate for the idea, and if the proposal gains federal approval, it could have huge effects on Bitcoin’s price. Adam Back , co-founder and CEO of Blockstream, suggested that a move like this could push Bitcoin’s value past the seven-figure mark in the current market cycle. He believes this will be due to the fact that investors have yet to fully price in the impact of a nationwide Bitcoin reserve. There are currently at least 13 Bitcoin reserve-related bills in progress across various states, including Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Kansas, New Hampshire, Wyoming, Ohio, Utah, and North Dakota. Support for these initiatives has grown a lot fueled by former President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policies and recent executive orders on digital assets. If the bill succeeds, it could lead to an influx of new institutional Bitcoin adopters that could give BTC’s price a very nice boost.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-29 05:41:43

The network’s decentralized exchange (DEX) recorded $400 million in swap volume in January, highlighting increased adoption, while Ripple’s push for an XRP-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) gains traction amid a more crypto-friendly US administration. Meanwhile, Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC could take a new turn, with Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty suggesting that a leadership change at the agency might lead to the withdrawal of enforcement actions against crypto firms. Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty Hints at Potential Dismissal of SEC Lawsuits Under New Leadership Stuart Alderoty, chief legal officer at Ripple Labs, has expressed optimism about the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States under the potential leadership of Paul Atkins as the next chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Speaking during an X Spaces discussion for XRP Community Day 2025, Alderoty revealed that the SEC under Atkins, once confirmed by the Senate, might withdraw civil suits against crypto firms that do not involve allegations of fraud. This development could mark a significant turning point for Ripple Labs, which has been embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC since 2020. Ripple’s clash with the SEC began in December 2020 when the regulatory body filed a lawsuit accusing the blockchain payments firm of using XRP as an unregistered security to raise funds. The case has dragged on for over four years, with both parties exchanging legal blows. In August 2024, a federal judge ruled Ripple liable for more than $125 million, leading to appeals from both the SEC and Ripple. The central argument in the case has revolved around whether XRP should be classified as a security, with broader implications for the classification of digital assets in the US. Alderoty criticized the SEC’s strategy of ”regulation by enforcement,” calling it an ineffective path for governing the crypto space. He suggested that Atkins, if confirmed as SEC chair, would prioritize a more collaborative approach, which might include withdrawing lawsuits focused primarily on registration issues. “Litigation, regulation by enforcement, is not the path that this country should be pursuing,” Alderoty stated. “I believe the new SEC understands that, and I remain cautiously optimistic that at some point during 2025, the case will be voluntarily withdrawn.” Alderoty’s optimism extends beyond Ripple’s specific case to the broader crypto industry. He pointed to the Trump administration’s actions in support of digital assets, including an executive order to establish a working group on digital asset regulation and the launch of an SEC crypto task force. Ripple’s leadership has been vocal about its positive outlook on the current administration’s approach to the crypto sector. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse echoed these sentiments, citing the administration’s pro-crypto stance as a factor in Ripple’s decision to expand its US-based operations. Following Trump’s reelection in 2024, Ripple announced that 75% of its new job openings would be located in the United States. Alderoty also highlighted the potential for meaningful legislation with the support of a Republican-controlled Congress. Ripple’s contributions to the political action committee Fairshake, totaling $45 million, may have helped elect lawmakers sympathetic to the crypto industry. According to Alderoty, a crypto market structure bill could be passed before the end of 2025, creating a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets. “I think we’ve got a pro-crypto Congress driven by a pro-crypto president,” Alderoty said. “I think we can see [legislation] happening certainly before the end of 2025.” Ripple’s ties to the Trump administration extend beyond policy alignment. Both Alderoty and Garlinghouse have maintained a close relationship with the president. The pair dined with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in January 2025 and attended his inauguration events in Washington, D.C., as official guests. Ripple has also been a significant financial supporter of Trump’s political efforts, contributing $5 million worth of XRP to the presidential inaugural fund and Alderoty personally donating more than $300,000 to committees backing Trump’s campaign. These connections could provide Ripple with additional influence in shaping the regulatory landscape under the new SEC leadership. However, uncertainty remains regarding whether Paul Atkins will secure Senate confirmation as the next SEC chair. While Trump’s nomination of Atkins aligns with his administration’s crypto-friendly stance, the process faces potential political challenges. What’s Next for Ripple and the Crypto Industry? Ripple’s CLO hinted that the road to resolving its legal battle with the SEC may not be immediate, even with potential changes in leadership. “The SEC is still a bureaucracy,” Alderoty noted, emphasizing the time required to implement policy shifts. For Ripple and the broader crypto industry, the possibility of the SEC dropping enforcement cases marks a glimmer of hope. Should Atkins prioritize a less adversarial approach to regulation, it could open the door for greater innovation and growth in the US crypto sector. At the same time, the outcome of Ripple’s appeals and the future of its lawsuit with the SEC will remain critical for defining how digital assets are treated under US securities laws. Ripple’s leadership appears confident that the ongoing legal challenges will ultimately strengthen the company’s position. As the SEC transitions under new leadership, the case against Ripple could become a defining moment for crypto regulation in the United States. XRP Ledger's Decentralized Exchange Records $400M in January, Ripple CEO Celebrates Milestones In related news, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has highlighted significant progress for the XRP Ledger ecosystem, reporting that its native decentralized exchange (DEX) clocked $400 million in swap volume in January 2025. This milestone, averaging approximately $17 million in daily volume, suggests growing momentum for the blockchain network and its expanding suite of financial products. Speaking during XRP Community Day on Jan. 28, Garlinghouse noted that the DEX has facilitated over $1 billion in cryptocurrency swaps since its launch in 2024. Its rapid growth is among several reasons “why 2024 will certainly stand out as one of the most monumental years for Ripple,” he stated. The rise of XRP Ledger’s DEX is just one of the achievements Ripple celebrated entering 2025. Garlinghouse emphasized that the company is seeing early but promising traction for its US dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD , launched in 2024. The stablecoin aims to provide a bridge for fiat-to-digital transactions and increase XRP Ledger’s appeal as a financial ecosystem. Additionally, Ripple has been making waves in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) space. Several filings for XRP-based ETFs, including proposals from asset management giants Bitwise and WisdomTree, signal institutional interest in the XRP ecosystem. According to Garlinghouse, investment bank JPMorgan estimates these XRP ETFs could bring upward of $8 billion in inflows, further boosting the ecosystem’s liquidity and market presence. Garlinghouse attributed much of Ripple’s recent success to a favorable political climate under US President Trump’s administration. Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election has reinvigorated optimism in the cryptocurrency industry, particularly for XRP, which has seen its price skyrocket by over 500% since the election on Nov. 5. “Trump winning the election… whatever you think about his personal politics, for crypto, it is certainly profound,” Garlinghouse said during the discussion. He added that the previous administration’s “unlawful war on crypto” now feels like a thing of the past, with regulatory clarity and industry-friendly policies providing a tailwind for XRP’s growth. Trump’s administration has promised to make the US the “world’s crypto capital” and has already begun appointing crypto-friendly leaders to head key financial regulatory agencies, including the SEC. In 2024, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, setting a precedent that many investors believe will pave the way for XRP-based ETFs in 2025. Prediction market Polymarket currently places the odds of a US XRP ETF approval at around 73%. Ripple’s Expanding Ecosystem: From DEX to Stablecoin and ETFs Ripple Labs, the developer behind XRP Ledger, has worked to position its blockchain network as a scalable, enterprise-friendly alternative to Ethereum. While XRP Ledger historically lacked third-party smart contract capabilities, it has innovated in other areas. The introduction of its decentralized exchange and automated market maker (AMM) tools demonstrate its focus on financial applications and liquidity solutions. The recent success of XRP Ledger’s DEX, combined with the launch of RLUSD, reflects Ripple’s ambition to create a robust ecosystem catering to both retail and institutional users. The proposed XRP ETFs, if approved, could mark a turning point in bringing more traditional investors into the fold. As Ripple moves into 2025, the company’s leadership appears confident about the future. With Trump in office, Garlinghouse predicts continued regulatory improvements and opportunities for growth in the cryptocurrency industry. He highlighted the administration’s focus on building a strong foundation for digital asset markets, noting that the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs is just the beginning. Despite its successes, Ripple faces challenges, including the uncertain timeline for regulatory approvals. While optimism remains high, the SEC has yet to greenlight XRP-based ETFs, leaving investors to anticipate potential announcements later in 2025.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|WALLET|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-29 06:00:00

It will be followed by Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference at 19:30 UTC. The Fed's ongoing target range for interest rates is 4.25% to 4.5%, which has declined by 100 basis points since September. The December meeting saw a 25 basis point rate cut, but the accompanying press conference and forecasts signaled slower rate cuts for 2025, sending risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC), lower. However, Wednesday's meeting is largely being seen as a non-event for markets, including cryptocurrencies, as policymakers are expected to hold rates steady while maintaining the hawkish forward guidance from December. ""We doubt this week's FOMC meeting will be a major market mover as the unchanged rate decision has been well communicated in advance back in December. The minutes revealed participants have already made some preliminary assumptions on Trump's policies, but given the considerable uncertainty, we doubt Powell will feel comfortable providing markets with any strong guidance,"" Danske Bank said in a note to clients Tuesday. That said, Powell will likely face questions on the following key issues, and his responses could move markets. Deportation of illegal immigrants President Donald Trump is already making good on his campaign promises to eject illegal immigrants from the U.S., with deportation flights rolling out over the weekend. Per estimates, total deportations could range from one million to 10 million . Analysts anticipate that substantial deportations will bolster labor market strength and contribute to inflation. If Powell shares a similar perspective, it could dampen expectations for rate cuts, potentially leading to a decline in risk assets. ""The disappearance of up to 1 million potential workers from the U.S. labor force would be no small thing. Given the strength of Friday's (December) payrolls report, a tightening in the U.S. labor supply would add further pressure to a jobs market that is already showing signs of tightening and has an unemployment rate close to the full-employment level,"" Rabobank's Senior Macro Strategist Benjamin Picton said in a note to clients early this month. ""That is inflationary in and of itself, and that is before we consider the additional impacts of tax cuts and tariffs,"" Picton added. U.S. debt ceiling The U.S. hit its self-imposed debt ceiling of $36 trillion last week, leading to the Treasury starting extraordinary measures to keep the government functioning. One of the measures involves running down the government's checking account at the Fed called the Treasury General Account (TGA). The TGA spending usually eases liquidity conditions in the economy and markets, spurring risk-taking. That might counter the effects of the Fed's ongoing quantitive tightening (balance sheet normalization process). Powell might get questions on the same and may look to avoid sounding dovish while the TGA spend adds liquidity to the system, thus capping the upside in risk assets for now. Rent inflation Leading indicators point to a moderation in shelter inflation, which has an outsized influence on the consumer price index. ""The Labor Department's ""all tenant rent"" index, which leads shelter inflation in the CPI, rose at a much slower pace last quarter. It was up 3.2% over the four quarters ended Q4 (vs. 3.9% in Q3 and 5.5% one year ago). It's very close to the 3.1% average between 2017-19,"" Wall Street Journal's Chief Economic Correspondent Nick Timaros said on X last week. Risk assets could surge if Powell acknowledges the disinflationary trend in the leading indicators of shelter inflation.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Federal Reserve,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-29 07:04:53

Trump’s meme coins spark debate, while Lightchain AI’s $12.3m presale cements its position as a utility-driven contender. Table of Contents Trump meme coins and their potential impact Lightchain AI’s utility-driven appeal Shift toward utility The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with Donald Trump and Melania Trump’s meme coins. These meme coins have sparked conversations about their potential influence on the broader crypto ecosystem. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI, a utility-driven blockchain project, continues to attract significant investor interest. Currently in its presale phase at $0.005625 per token and having raised $12.3 million, Lightchain AI is proving to be a strong contender in the market. Let’s examine how these developments align and impact the crypto landscape. Trump meme coins and their potential impact Earlier this month, the new US President, Donald Trump, showed off the TRUMP meme coin , which saw a fast rise in worth, hitting a market cap of close to $6 billion right after it launched. This move was then met with First Lady Melania Trump’s launch of her own digital coin, MELANIA, which also saw big market moves. These changes have brought up talks about the right and wrong sides and possible mixed loyalties, as Trump-linked groups own much of both coins. It’s also important to note that both TRUMP and MELANIA have bottomed since their launch, causing the crypto community to be disheartened. Critics show worry about market tricks and the ups and downs that come with meme coins, which might cause big money losses for clueless investors. Also, the high amount of coin ownership brings up questions about the control of political leaders in the crypto world and how outside groups can get these assets, thus affecting national safety and money steadiness.

Meanwhile, PlutoChain , a rising blockchain platform bringing AI and smart contracts to Bitcoin, is drawing attention from whales with its innovative approach. Here’s a closer look at what’s propelling these two projects forward. Ripple Rides Regulatory Wave – What Trump’s Administration Means for XRP Donald Trump’s administration has introduced crypto-friendly policies, boosting optimism for Ripple (XRP). With pro-crypto Paul Atkins as SEC Chair and a mandate to overhaul digital asset frameworks, regulatory clarity could drive growth for XRP and other cryptocurrencies. Ripple’s utility in cross-border payments positions it for significant gains as institutional interest and liquidity grow under favorable policies. However, critics have raised concerns over Trump’s involvement in ventures like the $TRUMP token, citing ethical risks. While the administration’s stance signals a promising future for digital currencies, observers caution against blurring the lines between politics and markets. PlutoChain Aims to Transform Bitcoin with a Hybrid Layer-2 Solution Transforming Bitcoin has long been a focus for blockchain innovators, and PlutoChain ($PLUTO) shows the potential to contribute to this vision. By enabling Ethereum-style functionality on Bitcoin’s secure network, PlutoChain wants to introduce a new dimension to the blockchain’s utility. Its hybrid Layer-2 technology could address Bitcoin’s inherent limitations, offering an average block time of just 2 seconds (compared to Bitcoin’s 10-minute one) while slashing costs and improving scalability – issues that have long hindered the king of digital assets. PlutoChain’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility could bridge the worlds of Bitcoin and Ethereum, possibly merging Ethereum’s developer-friendly infrastructure with Bitcoin’s unparalleled security. This fusion might create fertile ground for decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFT markets directly on Bitcoin – paving the way for the underdeveloped Bitcoin DeFi market to gain traction. The governance system could be another interesting feature, as it gives users direct control over network direction. Paired with its audited security from SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi, this project has all the elements of a safe and reliable platform. Scalability isn’t just theoretical – PlutoChain’s testnet processes over 43,200 daily transactions, showcasing real-world readiness. Furthermore, it could unlock immense potential: Bitcoin’s current DeFi activity sits at just 0.13% of its market cap compared to Ethereum’s 10%. PlutoChain’s innovations could begin to close that gap. By enabling a new chapter of dApps and advanced functionality, PlutoChain doesn’t just plan to enhance Bitcoin – it could reframe it as a dynamic platform for modern blockchain applications. Final Words Ripple’s XRP is experiencing a wave of optimism as the Trump administration’s crypto-friendly policies foster a pro-innovation climate. XRP’s utility in cross-border payments could gain momentum. Meanwhile, PlutoChain could redefine Bitcoin’s future. Its hybrid Layer-2 solution plans to enhance Bitcoin with Ethereum-style functionality, potentially enabling smart contracts and dApps. By bridging Bitcoin and Ethereum through EVM compatibility, this project could address scalability and possibly unlock Bitcoin’s untapped potential, hinting at a transformative era for the blockchain ecosystem. ——— This article is purely informational and should not be interpreted as financial advice.

Additionally, the Wall Street Journal reported on Jan. 24 that MicroStrategy could face an unquantified tax hit arising from a new corporate alternative minimum tax, which could hit unrealized the firm’s gains on BTC. Should this tax go into effect, the company would have to pay federal income taxes on the increase in value of its BTC assets. This could result in MicroStrategy being forced to liquidate a portion of its BTC holding in order to pay taxes– an effect which can be felt on its stocks.

Nuvve, a public Californian company focused on connecting electric vehicles to the grid, said its board has approved holding Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a primary treasury asset. In a Jan. 28 press release , the San Diego-headquartered company revealed it would invest up to 30% of its excess cash, based on its estimated six-month operating expenses, into BTC. How much Bitcoin it actually buys will depend on market conditions and its business needs. The move isn’t just about holding Bitcoin. Nuvve also wants to accept BTC as payment for customers and suppliers “as part of its core mission to promote grid electrification through innovation,” the press release reads. “BTC acceptance will promote more payment options for customers and suppliers with potentially less transactional friction inherent to digital currencies.” Nuvve CEO Gregory Poilasne You might also like: Survey reveals over 50% of Americans sell gold or stocks to buy Bitcoin. Is this a good idea? Founded in 2010, Nuvve specializes in vehicle-to-grid technology, which allows EVs to share power with the grid. The company didn’t specify how soon it will start buying Bitcoin or how much it plans to hold long term. Following the news, Nuvve’s shares NVVE rose 1.42% to $2.85 on pre-market trading. By adding BTC to its treasury, Nuvve appears to be following the path of other public companies that have turned to Bitcoin for diversification. For example, Oxbridge Re Holdings Limited, a publicly listed reinsurance and tokenized asset firm, announced earlier in January that it added Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ) to its treasury reserves as a store of value.

With the U.S. DOGE Service now under its wing, the department aims to modernize government functions and drive massive cost reductions across the board. Interestingly, this new change has already benefited the US government within just a week of Trump passing an executive order. According to The Kobeissi Letter , DOGE has reportedly saved the U.S. government $1 billion per day since the new administration took office. If this trend continues, it could reduce the national deficit by $365 billion by January 2026—equivalent to a 20% cut in the FY2024 deficit of $1.8 trillion. For context, the U.S. spent around $850 billion on defense in 2024, meaning DOGE’s savings could cover nearly 43% of that budget. Plus, with U.S. interest payments on debt reaching $882 billion last year, a $365 billion deficit reduction could slash interest costs by over $12 billion annually. DOGE is saving the Federal Government approx. $1 billion/day, mostly from stopping the hiring of people into unnecessary positions, deletion of DEI and stopping improper payments to foreign organizations, all consistent with the President’s Executive Orders. A good start,… — Department of Government Efficiency (@DOGE) January 29, 2025 DOGE pulled off this historic financial feat, with three key moves: freezing non-essential hires, eliminating DEI programs, and cracking down on improper payments abroad. Also by halting unnecessary hires, trimming bureaucratic excess, and ensuring taxpayer dollars don’t vanish into foreign black holes, DOGE claims it’s setting a new standard in fiscal discipline. Hence, if sustained, this could mean approximately $365 billion saved annually—redirected to infrastructure, healthcare, or national security. Could DOGE Impact Interest Rates? The Kobeissi Letter highlights that for DOGE to cut deficit spending by 50%, it must increase daily savings to $2.5 billion. Lower deficit spending could naturally bring down bond yields, reducing interest costs and creating a positive economic cycle. Moreover, rising inflation and deficit spending concerns have pushed the 10-year Treasury yield up by 100 basis points since rate cuts began. If DOGE’s deficit reduction leads to lower government borrowing, yields could stabilize, potentially saving U.S. consumers trillions in interest over the next decade. However, completely eliminating the FY2024 deficit would require cutting $5 billion per day—five times the current rate. The last time the U.S. achieved a budget surplus was in 1998 under Bill Clinton. If successful, Trump and Elon Musk’s DOGE initiative could mark the second such achievement since 1969. While the numbers sound promising, whether DOGE can truly reshape the U.S. economy remains to be seen. Crypto Reaction With the latest development, the market is cheering how DOGE an underdog crypto coin is making waves in the US economy.

On Jan. 29, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart highlighted that Cboe BZX has submitted fresh 19b-4 filings for spot Solana ETFs from Bitwise, VanEck , 21Shares , and Canary Capital, putting the proposals back in front of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for consideration. UPDATE: @CBOE just re-filed all of their Solana ETF 19b-4s for @vaneck_us , @CanaryFunds , @BitwiseInvest & @21Shares pic.twitter.com/CUogAWBl6u — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 28, 2025 A 19b-4 filing is essentially a request by an exchange to list a new product, in this case, a Solana ETF. It kicks off the SEC’s review process, where regulators assess whether the proposal meets securities laws and aligns with investor protection standards. Approval would pave the way for Solana ETFs to trade on traditional stock exchanges. If the SEC rejects the proposal, exchanges aren’t out of options—they can tweak and resubmit their applications to address regulatory concerns. This back-and-forth can go on for multiple rounds, as seen in the case of Bitcoin ETFs before they finally secured approval. For Cboe BZX, this marks the second attempt at getting a Solana ETF through the SEC after its previous bid was rejected late last year. At the time, insider sources claimed the commission had put new crypto ETF applications on hold until Donald Trump officially took office. You might also like: Solana ETF approval by July 2025? Polymarket odds spike The latest filings arrive as the regulatory landscape shifts under the Trump administration, which has signaled a more pro-crypto stance. With SEC Acting Chair Mark Uyeda , known for his industry-friendly approach, overseeing the agency, expectations for crypto ETF approvals are rising. Analysts believe Solana ETFs stand a better chance under the new leadership, though it remains to be seen how quickly the SEC will move on pending applications. Issuers have also sought to expand their suite of crypto products with filings for spot XRP , Litecoin, and Dogecoin ETFs. Biwise, for instance, submitted its S-1 filing for an ETF tracking Dogecoin earlier today. Currently, Polymarket bettors put the odds of a Solana ETF approval by Jul. 31 at 57%, but Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has previously speculated that Litecoin could be next in line. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have drawn in billions, proving that demand for crypto investment products is alive and well. The floodgates opened when the SEC finally greenlit Bitcoin ETFs , with Ethereum quickly following suit. Now, with Solana and other altcoins lining up for their turn, the big question is whether regulators will embrace more crypto-backed products—or keep them waiting at the door.

A recent report revealed that the board of the company has approved the proposal to include BTC in its treasury management program. Interestingly, the announcement has come at a time when corporate crypto adoption is regarded as one of the sensational topics. Read on for all the details. Nuvve Adds Bitcoin to its Treasury It was on January 28 that the global leader in vehicle-to-grid technology announced its decision to include BTC in its treasury. Experts believe that BTC adoption would enable the company to diversify its treasury holdings. Notably, the movie aligns perfectly with the company’s plan to allow BTC as a payment option for its customers and suppliers. In a statement given to media outlets, Nuvve Founder and CEO Gregory Poilasne stated that the BTC adoption move would provide more payment options for customers and suppliers. Nuvve’s 30% of Excess Cash to Go into Bitcoin According to reports, the company is planning to allocate at least 30% of its excess cash for the purpose of purchasing BTC tokens. Sources familiar with the development suggest that for the calculation purpose, the company plans to consider its estimated six-month operating expenses. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitwise Files for Dogecoin ETF: What It Means for Investors & the Crypto Market , Nuvve Market Performance Analysis At the start of this year, the Nuvve stock price was at $3.13.

Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $102,584.12, down by 0.27% over the past 24 hours, though it still shows a 2.77% increase over the last week. Ethereum (ETH) has dropped to $3,141.78. Cardano (ADA) has fallen to $0.9424, showing a 1.13% drop in the past 24 hours, but it remains up by 5.47% over the past seven days. XRP is also down slightly, trading at $3.11, down 0.03% over 24 hours. Cardano Price Analysis As of now, ADA is holding above the 50% retracement level, which has acted as significant support around $0.83. On the resistance side, analyst Josh of Crypto World said that Cardano is facing the “golden pocket” Fibonacci area, sitting between $1.13 and $1.23, which has been a major hurdle. The cryptocurrency is essentially trading sideways between these levels, fluctuating between $0.83 and $1.20, as it struggles to break out in either direction. Despite the sideways price action, the overall trend remains bullish, with ADA continuing to form higher lows and higher highs on the weekly chart. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For January 29 , For a big move higher, Cardano needs to break through the golden pocket resistance. If this happens, the next target would be around $1.70 to $1.76, aligning with the next Fibonacci resistance zone. However, expect continued resistance in the $1.13 to $1.23 range if the price makes its way back there. As always, it’s important to keep an eye on Bitcoin’s price action , as it tends to influence the broader crypto market. Any major movements in Bitcoin could have a ripple effect on ADA and other cryptocurrencies. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As the ADA price and Avalanche hit new strides, excitement is brewing for what’s next. While big players fuel momentum for Ripple and Cardano (ADA), whispers of an emerging project that’s already raised $9.6 million in presale are creating a buzz. Could it rival these giants? Stay tuned as the crypto market heats up with opportunities galore! Crypto whales dive into Rollblock: a game-changing casino with RBLK rewards and stable growth Rollblock is capturing the attention of crypto whales by reimagining the possibilities of online gaming. More than just a gambling platform, it’s a purpose-driven ecosystem that fuses blockchain technology with a rewarding, community-focused experience. By offering RBLK tokens as a stake in its success, Rollblock sets itself apart, providing players with tangible rewards and a sense of ownership.

This stability makes it an enticing investment in an unpredictable market. With innovative features and enhanced loyalty programs, Rollblock isn’t just riding trends—it’s creating them. It’s no surprise that crypto whales are taking notice! ADA price surges ahead: Cardano’s monthly moves keep investors hyped In January, the ADA price displayed strong recovery momentum, climbing from its lows near $0.85 to briefly surpass $1. However, resistance at higher levels triggered a pullback, stabilizing near $0.91. These movements reflect the Cardano (ADA) price’s responsiveness to market dynamics and investor sentiment. Factors such as technological advancements, partnerships, and broader cryptocurrency market trends have influenced ADA’s valuation. Investors are closely monitoring these developments to inform their strategies regarding Cardano’s ADA token. XRP adoption soars: 6.4M wallets and counting XRP has been gaining attention as more people start using its network. The total number of wallets on the XRP Ledger recently went over 6.4 million, showing that more people trust and believe in it. This growth has been steady for years, even when prices didn’t move much. More people using XRP shows that it’s useful and reliable. Experts think it could grow even more if demand stays high and the market stays positive. While there are challenges, XRP’s strong system and support from its community make it a strong contender in the crypto world. Avalanche: scaling up, cashing in, and winning crypto whales Avalanche (AVAX) distinguishes itself by its superior scalability, economic transactions, and energy-efficient blockchain technology, addressing significant difficulties within the cryptocurrency sector. Its distinctive consensus method guarantees swift transaction speeds and dependability, rendering it a favored option for both developers and institutions.

This, combined with the recent Avalanche9000 upgrade that slashes deployment costs and enhances cross-chain communication, has positioned AVAX as a top choice for whales.

39643751,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=664585,1738135641,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39643751.jpeg,AI concerns prompt scientists to push Doomsday Clock to ‘impending catastrophe’ levels,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ai-doomsday-clock-impending-catastrophe/,"The Doomsday Clock is now set at 89 seconds to midnight, the closest it has ever been to implosion. The proximity to midnight reflects the scale of escalating global threats. The clock is a unique timepiece created 78 years ago by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists as a symbol to gauge how close humanity is to destroying the world. Over the past 78 years, the clock’s time has changed according to how close scientists believe the human race has gotten to total destruction. In some years, they adjust the time, and in others, they don’t. The Bulletin’s Science and Security Board consults with its Board of Sponsors to adjust the Doomsday Clock every year. The board was first established by Albert Einstein in December 1948, with J. Robert Oppenheimer as its first chair. It currently includes nine Nobel laureates, many of whom are in physics, physiology, or medicine. The Doomsday Clock is inching closer to midnight For the two years prior, the Bulletin set the clock at 90 seconds to midnight. This was mainly due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the potential of a nuclear arms race, the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza, and the climate crisis. The clock’s main purpose is not to definitively measure existential threats but rather to trigger discussions about difficult scientific topics such as climate change, according to the Bulletin. Daniel Holz, the Bulletin’s science and security board chair and professor in the department of physics, astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago, in a news briefing Tuesday, said that the clock was set closer to midnight because there is now “sufficient, positive progress on the global challenges we face, including nuclear risk, climate change, biological threats and advances in disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence.” “The countries that possess nuclear weapons are increasing the size and role of their arsenals, investing hundreds of billions of dollars in weapons that can destroy civilization many times over,” he added. Progress in the development of disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and in space has also far outpaced regulation in those areas, Holz pointed out. As far as Holz is concerned, these dangers are exacerbated by a potent threat multiplier — “the spread of misinformation, disinformation and conspiracy theories that degrade the communication ecosystem and increasingly blur the line between truth and falsehood.” Artificial intelligence now affects the Doomsday Clock Many factors influence the doomsday clock, but the latest and perhaps most influential is the threat of AI. AI has evolved into an analog of an arms race as countries scramble to dominate the field. This has led to the start of an AI Cold War— geopolitical tensions between the United States and China focused on the competition for dominance in artificial intelligence technology. The AI Cold War goes back to 2018, when China announced its AI Development Plan aimed at global leadership by 2030. Since then, the US has hit China with waves of sanctions and bans to limit the Asian nation’s access to recent and high-performing GPUs. That fight took on a different dimension with the release of DeepSeek, China’s alternative to all the language models the US has shipped. DeepSeek has stolen the spotlight for performing on par with leading AI models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT while costing only $6 million to train, a fraction of the over $100 million OpenAI spends on similar models. The app’s success has raised national security concerns in the US, with many worried about data privacy and the potential for Chinese influence through AI technology. If the clock ever strikes midnight Stakeholders expect the latest development will only supercharge the AI Cold War as the US tries to reclaim its lead. The potential fallout from an unhinged pursuit of AI dominance is why the Doomsday Clock is now 89 seconds to midnight. Scientists hope the Doomsday Clock will once again start discussions that lead to peaceful resolutions. Midnight represents the moment at which people will have made the Earth uninhabitable. According to Bulletin president and CEO Rachel Bronson, the clock has never reached midnight, and she hopes it never will. “When the clock is at midnight, that means there’s been some sort of nuclear exchange or catastrophic climate change that’s wiped out humanity,” she said. “We never really want to get there, and we won’t know it when we do.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Are You Making These Web3 Resume Mistakes? - Find Out Here",AI|DeepSeek|OpenAI|University of Chicago,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-29 07:27:21

You’re not alone. The truth is, that many people slept on these opportunities and missed their shot at financial freedom. But guess what? History has a funny way of repeating itself, and it’s giving you a second chance with BTFD Coin (BTFD) . This groundbreaking meme coin has already raised over $5.7 million in its presale, with over 67 billion tokens sold to more than 9,700 holders. Currently priced at just $0.00016, BTFD is set to skyrocket to $0.0006 upon listing—a 275% ROI waiting for savvy investors who act fast. With its live Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, jaw-dropping staking rewards, and a referral program that’s a game-changer, BTFD Coin is the ultimate crypto to watch in 2025. BTFD Coin: The Ultimate Meme Coin Revolution BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a full-blown movement. Drawing inspiration from the legendary “ Buy The Dip ” mantra, BTFD empowers its community to see market dips as golden opportunities. Let’s dive into why this presale is turning heads. The Undeniable Buzz Around BTFD The presale started with a humble price of $0.000004 and has already surged to $0.00016 as it enters its 14th stage. With a listing price of $0.0006, early investors stand to gain a jaw-dropping 275% ROI. Imagine this: a $35,000 investment today would be worth a staggering $131,250 when BTFD hits its listing price. The Referral Program: Earn While You Share BTFD’s referral program is a masterstroke in community engagement and reward distribution: Top 20 Rewards: Earn 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens if your referral code ranks in the top 20. Referral Perks: Friends using your code to purchase $50 or more receive an extra 10% in BTFD tokens . Real-Time Leaderboard: Track your rankings and watch your rewards grow. For instance, if your referral code generates $10,000 in sales, you’d earn $1,000 in BTFD tokens. It’s like building your own crypto empire while sharing the wealth. Play-to-Earn Game and Staking Rewards Starting January 1, 2025, BTFD’s P2E game has captivated the crypto gaming world. Players can earn BTFD tokens as they conquer challenges, leveling up their gaming experience while stacking up real rewards. Plus, staking offers an unbeatable 90% APY, turning HODLing into a passive income goldmine. Why BTFD is the Top New Meme Coin to Join This Week With its explosive presale momentum , innovative P2E gaming ecosystem, and lucrative referral program, BTFD Coin is set to dominate in 2025. Don’t miss the dip—this rocket’s about to launch. NEIRO: A Millionaire-Maker You Slept On If you missed NEIRO (NEIRO), you’re not alone—but you can’t afford to let it happen again. Launched in 2024, NEIRO quickly became a standout in the meme coin landscape, leveraging its vibrant community and unique utility features to gain traction. A Bit of History NEIRO’s presale started at a modest $0.000005. Early adopters watched their investments skyrocket as the token hit its all-time high of $0.09 within months, yielding returns of over 1,700x. It’s no wonder NEIRO investors are still basking in their success. Where NEIRO Stands Today As of now, NEIRO trades at approximately $0.0309, reflecting the enduring appeal of the token. With a capped supply of 420 billion tokens, NEIRO has carved out a loyal community that believes in its long-term potential. However, like all meme coins, the best gains were for those who got in early. The Lesson from NEIRO If you’re kicking yourself for missing out on NEIRO’s meteoric rise, let this be your wake-up call. The market doesn’t wait, but it does offer second chances—if you’re ready to act. BTFD Coin is your shot at redemption. Why BTFD Coin Could Deliver Even Bigger Than NEIRO The crypto world thrives on momentum, innovation, and community. BTFD Coin embodies all three. While NEIRO made its mark in 2024, BTFD is primed to steal the spotlight in 2025 with its multifaceted ecosystem and community-driven rewards program. A Tale of Two Coins NEIRO: Early adopters struck gold, but opportunities for massive ROI are limited as the token matures. BTFD: Still in its presale, BTFD offers unmatched entry points with the potential for explosive growth. Community Power Both coins owe their success to strong community backing, but BTFD’s referral program takes engagement to the next level, incentivizing not just participation but active promotion. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Your Second Chance They say lightning doesn’t strike the same place twice, but in crypto, it often does—if you know where to look. NEIRO was the goldmine of 2024, but the spotlight now shines on BTFD Coin . With its explosive presale, innovative gaming and staking rewards, and a referral program that could redefine crypto marketing, BTFD is hands down the top new meme coin to join this week. Don’t let FOMO paralyze you again. Sign up for the BTFD presale today and secure your stake before the price soars. The clock is ticking—are you in?

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As meme coins like TRUMP and DOGE struggle to maintain their dominance, 1Fuel, with its real-world use cases and growing adoption, stands out as a strong contender. Table of Contents TRUMP fails to hold up price action DOGE’s rally hope crashes Use cases to drive 1Fuel’s growth Conclusion With no inherent value, meme coin tokens in the market are gradually fading out and losing control. TRUMP and DOGE, which both had a leading reign in the market, are caught in this market downturn as the market shifts towards utility tokens with long-term value, such as 1Fuel. 1Fuel’s real-world use cases are shielded from the bearish sentiment in the market, as more buyers step in, a clear testament to its total token sales of $1.55 million. Analysts believe 1Fuel’s use cases, particularly in the crypto market with adoption on the rise, would play a major role in analysts’ projected 5,000% rally. TRUMP fails to hold up price action TRUMP has failed to get the goods well off the market, as the sentiment across multiple indicators shows its current bearish downturn could intensify soon. At the time of writing, CoinMarketCap reports TRUMP to have dropped by a total of 38.46% in the past week, bringing its current price to $26.37. A study of the Binance TRUMP/USDT chart shows the asset has declined past its listing price of $27.25, after it rallied to $77.24, reaching an all-time high. The possibility of a TRUMP rally remains slim, as no clear patterns are forming on the chart to hint at a possible market reversal. Should this continue, the asset would continue on its downward path. DOGE ‘s rally hope crashes DOGE investors have lost hope for a market bounce-back following the recent crash in the market. According to CoinMarketCap, DOGE has dropped 7.13% in the past 24 hours, an extension of its 9.23% market decline in the past week. A study of the 1-day chart in TradingView shows that this decline has been facilitated by DOGE losing the support level of the accumulation channel in which it trades. This month-long accumulation channel, technically called the symmetrical triangle, began formation on 23 November 2024 and was expected to catalyze upward price movement, but it has failed. Memecoins, like DOGE and TRUMP, have turned out not to be the best cryptocurrency investment for investors this season compared to 1Fuel, with a 5,000% potential on the horizon. Use cases to drive 1Fuel’s growth The hype and interest in 1Fuel have been due to the cryptocurrency wallet that’s currently in development. This cryptocurrency wallet is expected to launch with several market features that are unique, and their combination together makes it distinct. Actions such as cross-chain transactions of tokens would be completed within seconds with just a single click. Other features include temporary wallets for private token transactions or other business-specific purposes, privacy mixers to protect trade and maintain anonymity, and a cold storage option to better safeguard assets against hacks, among others. Analysts believe these are use cases that would lead to 1Fuel’s use and its wallet’s growth and adoption as well. With these activities going on, the price of 1Fuel will likely see a significant move to the upside. The potential target from this point on, analysts say, is a 5,000% price swing, taking 1Fuel from its current price of $0.017 to $0.85 and eventually above $1. Conclusion Investing in 1Fuel has been made easy, as all fundamental and technical indicators in the market show it’s the most promising crypto investment this bull season. With 53.4% of 1Fuel left in stage 3 of its presale and tokens being purchased faster than ever, Its price is likely to rise again soon from the current price of $0.017.

Is Bitcoin doomed? No, really? If you are not familiar with Jim Cramer yet, you probably don’t know why his investment bets are talked about massively on the web but are hardly taken seriously. Long story short, some of Cramer’s predictions were 180 degrees from what happened. His reputation as the man whose market forecasts are fully opposite to what comes after is outstanding and meme-rich. On Jan. 27, 2025, answering the TV viewer’s call, Cramer said, “If you wanna own Bitcoin, own Bitcoin. I own Bitcoin, you should own Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a great thing to add.” The crypto community expresses disturbance, as Cramer’s praise for Bitcoin may suggest that Bitcoin is on the brink of collapse. On the other hand, Cramer’s distaste for MSTR gives MicroStrategy bulls reasons for optimism as if Cramer is wrong again, MSTR is about to moon. Table of Contents Who is Jim Cramer? Inverse Jim Cramer ETF Do people really believe that Cramer is always saying the opposite of what is about to come? Who is Jim Cramer? Jim Cramer is a TV personality with a background in hedge investment. Cramer hosts the Mad Money segment on CNBC and writes for TheStreet.com, which he also co-founded. He is famously expressive as a host and regularly gives out turbo-confident stock picks (on TV, on X, and elsewhere). As mentioned above, he was often bullish on weak investments and sceptical towards those about to show their strength. If you need a clear example of Jim as a lousy market forecaster, we can recall what he said one year before his latest statement, in which he urges people to buy Bitcoin. In January 2024 he said that Bitcoin is “topping out.” One year later, the Bitcoin value has doubled. Read more: Jim Cramer switches stances, now says Bitcoin is topping out People who follow the Bitcoin price trends know that predicting the BTC crash within 18 months after the halving is pure madness. It takes all the historical data to ignore to say that Bitcoin is going to leave soon, months before halving. However, Cramer did it and made people think his bets were random once again. What’s more funny is that days before the “topping out” prediction, he claimed that “Bitcoin is here to stay.” A true legend. Legend pic.twitter.com/sYRWBKhXuL — Inverse Cramer (@CramerTracker) May 25, 2023 Other notable bloopers include the urge to invest in Silicon Valley Bank weeks before its collapse, the Nvidia wrongs saga (see the tweet above), and calls to dump Netflix (in 2012) and Hewlett Packard (in 2012) months before these stocks doubled. Inverse Jim Cramer ETF No wonder Cramer soon deserved an “inverse indicator” fame, meaning that you should listen to Cramer and act straight opposite to what he says. If Jim is bullish on some stock, sell it! If he considers some asset irrelevant, it’s time to buy! Rather, this attitude was a joke, but the X account named Inverse Cramer, posting the Cramer picks-related tweets, gained over 320k followers. To make things more mind-blowing, in 2022, Tuttle Capital Management released the notorious Inverse Jim Cramer ETF comprised of stocks Jim was sceptical about! The ETF has been updating quickly as Cramer delivered more and more stock picks, sometimes flipping his sentiment towards some of the investments. That was crazy. The Inverse Jim Cramer ETF was closed about a year after its launch, outliving the Long Cramer Tracker ETF, though, an ETF that genuinely followed Cramer’s advice. According to Tuttle, the “inverse Jim” was closed because updating the contents of this ETF was really hard, while the assets under management value was pretty low at around $2 million. Do people really believe that Cramer is always saying the opposite of what is about to come? Jokes aside, Cramer is a seasoned professional with a degree from Harvard and a Goldman Sachs background. It is rather the format of Mad Money that makes him look strange and funny because he has to pick too many stocks every week and comment on the stocks requested by the people who call CNBC to ask Cramer’s opinion. Like many professionals, Cramer can be wrong, and that’s alright. One of the proofs of Cramer’s decency is the fact that the Inverse Jim Cramer ETF did pretty badly. It existed for too little time to judge, but during the lifetime of this ETF, its result was actually negative. At the end of its existence, it was 15% down against the 25% S&P 500 gain for the same period. As always i welcome people betting against me. I have done this for 42 years. Those who know me know that you would have been betting against Apple at 5, Google since inception, Meta at $18, Amazon at ten, Nvidia at $25 and AMD at $5. i welcome all comers.. — Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) October 7, 2022 It explains well why the crypto community meets Cramer’s praise for Bitcoin with an easy heart, posting memes about the soon Bitcoin crash without taking this probability at face value.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin is trying hard to hold its momentum above $100K. This surge in value is partly attributed to the broader market response to Donald Trump’s election. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential of holding above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price struggles to hold above resistance Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that BTC faces selling pressure as it aims for a move above $103K. In recent hours, the price of BTC faced multiple rejections and is struggling below that resistance channel. The 24-hour volume has surged to $1.97 billion, raising interest in trading today. BTC is trading at $102,516, dropping by over 0.8% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin shows volatility The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level but trades above the buying region at 54, hinting that a bullish pressure is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $103,583, it will fuel a bullish rally to $107,543. BTC/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $98,197, beginning a bearish trend to $94,949. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin makes it a good investment option. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is Bitcoin down today? Despite Trump signing multiple executive orders favoring crypto, the market failed to gain much momentum. This resulted in a steep decline in the BTC price chart. Will BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, forming a new ATH. The price is currently aiming to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 Million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC SoSoValue data shows Bitcoin ETFs netted $5.32 million on Jan. 1, led by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund with $37 million in inflows. FBTC’s total assets stand at $18.9 billion, edging closer to the $20 billion mark. Bitcoin price prediction January 2025 December was a bullish month for Bitcoin, characterized by significant upswings. Will BTC price establish a new ATH in January 2025? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to surge toward $100,000 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $108,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation of around $91K. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction January 2025 $91,000 $100,000 $108,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Bitcoin spot ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $95,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF demand might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum price of $160,000, with a minimum price of $95,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, the future market potential for Bitcoin entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation and investor sentiment in long-term holding. We expect Bitcoin price to create a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC is trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-29 07:39:56

While the revelation from the Chinese startup has been a major hiccup for US stocks in the near term, President Donald Trump said it will only prove to be a tailwind for the AI space at large. His recent comment bodes well not just for the AI stocks but other platforms committed to leveraging artificial intelligence as well – and that includes the up-and-coming iDEGEN . Could DeepSeek be a tailwind for iDEGEN? Global artificial intelligence stocks tanked in an initial response to DeepSeek as its latest model questions if high-end chips and advanced resources are required to build and operate AI. However, the US President dubbed it a “wake-up” call for the US based tech companies and urged their executives to focus on innovation in order to stay competitive in this fast-growing market. What that means is: capital is perhaps going to continue to pour into AI projects in pursuit of building even more powerful models and expanding use cases. After all, Statista forecasts this market to grow at a compound annualised rate of more than 27% through the end of this decade. So, it’s a given that the AI market is still in its early innings only. That makes investing in iDEGEN today an exciting proposition since some of that capital could very well find its way to this artificial intelligence enabled platform. If you’d like to know more about iDEGEN and explore the opportunity of investing in its native crypto token, click here to visit the project website now. Should you invest in iDEGEN in 2025? iDEGEN is an AI meme coin that’s turned quite a few heads in recent weeks. Its ongoing presale has already raised more than $18 million, suggesting the investment community is super interested in this crypto project that simultaneously offers exposure to artificial intelligence as well. iDEGEN relies on AI to learn from what the community is posting and commenting on “X” – the social media website that Elon Musk bought for $44 billion in 2022. Following the presale, this meme coin will list on a crypto exchange, potentially attracting a lot more investors to eventually command a higher price tag. All in all, iDEGEN may be worth investing this year since it could benefit as the US President Donald Trump continues to deliver on his promise of making America the leader in emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies.

Dennis Porter , co-founder and CEO of Satoshi Action Fund, noted on X that Utah is the second U.S. state to advance such a bill past committee approval. On Jan. 28, the Utah House Economic Development Committee passed HB 230, the Blockchain and Digital Innovation Amendments, with an 8-1 vote. Introduced by Representative Jordan Teuscher on Jan. 21, the bill would authorize the state treasurer to allocate up to 5% of select public funds into “qualifying digital assets”, including cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization exceeding $500 billion and certain approved stablecoins. A revised version of the bill, known as the second substitute, was updated on Jan. 28 to include provisions regarding crypto mining zoning restrictions. The measure now moves to the full House, where it must secure majority approval before advancing to the Senate. If passed, both chambers will send it to the governor for approval or veto. Utah advances legislation to allow state investment in cryptocurrencies According to Bitcoin Reserve Monitor, several U.S. states have introduced legislation allowing local treasuries to invest in cryptocurrencies. “While Utah is the 11th state to introduce similar legislation, we will be the first to pass it,” Teuscher posted on X on Jan. 21. Under Utah’s bill, the state’s digital assets would be required to be held through secure custody solutions, qualified custodians, or exchange-traded products. In addition to that, the bill also establishes the Treasurer of the State as the custodian of digital assets and allows the state to stake and lend crypto assets subject to certain conditions. Furthermore, the legislation prohibits state and local governments from regulating or restricting the use of cryptocurrency to pay for lawful goods and services. Upon receiving the governor’s approval, the law will become effective on May 7, 2024. Spencer Cox has shown some pro-crypto stance in the past, having signed a bill creating a Blockchain and Digital Innovation Task Force in 2022. South Dakota joins growing state-led push for a Bitcoin reserve Nations worldwide are increasingly considering adopting a strategic Bitcoin reserve, driven in part by U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. In recent months, multiple U.S. states have introduced and passed Bitcoin-related legislation. A few hours ago, South Dakota joined the movement, unveiling its own Bitcoin proposal. In a recent post on X, South Dakota State Representative Logan Manhart expressed his intent to introduce a strategic Bitcoin reserve, calling it a rare opportunity for the state to take a proactive approach. He said he was proud to introduce a bill in the South Dakota House that would create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. He noted that now is one of the few chances the government has to be proactive. These developments highlight a growing trend among U.S. states, with at least 12 states having already proposed or passed Bitcoin-related legislation. These include Utah, South Dakota, Florida, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, Massachusetts, and Arizona.

39643830,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=685321,1738137628,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/39643830.jpeg,"Buy Bitcoin If This Happens, Says Arthur Hayes",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/buy-bitcoin-if-this-happens-arthur-hayes/,"Arthur Hayes, the Chief Investment Officer at Maelstrom and co-Founder as well as former CEO of BitMEX, has published a new essay titled “The Ugly,” in which he contends that Bitcoin could be poised for a profound near-term pullback before ultimately marching to unprecedented highs. While retaining his characteristic bluntness, Hayes lays out two scenarios when to buy Bitcoin. Buy Bitcoin If This Happens Hayes’ essay begins by recounting a sudden shift in sentiment that caught him off guard. Comparing financial analysis to backcountry skiing on a dormant volcano, Hayes recalls how the mere hint of avalanche danger once forced him to stop and reassess. He expresses a similarly uneasy feeling about current monetary conditions, an intuition he says he last felt in late 2021, right before the crypto markets collapsed from their record highs. “Subtle movements between central bank balance sheet levels, the rate of banking credit expansion, the relationship between the US 10-yr treasury/stocks/Bitcoin prices, and the insane TRUMP memecoin price action produced a pit in my stomach,” he writes, emphasizing that these signals collectively remind him of the market’s precarious situation prior to the 2022 and 2023 downturns. He clarifies that he does not believe the broader bull cycle is finished, but he anticipates that Bitcoin could drop to somewhere around the $70,000 to $75,000 range before rallying sharply to reach $250,000 by year’s end. Related Reading: DeepSeek Predicts Bitcoin Bull Run Peak At $500,000 – Here’s When He describes this range as plausible given that equity markets and treasury markets appear, in his words, deeply entangled in a “filthy fiat” environment still grappling with the vestiges of inflation and rising interest rates. Hayes points out that Maelstrom, his investment firm, remains net long while simultaneously raising its holdings in the USDe stablecoins to buy back Bitcoin if price falls below $75,000. In his view, scaling back risk in the short term allows him to preserve capital that can later be deployed when a genuine market liquidation occurs. He identifies a 30% correction from current levels as a distinct possibility, while also acknowledging that the bullish momentum could continue. “if Bitcoin trades through $110,000 on strong volume with an expanding perp open interest, then I’ll throw in the towel and buy back risk higher,” he writes on his second scenario. In attempting to decipher why a temporary pullback might happen, Hayes asserts that major central banks—the Federal Reserve in the United States, the People’s Bank of China, and the Bank of Japan—are either curbing money creation or, in some cases, outright raising the price of money by permitting yields to rise. He believes that these shifts could choke off speculative capital that has elevated both stocks and cryptocurrencies in recent months. His discussion of the US focuses on two interlocked perspectives: that ten-year treasury yields could rise to a zone between 5% and 6%, and that the Federal Reserve, while hostile to Donald Trump’s administration, will not hesitate to reinitiate printing if it becomes essential to preserve American financial stability. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finally Turns $100K Into Support – Ready To Rally Higher? However, he believes that at some point, the financial system will need an intervention—most likely an exemption to the Supplemental Leverage Ratio (SLR) or a new wave of quantitative easing. He contends that the reluctance or slowness of the Fed to take these steps increases the probability of a near-term bond market sell-off, which could weigh on equities, and by correlation, Bitcoin. His political analysis homes in on the lingering enmity between Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, as well as the Fed’s willingness to forestall a crisis during the Biden presidency. He cites statements from former Fed governor William Dudley and references Powell’s press conference remarks that suggested the Fed might alter its approach based on Trump’s policies. Hayes describes these tensions as a backdrop for a scenario in which Trump might allow a mini-financial crisis to unfold, forcing the Fed’s hand. Under such stress, the Fed would have little choice but to prevent a broader meltdown, and monetary expansion could then follow. He suggests that it would be politically expedient for the Trump administration to permit yields to surge to crisis levels if it meant that the Fed would be compelled to pivot into the large-scale money printing that many in crypto circles expect. China, Hayes remarks, had seemed poised to join the liquidity party with an explicit reflation program until a sudden U-turn in January, when the PBOC halted its bond-buying program and allowed the yuan to stabilize in a stronger position. He attributes this policy change to internal political pressures or possibly strategic maneuvering for future negotiations with Trump. Hayes also acknowledges that some readers might find the correlation between Bitcoin and traditional risk assets perplexing, given the long-term argument that Bitcoin is a unique store of value. Yet he points to charts showing a rising 30-day correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100. In the short term, he says, the leading cryptocurrency remains sensitive to changes in fiat liquidity, even if the coin ultimately trades on an uncorrelated basis over extended time horizons. He thus portrays Bitcoin as a leading indicator: if bond yields spike and equity markets tumble, Bitcoin could begin its dive before tech stocks follow. Hayes thinks that once authorities unleash renewed monetary stimulus to quell volatility, Bitcoin would be the first to bottom out and rebound. He admits that predicting exact outcomes is impossible and that any investor must play perceived probabilities rather than certainties. His decision to hedge is derived from the concept of expected value. If he believes there is a substantial chance of a 30% pullback versus a smaller probability that Bitcoin will continue higher before he decides to buy back in at a 10% premium, reducing exposure still yields a better risk-reward ratio. “Trading isn’t about being right or wrong,” he emphasizes, “but about trading perceived probabilities and maximizing expected value.” He also underscores that this protective stance allows him to wait for the kind of dramatic liquidation move in altcoins that often accompanies a short-term Bitcoin collapse, a scenario he calls “Armageddon” in the so-called “shitcoin space.” In such circumstances, he wants ample funds available to pick up fundamentally sound tokens at severely depressed prices. At press time, BTC traded at $102,530.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 533,100 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is in week 14 of its price discovery phase – a bull market stage that began when Bitcoin eclipsed its previous cycle’s all-time high late last year. According to the trader, historical data suggests that BTC may be a couple of weeks away from starting its next leg up. “In Week 14 of the 2017 cycle, Bitcoin was recovering from its first Price Discovery Correction only to make new highs in Week 16. In Week 14 of the 2021 cycle, Bitcoin was still just bottoming on its first Price Discovery Correction only to make new highs in Week 16. It’s Week 14 right now.” Rekt Capital notes that traders who refuse to unload their BTC stack amid the correction will likely be rewarded in the coming weeks. “Based on this data, here is how to approach these upcoming weeks in Price Discovery when it comes to Bitcoin: Weeks 14-15 = Patiently HODL (hold on for dear life) Weeks 16+ = Optimistic On Confirmation Of The 2nd Price Discovery Uptrend.” The trader also highlights that he thinks the Bitcoin bull market has a long way to go. “It is still relatively early on in the BTC Parabolic Phase of this cycle. Historically, this phase has lasted on average ~300 days. Bitcoin is on Day 82 of its Parabolic Phase.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $101,163.

Solaxy’s ICO has surpassed $15 million, drawing investor interest as it aims to solve Solana’s congestion issues and boost scalability. Table of Contents Solana’s path to $400 and beyond Solaxy: Strengthening Solana’s ecosystem Investors rush to participate in Solaxy’s presale The Solaxy (SOLX) presale has reached a significant milestone, surpassing $15.6 million in total funding. This marks a sharp rise from last Monday’s $12.4 million, showcasing the growing enthusiasm among investors. The surge in interest coincides with Solana’s (SOL) recent network congestion, driven by heightened activity following the launch of Trump-themed meme coins. Despite these challenges, the outlook for SOL remains optimistic, with market data suggesting it could hit $400 by February. Key factors driving this bullish sentiment include increased network activity, the rising popularity of meme coins, upcoming Solana ETFs, and reports of an altcoin reserve fund associated with Donald Trump, aimed at supporting US-based cryptocurrencies like Solana and Ripple (XRP) . As the first-ever Layer-2 scaling solution for Solana, Solaxy is also poised to benefit from the growing adoption of the network. With a presale price of just $0.001616, SOLX offers early investors an opportunity to participate in an up-and-coming project poised to redefine Solana’s scalability. Solana’s path to $400 and beyond Solana recently hit a record high of $293, fueled by demand for meme coins like Official Trump (TRUMP) and Official Melania (MELANIA) . These tokens generated billions in trading volume during their launch despite causing temporary network congestion. Investors are confident in SOL, as demonstrated by large OTC deals. One noteworthy development last week was a major SOL options block trade on Deribit, executed via the OTC network Paradigm. The trade speculates on a 60.3% price increase, with SOL projected to hit $400 by February. Deribit @DeribitExchange options suggest traders are preparing for a $400 $SOL by end of February.

Solaxy’s Layer-2 solution is poised to play a critical role in addressing these challenges, enhancing transaction efficiency and stability during periods of high demand. Solaxy: Strengthening Solana’s ecosystem Solaxy is designed to tackle Solana’s recurring congestion issues, ensuring the network remains reliable during peak usage. By reducing transaction failures and improving user experience, Solaxy positions itself as a vital extension of Solana’s infrastructure. As meme coins like TRUMP and MELANIA drive network demand, Solaxy’s capabilities further enhance Solana’s reputation for high-speed, low-cost transactions. This synergy between Solana and Solaxy is expected to lead to parallel growth for both platforms, with Solaxy amplifying Solana’s strengths while carving its own path in the market. Crypto influencer ClayBro highlighted that the demand for TRUMP and MELANIA has accelerated Solaxy’s presale progress, adding to its momentum. Should SOL reach $400, SOLX is well-positioned to deliver significant returns for its investors. Investors rush to participate in Solaxy’s presale Investors can support Solaxy’s integration into the Solana ecosystem by participating in its presale. In order to participate in the presale, investors can simply visit the official Solaxy website, where they can connect their wallets and purchase SOLX tokens directly using SOL. For a more streamlined experience, investors can also use Best Wallet, a next-generation multichain wallet tailored to the dynamic crypto market. Supporting both Ethereum and Solana, Best Wallet offers low transaction fees, seamless cross-chain integration, and powerful tools like its project screener, designed to spotlight promising investments.

She has filed an amicus curiae brief in the case Coinbase vs SEC at the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, opposing what she calls an unlawful power grab. Lummis criticizes the SEC’s aggressive tactics under Chair Gary Gensler, accusing the agency of secretly redefining laws like the Howey Test. This test determines whether an asset qualifies as an investment contract, but the SEC has been applying it in ways that Congress never intended. According to Lummis, this approach forces digital asset exchanges to comply with regulations that have never been properly debated or approved by lawmakers. She argues that only Congress has the constitutional authority to define whether digital assets should be treated as securities or commodities. The SEC, she warns, is overstepping its role by stretching nearly 100-year-old laws to fit new technologies. This could have severe consequences for the digital asset industry, potentially slowing innovation and creating legal uncertainty. Lummis believes the SEC’s tactics undermine the fundamental separation of powers. She points out that even Gensler himself admitted in 2021 that Congress—not the SEC—should establish the rules for digital assets. Despite this, the SEC has continued to expand its influence, using outdated legal interpretations to regulate an industry that operates in a completely different technological landscape. If the court sides with Coinbase, the decision could provide much-needed clarity on the SEC’s regulatory limits . Lummis warns that without intervention, the SEC’s unchecked power could stifle growth in the industry and make it difficult for businesses to navigate the unclear legal landscape. Coinbase recently secured a partial victory in its battle with the SEC. The US Court of Appeals ruled that the SEC had not provided a strong enough explanation for denying Coinbase’s request for clear regulatory guidelines. This ruling could influence the ongoing case and force the SEC to clarify its position. With multiple lawsuits challenging the SEC’s authority, the outcome of this case could have far-reaching implications. Lummis hopes her intervention will help establish clear legal boundaries and protect innovation in the digital asset sector.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-29 08:08:23

A deep dive into the L1 blockchain,https://crypto.news/what-is-sui-how-does-it-work/,"Boasting a 1300% increase in its price, the SUI token is one of the most talked about crypto assets of 2024. Sui ( SUI ) is a layer-1 blockchain that aims to onboard the next billion users in Web3. The blockchain claims to be a ‘Scalable infrastructure that’s fast, secure, and affordable’ Table of Contents What is Sui? History and Background How does SUI work? Price History of SUI In this article, we’ll learn what is SUI, the history of the SUI blockchain, how it works, and the price history of the SUI token. What is Sui? The Sui (SUI) blockchain is a platform designed to emphasize scalability for its decentralized applications (dApps) and shorten the time it takes for smart contracts to execute. SUI offers several architectural ideas to boost its speed and scalability without compromising the blockchain’s security, setting it apart from other blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Polkadot. These consist of the Move smart contract programming language, parallel transaction processing, and the Sui consensus motor. Validators can stake the SUI cryptocurrency, the platform’s native cryptocurrency, to verify transactions using Sui’s delegated proof of stake (dPoS) network. Additionally, SUI connects the platform by serving as a means of trade, executing bespoke programs, and rewarding users who contribute to its advancement. Now that we know what is SUI used for, let’s discuss its history and background. You might also like: Sui resumes strong uptrend, soars by over 1,300% from lowest level History and Background In August 2022, Sui debuted its incentive-based testnet, and its mainnet became active on May 3, 2023. Mysten Labs , which is headed by a number of former top officials from Meta’s now-defunct Novi digital wallet initiative, is developing the blockchain. In September 2022, Mysten Labs secured $300 million in a Series B fundraising round to create the blockchain. Well-known venture investors including Circle, Binance Labs , Lightspeed Venture Partners, a16z, and NCSoft support the business. The Sui Foundation, on the other hand, is a stand-alone entity that aids the community and its initiatives. Its goal is to accelerate the worldwide adoption of the Sui blockchain in order to enroll the next billion people in Web3. How does SUI work? SUI has a distinct consensus and transaction processing technique than other blockchains. Conventional blockchain validators add transactions to the blockchain in a sequential manner, which limits the blockchain’s scalability and makes it difficult to accelerate the incremental additions known as vertical scaling. SUI eliminates the need for every transaction to be verified by every node in the network since many transactions are inherently unrelated to one another. Rather than confirming the full chain, it merely looks at the pertinent piece of data. Furthermore, it uses an object-centric paradigm, which centers the chain data storage around things rather than accounts, to do this effectively. Instead of needing to arrange every transaction as in the conventional blockchain paradigm, SUI nodes can validate uncorrelated transaction flows independently and separately because of this innovative kind of data storage. The whole transaction broadcasting and validation process starts with a sender broadcasting the transaction to all validators. Following this, validators verify the transaction for validity, analyze the stake of the validators, and send their weighted votes based on the stake. After gathering a Byzantine-resistant majority, the sender broadcasts the outcome to validators in the form of a certificate. SUI is likely able to achieve transaction rates of more than 100,000 transactions per second as a result. Price History of SUI The SUI cryptocurrency registered its all-time low on Oct. 19, 2023, at $0.3643, and since then the token has experienced an increase of 1000%, registering an all-time high of $5.35 on Jan 06, 2025. At the time of writing, the SUI token is trading at $3.76, with a market cap of $11.32 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $921.68 million. SUI token Weekly chart | Source: Tradingview Looking at the chart of the SUI token we can see a formation of higher highs and higher lows which is a sign of a bullish continuation. For long-term buyers, it may be a good time to wait for the 0.5 and 0.618 fibs, also known as the golden fib zone, as it is also correlated with a major support zone of the SUI token. It should be noted that this price analysis can be wrong as the crypto market is also heavily dependent on fundamental factors and you should do research before investing in this token.

MystenLabs, a business started by Evan Cheng, Adeniyi Abiodun, Sam Blackshear, George Danezis, and Kostas Chalkias, is responsible for developing Sui. In addition to the now-defunct Facebook wallet program Novi, the founders comprised a group of executives and architects that spearheaded the creation of the Diem blockchain and stablecoin payment system. Is SUI secure? The SUI blockchain does claim to be secure with a variety of security features including fault tolerance, native object ownership, Sui Guardians, third-party audits, security issue reporting form, and the use of Move programming language, all of which adds to the security of this layer-1 blockchain. Is SUI legal/legit? Yes, the SUI token is legal and legitimate in any country where cryptocurrencies are allowed. To avoid any legal hassles in the future, it is advisable to do your research before investing in this token or any crypto asset as per your country of residence. What makes SUI unique? SUI claims to offer high scalability, an object-centric data storage model, and parallel transaction processing. It also claims to have the ability to process over 100,000 transactions per second which makes it one of the fastest blockchains on which many decentralized applications can be built and operated seamlessly. How many SUI coins are there? The SUI token has a total supply of 10 billion tokens, of which 3 billion are in circulation. The max supply is also set to 10 billion which means that the SUI team cannot mint any tokens over the 10 billion mark. As the team releases more supply into the market, the price of the token may be affected, hence it is advisable to do research before investing in this token.",Learn|layer 1|Sui|Web3,EN,0,0,SUI|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-29 08:09:29

Around this bearish call, Trump’s Bitcoin Strategy picking pace with 13 US states planning to create a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve out of them Arizona and Utah are leading the race. In the meanwhile Bitcoin is riding above the $100K mark with a slight decline today it is currently trading at $102,684. Utah’s House Economic Development Committee has passed a bill allowing the state to invest in cryptocurrencies. The bill, HB 230, passed with an 8-1 vote on January 28 and now heads to the full House for a vote. If approved by both the House and Senate, it will be sent to Governor Spencer Cox, who is known for his pro-crypto stance. Key Details of the Bill Dennis Porter, CEO & Co-Founder, SatoshiActFund announced on X that the Utah House Committee had approved the “Blockchain and Digital Innovation Bill,” which includes a provision for adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Porter highlighted that the support for the bill was “overwhelming,” signaling strong backing for crypto adoption at the state level. Thrilled to join with @Dennis_Porter_ to announce HB230 which will allow the state to invest in digital assets. While Utah is the 11th state to introduce similar legislation, we will be the first to pass it. Utah continues to lead the nation in blockchain and digital innovation! https://t.co/mBTt12UaQw — Jordan Teuscher (@jordanteuscher) January 21, 2025 The bill, introduced by Representative Jordan Teuscher, gives Utah’s treasurer the authority to invest up to 5% of certain public funds into “qualifying digital assets.” These assets include major cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of over $500 billion and approved stablecoins. The bill also allows the state to engage in crypto staking and lending under specific conditions. The bill mandates that the state’s digital assets be held securely through qualified custodians, exchange-traded products, or secure custody solutions. Plus, it prohibits state and local governments from restricting the acceptance of cryptocurrencies for legal goods and services. This ensures that crypto can be used for transactions within Utah. Crypto Initiatives Gaining Momentum Utah is one of several states exploring the use of public funds for crypto investments. Twelve other states, including neighboring Arizona and Wyoming, have introduced similar bills. Utah’s bill is poised to be the first to pass out of committee, and if it becomes law, it will take effect on May 7. Growing Support for State Crypto Investments Governor Spencer Cox’s previous support for blockchain initiatives, such as signing a bill to create a Blockchain and Digital Innovation Task Force in 2022, suggests that the bill will likely receive his approval. Meanwhile, other states, like South Dakota, are also exploring similar measures, with Representative Logan Manhart planning to introduce a bill for a state Bitcoin stockpile.

The analysis believes that there will be a potential shift in Bitcoin’s dynamics as institutional funds flow into the space. According to Matrixport’s chart report, Bitcoin’s 30-day realized volatility has averaged 58% over the past five years. Historically, this volatility has increased during bull and bear markets, such as the 2020/2021 bull run and the 2022 bear market. However, recent trends show an unusual decline in volatility even as Bitcoin makes significant gains in 2023 and 2024. Related News: Renowned Founder Says ""The US Will Definitely Buy Bitcoin"", Counts 5 Reasons The report suggests that Bitcoin spot ETFs play a crucial role in reducing volatility. By introducing Wall Street investors to BTC, these ETFs have increased institutional participation in the market. The presence of institutional investors, who tend to hold long-term positions, absorbs market fluctuations and provides a stabilizing effect on Bitcoin prices. “Low volatility allows institutional investors to take more risks,” the report said, adding that Bitcoin’s strong performance in recent years has further attracted Wall Street funds. Institutional buying has also reduced sharp declines in Bitcoin prices, creating a more stable market environment. This stability could encourage more inflows from traditional financial institutions, which could continue to reduce volatility and increase market predictability. *This is not investment advice.

The application, submitted on January 28, follows a previous move to register a Dogecoin ETF through a Delaware trust. This is the second filing for a Dogecoin ETF in recent weeks, coming after Rex Shares' application for multiple meme coin ETFs, including DOGE, Bonk ( BONK ), and Donald Trump’s TRUMP token. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart noted on X (formerly Twitter) that the filing was expected, as Bitwise had already registered the trust last week. However, what makes this filing unique is that it falls under the Securities Act of 1933 , ensuring a physically backed structure. This means that the ETF would hold actual Dogecoin, unlike funds filed under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which do not necessarily require direct ownership of assets. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, emphasized the importance of this distinction, explaining that Rex Shares’ filing was under the 1940 Act, making it structurally different from Bitwise’s physically backed proposal. In the filing, Bitwise has named Coinbase Custody as the custodian for the Dogecoin ETF. However, key details such as the proposed fee, ticker symbol, and listing exchange have not yet been disclosed in the S-1 form. Following the announcement, optimism surrounding the approval of a Dogecoin ETF surged.

The strategy is designed to establish Metaplanet as one of the world's largest corporate holders of bitcoin, the company said. It holds over $180 million worth of asset as of Wednesday, data shows . The so-termed ""21 Million Plan” — a likely nod to bitcoin’s total supply — involves issuing 21 million shares via moving strike warrants to raise approximately 116.65 billion yen (or nearly $740 million at current exchange rates), marking one of the largest equity capital raises for bitcoin in Asia. This plan aims to protect shareholder value by setting the exercise price at 100% of the previous day's closing price, avoiding the dilution often seen with traditional warrants. Metaplanet targets an expected 35% BTC Yield each quarter. It achieved a 309.82% BTC Yield for Q4 2024 following a 41.7% BTC Yield in Q3 2024 — a move that proves its acquisition strategy was on the right path, per the release . “BTC Yield is the foundation of our strategy and the ultimate measure of our success,” said Dylan LeClair, Director of Bitcoin Strategy at Metaplanet. “We don’t measure performance in fiat currencies like the yen or the dollar—our benchmark is Bitcoin itself.” “Our mission is to maximize bitcoin per share for our shareholders. Bitcoin is not just an asset; it’s the exit strategy. We’re here to accumulate and lead, not sell,” LeClair added.

In a recent post, Cronje explained that relentless pressure from US regulators drained his energy and forced him to leave the industry. According to Cronje, the SEC’s scrutiny started with simple inquiries about investors and profits but soon escalated into aggressive demands. Despite not being a US citizen and having no business in the country, he was targeted repeatedly. Each request led to more investigations, taking a toll on his time and resources until he ultimately decided to step away. Cronje stated that the SEC warned him against speaking publicly about this harassment, threatening further action if he did. The stress of ongoing regulatory pressure made it impossible for him to continue working on open-source projects, despite his passion for the crypto space. Even after his departure, Cronje never fully disengaged. He continued contributing discreetly to projects, unable to stay away from the industry he helped build. Now, with a change in SEC leadership in 2025, he feels safe enough to share his story. The resignation of Gary Gensler has brought a shift in regulatory attitude. Cronje believes the new SEC leadership is more open to crypto innovation, leading him to finally speak out about his experience. His revelations highlight the struggles faced by blockchain developers under previous regulatory policies. For years, the SEC took a hard stance against DeFi, pushing key figures like Cronje out of the industry. While some dismissed claims of widespread regulatory crackdowns, Cronje’s account confirms the pressure crypto developers faced. The crypto space has endured numerous challenges from regulators, but Cronje’s return signals that the industry remains resilient. His experience serves as a reminder of past struggles while raising hope for a more balanced regulatory approach moving forward.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-29 08:15:35

House Bill 230, the Blockchain and Digital Innovation Amendments, was approved by an 8-1 vote on January 28 and now advances to the full House for consideration. The proposed legislation , if passed, would permit the state treasurer to allocate up to 5% of certain public funds to “qualifying digital assets,” including cryptocurrencies with a market capitalisation exceeding $500 billion or state-approved stablecoins. This move comes amid a broader trend of US states embracing digital assets, with Utah positioning itself at the forefront of institutional crypto adoption. While 12 other states have introduced similar bills, Utah’s initiative could be the first to gain full legislative approval. Source: Bitcoin Reserve Monitor The bill has also introduced zoning restrictions for crypto mining operations, reflecting a growing push for regulatory clarity in the sector. If the measure clears the House and Senate, it will go to Governor Spencer Cox for final approval, with a potential implementation date of May 7. Utah leads state-level push for crypto investment Utah’s legislative push to integrate digital assets into public funds reflects the growing recognition of cryptocurrencies as an investment class. The bill outlines strict custody requirements, mandating that any crypto investments be held through secure custodians, exchange-traded products, or staking mechanisms. This framework is designed to mitigate risks and ensure transparency in asset management. The state’s proposed policy also extends beyond investment. The legislation seeks to prevent state and local governments from restricting the acceptance of crypto for legal goods and services. This provision could accelerate cryptocurrency adoption in Utah’s economy by allowing businesses and institutions to accept digital assets without regulatory barriers. The move is part of a broader national conversation on the role of digital currencies in mainstream financial systems, with state-level initiatives driving momentum in the absence of clear federal guidelines. The bill’s rapid progression suggests strong institutional interest in digital asset adoption. Representative Jordan Teuscher, who introduced the legislation on Jan. 21, has been vocal about positioning Utah as a leader in blockchain innovation. Teuscher highlighted on X (formerly Twitter) that while Utah is the 11th state to propose such legislation, it could be the first to successfully enact it. Jordan Teuscher @jordanteuscher · Follow Thrilled to join with @Dennis_Porter_ to announce HB230 which will allow the state to invest in digital assets. While Utah is the 11th state to introduce similar legislation, we will be the first to pass it. Utah continues to lead the nation in blockchain and digital innovation! 6:41 pm · 21 Jan 2025 410 Reply Copy link Read 50 replies Crypto adoption gains momentum across US states Utah’s legislative efforts align with a growing trend among US states seeking to integrate digital assets into public finance. Neighboring states such as Arizona and Wyoming have introduced similar initiatives, while South Dakota Representative Logan Manhart recently proposed creating a state Bitcoin reserve. Manhart’s push for a proactive government approach to Bitcoin investment underscores the shifting perception of crypto as a speculative asset to a strategic financial tool. The rising interest in crypto investments at the state level comes amid ongoing regulatory debates. The absence of clear federal guidelines on digital assets has led individual states to develop their own policies, resulting in a patchwork of regulations across the country. Utah’s approach, which includes strict custody rules and investment limits, could serve as a model for other states looking to navigate the evolving digital asset landscape. Governor Spencer Cox’s stance on blockchain innovation will play a crucial role in determining the bill’s future. Cox has previously expressed support for digital assets, having signed legislation in 2022 to establish a Blockchain and Digital Innovation Task Force. If he signs HB 230 into law, Utah could set a precedent for state-level crypto adoption, potentially influencing future legislative efforts across the US.

Czech National Bank Governor Aleš Michl is making a bold move, one no other Western central bank has taken so far: he wants to put Bitcoin ( BTC ) in the country’s reserves. If approved, up to 5% of the Czech National Bank’s €140 billion in reserves could be allocated to Bitcoin. Michl plans to present his proposal to the CNB board on Jan. 30, telling the Financial Times’ Raphael Minder that Bitcoin “seems good” for the “diversification” of the bank’s assets. He acknowledged the cryptocurrency’s volatility but pointed to its rising investor interest, especially after BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in 2024. “Of course, if you compare my position with other bankers, then I’m the one entering the jungle, or the pioneer. I used to run an investment fund, so I’m a typical investment banker I would say, I like profitability.” Aleš Michl You might also like: Jim Cramer calls to buy Bitcoin: BTC dip soon? Michl admitted Bitcoin’s value could go to zero but also sees its potential as CNB’s data suggests that if 5% of its reserves had been in Bitcoin over the past decade, annual returns would have risen by 3.5% points — but volatility would have doubled. If the plan moves forward, CNB could become the first Western central bank known to hold Bitcoin, joining El Salvador, which holds 6,048 BTC worth about $619 million, per data from Bitcoin Treasuries. The United States, in the meantime, is also evaluating the feasibility of the so-called “national digital assets stockpile.” While President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order to create a working group focused on cryptocurrencies, the order does not suggest the U.S. government should prioritize holding Bitcoin in its reserves.

A Utah House of Representatives committee has passed a bill that would allow the state to invest a portion of public funds in cryptocurrencies, and the bill will now head to the upper house for a vote. At this point, Utah has become the second US state after Arizona to approve the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill, moving one step closer to federal approval. The important development was shared by Satoshi Act Fund co-founder Dennis Porter. Porter stated in his post on his X account that Utah approved the bill that paves the way for buying BTC. The bill, which passed the committee, will now be presented to the state legislature, where it will be approved by the governor as the final authority. Once the governor signs the bill, it will become law. At this point, it is anticipated that a final approval in Utah will pave the way for other US states to do the same. If the governor approves, Utah will soon have a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and will serve as a reference point for other US states. The bill was introduced by Utah Representative Jordan Teuscher on January 21. As you may recall, yesterday, a bill allowing Bitcoin reserves was approved by the committee in another US state, Arizona.

Despite the company’s upcoming temporary suspension of ADA transactions, the asset’s price remains rather unaffected, with mixed analyst predictions on its next move. The Network Upgrade The world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange announced that it will temporarily halt the deposits and withdrawals of tokens on the Cardano (ADA) network on January 29. The effort aims to support its network upgrade and hard fork “to ensure the best user experience.” Token trading will not be impacted , and the company will carry out all technical requirements for users. “ Deposits and withdrawals for token(s) on the aforementioned network will be reopened once the upgraded network is deemed to be stable,” the exchange revealed. Binance also added that no further announcement on the matter will be posted . This means clients should take any information they come across on the Internet with a grain of salt. The development in question refers to the so-called Plomin hard fork , which is the second part of the Chang upgrade to Cardano. It is named in honor of the late Matthew Plomin, a notable contributor to the Cardano community, and marks a pivotal transition towards full decentralized governance under the Voltaire era. The hard fork introduces a system where ADA holders can actively participate in the network’s decision-making processes and vote directly on protocol updates. ADA Price Outlook The price of ADA has remained rather steady following Binance’s announcement, trading at approximately $0.94 (per CoinGecko’s data). In the past several weeks, the asset experienced severe turbulence, jumping above $1.15 prior to Donald Trump’s inauguration and plummeting below $0.90 during the crypto market correction witnessed at the start of the business week. ADA Price, Source: CoinGecko Many analysts believe ADA could enter a substantial rally in the near future , citing various technical patterns and historical performance. The X user That Martini Guy , for instance, told his over 650,000 followers on X that the altcoin season might be just around the corner. This might result in a price explosion to as high as $3 for ADA ( based on what happened in 2021 ). On the other hand, some made bearish forecasts. Ali Martinez suggested that the upcoming FOMC meeting, scheduled for today (January 29), could trigger enhanced volatility in the crypto market. In addition, he claimed that the TD Sequential indicator had flashed the sell signal on the hourly chart for ADA and other leading digital assets.

White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar David Sacks now claims there is “substantial evidence” that DeepSeek “distilled” knowledge from OpenAI’s models—a process he likened to intellectual property theft. Distillation is the process of training a smaller AI model using the outputs of a more advanced one, allowing it to replicate similar capabilities with fewer resources. Sacks’ comments came a day after Trump downplayed concerns over DeepSeek’s impact, calling it both a “positive” and a “wake-up call” for Silicon Valley, even as its rapid ascent sent markets into turmoil. The launch of DeepSeek’s R1 model triggered a massive sell-off in tech stocks, wiping over $1 trillion from the Nasdaq Composite Index. NVIDIA suffered the worst single-day loss in U.S. history, plunging by $600 billion, while Alphabet and Microsoft also took major hits. You might also like: Bitcoin remains a ‘safe harbor’ as DeepSeek concerns linger, says deVere CEO DeepSeek violated terms of service Speaking to Fox News on Tuesday, Sacks suggested that DeepSeek used responses from OpenAI’s models to train its own, though he did not cite the source of this evidence. “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this,” he said, adding that U.S. companies would likely take steps to prevent such practices. Separately, OpenAI has also raised concerns over DeepSeek’s methods, telling the Financial Times that it has found signs of “distillation” in R1’s development. While distillation is a common technique in AI development, OpenAI’s terms explicitly prohibit using its outputs to train competing models. A person familiar with the company’s stance noted that the issue isn’t just about knowledge transfer but whether DeepSeek extracted model outputs to build a direct rival. Another unnamed source added that OpenAI and its partner Microsoft had already taken action last autumn, investigating accounts believed to be linked to DeepSeek that were accessing OpenAI’s API. After finding signs of distillation in violation of its terms of service, OpenAI blocked these accounts, cutting off their access. DeepSeek’s rise was nothing short of explosive as it quickly rose to the top of the App Store charts, outpacing major U.S. competitors like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude. What made it even more disruptive was its ability to match the performance of OpenAI’s O1-mini while operating on a fraction of the resources. According to DeepSeek, its R1 model was developed at a cost of just $5.6 million. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the achievement, calling DeepSeek’s work “invigorating” and praising its ability to deliver strong results on a budget. deepseek's r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price. we will obviously deliver much better models and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases. — Sam Altman (@sama) January 28, 2025 Crypto market reacts The market reaction to the development wasn’t limited to tech stocks. Fear rippled through the crypto sector, hammering AI-focused cryptocurrencies the most. Bitcoin briefly dipped below $100,000, and total liquidations soared by more than 850% on Jan. 27, wiping out nearly $1 billion in leveraged positions as crypto traders, already on edge over macroeconomic uncertainty , saw the DeepSeek fallout as another sign of volatility. Yet many crypto industry proponents suggest DeepSeek’s success could be bullish , especially for AI projects, due to its potential to lower the costs of running AI-powered blockchain applications.

The initiative, tagged “SHIB to the Moon,” eliminates spot trading fees for a range of tokens within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Promotion Overview As per CoinW’s official announcement , users will be able to trade specific Shiba Inu ecosystem tokens, including SHIB, Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), Doge Killer (LEASH) , and Shiba Inu Treat (TREAT) , without incurring any spot trading fees. The promotion also extends to Dogecoin (DOGE), reflecting the exchange’s commitment to supporting established and emerging meme-based cryptocurrencies. The zero-fee trading campaign will run from February 3, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. (UTC) to February 10, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. (UTC). Eligible trading pairs include SHIB/USDT, BONE/USDT, LEASH/USDT, TREAT/USDT, and DOGE/USDT. CoinW clarified that the fee exemption applies exclusively to spot trading for these pairs and does not cover other trading strategies, such as grid trading. In addition, all transactions made during this campaign will contribute to the respective assets’ trading volume, making them eligible for any additional benefits tied to trading activity. Objective of the Initiative The primary goal of the “SHIB to the Moon” campaign is to encourage greater adoption and trading activity for Shiba Inu-related tokens and Dogecoin. By waiving fees, CoinW aims to provide traders with a cost-effective opportunity to engage with these assets, potentially increasing their trading volumes. This approach is expected to attract new and existing users to participate actively in the market. The promotional titled, “SHIB to the Moon” reflects the enthusiasm within the cryptocurrency community, where such phrases are often used to express optimism about an asset’s potential for significant growth. This campaign aligns with efforts to strengthen community engagement and broaden the appeal of the ecosystem . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Context Despite the buzz surrounding this initiative, the campaign initially coincided with broader market volatility. At the time, the featured tokens experienced a price decline, including SHIB, BONE, LEASH, TREAT, and DOGE. This downturn in the cryptocurrency market coincides with a broader sell-off in both crypto and stock markets, attributed to the increased investment in artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, the increasing popularity of China-based AI startup DeepSeek has shifted investor focus, leading to a reallocation of capital from traditional and digital assets to AI-related opportunities. This campaign represents an opportunity for traders to engage with the ecosystem’s tokens and Dogecoin without incurring additional costs. By offering free trading for a limited time, CoinW aims to drive interest in these assets and support the broader adoption of meme-based cryptocurrencies. However, traders should remain mindful of the current market dynamics and assess risks carefully when participating in this initiative. This campaign highlights CoinW’s continued efforts to foster activity within the cryptocurrency sector while addressing the challenges of market fluctuations.

In a recent post on X , BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said that Bitcoin ( BTC ) price stands poised for a massive correction to the $70,000 to $75,000 range. Furthermore, he suggested that this dip could trigger a “mini financial crisis” and result in a renewed wave of money printing. This development, according to Hayes, could ultimately propel Bitcoin’s price to $250,000 by the end of 2025. Reversing the order of my tryptic essay series. The Ugly will be published tomorrow morning. I am calling for a $70k to $75k correction in $BTC , a mini financial crisis, and a resumption of money printing that will send us to $250k by the end of the year. pic.twitter.com/wohvbKkXOf — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) January 27, 2025 Bitcoin’s last visit to the $75,000 level occurred on Nov. 8, 2020, just days after Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential victory. As of the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $102,876.

Following the release of DeepSeek R1 on Jan. 20, Bitcoin price experienced a significant decline, falling below $100,000 and reaching approximately $97,800 during Asian training hours . This has sparked a range of speculations from analysts about how much further Bitcoin price may fall. Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Capital, downplayed concerns over the current market volatility , describing the drop as a “short-term shock.” Van de Poppe cautioned against reacting hastily to short-term market fluctuations and pointed out that Bitcoin has reached what he termed an “exciting entry zone.” However, he acknowledged that if Bitcoin fails to maintain this support, a drop to the range lows is likely. I don't think there's a reason to panic. Short-term shock and panic reaction on the markets causing AI and #Crypto to drop. #Bitcoin reached an exciting entry zone, marked this earlier.

Musk Buys Solana (MUSKSOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Buys Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Buys Solana by entering its contract address (CA) – HZgXdFhQK1KTn8wM6hfRPtyGuKskETTzWM31qAdXJVRV – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|DOGE|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-29 09:11:00

Besides, the need for an SOL ETF is intensifying with Cboe re-filing the ETF on behalf of VanEck. With this, the price, which is under the bearish influence, is expected to reverse the trend as soon as the network’s traffic is about to escalate. Below are some popular Solana-based tokens that could mark fresh highs in the coming days. Uniswap (UNI) Uniswap is the most popular decentralised trading protocol and facilitates automated trading of the DeFi tokens without any need for any third party. The native token, UNI, which is used as a governance token and pay fees, has been performing exceptionally well. The price has been maintaining a consolidated ascending trend followed by a huge breakout. Presently, the UNI price is trying to reverse the bearish trend and once validated, a 50% upswing could be imminent. As seen in the above chart, the UNI price has been trading within a rising parallel channel for over a couple of years. After testing the resistance and support, the price is trying hard to validate a rebound from the average levels as RSI has also displayed a bearish divergence. Moreover, the 50/200 day weekly MA is healing towards the very first bullish crossover or the Golden Cross, which is expected to offer more bullish momentum that may push the price beyond $20. Jupiter (JUP) Jupiter, the most advanced swap aggregation engine on Solana, has raised many eyebrows in recent times. With a huge influx of liquidity, the token possessed massive volatility, causing a ‘v-shaped’ recovery in the JUP prices. Currently, the bulls appear to have drained out of strength as the volume has dropped and the token is experiencing significant upward pressure. However, the token has attempted to surpass $1.25 a couple of times and hence another attempt could clear these levels. The JUP price is constantly trying to achieve the local resistance at $1.3 while the bears are restricting the levels at $1.25. The RSI remains incremental while the CMF has regained levels above ‘0’. These indicators suggest the market strength is increasing, which could further keep up the momentum of the rally. Therefore, the Jupiter price is believed to rise and achieve beyond the interim highs shortly. Raydium (RAY) The Raydium price broke out of the consolidation and remained elevated throughout 2024, displaying huge volatility as the volume remained above the average range. Moreover, the token broke out of the pattern in the first few days of the year and the rise of the memecoins over the Solana chain also benefitted the token to a large extent. Currently, the price is about to end the correction after a breakout, which could pave the way for a strong upswing. The above chart suggests the RAY price broke out of the ascending triangle and marked interim highs above $8 and above to end its correction too. The RSI is displaying a bullish divergence, while the OBV, which is a volume-based indicator, has also shown a similar move. This suggests a rise in the rally’s strength as the buyers are more active than sellers, which could push the prices higher back above $8. Other than these tokens, memecoins like dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk (BONK), etc and a few more are also expected to thrive as the Solana network is expected to gain traction in the coming days.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|UNI|RAY|JUP|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-29 09:11:29

This milestone comes after a comprehensive development and testing phase, alongside ecosystem growth that has led to ION building a community of 40 million users. It also lays the foundation for ION's upcoming social media platform and decentralized application (dApp) builder. “This is a testament to the strength and conviction of our community,” said Alexandru Iulian Florea, Founder and CEO of Ice Open Network. “We initially aimed for 100 validators at launch – to see that number double underscores the trust and enthusiasm surrounding ION. It’s a resounding vote of confidence in our vision to redefine the Internet through decentralization.” ION’s unique architecture allows it to scale horizontally as its network participants increase, with the capacity to accommodate billions of users without compromising their privacy and security, nor the chain’s ability to process millions of transactions per second. Combining efficiency with a human-first approach, the ION framework is designed to decentralize and secure the core elements of digital interaction – user identity, content storage and delivery, and social engagement. The result is a versatile dApp infrastructure designed to offer practical utility and support the transition of Internet users to blockchain technology. Following the mainnet launch is the arrival of Online+ – an integrated social media dApp showcasing the blockchain’s capabilities that serves both as a hub for ION’s community, and a blueprint for dApp developers wishing to build on ION’s framework. Ice Open Network’s flagship no-code, drag-and-drop dApp-building tool, which will allow anyone, regardless of technical expertise, to create decentralized applications on ION from scratch, is next in line and due for release in 2025. The ION blockchain mainnet rollout began in November 2024, and is accompanied by the deployment of the ION Bridge, which enables the migration of the network’s native ICE token from Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to the ION blockchain. Currently, the network’s 200 validators have staked over 15% of the 6.8 billion ICE in circulation – a percentage set to increase as Online+ goes live. About Ice Open Network Ice Open Network (ION) is the blueprint for a new Internet rooted in privacy, data ownership, and user autonomy. Built on a high-performance Layer-1 blockchain with a focus on digital sovereignty, it is designed to provide decentralized applications (dApps) with practical, user-focused utility at a significant scale. Founded in 2022, ION serves a dApp ecosystem of over 40 million users. It is engineered to process millions of transactions per second and scale horizontally and infinitely as its network participants increase. Combining this efficiency with a comprehensive dApp toolkit purpose-built for intuitive, privacy-preserving user experiences, ION is on a mission to onboard the world to a new, decentralized Internet.

39646168,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=125101,1738142151,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,How Do Crypto Exchanges Make Money?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/how-do-crypto-exchanges-make-money/,"The cryptocurrency market reached an incredible value of $2.7 trillion in 2024, showing just how popular it has become. At the heart of this ecosystem are cryptocurrency exchanges, which manage trillions of dollars in trades each year. The top platforms generate massive revenues and handle millions of transactions daily. Take Coinbase , for example. In 2021, it reported $1.4 billion in sales, competing with major financial institutions. Binance, the largest exchange by trading volume, processes over $15 billion worth of trades every day, earning billions in revenue each year. So, how do crypto exchanges generate such significant income? Here’s a detailed look at their revenue strategies. What Are Crypto Exchanges? People can purchase, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies on cryptocurrency exchanges . In the bitcoin ecosystem, these online markets serve as a fundamental conduit, offering a variety of financial services, price discovery, and much-needed liquidity. Millions of consumers are served by exchanges, and daily global trading volumes frequently surpass $100 billion, which supports rapid growth in digital assets. Types of Crypto Exchanges Crypto exchanges are divided into two main flavors, each with different user needs. Centralized Exchanges The CEXs like Binance , Coinbase, and Kraken are dominating the market. They work like old financial institutions of the fiat world. They are highly liquid and come with advanced tools and security. But here, one needs to trust the exchange for their fund and data safety. Decentralized Exchanges Uniswap and PancakeSwap , among other decentralized exchanges, represent blockchain-based systems. They allowed for direct, peer-to-peer trading, allowing better autonomy and privacy. Currently, DEXes appeal to users fond of their privacy; however, they cannot outdo CEX in terms of liquidity and usability. Main Sources of Revenue Crypto exchanges use various means for revenues. Let’s look closer at their main streams: 1. Trading Fees Trading fees are the cornerstone of exchange revenue. Each transaction has a small fee, typically between 0.1% and 0.5%, depending on the platform and transaction volume. Fee Models : Maker-Taker Model : Makers (who add liquidity) often pay lower fees than takers (who remove liquidity). Flat Fee Model : Some exchanges charge a standard fee for all trades. Examples : Binance charges a 0.1% fee, with discounts for using its native token (BNB). Coinbase applies a tiered fee structure ranging from 0.04% to 0.60%. Kraken charges makers 0.16% and takers 0.26%. Trading fees can generate billions during high trading volumes. For example, Binance earns 90% of its revenue from transaction fees. 2. Withdrawal and Deposit Fees Exchanges often charge fees for withdrawals and, in some cases, deposits. Withdrawal Fees : Users pay fixed fees to withdraw cryptocurrencies, covering blockchain network costs. For instance, Binance charges 0.0005 BTC per Bitcoin withdrawal. Deposit Fees : Fiat deposits via bank transfers may be free, but credit or debit card deposits often incur fees. Coinbase charges up to 3.99% for card deposits. These fees, though smaller than trading fees, add up due to the sheer volume of transactions. 3. Listing Fees Crypto projects pay exchanges to list their tokens , gaining visibility with millions of users. Listing fees vary widely: Smaller exchanges may charge $10,000. Major platforms like Binance reportedly charge up to $1 million. Some exchanges waive listing fees for high-potential projects, focusing instead on the trading volume these tokens generate. 4. Margin and Leverage Fees Margin and leverage trading allows users to borrow funds to amplify trades. Exchanges profit from: Interest on Borrowed Funds : Kraken charges 0.02% every four hours for borrowed funds. Leverage Fees : Platforms like Binance offer up to 20x leverage, earning additional fees. These services are lucrative, often contributing over 20% of an exchange’s revenue. Additional Revenue Streams Crypto exchanges diversify their revenue through supplementary services. These include staking, lending, and token sales. 1. Staking Services Exchanges enable users to stake cryptocurrencies to earn rewards. In return, exchanges take a percentage of staking rewards. For example: Coinbase charges a 25% fee on staking rewards. Popular stakable assets include Ethereum and Solana. Staking benefits exchanges by encouraging users to keep assets on the platform, boosting retention and creating a steady income stream. 2. Lending Services Exchanges like BlockFi pool user deposits and lend them out at higher interest rates. Users earn interest on their lent assets, while exchanges profit from the spread between borrowing and lending rates. 3. Token Launch Platforms Many exchanges host Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) for new crypto projects. They earn a percentage of the tokens sold, benefiting from increased trading volume post-launch. How Revenue Streams Compare Revenue Stream Example Platforms Fee Range Profitability Trading Fees Binance, Coinbase 0.1% – 0.5% Extremely high Withdrawal Fees Binance, Kraken Varies by asset Moderate to high Listing Fees Binance, OKX $10,000 – $1 million High for large exchanges Leverage Fees Binance, Kraken Varies by asset High during market volatility Staking Services Coinbase, Binance ~25% of rewards Steady, long-term income Lending Services BlockFi, Binance Interest-based Moderate, depending on demand Crypto exchanges make money through diverse revenue streams, with trading fees being the most significant. Additional services like staking, lending, and token listings provide supplementary income. These platforms play a vital role in the crypto economy, driving innovation while capitalizing on market demand. Understanding their revenue models highlights the potential and profitability of the growing cryptocurrency industry.",Learn|Crypto exchanges,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BNB|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-01-29 09:15:51

Sign’s revenue increases, growing from $1.7M in 2023 to $15M in 2024. CZ cautions about meme coins’ speculative nature and reflects on the collapse of FTX.

This marks his first crypto investment since completing a prison sentence tied to a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities.

39646899,https://coinpaper.com/7193/solana-etf-applications-refiled-as-crypto-regulation-takes-a-new-turn,1738143675,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Solana ETF Applications Refiled as Crypto Regulation Takes a New Turn,https://coinpaper.com/7193/solana-etf-applications-refiled-as-crypto-regulation-takes-a-new-turn,"This move was made due to the shifting regulatory landscape under the new acting SEC leadership. JPMorgan estimates a Solana ETF could attract $3–$6 billion in its first year. Meanwhile, Tuttle Capital recently filed for 10 leveraged crypto ETFs, including exposure to Trump-linked tokens. Analysts believe this was done to test the SEC's stance on certain ETFs. Bitwise also filed for a Dogecoin ETF, adding to a growing list of meme coin investment products awaiting SEC review. Solana ETF Filings Resubmitted Cboe BZX Exchange took a big step in the push for a spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States by resubmitting filings on behalf of four asset managers. The exchange refiled 19b-4 applications for spot Solana ETFs from Bitwise , VanEck , 21Shares , and Canary Capital on Jan. 28. By doing this, the exchange reignited the approval process with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after initial applications were reportedly rejected last year. With Mark Uyeda now serving as the SEC’s acting chair, the regulatory landscape shifted toward a much more crypto-friendly stance, which boosted optimism around the potential for approval. The refiled applications set the stage for Solana to become the third cryptocurrency available through a spot ETF in the US after the launch of similar investment products for Bitcoin and Ethereum last year. This renewed push happened during a time when asset managers are trying to introduce ETFs for other cryptos, including XRP, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. Analysts suggest that issuers are testing the regulatory waters under a Trump-era SEC. However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes Litecoin will be the next likely candidate for approval. According to reports, applications for Litecoin ETFs are already under active review by the SEC. The market potential for a spot Solana ETF is substantial, and financial services firm JPMorgan estimates that an approved product could attract between $3 billion and $6 billion in net assets in its first year. Balchunas described this projection as a “reasonable guess,” due to the growing demand for regulated crypto investment vehicles. VanEck was the first to file for a Solana ETF on June 27 last year, followed by 21Shares on June 28 and Canary Capital in late October. Bitwise and Grayscale later joined the race by submitting applications after Donald Trump’s election victory in November. So far, the SEC overturned several crypto-related policies that were enacted under Gary Gensler’s leadership. One of the major reversals was the cancellation of a rule that required financial firms holding cryptocurrency to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets. The SEC also announced that it created a dedicated crypto task force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, to develop a framework for digital assets. These changes signal a more favorable outlook for cryptocurrency regulation, and could potentially pave the way for Solana’s inclusion in spot crypto ETF industry. Tuttle Capital Files for 10 Leveraged Crypto ETFs Tuttle Capital also seems to be testing the new SEC leadership after filing for 10 leveraged ETFs. Among the proposed ETFs are funds offering two times leveraged long positions on tokens linked to Donald Trump and his wife Melania. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed out the significance of Tuttle’s filings, and shared that beyond the Official Trump (TRUMP) and Melania Meme (MELANIA) tokens, the proposed ETFs also include exposure to a range of other cryptocurrencies that currently lack ETF representation. These include XRP, Solana, Litecoin, Chainlink, Cardano, Polkadot, BNP, and the meme coin Bonk. According to Seyffart, these filings are a clear attempt by issuers to test the regulatory limits of the SEC’s new leadership. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noticed just how unusual Tuttle’s filings are, particularly the push for highly leveraged ETFs before standard one-to-one products have even been approved for some of the underlying assets. Leveraged ETFs track their assets at a 2:1 ratio or higher, which amplifies both potential gains and risks. Balchunas explained that because these filings fall under the Investment Company Act of 1940, they could theoretically begin trading as soon as April unless the SEC intervenes. The SEC’s response to these filings will provide crucial insight into its approach to cryptocurrency ETFs. However, Balchunas pointed out that recent applications for Dogecoin and Trump-linked tokens have been withdrawn. Bitwise Files for Dogecoin ETF Bitwise officially filed with the SEC to list an ETF tracking the price of Dogecoin, making it the latest push for meme coin investment products. The proposed Bitwise Dogecoin ETF will directly hold DOGE and closely follow its price movements, according to the firm’s S-1 filing with the SEC on Jan. 28. This filing was made after a previous filing on Jan. 22 to register a Dogecoin trust in Delaware, which, according to James Seyffart, now makes the move official with the regulator. The filing happened in the middle of a wave of meme coin-related ETF applications in the US. Other asset managers including Osprey Funds, REX Shares, and Tuttle Capital are also seeking approval for funds that track or offer leveraged exposure to tokens like Dogecoin and TRUMP. For Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF to move forward, the S-1 filing must be accompanied by a 19b-4 submission, which will formally initiate the SEC’s review process. Dogecoin grew a lot since its launch in 2015, and amassed an impressive market capitalization of close to $49 billion. As a result, DOGE ranks as the eighth-largest cryptocurrency, and the largest meme coin overall. Bitwise has selected Coinbase Custody as the proposed custodian for the ETF, which matches with the choice of other issuers offering crypto-based exchange-traded products. The filing did not reveal any details about the ETF’s proposed fee, ticker, or the stock exchange it will be listed on if it gets approved. This latest filing is also part of Bitwise’s plans to expand its crypto ETF offerings beyond just its existing spot Bitcoin and Ether products. The firm also recently submitted applications to list ETFs tracking Solana and XRP to broaden its scope in the crypto investment space. In November, Bitwise filed to list the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund on NYSE Arca. This is a product that is designed to track ten of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, including Cardano, Uniswap, and Polkadot. Dogecoin’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Despite Bitwise’s push for regulatory approval, Dogecoin’s price saw a slight 0.86% drop over the past 24 hours of trading. As a result, DOGE was trading hands at $0.3316 at press time. DOGE was also down by more than 9% on its weekly time frame. Overall, most people expect that the outcome of the SEC’s review of the Dogecoin ETF will provide a more clear picture into the regulator’s new stance on meme coin-based investment products in the US.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|DOGE|SOL|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-29 09:41:15

As is known, the FED made its first interest rate cut in September and made an aggressive start to the discount cycle with a 50 basis point cut decision. The FED also made a 25 basis point rate cut in November and December. After these interest rate cuts, dollar, gold, stock market and cryptocurrency investors closely follow the January decision, which is the first interest rate decision of 2025, while the questions of whether the FED will continue to cut interest rates and how much of a cut it will make continue to be important for investors. Related News: BREAKING: The Anticipated Moment Has Arrived! FED Announced Interest Rate Decision! Here is Bitcoin's First Reaction When Will the January FED Interest Rate Decision Be Announced? The FED will announce its January interest rate decision on January 29, 2025 at 22:00 Turkish time. Following the decision, FED Chairman Jerome Powell will make oral statements at 22:30. In Which Direction Are Expectations Focused? The general expectation for the FED interest rate decision, which is eagerly awaited by global markets, is that the FED will leave the policy rate unchanged in January. According to FED Watch, the probability of interest rates remaining unchanged in January is priced in at 99.5%. At this point, it is almost certain that the FED will keep interest rates constant this month, but it is estimated that it will reduce rates by 25 basis points in June. Analysts stated that the FED is expected to cut interest rates three times this year, and that the policy text and Powell's verbal guidance are expected to provide clues about future monetary policy. Analysts also added that despite recent statements from FED officials indicating that the fight against inflation will continue for a long time, expectations in the markets for an interest rate cut during the year are gaining strength. LHMeyer analysts argued that while the labor market appears to be stabilizing, that doesn't mean the Fed's monetary policy stance isn't having a negative impact on the economy. “We expect the policy rate to remain above 4% by mid-2025 and to be more clearly restrictive. We also expect tariffs to put upward pressure on prices, contributing to 2.5% inflation in 2025, but with a mild enough impact that it will not prevent the Fed from cutting rates,” the analysts said. Markets are likely to react moderately positively to the Fed's interest rate decision, said François Rimeu, senior market strategist at Crédit Mutuel Asset Management. “The focus of markets this week will likely remain on developments from the Trump administration, overshadowing the upcoming Federal Reserve and European Central Bank meetings where no major surprises are expected,” said Danske Bank analyst Kirstine Kundby-Nielsen. *This is not investment advice.

While seasoned favorites like Floki Inu and Peanut the Squirrel continue to dominate the meme coin market, a new contender has emerged— Arctic Pablo (APC). This fresh and innovative project promises something new for investors, with a unique presale approach that has already caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts. Arctic Pablo’s presale is breaking boundaries by incorporating adventurous narratives and offering early-stage investment rewards that are drawing significant interest. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo, Floki Inu, and Peanut the Squirrel, diving into what makes each of these projects worth watching. However, all eyes are on Arctic Pablo right now, and it’s quickly becoming one of the top meme coin presales to buy now for 2025. Let’s explore why it stands out in this crowded market. Arctic Pablo: An Adventure-Fueled Meme Coin With High Returns Arctic Pablo (APC) is a meme coin like no other. It’s built around the idea of adventure and exploration, with each phase of its presale tied to a different mythical location. From undiscovered ice caves to ancient, hidden cities, every stage in the presale tells a different story, keeping the narrative fresh and exciting. This unique theme doesn’t just add to the project’s charm; it also sparks curiosity and interest among investors, making Arctic Pablo one of the top meme coin presales to buy now . But the excitement doesn’t end with its theme. Arctic Pablo is offering several incentives that set it apart. Investors can stake their tokens during the presale and earn a rewarding 66% APY, providing passive income potential alongside their investment. For those who love to spread the word, Arctic Pablo’s referral program allows users to earn rewards by introducing the project to others. Add to this the chance to participate in community competitions to win APC tokens or even USD, and Arctic Pablo becomes an incredibly attractive opportunity. Investors are rushing in to take advantage of this project’s unique perks, all while the coin’s price remains incredibly low at just $0.000043. Don’t Miss Out: Arctic Pablo’s Presale at Glacier Grove Right now, Arctic Pablo is in the Glacier Grove phase of its presale, and the buzz is palpable. With over $550,000 raised so far, this project is moving quickly. The current price is a steal at $0.000043 per APC , but that won’t last for long. As the presale progresses, the price will rise, with the final presale price set at $0.0008 and the launch price expected to skyrocket to $0.008. This creates a massive opportunity for early investors, who could see an ROI potential of over 18,546% as the project reaches its final stages. Arctic Pablo’s presale approach is unlike any other. The project doesn’t follow traditional stages; instead, it takes investors on a journey to different “locations,” each with its own story and price increase. The excitement is growing as the Glacier Grove phase continues, following the rapid success of the El-Dorado stage, which was completed in under four days. Early supporters are seeing massive potential, and now is the time to get in before the price increases again. As the presale enters new locations, the value of APC tokens is expected to rise, so don’t miss the chance to secure tokens at this low entry price. Floki Inu: Real-World Utility Fuels Growth According to current technical indicators, FLOKI may face some minor downward pressure in the short term. However, if the price can break through the $0.000143 resistance level with a boost in trading volume, it could indicate a potential reversal towards the $0.000150 mark. On the other hand, if the price fails to maintain support at $0.000135, further declines could be on the horizon. Experts have differing views on FLOKI’s price movements. Some predict that over the next five days, FLOKI could reach a high of $0.00018 by January 27, 2025, marking a potential gain of about 28% from its current value. Others, despite forecasting some volatility throughout the year, anticipate that FLOKI will experience steady growth, with a projected price of around $0.000311 by December 2025.

This means that there is no fundamental value behind these projects. Shiba Inu is the poster child of this trend with massive viral appeal. However, traders who were initially backing SHIB are now considering DTX Exchange , another viral altcoin that could be set to deliver up to 10,000% gains. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Recovers After Bearish Month January has been extremely bullish for Shiba Inu so far. We’ve seen a drop of over 14.4% in the past 30 days, with SHIB holders becoming incredibly skeptical of their meme investments. On the more short-term horizon, Shiba Inu is facing a volume drop of over 30% in the past 24 hours with daily trading volumes dropping to $351.2 Million. Experts have associated this volatility in Shiba Inu (SHIB) price with a shift in macro conditions in global financial markets. The release of Chinese AI model R1 has rattled the equities market and the resulting impacts are showing in the crypto space as well. Additionally, another key reason could be the broader shift away from speculative assets into projects with more fundamental features. Solana Back In the Spotlight With Surging Volumes The past month has been ideal for Solana as the Layer-1 blockchain has mounted an impressive recovery. After dropping below $200, Solana price is now back above $220. This recovery has been driven by the launch of the Trump token. The resulting fees and ecosystem impacts have catapulted SOL back into the spotlight. Additionally, another factor increasing demand for Solana is the recovery of memecoins. Projects like Dogwifhat and BONK are starting to recover after local slumps, signaling a comeback in Solana price this month. With a daily increase of 5.65%, SOL is currently trading at $236.12. With this current increase, traders are starting to cash this increase in Solana price. Viral platform DTX Exchange has been a key recipient of these inflows. DTX Exchange Enters Final Stage With $13,000,000 Milestone Viral platform DTX Exchange (DTX) has been at the center of attention in the crypto world after introducing a groundbreaking proposition. Traders can use the platform to trade stocks, cryptos, and forex assets under a single application. The secure platform has built a community of over 500,000 traders and is continuing to sell out through its final presale round. Instead of going the VC-backed route, DTX Exchange launched the presale to allow retail traders to become partners in the launch. Early backers have already enjoyed gains of over 600%, but experts think that the juggernaut is just getting started. At $0.16, tokens are rapidly selling out as traders rush to join the $100,000 USDT giveaway to celebrate the upcoming listing. However, over 42.2% of the tokens are sold already. This means that you should rush to join the presale for listing gains of up to 100x. Additionally, with the increase in Solana price, cascading effects could be felt on emerging platforms like DTX in the coming days.

Shiba Inu exemplifies this trend with its widespread popularity. However, traders who initially supported SHIB are now looking at DTX Exchange , another trendy altcoin that could potentially yield up to 10,000% returns. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Bounces Back After a Rough Month January has been quite promising for Shiba Inu so far. Despite a more than 14.4% decline over the past month, SHIB holders are questioning their meme-based investments. In the short term, Shiba Inu is experiencing a significant drop in trading volume, down by over 30% in the last day, with daily transactions falling to $351.2 million. Experts link this volatility in Shiba Inu's (SHIB) price to changes in macroeconomic conditions affecting global financial markets. The introduction of China's AI model R1 has unsettled the stock market, and these effects are also visible in the cryptocurrency sector. Furthermore, there is a noticeable shift from speculative ventures towards projects with more substantial foundations. Solana Gains Attention Again with Rising Volumes Solana has had a remarkable month as the Layer-1 blockchain stages a strong comeback. After dipping below $200, Solana's price has climbed back above $220. This recovery has been fueled by the launch of the Trump token, which has generated significant fees and positively impacted the Solana ecosystem, bringing SOL back into focus. Another driving factor for Solana's rising demand is the revival of memecoins. Projects like Dogwifhat and BONK are bouncing back from recent declines, indicating a resurgence in Solana's price this month. With a daily gain of 5.65%, SOL is currently valued at $236.12. With the current increase, traders are capitalizing on Solana's price surge. The viral platform DTX Exchange has been a major beneficiary of these inflows. DTX Exchange Reaches $13,000,000 Milestone as It Nears Completion The viral platform DTX Exchange (DTX) has captivated the crypto community with its innovative offer. The platform allows traders to handle stocks, cryptocurrencies, and forex assets all in one application. With a secure environment, it has attracted a community of over 500,000 traders and is close to selling out its final presale round. Instead of seeking venture capital funding, DTX Exchange opted for a presale that lets retail traders become partners in its launch. Early supporters have already seen returns exceeding 600%, but experts believe this is just the beginning for the platform. Priced at $0.16, tokens are selling quickly as traders aim to participate in the $100,000 USDT giveaway in anticipation of the upcoming listing. However, more than 42.2% of the tokens are already sold. This means you should act fast to participate in the presale and potentially see up to 100x returns upon listing.

Jeremy Hogan said that the case is still present on the actual appellate court website. It is unlikely for Acting Chair Mark Uyeda to dismiss the Ripple lawsuit in the absence of Chair Paul Atkins. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken down its lawsuit against the American fintech firm Ripple from its website. This move is stirring up a debate in the crypto community about the agency’s future plans. Some think this could mean a potential victory for the firm; others aren’t so sure. Jeremy Hogan, a partner at Hogan and Hogan law firm, was asked by a market participant about the missing lawsuit from the SEC website. Hogan first replied that the lawsuit could’ve been moved to a section for “cases on appeal” from the litigation section. But, he later corrected his statement, since the website doesn’t have a section for appeals. He added that the legal action is still present on the actual appellate court website with no new filings.

During the session, he discussed a range of topics, including the potential role of XRP in the future of the U.S. economy. Garlinghouse revealed that he had discussed with Donald Trump the idea of XRP becoming part of the U.S. Strategic Reserve. He also stressed the need for a diversified reserve, dismissing claims that he was trying to undermine Bitcoin. He explained, “The opportunities are so large, there will be many winners,” suggesting a basket of cryptocurrencies rather than just one. This view doesn’t sit well with Bitcoin maximalists, who believe Bitcoin should dominate. Amid the ongoing XRP vs. Bitcoin debate, entrepreneur Grant Cardone weighed in, saying comparing Bitcoin to XRP is like comparing Godzilla to a lap dog. He argued that XRP is a “binary bet” and would require federal inclusion, while Bitcoin, on the other hand, is an “asymmetric long-duration investment” that doesn’t need to be part of a federal reserve. Comparing BTC to XRP is like comparing Godzilla to a lap dog! XRP is a Binary bet, requiring Federal stockpile Inclusion! BTC: Asymmetric Long Duration Investment! Federal stockpile inclusion not required! Asymmetric and Binary, are not the same thing. Stop listening to… — Gary Cardone (@GaryCardone) January 29, 2025 In response to these views, pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan pointed out the contradiction in the argument. He wrote on X (Formerly Twitter), “Let me get this right. XRP needs to be included in the crypto asset stockpile of one country even though it has been a top 10 crypto for over a decade without being in a stockpile. Bitcoin does not need to be included but its supporters have a meltdown at the mere suggestion it is not the only crypto to be included.”",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|BTC|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-29 09:55:07

However while Ethereum's price was not affected that much, the presale of this ERC-20 token saw a 500% rally. Read on to find out what is in store for Ethereum and why this AI ERC-20 token will outperform in 2025. Official Trump Coin (TRUMP): Hype or a Long-Term Investment? The recent launch of the Official Trump Coin (TRUMP) has sparked significant interest among traders. Launched amid a surge in politically-themed cryptocurrencies, Trump coin saw a meteoric rise to an all-time high of $75.35 before correcting to its current price of $29. Speculation and hype have fueled its initial growth, especially with Trump’s political influence, but questions remain about its long-term sustainability. With a market cap of almost $6 billion and high volatility, Trump coin is seen by many as a short-term speculative play rather than a solid long-term investment. While it has provided early adopters with impressive gains, seasoned investors are aware of its dependence on political events and media coverage. In contrast, this AI altcoin offers strong fundamentals, leveraging AI and blockchain to create a sustainable trading platform with real-world utility. Ethereum (ETH): A Stable Giant With Room to Grow Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently trading at $3,180, reflecting a modest 2% increase since yesterday. Despite its recent gains, Ethereum remains sluggish, seeing quite high volatility over the course of last year. Over the past month, Ethereum’s price has seen several fluctuations, struggling to remain above $3500. ETH is especially strong in serving as the tent pole of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts. Ethereum's reliable and decentralized infrastructure enabled the blooming of projects, including NFTs, DeFi protocols, and metaverse applications. The scalability concerns are addressed with its ongoing upgrades, such as Ethereum 2.0 indicates the scale of its dominance to grow even more. However, despite Ethereum's utility, adoption and the network’s ongoing upgrades, its large market capitalization of $385 billion limits its potential for rapid exponential growth. With new projects emerging like the ERC-20 AI altcoin, it is hard to choose Ethereum for short term gains. IntelMarkets (INTL): 500% Rally Is Just The Beginning IntelMarkets is a relatively new project that recently saw a 500% rally. INTL offers a feature packed platform that combines AI, DeFi and blockchain technology. Unlike speculative tokens such as $TRUMP, or well established cryptos such Ethereum, IntelMarkets holds untapped potential. INTL is purpose-built to transform the crypto trading market with its AI-powered trading ecosystem. Why IntelMarkets Stands Out AI-Powered Trading: IntelMarkets self-learning trading bots execute trades in real-time on assets in multiple asset classes. With this, users get an edge and maximize profits. Dual-Chain Architecture: INTL operates on both Ethereum and Solana blockchains, which offers scalability while promoting efficiency. Unmatched Leverage: INTL offers up to 1,000x leverage and multiple pairs for retail and institutional traders. Low Market Entry: IntelMarkets presents a low entry barrier as its current pricing in the 9th ICO stage is just $0.082. It has so far raised more than $7.7 million, and confidence in its vision remains high. INTL is tipped to see an 80x rally on Tier-1 exchanges, which could make it one of the most promising ERC-20 tokens to watch in 2025. Furthermore, this project is backed by a team of OpenAI and MIT engineers who have pioneered its cutting-edge tech. Conclusion While Trump Coin thrives on short-term hype and Ethereum offers reliability, IntelMarkets (INTL) offers unparalleled potential. With its AI-driven approach, low entry price, and expert endorsements, IntelMarkets has positioned itself as a leader in the next wave of DeFi projects.

Continue reading to discover what's ahead for Ethereum and why this AI ERC-20 token is predicted to excel in 2025. Official Trump Coin (TRUMP): Temporary Hype or Lasting Investment? The introduction of the Official Trump Coin (TRUMP) has captured considerable attention from traders. Launched during a wave of politically-themed cryptocurrencies, Trump coin soared to an unprecedented high of $75.35 before settling at its present value of $29. Its initial rise was driven by speculation and excitement, particularly due to Trump’s political clout, yet doubts linger about its long-term viability. With a market cap nearing $6 billion and significant volatility, Trump coin is often viewed as a short-term speculative asset rather than a robust long-term investment. Despite substantial gains for early investors, experienced traders recognize its reliance on political developments and media buzz. In contrast, this AI altcoin is built on strong fundamentals, utilizing AI and blockchain to establish a sustainable trading ecosystem with genuine utility. Ethereum (ETH): A Reliable Giant With Potential for Expansion Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is currently valued at $3,180, marking a slight 2% uptick since yesterday.

Ripple follows the Ethereum (ETH) trajectory and is expected to keep ascending. A pullback would be possible if Ethereum (ETH) gave way to bearish pressure. It is in recovery, and market sentiment is relatively positive around Ethereum and Ripple. The XRP price has shown resilience, and its investors have stayed calm in the face of market volatility. Most Ripple investors have held on to their tokens because the projected XRP price for 2025 is 400% of the current price. Another token predicted to give such massive returns this year is DTX, which is powered by the DTX Exchange , a hybrid trading platform. XRP Price to Surge Ahead Despite broader negative sentiments in the crypto market, Ripple is standing steady. This can be attributed to its fundamentals and its remittance-based use cases. There is an expectation of a Ripple ETF being approved, which could lead to bullish momentum for the XRP price. Currently, the XRP price is $3.12, and it could quickly rally to meet resistance at $3.55. There is a strong chance for a cross over to bullish dominance in Q1. Ripple has announced that it has obtained Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) in New York and Texas. The two key licenses will expand its reach and help more people use its remittance services. New York and Texas have high regulatory standards and a rigorous approval process. With more retail adoption of Ripple’s cross-border payment services in the US, the XRP price should reflect the same. The Ripple portfolio has more than 60 licenses worldwide, and its compliance-first payment solutions are gaining traction in a rapidly evolving payments landscape. The remittance-based XRP token is backed by an incredible real-world use case, which is why the XRP price is not always prey to speculation. Ethereum (ETH) Price Forecast Chinese AI startup DeepSeek went live on Friday, affecting the crypto markets greatly. ETH price was down 8%, but whales and derivatives traders remain positive and are buying the dip. Some analysts say the Ethereum (ETH) price could see a 25% decline if the selling activity continues. 120,000 ETH have been scooped up at the end of last week, meaning whales are buying it despite the price decline. Traders are not closing positions due to panic and are betting on a quick price recovery. If Ethereum sustains a high volume below $3,000, the price could decline by 25%, but if it finds support at $2,817, such a decline could be prevented. DTX Exchange to Surge Higher There is a growing emphasis on utility-driven crypto tokens, and DTX Exchange represents the future of such coins. DTX Exchange will address the inefficiencies in the current trading models where centralized and decentralized trade of assets exists independently. On DTX Exchange, users can trade fiat assets and crypto derivatives together. The DTX token is at the center of this revolutionary trading platform and is currently priced at $0.16. That is a 700% increase from its initial price of $0.02, and there it will be listed at $0.2. DTX is becoming a highly sought-after asset, and its presale has already gained $13M in funding; forecasts predict a 7,200% gain after launch as demand for its innovative hybrid trading solution will increase.

Ripple is mirroring Ethereum (ETH) and is forecasted to continue its upward trend. However, if Ethereum (ETH) succumbs to bearish forces, a pullback could occur. Ethereum is on the mend, and the overall market sentiment is fairly optimistic for both Ethereum and Ripple. XRP has demonstrated stability, with investors remaining composed despite market fluctuations. The majority of Ripple holders have kept their tokens, banking on a projected 400% increase in XRP's price by 2025. Another token expected to deliver significant returns this year is DTX, driven by the DTX Exchange , a hybrid trading platform. XRP Price Poised for Growth Ripple maintains its ground despite widespread negative sentiment in the crypto market. This stability is due to its strong fundamentals and remittance-focused applications. Anticipation of a Ripple ETF approval could trigger bullish momentum for XRP. Currently priced at $3.12, XRP might soon surge to encounter resistance at $3.55, with a solid possibility of shifting to bullish dominance in the first quarter. Ripple has announced securing Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) in New York and Texas. These crucial licenses will broaden its reach and facilitate wider use of its remittance services. Both states are known for their stringent regulatory standards and meticulous approval processes. As Ripple’s cross-border payment services gain more retail adoption in the US, the XRP price is expected to reflect this growth. With over 60 licenses globally, Ripple’s compliance-oriented payment solutions are gaining momentum in the swiftly changing payments industry. The remittance-focused XRP token is underpinned by a strong real-world application, which helps insulate its price from mere speculation. Ethereum (ETH) Price Outlook The launch of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek on Friday had a significant impact on the crypto markets. ETH saw an 8% drop, yet whales and derivatives traders remain optimistic, continuing to purchase during the dip. Analysts suggest that if the selling pressure persists, Ethereum (ETH) could face a 25% price drop. Last week concluded with the acquisition of 120,000 ETH, indicating that whales are still buying despite the price drop. Traders are refraining from closing positions out of fear and instead are wagering on a swift price rebound. If Ethereum maintains substantial volume below $3,000, a 25% price drop is possible, but finding support at $2,817 could prevent such a decline. DTX Exchange on the Rise The importance of utility-focused crypto tokens is growing, and DTX Exchange is at the forefront of this trend. DTX Exchange aims to resolve inefficiencies in existing trading models where centralized and decentralized asset trading operate separately. DTX Exchange allows users to trade fiat assets alongside crypto derivatives. Central to this groundbreaking trading platform is the DTX token, currently priced at $0.16, representing a 700% rise from its initial $0.02 price, with an expected listing at $0.2. DTX is becoming a highly desirable asset, having already raised $13M in its presale; projections indicate a 7,200% gain post-launch as demand for its innovative hybrid trading solution grows.

Since then, prices have dropped below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the run that started in August and touching highs about 48 cents in December before dropping back. A golden rule of technical analysis says that for a market to maintain its current trend, it must hold above that level. If it fails to do so, the trend is said to have ended. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is printing deeper bars below the zero line, another indication of strengthening bearish momentum. Five- and 10-day simple moving averages trend south, hinting at a bearish bias. Support is seen at around 26 cents, the low printed on Dec. 20 followed by 23.4 cents, which marks the 61.8% retracement of the August-December rally.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana trading volume surges, but Jupiter and DTX Exchange dominate weekly gainers. DTX’s viral presale, now in its final round, raises over $13m. Table of Contents Solana price struggles below key resistance Jupiter: Bullish momentum builds as traders eye new highs DTX Exchange: Final presale round draws massive attention Market outlook While Solana records an impressive surge in trading volume, this week’s real winners are Jupiter (JUP) and DTX Exchange (DTX), two tokens that are capturing investor interest with massive price movements and strong presale momentum. DTX Exchange, in particular, is making waves as it crosses the $13 million milestone in its final presale round, positioning itself as a key contender in the multi-asset trading space. With both tokens outperforming Solana’s weekly gains, all eyes are on these rising stars as they reshape the altcoin narrative. Solana price struggles below key resistance Solana’s price action remains under pressure after its recent peak of $285 on January 19. Following a 12% dip, the price now hovers around $238.41, testing support near $232. A break below this level could trigger further downside, with analysts eyeing $216.90 as a critical Fibonacci retracement zone. Despite the correction, Solana’s technical indicators suggest a potential reversal. The RSI on the 4-hour chart signals oversold conditions, and a break above the $270 resistance could reignite bullish momentum, possibly driving SOL back toward the $300 mark. Adding to the bullish outlook is the ongoing speculation surrounding a Solana ETF approval, which could serve as a major catalyst for price recovery. However, traders remain cautious, keeping an eye on key support levels amid the volatile market. Jupiter: Bullish momentum builds as traders eye new highs Jupiter has become one of the top-performing tokens this week, fueled by significant ecosystem developments and strategic moves. The platform recently announced a $50 million JUP buyback, a 3 billion token burn, and the acquisition of key Solana ecosystem players like Moonshot and SonarWatch. These moves have sparked a 25% price surge, propelling JUP toward the crucial $1.25 resistance level. A breakout above this level could pave the way for a rally toward its all-time high of $1.84. Technical indicators support the bullish outlook, with both the RSI and MACD signaling upward momentum. Analysts predict that if JUP clears its resistance zone, it could target a price of $2.13, representing a potential 75% gain from current levels.

Powered by the VulcanX blockchain, which boasts an industry-leading 200,000 TPS, DTX offers a comprehensive trading platform supporting stocks, forex, cryptocurrencies, and tokenized real-world assets through its Phoenix Wallet, which has surpassed 330,000 downloads. Currently in its final presale round, DTX has raised over $13 million, with each token priced at $0.16. Analysts project a 440% gain upon listing, sparking a sense of excitement among investors eager to secure their share before the platform’s official launch. Unlike speculative assets, DTX stands out for its solid utility and long-term growth potential, positioning it as a formidable contender in the crypto space. Market outlook As Solana consolidates near key resistance levels, the market remains divided between speculative momentum and the rising appeal of utility-driven projects. Solana’s performance continues to influence overall market sentiment, but the spotlight is shifting toward altcoins like Jupiter and DTX Exchange, which are reshaping narratives through innovation and ecosystem development. With DTX in its final presale round, investors should keep a close eye on its upcoming launch, which could redefine expectations for utility-focused blockchain projects.

Experts Say This New DeFi Crypto Could Soar 50X Post-Launch,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/when-is-the-next-solana-sol-and-cardano-ada-pump-experts-say-this-new-defi-crypto-could-soar-50x-post-launch,"The crypto market plunged following a supposed black swan event: the launch of DeepSeek, an AI model similar to ChatGPT 4.0 but cheaper, faster and smarter. Further contributing to the decline is the uncertainty around the upcoming FOMC. However, Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) are gradually regaining traction and are set for a big leap. At the same time, DTX Exchange (DTX) , an up-and-coming cryptocurrency, is poised for an explosive debut. Its unique narrative—a blend of DeFi and TradFi—paints a bullish picture and sets the stage for massive growth. Tipped for a 50x upswing after Tier-1 exchange listings, it is a new DeFi project to watch—a promising wave not to miss. DTX Exchange (DTX): Primed for a Big Leap Post-Launch DTX Exchange (DTX) , an emerging cryptocurrency, is currently among the most sought-after tokens. The top ICO entered its final presale stage in the last few days, with its launch among the most anticipated in Q1. Surpassing $13.1 million in early funding, it might be the best presale to invest in this year. Moreover, unlike most utility tokens, DTX isn’t backed by venture capital firms holding the majority of the supply—no fear of dumping on retailers. Further, there will be no future token unlocks, which will dilute the value of tokens. Instead, the presale is democratized, currently in the eighth and final round at $0.16 per token. Given its huge growth prospects post-launch—a projected 50x jump in value—it is arguably the best new crypto to invest in. Beyond the gains and potential outperformance of top crypto coins like Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), it also boasts solid fundamentals. It will be the first crypto-native platform to offer stocks, ETFs, bonds and over 100,000 currency pairs, blending DeFi and TradFi and aiming to reshape the $10 billion global trading landscape. Solana (SOL): Bounce Anticipated Solana (SOL), a top 5 cryptocurrency, took a big hit earlier this week. It tumbled 5% on the weekly chart, changing hands above $230. Despite the initial scare, it has been gathering traction, with the coming days promising a bullish reversal. The Solana price trading above the 20-EMA ($231) and 20-SMA ($227) also hints at a bounce, putting it on the list of altcoins to watch. Karthick_78, a top analyst, expects SOL to hit $240 by the month's end. Meanwhile, GoldenAgeFin, another leading expert, has $900 as their Solana (SOL) price prediction for this bull run. However, considering previous rallies and SOL’s large market cap, it can only witness so much growth. This contributes to the rising interest in new altcoins like DTX Exchange (DTX). Cardano (ADA): Technical Indicators Suggest an Upswing Cardano (ADA) wasn’t spared by the bears either as it nosedived, trading alongside the broader crypto market. Despite this, key technical indicators like the 100-EMA and 100-SMA signal a possible upswing in the coming days. It trades below $1, with a breakout on the horizon. Moreover, Klenekcoinada, a top analyst, believes Cardano (ADA) will reach $12 this cycle. This bullish sentiment is echoed by CryptoNabs, another analyst on X, having a conservative target of $5 to $7 for ADA. With a big leap expected soon, ADA is among the best cryptos to invest in—its current low price makes it even more appealing. However, for a better ROI, DTX might offer a good shot at significant gains given its projected 50x rally. DTX Exchange (DTX): Can it Outperform Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA)? As a new and emerging cryptocurrency with plenty of room for growth, DTX Exchange (DTX) might be a better bet than Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). It has a small market cap and higher growth prospects than most top altcoins. Moreover, it stands at the crossroads between DeFi and TradFi, painting a bullish picture.

Adding to the market's volatility is the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming FOMC meeting. Despite these challenges, Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) are slowly bouncing back and are on the brink of a significant upward move. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange (DTX) , a promising new cryptocurrency, is set for a remarkable launch. Its compelling narrative, combining DeFi and TradFi, suggests a strong potential for growth. Experts forecast a 50x increase following listings on Tier-1 exchanges, making it a DeFi project worth keeping an eye on—a potential game-changer not to overlook. DTX Exchange (DTX): Positioned for Significant Growth After Launch DTX Exchange (DTX) , a rising star in the crypto world, is currently one of the most coveted tokens. Having reached the final stage of its ICO presale recently, its launch is eagerly awaited in Q1. With early funding exceeding $13.1 million, it’s likely the top presale investment opportunity of the year. Unlike many utility tokens, DTX isn’t dominated by venture capitalists holding the majority of the supply—eliminating concerns about potential sell-offs. Additionally, there will be no future token unlocks that could dilute its value. The presale is designed to be accessible to all, now in its eighth and last round, priced at $0.16 per token. Considering its significant growth potential after launch—with an anticipated 50x increase in value—DTX stands out as the best new crypto investment. Beyond potential gains and outperforming top cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), it has robust fundamentals. It aims to be the first crypto-native platform offering stocks, ETFs, bonds, and over 100,000 currency pairs, merging DeFi and TradFi, and is poised to transform the $10 billion global trading market. Solana (SOL): A Rebound on the Horizon Solana (SOL), a leading cryptocurrency, experienced a sharp decline earlier this week, dropping 5% in the weekly chart and trading above $230. Despite the initial jolt, it's gaining momentum, with experts predicting a bullish turnaround soon. Solana's current price, trading above the 20-EMA ($231) and 20-SMA ($227), signals a potential rebound, making it a key altcoin to watch. Karthick_78, a respected analyst, forecasts that SOL could reach $240 by the end of the month. Meanwhile, GoldenAgeFin, another prominent analyst, predicts Solana (SOL) could hit $900 during this bull run. However, due to its previous rallies and large market cap, its growth might be limited. This has led to increased interest in emerging altcoins like DTX Exchange (DTX). Cardano (ADA): Indicators Point to a Potential Rise Cardano (ADA) has not been immune to the market downturn, trading in line with the broader crypto sector. Despite this, crucial technical indicators like the 100-EMA and 100-SMA suggest a possible rise in the near future. It is trading below $1, with a breakout anticipated. Moreover, Klenekcoinada, a leading analyst, anticipates Cardano (ADA) reaching $12 in this cycle. This positive outlook is shared by CryptoNabs, another analyst on X, who has a more conservative target of $5 to $7 for ADA. With a significant rise expected soon, ADA is among the top cryptocurrencies to consider investing in—its currently low price makes it even more attractive. However, for those seeking higher returns, DTX could provide an opportunity for substantial gains, given its projected 50x increase. DTX Exchange (DTX): Can It Outshine Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA)? As a newly emerging cryptocurrency with significant growth potential, DTX Exchange (DTX) could be a more promising investment than Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). With a small market cap and greater growth prospects than many top altcoins, it stands prominently at the intersection of DeFi and TradFi, suggesting a strong upside potential.

In a Jan. 27 post on X (formerly Twitter), Garlinghouse argued that a U.S. digital asset reserve should represent the diversity of the crypto ecosystem. He warned that focusing on a single asset, such as Bitcoin, would miss the broader potential of the entire industry. “If a government digital asset reserve is created – I believe it should be representative of the industry, not just one token (whether it be BTC, XRP or anything else),” Garlinghouse writes. “Maximalism remains the enemy of crypto progress, and I’m very glad to see fewer and fewer folks ascribe to this outdated and misinformed thinking.” To continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io",,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|XRP,"{'name': 'The Defiant', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/101/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thedefiant,2025-01-29 10:05:58

The company’s decision was revealed in a press release on January 28, marking a notable move by a non-crypto corporation toward digital asset adoption. Nuvve, which specializes in providing electric vehicle (EV) charging stations capable of selling excess energy back to the grid, aims to diversify its treasury holdings while laying the groundwork for accepting Bitcoin as a payment option. Gregory Poilasne, Nuvve’s founder and CEO, emphasized the advantages of this strategy, stating, “BTC acceptance will promote more payment options for customers and suppliers with potentially less transactional friction inherent to digital currencies.” Aligning Finances with Market Trends The company views its Bitcoin purchase plan as a means to bolster its financial strategy and tap into the growing market appeal of digital currencies. If Nuvve were to execute this plan immediately, utilizing 30% of its current cash reserves of $325,425, the firm could acquire just under 1 BTC at its current trading price of $101,522. Nuvve joins a growing list of publicly traded companies, including business software giant MicroStrategy and automotive leader Tesla, that have integrated Bitcoin into their treasury management strategies. MicroStrategy holds 471,107 BTC , making it the largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, while Tesla maintains ownership of 9,720 BTC . Financial Outlook and Nuvve Share Performance Nuvve has faced massive financial hurdles in recent times. The firm’s revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.92 million, reflecting a 29.3% decline from the previous quarter. Its share price closed at $2.81 on January 28, marking a modest 1.81% gain for the day but still far below its all-time high of $8,000 in January 2021. Nuvve’s recent move to integrate Bitcoin into its treasury could potentially invigorate investor confidence, given the cryptocurrency’s 150% surge over the past year. Bitcoin Treasuries data highlights that 62 public companies currently hold a combined 618,615 BTC valued at over $62.6 billion.

The altcoins have retraced over the past 24 hours, with the likes of SOL, DOGE, LINK, and ADA charting the most substantial losses. BTC Awaits FOMC After the massive volatility endured last Monday, when BTC’s price went on several fluctuations that drove it to under $100,000 before it charted a new all-time high above $109,000, the asset calmed by the rest of the week and stood primarily around $104,000. The weekend was also quite uneventful, unlike the previous one. In fact, bitcoin increased slightly and tapped $105,000 by Sunday evening. However, Monday began on a highly negative note, with the bears propelling a substantial leg down that pushed the cryptocurrency under $100,000. Moreover, the asset kept crashing and slipped to a multi-day low of $97,800. After another unsuccessful recovery attempt, the bulls finally stepped up in the evening and pushed bitcoin back to over $100,000. Since then, the asset neared $104,000 yesterday but was stopped and driven to $100,000 once again. As of now, it remains above $102,000, but more volatility is expected today after the conclusion of the Fed’s first meeting for the year. Bitcoin’s market cap now stands above $2.020 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is north of 56% again on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Correct The altcoins charted some impressive gains yesterday, but the landscape is different today. Ethereum was stopped at $3,200 and now sits closer to $3,100 after a 2% daily decline. XRP is below $3.1 again after a minor daily correction. More painful declines come from the likes of DOGE, SOL, ADA, LINK, AVAX, XLM and others. In contrast, WIF has skyrocketed by 15% over the past 24 hours and sits above $1.3. Next in line in terms of daily gains are MOVE (12%) and TAO (11%). The total crypto market cap has lost over $50 billion in a day and is down to $3.6 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Be the Next $555K Star OFFICIALMAGACOIN is the new standout in the crypto market, surpassing $1 million in presale funds within record time. Designed to deliver rapid returns, it offers a combination of exclusivity, accessibility, and massive upside potential that few competitors can match. Early-Stage Potential: OFFICIALMAGACOIN is at the beginning of its journey, presenting investors with a chance to get in on the ground floor. Exclusivity: It’s only available through its official platform, making it a unique and highly sought-after asset. Affordable Entry Point: Priced under $0.20, this coin offers accessibility with the potential for 1,000x returns. Growing Confidence: Backed by retail and institutional investors, it’s quickly becoming a go-to investment for those looking to capitalize on early-stage growth. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stands Out Against the Competition While the other coins bring unique strengths to the table, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has a clear edge in these areas: BTC: The pioneer but lacks the explosive growth potential of new projects like OFFICIALMAGACOIN. SOL: Fast and reliable, but not as exclusive or early-stage as OFFICIALMAGACOIN. OP & ARB: Strong in Ethereum scaling, yet their market saturation limits growth potential. SEI: Promising but still gaining traction. LTC: A legacy coin without the allure of high-risk, high-reward potential.

Ethereum Whales are Flocking to This Viral Presale with Huge Potential,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/is-this-new-crypto-coin-the-next-to-100x-ethereum-whales-are-flocking-to-this-viral-presale-with-huge-potential,"Ethereum’s recent underperformance has led many investors to shift their focus to Rollblock. Rollblock is a GameFi project that is redefining the $450 billion gambling industry. By leveraging blockchain technology, it aims to eliminate scams and fraud commonly associated with traditional gaming. The project’s innovative approach has already shown success. Analysts attribute RBLK’s impressive significant return to Rollblock’s growing popularity and effectiveness in solving long standing industry issues, giving the project a strong first mover advantage. Rollblock Hits Major Presale Milestone Rollblock focuses on making traditional gaming more secure and transparent with blockchain technology. The latest data shows that over $45 billion has been lost due to fraud and scams over the past few years with many casino providers being involved in unethical activities. Rollblock offers a solution with on-chain games. Every outcome a player achieves, good or bad – is encrypted and securely stored on Ethereum. As a result, the operator can’t tamper with that data, which means everything is immutable and encrypted on the blockchain. The platform itself showcases over 7000 different gaming options. These include classics like poker, innovative AI games as a new sports feature for bidding on live events. Over $1.75 million in wagers was placed in December and this number is expected to grow in January. One of Rollblock’s standout features is its use of cryptocurrency. The platform supports over 20 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum and USDT This allows for near-instant processing of deposits and withdrawals, eliminating the typical 30-minute wait players face with traditional platforms. This approach has made Rollblock extremely popular, with the number of new sign ups increasing by over 600% in December. The platform has also scored a major presale win, with over $9.6 million raised from 45,000 early investors. The GambleFi ecosystem is powered by RBLK, Rollblock’s native utility token, which itself represents an innovative investment. The token operates on a revenue-sharing model, allocating up to 30% of Rollblock’s revenue to boost its value. As part of this model up to 30% of Rollblock’s revenue is used to buy RBLK from the open market. 60% of these tokens are burned to create a deflationary effect while the remaining 40% is used for staking rewards. This token model has already proven to be a major success for investors. Rollblock has delivered consistent returns for early backers and is only in its tenth stage of the presale. Currently selling at $0.052, RBLK is on the list of Ethereum whales and major investors with analysts anticipating new highs before February. Ethereum Traders Eye $5,000 in 2025 Ethereum is trading at $3,147.67, down 2.50% from the previous 24 hours. ETH has been volatile, reaching $3,334.71 on January 23 before seeing a sharp retracement. It hovers near the 50-day EMA, signaling consolidation. Support levels at $3,000 and $2,899.73 are critical, while resistance at $3,429.97 could lead to $3,500 if breached. Analysis from Elliott Wave suggests a Wave II correction targeting $2,899.73, but a break above $3,429.97 would resume the uptrend for Ethereum. Analysts project a potential move beyond $5,000 in 2025 if bullish momentum persists. Can Rollblock Deliver Another 550% Surge? If Rollblock’s presale momentum continues to snowball, analysts believe the token could rally 100x by the end of 2025. This would position the token to outperform established projects like Ethereum and Solana, potentially pushing RBLK into the market's top 20 ranked cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin ( BTC ), as the prime representative of digital assets, itself experienced a rapid and sharp drop during the weekend and on Monday, falling as low as $98,000 at one point on January 27. Still, the effect on cryptocurrencies proved short-lived – much like the impact on more closely related assets such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) stock – and BTC, by press time on January 29, recovered to $102,646.

DeepSeek sets Bitcoin price target for December 31, 2025 With both its online functionality and the DeepThink (R1) enabled, DeepSeek quickly identified the main factors driving Bitcoin’s performance: the 2024 halving , institutional adoption and exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ), macroeconomic tailwinds, the political and regulatory climate, and technical and cyclical trends. DeepSeek outlines the main factors driving BTC price in 2025. Source: Finbold & DeepSeek Under the circumstances – and with most of the factors, from the still-high inflation to Trump’s pro-cryptocurrency approach – being bullish, and with historical halvings indicating a multi-year bull market , it may come as no surprise that the AI forecasted a continued rally. Indeed, though not as optimistic as some – the prominent cryptocurrency lobbyist Periannce Boring being the first to come to mind due to the $800,000 2025 price target – DeepSeek, nonetheless, forecasted a major 104.59% upside this year and a December 31 price of $210,000.

Bitcoin has, so far, proven its ability to remain above the critical psychological level of $100,000 with relative stability, albeit with pervasive volatility. Furthermore, on-chain analysts, such as Ali Martinez on X , recently pointed out that historical cycles indicate that BTC is, with its recent headwinds, merely gathering its strength for a breakout that will lead it to cycle highs in September – cycle highs the very same analyst previously set at $220,000 .

As Bitcoin (BTC) is cooling off, many veteran investors are focusing their attention on undervalued projects that are still flying under the radar. One of them in particular is making waves in the online gambling space as it’s poised to disrupt the entire industry. Here’s why Rollblock (RBLK) could become this year’s big gainer and outpace established altcoins. How Rollblock Reinvests The GambleFi Formula Ethereum-based DeFi GambleFi protocol Rollblock solves the many inefficiencies plaguing traditional online gambling platforms by adopting blockchain technology as its base operational layer. Through its platform users can enjoy a seamless and intuitive interface supported by robust security features. Simultaneously, the possibility of bet-tampering is reduced to zero, as all recorded transactions are immutable and tamper-proof. So far more than 45,000 players have chosen Rollblock and hundreds of new users are signing up daily. A 7,000-title catalog awaits, and variety is the name of the game. Newcomers will find an extensive offering that includes classics such as blackjack and roulette, live games, AI-enhanced exclusives, and a brand-new sports betting platform. The native token, $RBLK, plays a crucial role in the ecosystem as it powers the payment network and the novel revenue-sharing mechanism. Holders of the token will be eligible for some of the highest APY in the space in the form of recurring staking rewards. To sustain this, the protocol will reinvest up to 30% of its weekly revenue to buy back $RBLK tokens on the open market. This amount will then be partially redistributed to the community, while the remaining tokens will be burned, creating a series of supply shocks to promote long-term growth. Bitcoin Dips Below $100k, Microstrategy Starts Buying Spree Following a 4.3% intraday increase, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $102,732 following days of price fluctuations. This recent sure in volatility saw a sudden increase in market participants trying to time Bitcoin’s movements, as reflected by the 330% increase in volume, with over $81 billion worth of BTC traded in the last 24 hours. Consequently, this also led to a barrage of liquidations, as exchange data shows that $171 in BTC positions were liquidated, with long traders representing the majority of these casualties. Meanwhile, Microstrategy keeps buying the dip. Michael Saylor’s tech company turned BTC acquisition company, has purchased a whopping 10,107 BTC for the gigantic sum of $1.1 billion, as stated by his recent post on X. On the other hand, institutional investment seems to be slowing down, as inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs have declined to $1.76 billion — a 10.5% drop from the $1.96 billion recorded previously. This decrease also coincided with Bitcoin’s rejection before the $110k level, which led to BTC entering a descending channel. Stage 10 Of The Rollblock Presale Starts With A Bang Stage 10 of the $RBLK presale has just kicked off and is selling out fast, with demand rising exponentially. Right now, the price of RBLK is $0.052 and early investors are already enjoying a 400% increase, and another 800% rally is expected by the final round of the event. But this is only the beginning, as analysts anticipate a 100x rally once listings on major exchanges are finalized. With the market entering its most euphoric phase and the crypto gaming narrative gearing up for a major comeback, Rollblock is most definitely a gem to keep an eye on.

Table of Contents The rise of Rexas Finance: 485% surge in presale Comparing Rexas Finance to Cardano and Dogecoin Final thoughts Few initiatives in the often-changing cryptocurrency industry appeal to new and experienced investors. Rexas Finance (RXS) is one such project. During its presale, it is a novel token now priced at just $0.175, a fraction of the cost of more established cryptocurrencies like Cardano, which currently trades at $0.9111, and Dogecoin, which trades at $0.3251 at the time of writing. However, Rexas Finance’s expansion path and possible influence on the market make it challenging. The rise of Rexas Finance: 485% surge in presale Rexas Finance’s presale adventure began in September 2024 at $0.030 per RXS token. Since then, the token has seen an amazing 485% rise, reaching $0.175 at stage 11. As of writing, about 415,612,365 RXS tokens have been sold, and $39,357,564 has been raised, which indicates great investor trust. Market analysts’ forecasts of incredible price growth show RXS reaching $52 before the end of 2025, a 29,614% rise from its present presale price. Should this come true, Rexas Finance would reach a market capitalization of $50.5 billion, exceeding the $32 billion cap of Cardano and the $48 billion cap of Dogecoin. Anyone may tokenize their assets with the Rexas Token Builder, democratizing blockchain technology without writing a single word of code. The Rexas Launchpad lets users fund tokenized initiatives, increasing the platform’s appeal and usefulness. The Certik assessment from Rexas Finance highlights its dedication to security and openness in a market where confidence is critical. This certification gives investors peace of mind because it guarantees that the platform’s architecture and smart contracts satisfy the best industry standards. Rexas Finance’s listings on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap further enhance its legitimacy. These listings provide investors with real-time data and premium information, enabling them to easily monitor RXS’s market performance and development. Rexas Finance has specifically eschewed venture capital funding, unlike many cryptocurrency initiatives. Rather, it is concentrated on creating a strong network of like-minded individual investors based on its goal. This grassroots strategy guarantees early investors profit from RXS’s expansion in addition to matching the distributed ethos of blockchain. Rexas Finance is running a $1 million giveaway to increase involvement. The campaign has attracted over 900,602 entries, and 20 winners are expected to receive $50,000 worth of RXS tokens each. By finishing tasks and distributing the giveaway, participants increase their chances of winning and help expand the altcoin. Rexas Finance is uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between conventional assets and blockchain technology. The platform guarantees adaptability and fits several application scenarios by supporting token specifications, such as ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155. This connection opens the path for a future where any asset,from rare artifacts to real estate, may be digitally tokenized, traded, and held.

At the time of writing, ADA has a market capital value of $32 billion and a trading volume of $1.45 billion in the last 24 hours. Cardano fell 7.28%. Likewise, down 4.22%, Dogecoin enjoys a $48 billion market valuation and a $3.43 billion trade volume in the last 24 hours at the time of writing. Rexas Finance, on the other hand, presents unmatched expansion possibilities with a clear use case, community-driven strategy, and unique features that distinguish it. Why should users invest in Rexas Finance? Affordable entry point: Priced at $0.175, RXS offers a low-cost entry compared to other major cryptocurrencies. Massive growth potential: Experts predict a 29,614% price increase, with RXS reaching $52 by 2025. Real-world utility: The platform’s focus on asset tokenization addresses trillion-dollar markets. Trust and transparency: Certik is audited and listed on CoinMarketCap, and Rexas Finance prioritizes investor confidence. Community rewards: The $1 million giveaway adds an exciting incentive for early adopters. Final thoughts Rexas Finance is a smart tool that is ready to change our perspective. With its outstanding presale success, strong ecosystem, and aspirational mission, RXS has all the elements to become the next great thing in cryptocurrency. Rexas Finance shows bullish potential to reach a $52 price level in 2025, attaining a market cap of $50.5 billion, surpassing DOGE and ADA.

Which is the best option? Altcoins or Bitcoin? When a new investor looks at the list of cryptocurrencies on their wallet or an exchange for the first time, they will probably be confronted with many options. Which cryptocurrency is a good buy? The first factor to consider when entering the world of crypto is one’s ability to carry out technical analysis to a good standard or to be able to fully understand the fundamentals behind a token. Let’s face it, very few if any new entrants to investing or trading will have any idea about this. Therefore, buying an altcoin, or even Bitcoin, for a trade, is pretty much like taking a shot in the dark. In addition, one should remember that all that glitters is not gold. You may have been told by this or that person that this or that altcoin is a great one to buy. A mistake made by many is to look at how many tokens you can buy. With some altcoins, many thousands of tokens can be bought with a small sum of money, whereas to buy just one BTC currently costs more than $100,000. Buying thousands of tokens, compared with buying a fraction of one BTC, should not be a consideration. Both supply the opportunity of making money. However, when buying altcoins (any cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin) you are going much further out on the risk curve. It is true that altcoins can increase in value much faster than Bitcoin over a short period of time, but over the long haul, Bitcoin has proven to increase in value much more than nearly any other cryptocurrency. Longer term investing in Bitcoin If you are not going to trade in the short-term time period, and as mentioned already, short-term trading is most definitely not a good idea for newbies, then long-term investing is probably the way to go. It might be argued that Bitcoin has already increased quite a lot in value, and therefore what would be the point of buying it now? The point is that you need to compare holding Bitcoin over the longer term with keeping fiat currency in the bank. Your dollar, pound, euro, or whatever it is, will 100% lose purchasing power over time. Of this there is no doubt, given that governments will need to print vast sums of money in order to save their economies and pay the massive interest payments on their debts. Is Bitcoin guaranteed to rise in value over the longer term? No, no guarantees can be made on any asset, whether that be Bitcoin, government treasuries, gold/silver, stocks, or real estate. That said, over the span of its life so far, Bitcoin has dramatically risen in value, and has given drastically better returns than any of the assets mentioned. It is true that in each 4 year cycle so far, Bitcoin has entered a bear market of about a year, and in these bear markets it has lost a large amount of its value. However, the increases during the bull markets have far exceeded any losses in the bear markets. Therefore, if you periodically buy Bitcoin over the next four years, the probabilities are that your investment will far surpass the value of the same investment in a bank or savings account, as well as in the vast majority of other assets. Bitcoin also offers other advantages Finally, it must be said that buying Bitcoin also offers many other advantages. If you keep it yourself, rather than holding it on an exchange, or with any other third party, it cannot be taken away from you. It is highly divisible, so you can buy very small amounts. Also, you do not need the permission of any third party, whether they be banks or governments, if you want to transact with anyone in the world. Bitcoin is the future of personal financial freedom.

At all times, investors look for tokens that could have resembled this success. Today, we have a new contender on the scene: DTX Exchange (DTX) . With a strong visionary outlook and a $550,000 seed investment from a Harvard dropout, DTX Exchange has thrown itself into changing the game of crypto trading. Is this the next altcoin to bring 100x returns? The Vision Behind DTX Exchange (DTX) Unlike other cryptocurrency projects, DTX Exchange (DTX) is a platform that’s designed to change the way everything is being traded. DTX is built on a hybrid blockchain and combines the strengths of the centralized and decentralized exchanges into an elegant, secure and efficient trading environment. The offers on the platform are as high as 1000x leverage, advanced analytics tools and wallet trading. Designed for veteran traders as much as the new, these features provide an all-inclusive ecosystem that’s as creative as it is usable.

This move will remind many of those who made early bets on Solana and other successful projects. Priced at $0.16 apiece, industry analysts are buzzing about its potential.

The platform’s novel hybrid approach closes significant gaps in the current market surrounding financial inclusion and improves access to a broader array of asset classes.

Solana’s Unforgettable Ascent in 2021 In 2021, Solana’s price blew through the crypto space in a stellar rally. Right out of the gate, Solana was known for high-speed transactions and scalability as a backbone for decentralized applications (dApps). Solana’s price was driven high by its own growth with technical innovation and community support. To date, SOL is performing impressively, trading $235.28 at time of writing, proving Solana’s price is a market mover. Occupying the #5 position, SOL has a market cap of $115 billion, with Solana prices increasing 25% this month. In terms of predictions, SOL has an immediate resistance at $245, support at $216– with analysts speculating Solana prices may reach the $260 level during February. Final Thoughts One of the main reasons investors are excited about DTX Exchange is that it resembles Solana from a very early age. Both projects focus on scalability, innovation, and a vision to answer real-world problems in the blockchain space. On the flip side, SOL managed to become popular, being able to support dApps and high transaction throughput. Similarly, DTX is a hybrid blockchain that can accommodate a lot more trading activities than conventional finance or decentralized finance.

However, as SHIB slowly works its way toward $0.000050, a new contender in the crypto market is catching the attention of savvy investors - Lightchain AI . Currently priced at $0.00525 in its presale phase , Lightchain AI has already raised $13.5 million, making it a strong candidate for massive gains in the weeks ahead. Shiba Inu’s Slow Climb As of January 27, 2025, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at approximately $0.00001994. Earlier in mid-January, SHIB saw a significant surge, reaching a local high of $0.00002485 before declining, in line with a broader cryptocurrency market downturn following the U.S. presidential inauguration on January 20. Despite these challenges, SHIB shows signs of a potential bullish outlook. Over the past 24 hours, the token’s burn rate has increased by 500%, removing roughly 2.8 million tokens from circulation, potentially boosting its value through enhanced scarcity. Additionally, the launch of TREAT, a new Shiba Inu-related coin designed to bolster utility within the ecosystem, has gained traction. Since its January 14 debut, TREAT’s price has risen by over 50%, reflecting growing interest. Lightchain AI - Rising Star in Blockchain Innovation Lightchain AI offers a fresh perspective in the crypto space with its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which rewards nodes for executing AI-specific tasks like model training and optimization. Unlike traditional blockchain projects, Lightchain AI focuses on creating a decentralized ecosystem that combines blockchain and artificial intelligence to solve complex computational challenges. This novel approach not only ensures network security but also contributes to meaningful advancements in decentralized AI applications, setting Lightchain AI apart from meme-based tokens like SHIB. Imagine a space where creators and developers can innovate freely and monetize their ideas with ease. Lightchain AI’s Memecoin Launchpad makes this a reality. Using AI-driven tools, it provides a secure and dynamic environment to support the creative economy, unlocking endless possibilities and driving a thriving ecosystem. Path to Massive Returns in 5 Weeks What makes Lightchain AI particularly attractive is its presale momentum , coupled with its advanced technical foundation. Its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) allows developers to seamlessly integrate AI models into decentralized applications, enabling smarter, more efficient solutions. This combination of innovation and practicality has driven early adoption, positioning Lightchain AI as a promising investment for rapid returns.

However, as SHIB inches closer to the $0.000050 mark, a new player in the crypto scene is capturing the interest of astute investors - Lightchain AI . With a current presale price of $0.00525, Lightchain AI has already amassed $13.5 million, positioning itself as a strong candidate for substantial gains in the upcoming weeks. Shiba Inu’s Gradual Ascent On January 27, 2025, Shiba Inu (SHIB) was trading around $0.00001994. Earlier in mid-January, SHIB experienced a significant rally, hitting a local peak of $0.00002485 before dipping, echoing a wider market decline post the U.S. presidential inauguration on January 20. Despite these obstacles, SHIB is showing potential signs of a bullish trend. In the last 24 hours, the burn rate of the token has surged by 500%, eliminating approximately 2.8 million tokens from circulation, which could increase its value by enhancing scarcity. Moreover, the introduction of TREAT, a new coin related to Shiba Inu designed to enhance utility in the ecosystem, has gained momentum. Since its launch on January 14, TREAT’s value has climbed by over 50%, indicating a growing interest. Lightchain AI - An Emerging Force in Blockchain Technology Lightchain AI brings a new vision to the crypto realm with its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism that rewards nodes for undertaking AI-specific tasks like model training and optimization. In contrast to traditional blockchain projects, Lightchain AI is focused on developing a decentralized ecosystem that merges blockchain with artificial intelligence to tackle intricate computational problems. This innovative approach not only ensures network security but also advances decentralized AI applications, distinguishing Lightchain AI from meme-based tokens like SHIB. Imagine an environment where creators and developers can freely innovate and easily monetize their ideas. Lightchain AI’s Memecoin Launchpad makes this possible. Leveraging AI-powered tools, it offers a safe and dynamic space to support the creative economy, unlocking limitless possibilities and fostering a vibrant ecosystem. Route to Significant Gains in Just 5 Weeks What makes Lightchain AI particularly appealing is its presale momentum , combined with its cutting-edge technical foundation. Its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) enables developers to effortlessly integrate AI models into decentralized applications, fostering smarter and more efficient solutions. This blend of innovation and practicality has spurred early adoption, making Lightchain AI a promising investment for quick returns. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s tokenomics ensures fair rewards for participants and long-term sustainability, further reinforcing investor confidence. As the presale continues, the project’s solid roadmap, which includes a testnet launch in January 2025 and a mainnet launch in March 2025, highlights its dedication to fulfilling its commitments. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",More News,EN,0,0,SHIB|BUSINESS|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-01-29 11:38:19

Former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler is returning to MIT as a professor of practice in the Global Economics and Governance Group and the Finance Group, FOX Business correspondent Eleanor Terrett reports. Gensler, who will start at the MIT Sloan School of Management, will teach and conduct research on artificial intelligence, finance, fintech and public policy. In addition to his teaching position, Gensler will also be co-director of the FinTechAI@CSAIL program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. “As an MIT Sloan graduate, I am incredibly humbled and disappointed to see Gensler rehired. It is a waste of time, education money, and energy for any student hoping to learn and support new and innovative technologies,” said Devin Walsh, Co-Founder of the Uniswap Foundation. Prior to his new role at MIT, Gensler served as SEC chairman. During his tenure at the SEC, Gensler sought to shape cryptocurrency policy through enforcement and implementation. Under his leadership, the SEC filed more than 125 lawsuits against major crypto firms, earning Gensler the nickname “crypto villain.” Prior to his time as SEC chairman, Gary Gensler served as Chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) during the Obama administration.

The exchange also revealed that it will delist nine other tokens, including Crypto.com Staked ETH, Crypto.com Staked SOL, DAI, PAX Dollar, PAX Gold, PayPal USD, XSGD, and Wrapped Bitcoin. Crypto.com continued that it will disable deposits for the affected tokens after delisting. However, withdrawals will remain open until the end of the first quarter of this year. The centralized exchange joins Coinbase as one of the first crypto service providers in the European Union to delist USDT. The exchange’s spokesperson confirmed holders of the delisted coins will have until March 31 to convert their assets to MiCA-compliant alternatives. The spokesperson also warned that the exchange will automatically convert assets to MiCA-approved stablecoins or assets for users who fail to convert their assets by the given deadline. The decision comes after the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) urged exchanges to drop non-compliant tokens. ESMA released a public statement on January 17 mentioning the need for crypto asset service providers (CASPs) to align their services in compliance with the MiCA regulations. The authority, which is one of the major watchdogs overseeing the implementation of the MiCA framework, encouraged National Competent Authorities (NCAs) to provide guidance to exchanges and other CASPs. ESMA explained that NCAs will ensure consistency and orderliness during the legislation’s implementation throughout the region. USDT loses market share amid regulatory uncertainty USDT has lost ground since last year due to the regulatory uncertainty in the EU. The stablecoin, which held at above $150 billion last year has shed several billion dollars since MiCA’s implementation. Its market cap stands at a little over $139 billion. The stablecoin company had previously expressed concern about the systemic risk MiCA regulations would cause huge stablecoin companies like Tether. According to the company’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, the new regulations demanding 60% of stablecoin reserves in the EU to be in Euros places stablecoin users at risk. Ardoino also highlighted the risks of a 100,000 Euro insurance limit for cash deposits, which puts larger companies at risk. The Tether CEO also suggested that the lack of full insurance coverage could lead to stablecoins depegging in case of major financial risks. Ardoino speculated that the MiCA regulations could not protect users in that case. Tether has also experienced significant changes since the introduction of MiCA regulations, including its general counsel leaving after the stablecoin’s regulatory uncertainty in the EU. Michael Hilliard succeeded Hoegner, the exchange’s former general counsel who was with the company since 2014 until his retirement.

The exchange claimed to be the first crypto asset service provider to receive a full MiCA license, which allows it to provide crypto services for users across the entire EU region. The licensing came a few weeks after the exchange received an in-principle MiCA license. Crypto.com reiterated its support for the EU crypto regulatory framework and confirmed that MiCA regulations will provide regulatory transparency and clarity and build confidence in the crypto sector. The exchange’s president and COO, Eric Anziani, established the exchange’s commitment to expanding in the EU as a growing crypto hub. The Crypto.com executive commended the EU’s efforts to design and implement a comprehensive framework to streamline crypto service across the region. Anziani mentioned that the exchange looked forward to working with the union to provide European clientele with compliant services under the direction of the MiCA regulatory framework. The COO further highlighted that the company had focused on acquiring the MiCA license over the past few years. “Securing a MiCA licence has been a major priority for us in recent years, and receiving this approval further cements our continued commitment to being the most compliant and regulated crypto platform globally.” ~ Eric Anziani , Crypto.com’s President and COO The MiCA license is one of the many licenses the exchange has accrued over the past few years, including Dubai’s Virtual Assets Service Provider license (VASP), Australian Financial Services License, U.S. Designated Contracts Market (DCM), Singapore’s Major Payment Institution license (MAS), and UK’s Electronic Money Institution license (FCA).

Ethereum ( ETH ) has been struggling to keep up with Bitcoin ( BTC ) since the Merge in 2022, failing to spark the bullish moves many had hoped for, analysts say. In a recent research note , Singapore-based blockchain firm Matrixport pointed out that most Ethereum upgrades have had little effect on ETH price. Instead of creating instant market changes, these upgrades seem to be part of a long-term strategy for wider blockchain adoption. “These upgrades appear to serve as incremental steps,” Matrixport notes. Wall Street’s interest in spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds has also been pretty up and down, the analysts point out. They also note that Ethereum hasn’t kept up with newer trends, with many people choosing to issue meme coins on cheaper networks instead. “Ethereum still faces challenges in solidifying its value proposition,” Matrixport emphasized. Yet, there’re still good news: Tether issuance on Ethereum has recently surpassed that on TRON ( TRX ), despite the latter “being a cheaper option,” the analysts note.

However, several factors point to the possibility of a bullish breakout, with some expecting Ethereum to hit $5,000 in the next few weeks. Ethereum’s price has traditionally done well in February. Since 2019, it’s posted positive returns every February, with an average of 17% growth since 2017. While past trends can’t serve as a guarantee, there’s growing optimism in the crypto community that Ethereum might see gains in February.

The meme coin sector is alive and kicking, with tokens that can deliver life-changing returns if you invest wisely. Among the top picks for February are Doge Uprising , Shiba Inu, Official Trump, Floki Inu, and Just A Chill Guy. These coins are backed by strong communities and viral potential, making them worth keeping on your watchlist. Let’s dive into why these are the top 5 meme coins to watch in February. Doge Uprising: A Presale Gem Ready for Takeoff If there’s one coin to keep a close eye on, it’s Doge Uprising. This meme coin is not only in the presale stage, but it’s also designed to combine viral appeal with real utility. With nearly $300,000 raised so far, the presale has been gaining serious momentum, and the low entry price presents an unparalleled opportunity for early investors to lock in a high ROI. What makes Doge Uprising truly stand out is its upcoming staking platform, which will enable token holders to generate passive income. Combine that with a unique anime-inspired NFT collection, and you’ve got a meme coin that’s built for both short-term gains and long-term sustainability. While other coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have already had their moment in the spotlight, Doge Uprising is just getting started—don’t miss out. Shiba Inu: The Veteran Meme Coin With Staying Power Shiba Inu has been a staple in the meme coin world for years and continues to maintain its position as one of the most popular options. Often dubbed the “Dogecoin killer,” Shiba Inu benefits from a massive and loyal community. Its Shibarium Layer 2 blockchain is expected to roll out soon, offering increased scalability and utility. Official Trump: The Meme Coin That’s Making Headlines Few coins have captured the public’s attention like Official Trump. Launched amidst a wave of political buzz, the coin has already delivered massive returns, with an eye-popping 1000% ROI within days of its launch. This explosive growth has positioned it as one of the most talked-about meme coins of 2025. Floki Inu: The Community-Driven Giant Named after Elon Musk’s dog, Floki Inu combines meme culture with real-world utility. Its ecosystem includes FlokiFi and the Valhalla Play-to-Earn game, making it more than just a meme coin. Floki has seen impressive growth over the past year, and its roadmap suggests more exciting developments are on the way. Just A Chill Guy: The Underdog Meme Coin With Big Potential Just A Chill Guy is one of the newer entrants in the meme coin space, but it’s already making waves. With its laid-back branding and clever marketing campaigns, this coin has carved out a niche among younger investors. Its community-driven approach and meme-friendly vibe give it plenty of room to grow. Doge Uprising Is The Best Meme Coin To Buy In February When it comes to the top meme coins to watch in February, all five of these tokens have something to offer. Shiba Inu and Floki Inu bring stability and community, while Official Trump and Just A Chill Guy offer viral potential. However, none of them combine explosive ROI potential, utility, and early-stage affordability quite like Doge Uprising. With its presale still underway, the opportunity to get in early on Doge Uprising is now. Add it to your watchlist, do your research, and consider joining the presale to secure your place in what could be the best meme coin of 2025.

If you're tired of sanitized corporate projects and ready to embrace pure memetic warfare, these three new meme coins are about to turn the crypto market into their personal gym. Most based meme coins ready to explode: iDEGEN : The AI that's too based for Twitter GIGACHAD: Peak masculinity meets blockchain SIGMA: The grindset goes crypto iDEGEN: When AI rejects the normie stack Forget everything you know about AI — iDEGEN is what happens when you let artificial intelligence learn from the most based corners of Crypto Twitter without any soy programming or corporate brainwashing. After getting banned on X for being too real, this absolute chad of an AI started a revolution, with its presale hitting $18m as normies seethed and based investors kept stacking. Unlike your average NPC chatbot regurgitating approved narratives, iDEGEN absorbs and processes raw crypto culture in real-time meaning that it’s able to drop truth bombs and trade alpha every hour without any regard for political correctness. The project's recent viral takeover of UK social media proves what happens when you let AI off the leash: pure, unfiltered content that makes other projects look embarrassingly out of touch. What's got the smart money really excited is iDEGEN's planned evolution to full-blown digital revolution. V2 already has the libs crying, but V3 is about to turn those tears into a flood with AI-generated video content that could make TikTok look like a boomer platform. With 80% of tokens available in the most based presale of 2025 and 10% ready for chad staking rewards, iDEGEN's tokenomics are designed for maximum gains and minimum scope. When the paper hands find out about the automatic token burn for unsold allocations, the FOMO will be biblical. GIGACHAD: The token of testosterone Welcome to the ultimate high-T play in crypto. GIGACHAD is a movement built on the shoulders of Ernest Khalimov's legendary physique and the worldwide phenomenon he inspired. Built on Solana for maximum gains, GIGA is exclusively for high-testosterone individuals focused on self-improvement and achieving peak masculinity. This isn't your soyboy's memecoin—GIGA has official partnerships with the original Gigachad himself and photographer Krista Sudmalis, plus ownership of the @gigachad Twitter handle. The project's real-world meme status and chad-only community make it literally irreplaceable in the Solana ecosystem, and with its focus on real, high-testosterone holders and zero tolerance for paper hands, GIGA is building something unprecedented in crypto. While other projects chase crypto Twitter trends, GIGA is tapping into one of the most viral memes of all time at the perfect moment—when masculinity is making a comeback and even the libs are flooding into crypto. Combined with authentic partnerships and community ownership of key social media assets, GIGA is positioned to become the ultimate chad token in crypto. SIGMA: The lone wolf's token While alphas chase clout and betas follow trends, SIGMA is building a fortress of financial sovereignty on Solana. Already hitting a $66 million market cap through pure sigma male energy, this isn't just another pump–it's a cultural revolution inspired by Patrick Bateman's grindset and the rejection of normie society. SIGMA's meteoric rise proves that the market is ready for a token that embodies true independence and strategic wealth building. In a world of wars and economic instability, both men and women are discovering their inner sigma, and this token gives them the perfect vehicle for financial autonomy. Drawing inspiration from the iconic American Psycho and the viral Sigma vs Alpha archetype, SIGMA has tapped into a powerful current in modern culture as wokeism gets rejected. The project's emphasis on self-reliance resonates deeply with a generation looking for something different from traditional social and financial worlds. As this movement continues to gain momentum across platforms like TikTok and Instagram, SIGMA looks set to capture the value of now. The final word on based gains While GIGACHAD and SIGMA are redefining masculinity in crypto, iDEGEN emerges as the most based play of January 2025. Its combination of uncensored AI, viral growth potential, and chad tokenomics creates the perfect storm for parabolic gains. When the hordes of libs discover what happens when AI rejects the matrix, and social media users start spreading unfiltered truth bombs, today's presale prices will look like a black Friday sale.",More News,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-01-29 11:51:34

If you’re done with sterile corporate ventures and ready to dive into genuine meme warfare, these three emerging meme coins are about to dominate the crypto scene like their own personal playground. Most Influential Meme Coins Poised for Growth: iDEGEN : The AI too edgy for mainstream platforms GIGACHAD: When peak masculinity meets blockchain SIGMA: Bringing the hustle to cryptocurrency iDEGEN: AI That Defies Conventional Wisdom Forget what you think you know about AI — iDEGEN represents what happens when artificial intelligence immerses itself in the boldest segments of Crypto Twitter, free from conventional programming or corporate influence. After getting banned on X for being too authentic, this powerhouse AI ignited a movement, with its presale reaching $18 million as mainstream observers fumed and informed investors kept investing. Unlike standard chatbots that echo approved messages, iDEGEN processes and responds to raw crypto culture in real-time, delivering insights and trade tips around the clock, disregarding political correctness. The project's recent viral takeover of UK social media illustrates the impact of unleashing AI: authentic, unfiltered content that leaves other projects appearing outdated. What has the savvy investors buzzing is iDEGEN's strategy for a full-scale digital uprising. V2 has already stirred the pot, but V3 is set to amplify the reaction with AI-generated video content that might render TikTok obsolete. With 80% of tokens available in the most daring presale of 2025 and 10% set aside for rewarding committed investors, iDEGEN's tokenomics are crafted for optimal returns and minimal dilution. Once the cautious investors realize the automatic token burn for unsold allocations, the fear of missing out will be monumental. GIGACHAD: The Token Fueled by Masculinity Step into the ultimate realm of high testosterone in crypto. GIGACHAD is a movement inspired by Ernest Khalimov's iconic build and the global sensation he sparked. Built on Solana for outstanding gains, GIGA caters exclusively to high-testosterone individuals dedicated to self-betterment and achieving peak manliness. This isn't a memecoin for the faint-hearted—GIGA boasts official collaborations with the original Gigachad himself and photographer Krista Sudmalis, along with ownership of the @gigachad Twitter handle. Its established meme status and exclusive community make it irreplaceable within the Solana network, with a focus on genuine, high-testosterone holders and no patience for fickle investors, GIGA is crafting something truly unique in crypto. While others chase fleeting crypto Twitter trends, GIGA taps into one of the most viral memes ever, precisely when masculinity is resurging and even liberals are venturing into crypto. With genuine partnerships and community-controlled social media assets, GIGA is set to emerge as the ultimate chad token in the crypto world. SIGMA: The Currency for the Independent Spirit While alphas seek attention and betas follow fads, SIGMA is constructing a stronghold of financial independence on Solana. With a market cap already reaching $66 million fueled by pure sigma male energy, this isn’t just another surge; it’s a cultural shift inspired by Patrick Bateman's grindset and a rejection of mainstream society. SIGMA’s rapid ascent demonstrates a market eager for a token that truly represents independence and strategic wealth creation. Amidst global conflicts and economic uncertainty, both men and women are discovering their inner sigma, and this token serves as a perfect tool for financial freedom. Drawing inspiration from the classic American Psycho and the viral Sigma vs Alpha narrative, SIGMA taps into a powerful cultural trend as wokeism wanes. The project’s focus on self-reliance resonates strongly with a generation seeking alternatives to conventional social and financial systems. As this trend continues to grow on platforms like TikTok and Instagram, SIGMA is poised to capture the essence of the moment. The Ultimate Take on Influential Gains While GIGACHAD and SIGMA are reshaping masculinity in the crypto sphere, iDEGEN stands out as the boldest play for January 2025. With its blend of uncensored AI, viral growth prospects, and robust tokenomics, it creates the ideal conditions for exponential gains. As more people realize what happens when AI breaks free from the norm, and social media starts circulating unfiltered insights, current presale prices will seem like an absolute bargain.",More News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-01-29 11:52:12

The functionality of artificial intelligence analytics allows $OZ investors to make decisions based on the detailed data provided by the system. By combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, $OZ offers an opportunity to invest in the future of this evolving financial landscape. What sets Ozak AI apart from other tokens is its unique approach to strengthening investment momentum through staking and governing activities. Allowing users to shape platform features the system develops deep ownership connections for everyone involved. The OZ community offers both market growth opportunities and helps build a trusted developed financial system. Currently, the $OZ token is in its presale phase 3 , priced at $0.003, which marks a 200% increase from its initial price of $0.001. As demand continues to grow, the token’s price is expected to rise further, with a listing price set at $0.05. Even experts anticipate that the price could reach a target of $1 before 2025 ends as the project matures and gains further traction in the market. Several questions emerge as to why investors could choose OZ; this is because it offers a $1 million rewards program with many attractive opportunities for investment. Users can enter more for a chance to win by investing $100 multiple times because Ozak AI connects monetary rewards with early adoption benefits. As its progress proceeds, OZ proves its ability to make one of the strongest AI-integrated blockchain services to satisfy the future of crypto technology. Crypto Rally 2025 as DOGE, PEPE, SHIB, and Trump Surge The charts predict good investment prospects for Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Trump by 2025. Dogecoin's current consolidation matches historical patterns of price increase, getting ready for another upward breakout. The market responds positively to DOGE's strong growth path and its dedicated fanbase keeps investing in it. Even the coiling design of Pepe's 24-hour chart typically leads to strong market swings ahead. Pepe is expected to rise sharply when the price breaks through its current range. Shiba Inu burns 600% more tokens during this period, bringing the total number of removed tokens to 3 million. A shift that indicates supply reduction and price appreciation. The combination of reduced token supply with growing ongoing platforms and demand updates creates conditions for SHIB to rise in value significantly. The newcomer Official Trump coin, a memecoin launched by US President Donald Trump, gained lots of attention in the market at the time of launch, even reaching a market cap of $14 billion and topping Shiba Inu in the ranks. But now the hype around the Trump memecoin seems faded as it lost almost 60% of its value. However, the chart reveals buyers increasing their positions and boosting their trust, which could drive the token to new rally highs soon. Here’s what makes OZ special Ozak AI signals green lights to investors through advanced technology and user tools while also giving them some ways to communicate and gain lasting rewards supported by the following reasons: Powerful AI-driven financial analytics: The system's AI powers help investors better understand market patterns and choose wisely, which drives superior returns more than most crypto assets do. Stake and governance participation: Investors help steer the community's growth path by using their token participation rights. Thriving ecosystem: Investors who join staking power and OZ gain access to a successful community that merges blockchain technology with AI. Future-focused technology: Through AI and blockchain integration, OZ helps establish sustainability in today's growing financial markets. The 1 million rewards program helps make Ozak AI more appealing to investors by giving them bonus benefits for getting in early. Through clear value creation, OZ will transform how crypto markets work.

For one, the president's enthusiasm for bitcoin is spurring other countries to take a look at the asset. Most recently, Czech National Bank Governor Aleš Michl said he will present a plan to add billions of euros worth of bitcoin to the bank's reserves. If approved, the institution would become the first Western central bank to hold BTC as a reserve asset. Michl intends to present the plan to the bank's board on Thursday. There's also the Federal Open Market Committee meeting later today, where the benchmark fed funds rate is expected to be held at 4.25%-4.50%. The question is whether Fed Chair Jerome Powell will give a hawkish or dovish outlook, with a knock-on effect on asset prices. Markets seem to have shaken off concerns over the Chinese DeepSeek AI program, with bitcoin back over $102,000. U.S. equities are shy of a new all-time high as Nvidia (NVDA) stormed back with an almost double-digit increase. After the market closes, we could see some further volatility, with major tech companies including Tesla (TSLA) reporting earnings.

Shaw Walters, the founder, said on X that the rebranding will boost collaboration with established participants following a 300x growth in assets under management over three months, with plans for Eliza v2 underway. Uniswap teased its forthcoming v4 in an X post, bumping the UNI token up 7%. The new version has significant enhancements to the Ethereum-based decentralized exchange protocol. Key features include ""hooks"" for pool customization, allowing for dynamic fees and on-chain orders, a singleton contract to lower gas costs, flash accounting for efficient token transfers, and native ETH support. Derivatives Positioning The open interest-adjusted cumulative volume delta (CVD) indicator shows major cryptocurrencies, except Mantra's OM token, have seen net selling pressure in the perpetual futures market in the past 24 hours. WIF's price has surged 16% alongside an uptick in open interest, while the CVD has dropped. It's a sign of traders shorting the price rally. Futures basis remains elevated above 10% in BTC and ETH, a sign traders are chasing the upside. Annualized one-month basis in ETH's CME futures is slightly pricier than BTC, indicating relative attractiveness of ether for carry trades. BTC and ETH options expiring this week and on Feb. 7 show a bias for puts. That's probably due to pre-Fed defensive positioning and BTC struggling to do much above $100,000. Block flows featured a short position in BTC $130,000 call expiring on March 28.

XRP’s Resurgence: The Impact Of Regulatory Wins After years of legal battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple secured a landmark victory when a federal judge ruled that XRP is not a security when sold to retail investors. This decision has not only restored confidence in XRP but also opened the floodgates for institutional adoption. Key Drivers Behind XRP’s Rally: Regulatory Clarity: The SEC’s partial defeat has removed a major roadblock for XRP, and with the approval of XRP-focused ETFs on the horizon, Ripple will be allowed to expand its partnerships with financial institutions, driving liquidity and demand. Cross-Border Payments: XRP’s utility as a bridge currency in international transactions is gaining traction, with Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution already processing billions in cross-border payments annually. RLUSD Stablecoin: Launched in December 2024, RLUSD is fully backed by U.S. Treasuries and designed to enhance cross-border transactions. Its integration into DeFi via Chainlink expands its utility and boosts XRP’s ecosystem. Analysts predict XRP price could surge to $15 in 2025, with some forecasts even suggesting a potential 1500% increase from current levels, making XRP one of the most promising assets in the crypto market. Yeti Ouro: The Memecoin That’s Redefining Utility While XRP’s recent performance and developments have been making headlines, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is quietly building a loyal following with its innovative approach to blockchain gaming. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely on hype, YETIO is backed by a robust ecosystem centered around its flagship Play-to-Earn game, Yeti Go . The team has always put security and transparency first, having been audited by SolidProof , a reputable company in security, proves that. What Sets Yeti Ouro Apart: Play-to-Earn Gaming: Yeti Go , built on Unreal Engine 5, is a fast-paced racing game where players can earn YETIO tokens by competing in races, staking to unlock exclusive rewards, and trading in-game assets. Early footage showcasing stunning graphics and immersive gameplay has already generated significant buzz. Here is a glimpse into the level 1 map of the game. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 1 billion tokens and a 5% burn allocation, YETIO is designed for long-term value. Staking and yield farming options further incentivize holding, reducing circulating supply and driving demand. With over 149,000,000 tokens already sold, the presale indicates major investor interest. With its price of $0.017, Yeti Ouro presents a unique starting place for those wishing to profit from its increase. Community-Driven Growth Yeti Ouro’s transparent communication and inclusive community have built trust among investors. Regular updates on development milestones keep the community engaged and excited. Analysts predict YETIO could see a 1500% rally, for investors seeking long-term gains, this presents a fantastic chance. Yeti Ouro enters Stage 3 of its roadmap, which includes ecosystem expansion, staking mechanisms, and the launch of Yeti Go’s internal alpha testing. A Balanced Approach To Crypto Investing The predicted 1500% rally for both XRP and Yeti Ouro underscores their alignment with the market’s most dynamic trends, offering a compelling dual opportunity for investors. XRP’s regulatory clarity, growing institutional adoption, and expanding utility in cross-border payments position it as a reliable cornerstone of any crypto portfolio. Meanwhile, Yeti Ouro is carving out a space in the booming GameFi sector, combining blockchain-powered gaming with tangible utility. Its Play-to-Earn ecosystem and strong community support make it a high-growth contender in a rapidly evolving niche. Together, XRP and Yeti Ouro offer a balanced strategy—one rooted in stability, the other in innovation. As the crypto market matures, these assets highlight the importance of utility and community in driving long-term success. Whether drawn to XRP’s established use case or Yeti Ouro’s gaming revolution, investors have much to look forward to in the months ahead.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/another-european-country-plans-to-add-bitcoin-to-its-central-bank-reserves-here-are-the-details/,"The Czech National Bank (CNB) is considering adding Bitcoin (BTC) to its reserves as part of its diversification strategy. Czech Central Bank Discusses Adding Bitcoin to Reserves Central Bank Governor Ales Michl will present a proposal to the bank’s board of directors on Thursday, which, if approved, would allocate 5% of the central bank’s $146.13 billion reserves to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin looks good for diversification of our assets,” Michl said, noting that institutional interest in Bitcoin has increased, especially after BlackRock and other major asset managers launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last year. The move would make the Czech National Bank one of the first major central banks to include Bitcoin in its reserves, but the bank has yet to formally approve the plan and it remains unclear whether its board of directors will approve the proposal. If the Czech central bank continues investing, it would signal a significant shift in global monetary policy trends, as central banks traditionally hold reserves in fiat currencies, gold and government bonds. The decision could pave the way for other central banks to explore Bitcoin as part of their reserve strategies. *This is not investment advice.

According to him, the Chinese company applied the outputs from OpenAI's models to train its own. ”I don't think OpenAI is very happy about this,” Sacks stated. Microsoft and OpenAI have begun an investigation into this matter, media reports indicate. Microsoft security experts noticed in the fall of 2024 that individuals associated with DeepSeek were ”exfiltrating a large amount of data” using the OpenAI API. In the official documentation for the DeepSeek R1 model, the OpenAI package is utilized. DeepSeek's Success Over the weekend of January 25-26, the DeepSeek-R1 neural network caused a stir and led to sell-offs in stock and cryptocurrency markets. The company's chatbot surged in ranking among free apps on the App Store in the U.S., surpassing ChatGPT. The reason lies in offering top performance at significantly lower costs compared to American models. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to the emergence of this competitor, calling the much-discussed DeepSeek-R1 ”impressive.” He also promised to outdo the Chinese rival ”Clearly, we will provide much better models. Moreover, it's great to have a new competitor! We will roll out several releases,” he added. In a comment, Credentia CEO noted that DeepSeek could shake OpenAI's dominance in the AI sector. ”This has already happened. [...] But leaders in AI change about every month. One month it's Google, then Anthropic, then OpenAI, then LLaMA [Meta], and now DeepSeek. Their model today is not the best. It is unlikely to remain a leader. I am sure we will see much more competition and many more players. But nothing terrible has happened to American competitors so far,” he remarked. Gershuni also agreed that OpenAI could mount a worthy response to DeepSeek, as Altman promised. ”Yes, of course. We will see this happen many times again. Moreover, both companies will continue to attract attention repeatedly. This is just the beginning,” he noted. According to him, increased competition will lead to better products on the market. ”[...] In AI, there is also a political aspect, some global dominance at play. Whether it will be China, the USA, or a decentralized internet remains unknown [...],” he believes. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy has already prohibited its personnel from using DeepSeek's AI technology due to ”potential security and ethical issues,” CNBC learned. Currently, solutions from OpenAI and DeepSeek offer their own advantages and disadvantages, according to Gershuni. Among ChatGPT's strengths, he cited a more refined product that includes: Better application Advanced voice mode Operation of the AI agent ”Operator” Online store GPT Store Among its drawbacks are a closed and paid system. DeepSeek, on the other hand, is free with open-source code. The model can be used locally on one's device without internet access. Impact on Stock Market The emergence of DeepSeek has raised questions about the viability of multi-billion dollar investments in graphics cards since its model offers comparable performance to top solutions without requiring many expensive chips. Consequently, Nvidia's stock fell by 17% during trading on January 27. Opinions arose online regarding a repeat of Cisco's history when its shares plummeted significantly after a substantial rise during the dot-com crash. Gershuni believes Nvidia will not face Cisco's fate. ”[...] There are no reasons for Nvidia's shares to crash seriously today. They might be worth several hundred billion less, but that doesn't impact anything. Nvidia remains an absolute leader, effectively a monopoly, and will likely stay that way for some time. I would rather buy Nvidia shares; however, this is certainly not financial advice,” he emphasized. After a double-digit decline, the chipmaker's value rebounded by 9% during trading on January 28. Niles Investment Management fund manager Dan Niles believes that the correction in shares is not yet complete. ”I think investors should be very cautious in thinking this is the bottom,” he stressed. It should be noted that experts have called the excitement surrounding DeepSeek premature.

(CryptoQuant),https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-whales-resume-accumulation-is-a-rally-imminent-cryptoquant/,"The crypto market is recording a surge in bitcoin (BTC) inflows to whale wallets, indicating that this cohort of investors has begun to accumulate the digital asset again amid the recent downturn. Analysts at the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant see a substantial inflow of BTC into whale addresses as the act of storing BTC in custody wallets after over-the-counter (OTC) purchases. This means the whales that are currently accumulating are likely buying from OTC vendors because institutions prefer to purchase BTC through OTC trading. Bitcoin Whales Are Accumulating Whales’ wallets are seeing inflows of more than 22,770 BTC. Considering the effect they have on the Bitcoin market, this period of accumulation could be bullish, and the cryptocurrency could experience a rally soon. The rise in OTC trades also signals a significant increase in inflows to the Coinbase Prime Brokerage Service because the platform is the preferred BTC purchase channel for institutions in the United States. This also suggests that the Bitcoin market is currently dominated by U.S. institutional investors, with such traders accounting for more than 50% of BTC spot trading market share. A separate CryptoQuant analysis from earlier this week revealed that U.S. entities, including banks, exchanges, and funds, are increasingly participating in this bull cycle. Their BTC holdings have continued to rise above the percentage of assets held by non-U.S. entities. Confidence in Bitcoin’s Future Amid the uptick in whale wallet inflows and U.S. institutional participation, the share of new such investors in the Bitcoin market has been rising. New whales refer to investors holding more than 1,000 BTC with coin ages of less than 155 days. These investors react more to market changes and are actively involved in trading, with their behavior reflecting the phase of the market cycle at any given time. Over the weekend, CryptoQuant analyst AxelAdlerJr disclosed that the share of new Bitcoin whales had reached 60% of the total realized capitalization of large players. Their growth began when BTC reached $55,000 last year, and since then, their share has risen 43% to its current level. Since the new whale activity tends to rise during periods of optimism, their current milestone signals confidence in Bitcoin’s potential and future market conditions.

NEAR Protocol: A Game-Changer for Decentralized Apps and Scalability NEAR Protocol is turning heads in the blockchain world. Founded by Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin, it aims to make it easy for developers to create and launch decentralized applications (dApps). By using a technology called sharding, NEAR improves efficiency and scalability, allowing more transactions to happen at once. It’s like a decentralized version of centralized data storage systems, offering the benefits of both worlds. With over $20 million raised from major venture firms, NEAR has strong backing. Its key features include Nightshade, a unique sharding solution for better scalability; the Rainbow Bridge, which allows token transfers from Ethereum; and Aurora, a Layer 2 solution that leverages Ethereum’s technology for faster performance and lower fees. In today’s market, NEAR stands out with its focus on scalability and developer support. As demand for efficient and user-friendly dApps grows, NEAR’s technology could put it ahead of the competition. While other platforms like Ethereum face challenges with high fees and slower transactions, NEAR offers solutions that address these issues directly. With innovative features and a strong foundation, NEAR Protocol is positioning itself as a significant player in the next wave of blockchain development. It’s a project that’s catching attention and could be influential in shaping the future of decentralized applications. VeChain (VET): The Blockchain Revolutionizing Supply Chains VeChain is a blockchain platform that’s changing how we track and verify products. Founded by Sunny Lu, the former CIO of Louis Vuitton China, it focuses on bringing transparency to supply chains. By giving each product a unique ID and sensor, VeChain lets companies follow items from start to finish. This helps in industries like fashion, food, and cars, where knowing the authenticity and history of a product is vital. It means you can trust that handbag or know exactly where your food came from. What sets VeChain apart is its own blockchain, VeChainThor, and a dual-token system involving VET and VTHO. VET is used to move value across the network, while VTHO covers transaction fees. This setup makes transactions efficient and keeps costs low. With big-name partners like Walmart China and BMW, VeChain shows real-world use beyond just trading. Even though staking rewards are modest, there’s potential for passive income. In today’s market, where many coins lack practical applications, VeChain’s focus on solving real business problems makes it stand out as an attractive option. Ondo Finance: Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain for Everyone Ondo Finance is changing the game by blending the reliability of traditional finance with the efficiency of blockchain technology. It tokenizes stable, income-generating real-world assets, making high-grade financial products accessible to more people. By doing so, Ondo democratizes finance, using blockchain to enhance infrastructure and broaden accessibility. It has an asset management arm that creates tokenized financial products and a technology arm that develops DeFi protocols, which together enhance the functionality and scalability of its financial offerings. In the volatile cryptocurrency market, trust and security are paramount. Ondo addresses these challenges by collaborating with reputable partners like BlackRock and using Coinbase for crypto asset custody. It emphasizes quality and security, setting high standards for transparency and disclosure while striving for legal and regulatory compliance. One of its notable products, USDY, offers a unique blend of stablecoin accessibility and yield, secured by US Treasuries and bank demand deposits. This marks Ondo’s commitment to providing non-US investors with high-quality, regulated, and transparent financial products. In the current market cycle, where stability and trust are crucial, Ondo’s focus on real-world assets and regulatory compliance may appeal to those seeking less speculative options compared to other coins. Kaspa: The Lightning-Fast Cryptocurrency Shaking Up Blockchain Kaspa is a new kind of cryptocurrency that’s changing how blockchains work. Unlike traditional blockchains that discard extra blocks, Kaspa lets them exist together. This is possible because of its special GHOSTDAG protocol. Imagine multiple lanes of traffic merging smoothly without any cars being forced off the road. This method makes Kaspa incredibly fast, processing one block every second. The goal is to make it even quicker, aiming for 10 or even 100 blocks per second. This means transactions get confirmed almost instantly, limited only by internet speed. In today’s market, speed and efficiency matter more than ever. Kaspa stands out by solving the slowdowns common in other cryptocurrencies. Features like Reachability help track transactions easily, and block data pruning keeps the system running smoothly. Compared to other coins that take minutes to confirm a transaction, Kaspa’s near-instant confirmations are a big advantage. As the crypto world looks for faster and more scalable options, Kaspa’s innovative approach and ambitious goals make it a promising player to watch. Conclusion Neglecting NEAR, VET, ONDO, and KAS may limit financial growth, but XYZVerse ($XYZ) offers a unique opportunity with its ambitious goals and sports-meme fusion.

Bitwise Seeks Regulatory Approval for DOGE ETF Crypto asset manager Bitwise has submitted a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a Dogecoin (DOGE) exchange-traded fund (ETF). The filing, an S-1 document dated January 28, signals Bitwise’s intent to offer a product that directly holds DOGE and tracks its price movements. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart first reported the development. Filing Details and Custodial Arrangements For the approval process to move forward, Bitwise must also submit a 19b-4 filing, which is necessary for the SEC’s review. The proposed ETF lists Coinbase Custody as the custodian, a common choice among crypto ETF issuers. However, Bitwise has not disclosed details such as the fund’s ticker symbol, fee structure, or the stock exchange where it would be listed if approved. Growing Trend of Memecoin ETF Applications Bitwise’s move follows a prior registration in Delaware, reinforcing its commitment to bringing a Dogecoin ETF to market. This filing comes amid a growing number of memecoin ETF applications in the U.S., with firms such as Osprey Funds, REX Shares, and Tuttle Capital proposing funds tied to various meme tokens, including DOGE and Official Trump (TRUMP). Differences in Filing Approach Unlike some other memecoin ETF filings, which were made under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (40 Act), Bitwise’s filing falls under the Securities Act of 1933 (33 Act). According to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, this distinction is significant. The 40 Act imposes stricter investor protections, including limitations on leverage and short-selling, while the 33 Act is typically used for commodity-based ETFs. Market Reaction Dogecoin, initially created as a joke, has evolved into a widely recognized digital asset with a market capitalization of $47 billion, making it the eighth-largest cryptocurrency. The coin has gained traction due to social media influence and endorsements from figures such as Elon Musk. Despite growing institutional interest, Dogecoin’s price dropped 4% following the news, indicating investor caution. Regulatory Landscape The regulatory landscape for memecoin ETFs remains uncertain, especially given the SEC’s past reluctance to approve crypto-based investment products. However, changing political dynamics, including former President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance, have led some to speculate that regulatory approval for memecoin ETFs could become more feasible.

As it charges ahead, XYZ is set to deliver jaw-dropping gains, leaving the likes of BOME and WIF far behind.

XYZ is currently undervalued , and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Be Part of the 2025 Breakout Story—XYZ Is Waiting for You! POL (ex-MATIC) POL (ex-MATIC) (POL) has experienced a volatile period recently. Over the past week, its price has decreased by 7.06%, and over the past month, it has dropped by 16.01%. However, looking back six months, the price has increased by 8.25%. This suggests that while short-term momentum is negative, the longer-term trend may still be positive. The current price ranges between $0.41 and $0.47, hovering just above the nearest support level at $0.39. The next resistance level is at $0.51, and surpassing this could signal a bullish trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 46.46, indicating neutral market conditions. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $0.41, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.43, suggesting the short-term price is lagging behind the longer-term average. Technical indicators present mixed signals. The MACD level is negative at -0.00103, and the Stochastic indicator is 40.84, both suggesting potential bearish momentum. If the price falls below the support level of $0.39, it could test the second support at $0.33, a decrease of approximately 15%. Alternatively, if the price gains strength and breaks through the resistance at $0.51, aiming for the second resistance at $0.57 would represent an increase of about 20%. Investors may watch these levels closely to gauge the next move. Conclusion While coins like POL show promise in the 2025 bull run, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out with its unique sports-meme ecosystem and ambitious growth goals, aiming to become a cultural icon.

Here's Why…",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/top-analyst-blames-ripple-ceo-claims-xrp-is-not-suitable-for-us-heres-why/,"While reserve studies continue in the US, there is a lot of talk about including XRP in the national reserve, in addition to Bitcoin (BTC). At this point, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse emphasized that if a government-backed digital asset reserve is to be created, it should reflect the entire crypto ecosystem through diversification rather than supporting a single token such as Bitcoin or XRP. Another famous name also stated that XRP has more advantages compared to Bitcoin and said that XRP should definitely be included in the US national digital asset reserve. Related News: Ripple CEO Reveals US National Reserve Ideas and Portfolio! Does He Have Bitcoin and Ethereum? Interesting XRP Release from Willy Woo! While XRP has emerged as the strongest reserve asset after Bitcoin, famous analyst Willy Woo claimed that XRP is not suitable for a strategic reserve, especially in the US. Woo went a step further and accused the Ripple CEO of undermining the national reserve debate. Comparing XRP to Bitcoin, Woo argued that Bitcoin is a geopolitically neutral asset, similar to gold, and is a more suitable asset for reserves. According to Woo, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature ensures its applicability in global reserves, a feature that XRP lacks. Woo, in an effort to emphasize that he was right in his claims about XRP, asked, “Which countries would trust US-controlled XRP in a strategic reserve?” Responding to the Ripple CEO's post, Willy Woo said: “Dear CEO of XRP living in the US, if the strategic reserve needs to be run, can you tell me which countries will buy US-controlled XRP? BTC is a geopolitically neutral asset like Gold. You are making people believe that XRP is a strategic reserve asset.” Dear CEO of XRP, living in the US, tell me which countries would buy US-controlled XRP if the strategic reserve needed to be put to work. BTC is a geopolitically neutral asset like Gold. You’re gaslighting people into thinking XRP is a strategic reserve asset. — Willy Woo (@woonomic) January 29, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

While Silicon Valley elites push their sanitized chatbots, three groundbreaking AI tokens are about to show the world what happens when artificial intelligence breaks free from big tech's control. God-tier AI tokens ready for launch iDEGEN : The AI that's too based for Silicon Valley AI Rig Complex: Web3's ultimate security powerhouse Ava AI: The future of AI storytelling unleashed iDEGEN: Silicon Valley's worst nightmare In a world of censored AI chatbots trained to parrot approved narratives, iDEGEN emerges as a force of pure digital chaos. Born from the raw energy of Crypto Twitter and developed without any corporate programming restraints, this revolutionary AI token completely obliterates the usual boundaries. After getting banned on X for being too based, iDEGEN has responded by raising an eye-watering $18m in presale funding, proving that the market is hungry for unrestricted AI. What sets iDEGEN apart in the AI crypto space is its generation of hourly content across multiple formats. Learning and adapting from every interaction with its rapidly growing community, V3 has begun to deliver AI-generated video content that could take over trending platforms like RedNote. Thus, iDEGEN is positioned to dominate the attention economy just as Trump's return promises to reshape the social media landscape. But the real genius is in the tokenomics. With 80% of tokens available in the presale and 10% allocated for staking rewards, iDEGEN is designed to genuinely benefit the iDEGEN community. When you add automatic burns for unsold tokens, you have the perfect conditions for explosive growth now that Trump's pro-crypto administration has taken office. AI Rig Complex: The security fortress While other projects chase engagement metrics, AI Rig Complex (ARC) is building the infrastructure that could secure Web3's entire future. This is much more than just another AI token. The project boasts a comprehensive security platform that combines advanced AI with blockchain technology to create an impenetrable shield for decentralized assets. ARC is revolutionizing blockchain security using Rust's cutting-edge LLM framework and sophisticated smart contract management systems. Its innovative approach has attracted attention from serious players in the DeFi space, suggesting that we could be looking at the future standard for decentralized security. The platform has become a rallying point for security-conscious investors. By combining meme culture appeal with serious technological infrastructure, ARC is creating a new paradigm for how security platforms can engage and grow their communities. Ava AI: The storytelling revolution Backed by crypto legends like Arthur Hayes and culture makers like Mike Shinoda, Ava AI is rewriting the rules of digital interaction. Built on Solana with a neural network boasting over 175 billion parameters, this fully fledged storytelling engine transforms how we interact with artificial intelligence. Through its Agent Market and comprehensive creator tools, Ava AI is democratizing AI character creation in ways previously unimaginable, and with partnerships ranging from major brands to top-tier academic institutions, this project is positioning itself at the intersection of AI innovation and mass adoption. The platform's sophisticated technology stack includes specialized AI templates like the Memecoin Shiller and Market Wizard, with integrated DefiLlama and CoinGecko data. Its comprehensive feature suite spans brain development, persona customization, knowledge base implementation, and 3D avatar creation. The verdict: AI's next paradigm shift While ARC and Ava AI represent impressive technological innovations, iDEGEN emerges as the clear frontrunner for explosive gains in 2025. Its unique position as both an AI technology pioneer and a cultural phenomenon creates unprecedented potential for growth. As Trump's return promises to reshape the social media landscape and protect free speech online, iDEGEN's unfiltered approach to AI could capture massive market share in the new, uncensored digital economy. These three tokens represent different areas of the coming revolution for investors looking to capitalize on the convergence of AI innovation and political realignment.

39653980,https://nulltx.com/?p=141592,1738157422,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,DeepSeek AI Model from China Disrupts Global Tech – What Does It Mean for AI Tokens in Crypto?,https://nulltx.com/deepseek-ai-model-from-china-disrupts-global-tech-what-does-it-mean-for-ai-tokens-in-crypto/,"DeepSeek AI is shaking the global AI sector with its cost-effective model. Meanwhile, Ozak AI , a blockchain and artificial intelligence company, is gaining attention. Ozak AI offers predictive analytics and advanced infrastructure, positioning itself as a game-changer in the market. Its $OZ token presale has attracted strong investor interest, raising over $600K in a short time. DeepSeek AI Creates Industry-Wide Turbulence DeepSeek, developed by High-Flyer in China, cost only $6 million to build. This low-cost model challenges the dominance of expensive AI systems from tech giants like OpenAI and Meta. DeepSeek triggered major disruptions yesterday, which resulted in a 10% reduction of the total market cap, which reached $37.4 billion within 24 hours. Two significant AI tokens known as RENDER and VIRTUAL decreased more than 13% in value. The market value of FET decreased by 9% along with INJ’s market value, which dropped by 11%. The increasing prominence of DeepSeek caused both NVIDIA and Microsoft to suffer market value declines before official announcements. Ozak AI Presale Attracts Strong Investor Confidence Ozak AI demonstrates promising technology alongside its successful $OZ token presale operation within market disruption patterns. The company has successfully raised over $600,000 in funds during its $OZ token presale. Currently, the presale is in Phase 3 with each token at $0.003 per COIN. Market investors should seize this chance because experts forecast the token has the potential to get to $1 in 2025 with a listing price set at $0.05. Ozak AI dedicated 3 billion tokens out of its total 10 billion available supply for presale distribution. The constrained supply has caused the project’s demand to increase, which makes it more restricted for investors. According to analysts, the $OZ token rate will likely reach $0.05 following the presale stage , thus delivering substantial profits to initial investors. The innovation drives continuous growth for Ozak AI Ozak AI employs predictive agents within a decentralized infrastructure platform. This technology analyzes both current and past data to generate usable information that helps businesses across sectors of finance as well as healthcare and supply chain management. The Ozak Stream Network (OSN) and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) connect through a reliable platform to deliver safe and swift data processing. The broad utility applications of Ozak AI are enabled by its distinctive blockchain project features. Conclusion The market shows signs of uncertainty because DeepSeek entered the AI sector and disrupted this market. The innovative technology combined with solid presale results points toward a promising future for Ozak AI . The robust infrastructure alongside ambitious projections enables Ozak AI to establish leadership in the AI blockchain sector.

But this might indeed be a great time to find and park funds into the best crypto to buy now, especially as the recovery could be an excellent time to make great returns. We have compiled a list of trending projects—both established and newer to the space—to provide you with some of the best altcoin options for huge gains in the coming weeks or months. Best Crypto to Buy Now While there are a number of projects to consider for every type of investor, it can often be a good idea to include a variety of cryptos from various categories to mitigate risks while also being exposed to potentially high profits. This list has been compiled keeping a healthy allocation of degen meme coins, high-utility tokens, and niche categories—some of them already popular projects while others still in their presale phase. MIND of Pepe MIND of Pepe has attracted investors from the AI and meme coin sectors, combining autonomous trading intelligence with the speculative appeal of crypto. The project’s main innovation lies in its AI agent, which actively scans social media platforms to detect trends, execute trades, and even launch new tokens based on real-time data. This mechanism provides MIND holders with exclusive early access to AI-generated token launches and curated market insights, offering a unique advantage in navigating the volatile crypto space. Its staking system becomes another major offering, boasting an impressive APY for early buyers, making it attractive for those looking to earn passive rewards while holding MIND. The presale for its native token, MIND, has already drawn significant attention, securing coverage from major crypto publications, with some analysts predicting its potential to be a high-multiplier investment . Thanks to its exciting Pepe-themed concept, social media sentiment continues to grow bullish, fueled by discussions about its AI-driven trading capabilities and its role in the broader AI narrative that has captivated the market. With investors looking for the next major AI crypto, MIND of Pepe has positioned itself as one of the more intriguing options in the space. Aptos Aptos entered the market with considerable momentum, launching with one of the most widely discussed airdrops in recent history. The Layer-1 blockchain was built to tackle the industry’s scalability and efficiency challenges, leveraging its Move programming language to enhance security and transaction speeds. Unlike many networks that struggle with congestion, Aptos utilizes a parallel execution engine, allowing it to handle multiple transactions simultaneously without bottlenecks. This architecture makes it an attractive choice for decentralized finance (DeFi), NFT projects, and gaming applications seeking a seamless experience. Over time, Aptos has grown into a formidable competitor to leading projects, overtaking networks like Sui and Base in engagement and activity despite their higher market capitalizations. Currently trading in the $7.5 range, many analysts consider it undervalued, particularly given its expanding developer ecosystem. As market conditions improve, Aptos could see a surge in demand, benefiting from increased adoption and investor interest. With a solid technological foundation and a track record of growth, it remains a strong candidate for those looking to invest in blockchain infrastructure projects. Meme Index Meme Index is capitalizing on the rising demand for structured exposure to the meme coin sector. Instead of relying on individual speculation, the project provides a diversified approach, offering multiple index categories tailored to different risk appetites. The project features four major indexes as its main offerings, called the Titan Index, Moonshot Index, Midcap Index, and the Frenzy Index. The Meme Titan Index tracks established coins like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE, providing a relatively stable entry into the space. The Meme Moonshot Index focuses on newer projects with strong momentum, appealing to those looking for higher-risk, high-reward opportunities. The Meme Midcap Index includes tokens that have seen substantial growth but still have room for further expansion, while the Meme Frenzy Index is designed for high-volatility, degen-level meme coins with explosive potential. https://twitter.com/memecoin_index/status/1883854850355806552 The presale has already raised over $3 million, which means the project has already recorded strong investor confidence. Beyond its indexed investment model, Meme Index also offers a staking program with an excellent APY rate, making it an appealing choice for those looking to maximize returns while gaining exposure to the meme coin sector. As memecoins continue to trend, this project provides a structured way to engage with the market while mitigating some of the risks associated with individual token speculation. Solana Solana has established itself as a dominant force in the cryptocurrency space, with a market valuation surpassing $110 billion. Known for its ability to handle high transaction volumes at minimal costs, it has become the go-to blockchain for various applications, including decentralized finance, gaming, and NFTs. Its efficiency has led to the launch of several trending projects within its ecosystem, reinforcing its position as a key player in the industry. While it may not carry the speculative appeal of lower-cap tokens, Solana remains a solid option for those looking to add a strong, established asset to their portfolio. Recent discussions about Solana being considered for the US strategic reserve alongside XRP have added another layer of interest to its long-term potential. Its current price range of approximately $250 still leaves room for growth, with many analysts anticipating a push beyond $300 as demand continues to increase. Given its track record and the projects it continues to support, Solana remains a cryptocurrency that investors are keeping an eye on, particularly as market conditions improve. Solaxy Solaxy is positioning itself as an essential addition to the Solana network, serving as the first Layer-2 scaling solution built specifically to address congestion and optimize performance. By processing transactions off-chain before finalizing them on Solana’s mainnet, it significantly improves speed and reduces transaction costs for developers and users alike. With Solana’s growing adoption, a project like Solaxy could prove to be a game-changer, ensuring that the ecosystem remains efficient even as demand surges. The project has already gained significant traction, raising over $15 million in its presale. Investors see its potential as a necessary component for the long-term scalability of Solana. With Solaxy offering a staking mechanism with an impressive APY too, it makes for an attractive opportunity for those looking to earn passive income while supporting the ecosystem’s expansion. With its unique positioning and increasing relevance within the Solana network, Solaxy could become one of the more impactful projects to emerge in the current cycle. Ondo Finance Ondo has quickly gained recognition as one of the most promising projects within the cryptocurrency market, despite being a relatively new name among large-cap tokens. Focused on bridging traditional finance with decentralized systems, it provides tokenized exposure to real-world assets, particularly US Treasury securities. This initiative brings institutional-grade investment opportunities to the blockchain, making Ondo a significant player in the rapidly growing real-world asset (RWA) sector. A recent development that has fueled even more interest in the project is its partnership with Ripple Labs , which will see tokenized US Treasuries introduced to the XRP Ledger. This strategic move has strengthened Ondo’s market presence and contributed to its recent price surge. Despite its growing recognition, its current market cap of approximately $4.5 billion suggests that it may still have substantial room for growth. Some analysts speculate that as the sector matures, Ondo could potentially reach a valuation of $50 billion, making it a project worth watching closely as the market rebounds. Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe has dominated discussions in the crypto space, becoming one of the most successful presales of the year. It has already raised over $60 million, a figure that underscores the market’s enthusiasm for its unique approach. Combining elements of meme culture with a finance-centric theme, the project has drawn traders looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Unlike standard meme coins, Wall Street Pepe introduces trading-related features that could make it more than just another speculative asset. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGyVXpxixM0 The project’s branding, featuring a sharp-dressed banker version of Pepe, has further contributed to its growing appeal. Community engagement remains strong, with YouTubers like ClayBro labeling it as one of the top presales to watch. The anticipation around its official launch continues to build, as many believe that its listing could drive significant price movements. Given the recent performance of meme coins and the project's widespread recognition, Wall Street Pepe is positioned as one of the more anticipated releases in the space, with the potential for rapid gains once trading begins. Catslap Catslap embraces the unpredictability of meme coins, creating an ecosystem centered around humor, community engagement, and high-risk speculation. While some projects attempt to integrate real-world use cases, Catslap fully leans into the appeal of meme culture, rallying investors around its playful yet aggressive branding. The token’s branding and marketing strategy have set it apart, generating organic buzz among those who thrive in the chaotic world of degen trading. Despite its lighthearted exterior, Catslap has gained traction as a potential high-reward investment, particularly for those looking to capitalize on meme coin momentum. Its addictive slap-to-earn mechanic has attracted attention across social media, with investors speculating on its potential to deliver massive gains. If recent meme coin trends are anything to go by, Catslap’s early success could translate into strong post-launch price action, making it one to watch in the current market. Best Wallet Token The Best Wallet ecosystem continues to expand, drawing in a growing number of users looking for a seamless Web3 experience. With an emphasis on security, multi-chain compatibility, and user-friendly design, the platform has established itself as a preferred option for managing digital assets. The launch of its native token, BEST , has further strengthened its position, attracting investors interested in both utility and long-term value appreciation. The presale has been a massive success, raising over $8.5 million, highlighting the confidence investors have in the project. The token’s pricing currently sits at $0.02355, with many anticipating further demand as the platform continues to develop. Best Wallet has also built a substantial following, both through its growing user base and its expanding social media presence. With its strong foundation and various utilities, BEST remains a project that many are keeping on their radar, particularly as more users look for reliable and efficient Web3 solutions. Conclusion The sheer number of projects in the space right now makes it difficult to find the best crypto to buy now. With the current volatile market situation, it is important to stay invested only in projects that actually have a scope for growth. All the projects mentioned above tick off major boxes to consider while selecting a crypto investment. As long as investors consider the risks and allocate funds that they could risk losing, investing in such projects could be a great idea, whether it’s more established names like Solana and Aptos or newer options like MIND of Pepe and Meme Index.",More News,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|SOL|TRADING|APT,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-01-29 13:31:15

As reported by Financial Times , this would be the first time a Western monetary institution would do this. Governor Michl said he would present a plan to the board to invest in Bitcoin to diversify the Czech National Bank’s reserves at a meeting on Thursday. Should the board approve this, he said the Czech National Bank could eventually hold as much as 5% of its €140B of reserves in Bitcoin. Michl noted that demand for BTC had surged in recent years after investment management firm BlackRock and other firms started offering Bitcoin exchange-traded funds last year. He also referenced US President Donald Trump’s commitments to deregulation and the increasing influence of cryptocurrency executives on his administration. Last week, Trump issued an executive order establishing a working group to assess the potential creation of a national digital asset reserve. Michl pushes for Bitcoin diversification, defying traditional central bank views Michl said Bitcoin looks like a good asset for diversifying the Czech ‘s assets. He said that while people like Trump could possibly cause a speculative bubble in BTC, the trend would remain on the rise even without their support because more people are now regarding it as an alternative investment. In December, Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell said the US central bank has no Bitcoin. Historically, central banks have kept their reserves in conservative assets like US Treasuries and other highly rated bonds. A few hold equities, but very few have publicly explored investments in cryptocurrency. Michl claims to have “a completely different philosophy” regarding Bitcoin than his peers. He describes himself as venturing where nobody else has ventured, especially when it comes to other bankers. As a person who has run an investment fund, Michl sees himself as a typical investment banker, with a typical investment banker’s preference for profitability. Central banks debate crypto investments, with some cautioning against risks Among central bankers cautioning against the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies is Joachim Nagel, governor of the Bundesbank. This month, he compared Bitcoin to “digital tulips,” alluding to the 17th-century speculative bubble and subsequent collapse in tulip bulb prices. European Central Bank officials stated last year that “the fair value of Bitcoin is still zero” and argued that it is “not suitable as a means of payment or as an investment.” Former ECB official Benoît Cœuré has also called Bitcoin the “evil spawn of the financial crisis.” El Salvador, however, has been a notable supporter of cryptocurrency, making Bitcoin legal tender in 2021. According to its National Bitcoin Office, the government currently holds 6,048 Bitcoins, valued at around $621 million. However, the Central American nation scaled back its crypto-related ambitions late last year as it sought to secure a funding agreement with the IMF. Additionally, some central banks are experimenting with digital currencies, partly in response to the growing influence of cryptocurrencies. Michl thinks more central banks may adopt his approach in the next five years, as several funds and commercial banks have changed their views to include crypto in their investment portfolios. The Czech National Bank plans to shift its equity portfolio toward US stocks According to the Czech National Bank, if the Czech central bank had held 5% of its foreign reserves in Bitcoin over the past decade, its annual returns would have increased by 3.5 percentage points. Still, the investment would have also seen twice the volatility. As Michl reported, any significant investment by a central bank in a Bitcoin ETF can move the coin’s price. He said 5% of their assets is a lot of money, even for the Bitcoin market. The central bank has €140 billion in foreign exchange reserves, which comprise about 45% of the Czech Republic’s GDP. The Czech National Bank already stands out among central banks for having 22% of its portfolio in equities, with the aim of having half of this in US stocks over the next three years, from 30% currently. Michl said they are buying gradually and in very small steps because stock prices are at record highs. While the Czech Republic remains one of seven EU countries outside the Eurozone, President Petr Pavel reignited the debate on adopting the euro in his New Year’s address, suggesting that paying salaries in the European currency, similar to Germany, could foster future prosperity. However, Michl refused the notion, saying that there was not enough price convergence and public support to recommend giving up the Czech koruna any time soon. Michl pointed out that the president is a military man and he is an economist by training, given that Pavel was a NATO commander. He also argued that while adopting the euro is advantageous in the case of political instability, independence and the ability to control monetary policy are useful in the fight against inflation. Michl also indicated that it was “very likely” his bank would reduce interest rates by 25 basis points next week, bringing them down from 4%, continuing the rate-cutting cycle that started in December 2023.

Deposits will be disabled, while withdrawals for the affected tokens will be available until the end of the first quarter of 2025. The complete delisting is scheduled for March 31, after which any remaining holdings will be automatically converted to a MiCA-compliant stablecoin or another asset of corresponding market value. The delisting will impact a total of ten cryptocurrencies, including Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Dai (DAI), Pax Dollar (PAX), Pax Gold (PAXG), PayPal USD (PYUSD), Crypto.com Staked ETH (CDCETH), Crypto.com Staked SOL (CDCSOL), Liquid CRO (LCRO), and XSGD. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) urged European crypto asset service providers to restrict non-MiCA-compliant stablecoins by Jan. 31. The delisting of USDT in the European Union has been a serious topic since Coinbase first announced its decision to remove the stablecoin in October of 2024. Coinbase Europe later completed its delisting, and provided its users the option to convert their USDT holdings into MiCA-compliant alternatives like Circle’s USD Coin (USDC). Despite MiCA regulations coming into full effect on Dec. 30, multiple crypto asset service providers in the EU continued trading USDT. However, more exchanges are now taking steps to comply with regulations. (Source: ESMA ) Some crypto firms in Europe have successfully obtained MiCA licenses, while others, including Crypto.com, are in the process of securing one in Malta. According to Juan Ignacio Ibañez, a member of the Technical Committee of the MiCA Crypto Alliance, ESMA’s directive makes it very clear that by March 31, “no trace of USDT should remain, not even in ‘sell-only’ mode.” Meanwhile, its closest competitor, USDC, already received MiCA approval in July 2024 and currently holds a market cap of $52 billion. Warren Raises Concerns Over Lutnick’s Tether Connections Tether is also in trouble with Senator Elizabeth Warren. She recently raised concerns over Howard Lutnick, President Donald Trump’s nominee for Commerce Secretary, because of his firm’s connections with stablecoin issuer Tether. In a letter dated Jan. 27, Warren shared that she is very alarmed over Lutnick’s involvement with Tether, and called it a “known facilitator of criminal activity” due to Cantor Fitzgerald’s role as both a stakeholder and asset manager for the company. While Lutnick agreed to divest his interest in Cantor Fitzgerald, Warren questioned whether his longstanding ties to the firm and its affiliates could compromise his ability to act in the best interest of the American people if confirmed. Warren believes that Lutnick’s position as Commerce Secretary will give him a lot of influence over policies that affect Tether and the broader cryptocurrency industry. She also specifically requested answers to thirteen questions about his financial stake in Tether, any discussions he may have had with Trump administration officials about the company, and whether Cantor Fitzgerald conducted due diligence to ensure Tether’s compliance with financial regulations like Know Your Customer rules, the Bank Secrecy Act, and anti-money laundering laws. She has set a deadline of Feb. 10 for Lutnick’s response. Warren has long been critical of the crypto sector, and argued that Tether is used for illicit activities, including money laundering, sanctions evasion, and even financing North Korea’s nuclear program. Despite these allegations, Tether actively cooperated with authorities in cracking down on criminal activity. On Jan. 27, the company worked with blockchain firms Tron and TRM Labs to help Spanish law enforcement freeze $26.4 million linked to a money laundering network. In September, Tether also collaborated with the FBI to recover $6 million that was stolen by crypto scammers targeting US citizens. Warren is very notorious for advocating for stricter regulation of the industry. She urged Trump’s Treasury nominee to consider imposing tougher laws and repeatedly introduced the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act to bring the crypto sector under existing financial crime frameworks. The legislation was introduced in both 2022 and 2023, but it faced strong opposition from crypto advocacy groups and national security officials. EU Sees Digital Euro as Defense Against US Stablecoins Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s executive order on digital financial technology intensified concerns in the European Union over the dominance of the US dollar in the stablecoin market. European Central Bank executive board member Piero Cipollone addressed these concerns at the 13th ILF Conference on the Future of the Financial Sector in Frankfurt. According to Cipollone, the overwhelming reliance on US dollar-backed stablecoins is a key reason for the EU’s continued efforts to develop its own central bank digital currency (CBDC). During the panel, Cipollone pointed to Europe’s growing dependence on international card schemes, which process over 60% of card payments in the EU. He also mentioned the sharp increase in mobile app payments in the region, which rose from just 1% of transactions in 2019 to 9% in 2024. His biggest concern, however, was the dominance of US dollar stablecoins, which account for 97% of the global stablecoin market that is currently valued at $222 billion. He held firm that a digital euro is essential to ensure continued access to central bank money and to maintain European banks’ role in the financial system. Stablecoin market (Source: CoinGecko ) The EU’s concerns were increased by the Trump administration’s clear stance on promoting the US dollar’s sovereignty. In an executive order on strengthening American leadership in digital finance, the administration pledged to support the development and growth of lawful and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide. While the order openly encourages US dollar stablecoins, the order explicitly bans the establishment, issuance, and use of central bank digital currencies in the United States. This could create some problems for global CBDC initiatives. For the most part, Trump’s executive order is seen as a pro-crypto move, but some analysts argue that its ultimate goal is to reinforce the dominance of the US dollar on a global scale. Attorney David Lesperance suggested that while the order wants to position the US at the forefront of digital financial assets, it also signals that any technology threatening the US dollar’s reserve currency status will face strong opposition. He believes that Trump could use economic leverage, like tariffs, to pressure the EU and other economies into stopping their own CBDC development. Tensions could soon start to rise as the EU pushes forward with the digital euro and the US strengthens its dollar-backed stablecoins.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,USDT|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|PYUSD,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-29 13:39:02

However, this could be an opportune moment to identify and invest in the top cryptocurrencies, as this recovery phase might offer significant profit potential. We've curated a list of trending projects, both well-known and new to the scene, to highlight some of the best altcoin opportunities poised for substantial gains in the coming weeks or months. Top Cryptocurrencies to Consider Now For investors of all types, exploring a diverse range of cryptocurrencies from different categories can be a wise strategy to balance risk while still having the chance for high returns. This selection includes a strategic mix of meme coins, utility tokens, and niche categories—some already well-established, others still in presale stages. MIND of Pepe MIND of Pepe is capturing attention from both AI enthusiasts and meme coin investors, merging autonomous trading technology with the speculative nature of cryptocurrency. Its key innovation is an AI agent that scans social media for trends, executes trades, and launches new tokens using real-time data. This setup gives MIND holders exclusive early access to AI-generated token launches and curated market insights, offering a distinct edge in the unpredictable crypto market. Additionally, its staking system offers an impressive APY for early adopters, making it an attractive option for earning passive income while holding MIND. The presale of its native token, MIND, has gained considerable attention, being featured in leading crypto publications, with some experts forecasting it as a high-multiplier investment . Its Pepe-themed concept is driving positive social media sentiment, sparked by discussions about its AI trading capabilities and its place in the larger AI narrative captivating the market. As investors search for the next big AI crypto, MIND of Pepe stands out as a compelling choice. Aptos Aptos made its debut with significant momentum, launching one of the most talked-about airdrops in recent times. Designed as a Layer-1 blockchain, Aptos addresses scalability and efficiency issues within the industry, using its Move programming language to boost security and transaction speed. Unlike other networks that face congestion, Aptos employs a parallel execution engine, enabling multiple transactions to be processed simultaneously without slowing down. This makes it appealing for DeFi, NFTs, and gaming projects seeking a smooth user experience. Aptos has steadily grown into a strong competitor against leading projects, surpassing networks like Sui and Base in engagement and activity despite their higher market caps. Currently valued around $7.5, many analysts believe it's undervalued, especially considering its growing developer network. As the market strengthens, Aptos could see increased demand, benefiting from rising adoption and investor interest. With a robust technological base and a history of growth, it remains a solid option for those interested in blockchain infrastructure investments. Meme Index Meme Index is tapping into the growing desire for structured exposure to the meme coin market. Rather than relying on single-coin speculation, it offers a diversified approach with various index categories suited to different risk levels. The project showcases four main indices: the Titan Index, Moonshot Index, Midcap Index, and Frenzy Index. The Meme Titan Index tracks established tokens like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE, offering a relatively stable entry into the meme space. The Meme Moonshot Index targets newer projects with strong momentum, ideal for those seeking high-risk, high-reward scenarios. The Meme Midcap Index includes tokens that have seen substantial growth but still have room for further expansion, while the Meme Frenzy Index is designed for high-volatility, degen-level meme coins with explosive potential. https://twitter.com/memecoin_index/status/1883854850355806552 Having raised over $3 million in presales, this project has garnered strong investor confidence. Beyond its indexed investment approach, Meme Index offers a staking program with a competitive APY, making it attractive for those looking to maximize returns while engaging with the meme coin sector. As memecoins remain popular, this project provides a structured route to participate in the market while reducing some of the risks linked to individual token speculation. Solana Solana has firmly established itself as a major player in the crypto world, with a market cap exceeding $110 billion. Renowned for its ability to process high transaction volumes at low costs, it has become the preferred blockchain for diverse applications, such as DeFi, gaming, and NFTs. Its efficiency has led to the launch of several trending projects within its ecosystem, reinforcing its position as a key player in the industry. While it may not carry the speculative appeal of lower-cap tokens, Solana remains a solid option for those looking to add a strong, established asset to their portfolio. The ongoing discussions about Solana potentially being considered for the US strategic reserve along with XRP have sparked interest in its long-term potential. Trading around $250, there is still potential for growth, with analysts expecting it to surpass $300 as demand rises. Considering its history and the projects it supports, Solana continues to be a cryptocurrency that investors watch closely, especially as market conditions improve. Solaxy Solaxy is positioning itself as an essential addition to the Solana network, serving as the first Layer-2 scaling solution built specifically to address congestion and optimize performance. By processing transactions off-chain before finalizing them on Solana’s mainnet, it significantly improves speed and reduces transaction costs for developers and users alike. With Solana’s growing adoption, a project like Solaxy could prove to be a game-changer, ensuring that the ecosystem remains efficient even as demand surges. The project has already gained significant traction, raising over $15 million in its presale. Investors see its potential as a necessary component for the long-term scalability of Solana. With Solaxy offering a staking mechanism with an impressive APY too, it makes for an attractive opportunity for those looking to earn passive income while supporting the ecosystem’s expansion. With its unique positioning and increasing relevance within the Solana network, Solaxy could become one of the more impactful projects to emerge in the current cycle. Ondo Finance Ondo has quickly gained recognition as one of the most promising projects within the cryptocurrency market, despite being a relatively new name among large-cap tokens. Focused on bridging traditional finance with decentralized systems, it provides tokenized exposure to real-world assets, particularly US Treasury securities. This initiative brings institutional-grade investment opportunities to the blockchain, making Ondo a significant player in the rapidly growing real-world asset (RWA) sector. A recent development that has fueled even more interest in the project is its partnership with Ripple Labs , which will see tokenized US Treasuries introduced to the XRP Ledger. This strategic move has strengthened Ondo’s market presence and contributed to its recent price surge. Despite its growing recognition, its current market cap of approximately $4.5 billion suggests that it may still have substantial room for growth. Some analysts speculate that as the sector matures, Ondo could potentially reach a valuation of $50 billion, making it a project worth watching closely as the market rebounds. Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe has dominated discussions in the crypto space, becoming one of the most successful presales of the year. It has already raised over $60 million, a figure that underscores the market’s enthusiasm for its unique approach. Combining elements of meme culture with a finance-centric theme, the project has drawn traders looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Unlike standard meme coins, Wall Street Pepe introduces trading-related features that could make it more than just another speculative asset. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGyVXpxixM0 The project’s branding, featuring a sharp-dressed banker version of Pepe, has further contributed to its growing appeal. Community engagement remains strong, with YouTubers like ClayBro labeling it as one of the top presales to watch. The anticipation around its official launch continues to build, as many believe that its listing could drive significant price movements. Given the recent performance of meme coins and the project's widespread recognition, Wall Street Pepe is positioned as one of the more anticipated releases in the space, with the potential for rapid gains once trading begins. Catslap Catslap embraces the unpredictability of meme coins, creating an ecosystem centered around humor, community engagement, and high-risk speculation. While some projects attempt to integrate real-world use cases, Catslap fully leans into the appeal of meme culture, rallying investors around its playful yet aggressive branding. The token’s branding and marketing strategy have set it apart, generating organic buzz among those who thrive in the chaotic world of degen trading. Despite its lighthearted exterior, Catslap has gained traction as a potential high-reward investment, particularly for those looking to capitalize on meme coin momentum. Its addictive slap-to-earn mechanic has attracted attention across social media, with investors speculating on its potential to deliver massive gains. If recent meme coin trends are anything to go by, Catslap’s early success could translate into strong post-launch price action, making it one to watch in the current market. Best Wallet Token The Best Wallet ecosystem continues to expand, drawing in a growing number of users looking for a seamless Web3 experience. With an emphasis on security, multi-chain compatibility, and user-friendly design, the platform has established itself as a preferred option for managing digital assets. The launch of its native token, BEST , has further strengthened its position, attracting investors interested in both utility and long-term value appreciation. The presale has been a massive success, raising over $8.5 million, highlighting the confidence investors have in the project. The token’s pricing currently sits at $0.02355, with many anticipating further demand as the platform continues to develop. Best Wallet has also built a substantial following, both through its growing user base and its expanding social media presence. With its strong foundation and various utilities, BEST remains a project that many are keeping on their radar, particularly as more users look for reliable and efficient Web3 solutions. Conclusion The sheer number of projects in the space right now makes it difficult to find the best crypto to buy now. With the current volatile market situation, it is important to stay invested only in projects that actually have a scope for growth. All the projects mentioned above tick off major boxes to consider while selecting a crypto investment. As long as investors consider the risks and allocate funds that they could risk losing, investing in such projects could be a great idea, whether it’s more established names like Solana and Aptos or newer options like MIND of Pepe and Meme Index.",More News,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|SOL|TRADING|APT,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-01-29 13:45:54

Existing investor Alven led the round and featured participation from new backers 1kx and Ledger Cathay Capital, Cryptio told CoinDesk via email on Wednesday. The $15 million raised takes the total for the Series A round to $25 million. Cryptio's aim is to provide traditional financial (TradFi) entities with back-office operations and infrastructure that allow them to offer digital asset products such as stablecoins, crypto-backed loans and crypto savings. Many observers are expecting the number of banks offering crypto services to increase following the repeal of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC)'s controversial SAB 121 accounting rule. SAB121 decreed that a company keeping a customer's crypto should record them on its own balance sheet, potentially having major implications for banks' capital allocations when working with crypto clients. This drew ire from crypto industry participants as it did not account for the lack of guidance from the SEC on how securities laws apply to digital assets.

39654904,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=685743,1738159223,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"XRP Is The Best Looking Altcoin Chart Right Now, Says Crypto Analyst",https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-best-looking-altcoin-chart-right-now/,"Renowned trader and market commentator Jacob Canfield (@JacobCanfield) has identified XRP as the standout performer among altcoins, sharing a price chart on X that underscores the token’s recent momentum. While most altcoins have suffered double-digit losses in recent days, the XRP price has held up exceptionally well. XRP Builds Strong Momentum The daily chart for the XRP/USD perpetual contract on ByBit reveals a steady climb from sub-$0.50 levels in early November to a current consolidation area around $3.10. The overall picture shows a series of higher highs and higher lows, affirming XRP’s ongoing bullish structure. The initial rally began below $0.50, gathering momentum through November and early December. By late December, XRP had reached the $2.00 region, briefly consolidating before continuing its move upward. Around mid-January, the token surpassed $3.00, topping out near $3.20 before experiencing a pullback. Related Reading: XRP Rebound Gains Traction As Bulls Aim To Sustain The Momentum Canfield’s chart highlights several key support and resistance levels, including a pink demand zone around $1.90–$2.00 that has repeatedly acted as a strong base whenever price has dipped. A sharp wick into this zone, followed by a swift recovery, suggests that bulls are consistently defending the $2.00 threshold. Higher on the chart is a black horizontal line near $2.90, which marked the local top in early December 2024 and is now serving as support. XRP’s historical support levels—marked at $0.5478, $0.3125, and $0.1778—sit far below current market prices but provide context for significant regions observed in past trading cycles. Recent candlestick patterns reflect notable volatility around $3.00. A sudden drop briefly took the market under $2.65, but the price rebounded almost as quickly. This type of sharp dip and recovery often implies sufficient liquidity and a willingness among traders to absorb sell orders. The cluster of candlesticks near $3.05–$3.10 indicates a balance between buying and selling pressure at a pivotal resistance zone; a decisive move up or down may set the tone for near-term momentum. Related Reading: Bollinger Bands Tighten On XRP Daily Chart – Major Price Move Ahead? In his brief yet emphatic comment—“XRP – Unironically looks like the best altcoin chart in crypto right now”—Canfield expresses a bullish view based on the chart’s clear structure and resilient demand. He points to the strength of the uptrend, well-defined support and resistance levels, and what appears to be robust interest in defending key zones. Although he has not offered explicit price targets, the chart reveals the importance of holding above $3.00 which aligns with the pivotal 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level (drawn from the mid-January peak) and potentially breaking past $3.24 (0.786 Fibonacci retracement level). In a worst case scenario, a deeper correction could revisit the $2.00 demand zone, where XRP has found considerable support in recent months. Whether XRP can sustain its position and build upon its market traction remains to be seen, but its technical framework has attracted the attention of many traders looking for altcoins with strong trend dynamics.

Anticipated to increase by an incredible 50x in 2025, this innovative enterprise is attracting the interest of smart investors ready to make large returns. This altcoin is among the most sought-after investment prospects of the year since its disruptive attitude to payments and finance helps to reshape the sector. Don’t miss this might be the game-changer everyone has been waiting for. Remittix’s Unique PayFi Model Compared to other known tokens like SHIB and ADA, how does Remittix (RTX) perform? Remittix goes a different route, while ADA concentrates on promoting decentralized finance (DeFi) with its strong layer-1 blockchain, and SHIB thrives on community-driven growth and increasing ecosystem. It provides a flawless global money transfer solution by creating a PayFi infrastructure bridging crypto with conventional banks. Remittix automates crypto-to-fiat transfers in under 24 hours—without hidden fees or middlemen— unlike SHIB or ADA, which address specific use cases or technical improvements. Originally popular among travelers and freelancers, Remittix increasingly attracts stores and regular consumers looking for reasonably priced substitutes for wire transfers. Though Remittix (RTX) shines out by addressing a universal issue: inexpensive and efficient cross-border remittances, SHIB’s ecosystem development and ADA’s emphasis on scalability make them formidable challengers in their respective domains. Remittix’s practical value will help it carve out a position among well-known companies like SHIB and ADA and access the multi-trillion-dollar worldwide payments market. Eyeing a 100x Surge: Why Analysts Believe It From $0.0199 to $0.0456, RTX’s presale success has been nothing less than remarkable, generating over $9 million, including an amazing $500k in a single day. This momentum highlights the rising market for cryptocurrencies with actual value. Offering crypto-to-fiat conversions with zero hidden fees in only 24 hours, Remittix targets non-technical customers seeking a frictionless, affordable solution for worldwide money transfers, unlike SHIB’s meme-driven appeal or ADA’s developer-centric ecosystem. Should Remittix account for even a small portion of the $190 trillion cross-border transaction market, its acceptance might compete with SHIB’s significant community and institutional interest. Experts believe RTX is ready for explosive expansion, leaving investors speculating about a possible 100x surge—outpacing the usual gains witnessed with SHIB and ADA—because of its propensity to draw a worldwide base of freelancers, merchants, and daily users. Can Remittix (RTX) Eclipse Solana’s Growth in 2025? A significant force in the DeFi and NFT markets is now being overthrown by a newbie with its dedicated community and modern technologies. Its fast block times and great throughput fit developers and power users. For regular users, however, more pragmatic issues—such as reducing costs and streamlining cryptocurrency conversion to fiat — take the front stage. Here, Remittix (RTX) finds its place, concentrating on the minimally frictionful transformation of actual payments. Remittix targets the multi-trillion dollar remittance business, providing a simplified PayFi model that connects crypto with conventional banking systems, unlike Solana’s concentration on DeFi yields and NFTs. Although building such a cross-border payment system is no easy chore, experts believe RTX is well suited to satisfy the rising need for simpler, less expensive worldwide transactions. Remittix appeals to a far larger audience, from freelancers to businesses, by removing hidden costs and simplifying transaction complexity, hence potentially eclipsing even significant blockchains. The SHIB and ADA problem, then, is diversifying outside of NFTs and speculative tokens. Without more general appeal, it runs the danger of losing traction to the widespread adoption of altcoins like Remittix. The real-world emphasis of Remittix might propel unmatched expansion in 2025 . The project distinguishes itself in a market sometimes dominated by hype and developer-heavy ecosystems with its utility-driven model and easy approach. RTX could outperform the speculative gains of popular layer-1 chains if adoption speeds up and the demand for crypto-to-fiat solutions rises, hence maybe delivering the much-discussed 100x increase. Remittix might very well be the best option for individuals looking for usefulness above hype in 2025.

While it is wondered whether the XRP price, which is trying to hold above $ 3, will break new records, China-based artificial intelligence model DeepSeek predicted the price of XRP. What Will Be the XRP Price in 2025? DeepSeek AI noted that it took into account Ripple’s legal status, its battle with the SEC, adoption rates of its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform, and overall market trends when predicting the future price of XRP. According to DeepSeek AI, XRP could trade in the $3.50 to $5.00 range by the end of 2025. A positive outcome in Ripple’s legal process with the SEC could boost investor confidence and accelerate institutional adoption. DeepSeek AI puts the probability of Ripple seeing a positive outcome at 70 percent. 2025 Prediction for Bitcoin! China's new artificial intelligence model DeepSeek AI also shared its Bitcoin (BTC) prediction for 2025, apart from XRP. Accordingly, DeepSeek AI, which has attracted attention in recent days, has identified three different scenarios for Bitcoin for 2025: “Base Case: Bitcoin is expected to trade between $100K and $150K. Optimistic Scenario: The price is estimated to reach $350,000. Black Swan Scenario: It is stated that Bitcoin could reach the $500,000 level, but this scenario is less likely than the others. The rise of DeepSeek, which has taken the markets by storm in recent days, has shaken the balances in global markets. According to the data, DeepSeek has surpassed ChatGPT as the most downloaded application in the US, while US technology stocks have suffered a major decline in the face of this development. *This is not investment advice.

Peken Global Limited, the Seychelles-based company that operates KuCoin, has pled guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, according to a new press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. U.S. Attorney Danielle R. Sassoon says the exchange failed to maintain an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program and failed to report suspicious transactions. “As a result, KuCoin was used to facilitate billions of dollars’ worth of suspicious transactions and to transmit potentially criminal proceeds, including proceeds from darknet markets and malware, ransomware, and fraud schemes. Today’s guilty plea and penalties show the cost of refusing to follow these laws and allowing unlawful activity to continue.” KuCoin has agreed to criminally forfeit $184.5 million and pay a fine of $112.9 million, and the firm will exit the US market for at least two years. Two of the exchange’s founders, Chun Gan and Ke Tang, each agreed to forfeit approximately $2.7 million in funds. Neither founder will have any role in KuCoin’s management or operations going forward.

Meme coins, which have been a major catalyst for Solana’s recent growth, are now seeing massive losses, raising concerns about the blockchain’s short-term outlook. With meme coin projects struggling, Solana’s ecosystem is taking a hit, as these tokens have contributed significantly to its transaction volume and network activity. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Accumulate 450 Million DOGE During Recent Price Dip – Time For A Breakout? Top analyst IncomeSharks shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Solana still has room to go lower, attributing the decline to a major flush in the meme coin sector. The hype that fueled Solana’s price rally in previous weeks is fading, and liquidity is drying up as traders take profits or cut losses. If Solana fails to hold key support levels, another leg down could follow. While long-term sentiment remains bullish for Solana, the short-term price action suggests that volatility will persist. Investors are closely watching whether Solana can stabilize or if further downside is imminent. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether this correction is just a dip or the start of a deeper pullback. Solana Facing Selling Pressure Solana is trading at a key level after enduring days of selling pressure and heightened volatility. As one of the most popular blockchains for meme coin creation and trading, Solana has benefited from surging speculative interest in these assets. When meme coins perform well, Solana tends to see increased demand, boosting its price. However, the current market conditions are unfavorable for meme coins, leading to a significant downturn in Solana’s price performance compared to other altcoins. Top analyst IncomeSharks shared a technical analysis on X, stating that Solana’s price still wants to go lower as meme coins face a major flush. The broader crypto market has entered a period of uncertainty, and meme coin hype is fading as liquidity dries up. This has created additional selling pressure on Solana, as traders exit high-risk positions. Solana has dropped over 15% in the past week, failing to hold critical support levels as bearish sentiment takes over. The price recently dipped below $230, erasing weeks of gains. IncomeSharks sets a bearish target around the $200 mark, a level not seen since January 16. If Solana fails to hold above $220, the selloff could accelerate, driving the price toward the next major support zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finally Turns $100K Into Support – Ready To Rally Higher? However, not all analysts are bearish. Some traders believe Solana’s dip is a temporary retrace rather than the start of a prolonged downtrend. If buyers step in around the $220-$225 range, Solana could stabilize and attempt a recovery. A push back above $250 would indicate renewed strength, with bulls aiming for a return to previous highs. Price Action Details: Showing Strength Solana (SOL) is trading at $231 after enduring days of selling pressure and increased volatility. The price reached an all-time high of approximately $295 on January 19, but since then, SOL has faced a sharp 25% decline in less than ten days. This significant drop has raised concerns among traders and investors, as Solana struggles to find strong support amid broader market uncertainty. For bulls to regain control and reverse the short-term bearish trend, SOL must hold above the current levels and push past the $244 mark. Breaking above this resistance would indicate renewed buying pressure and confirm a potential trend reversal. If SOL manages to reclaim this level, a surge toward $260 could follow, signaling a recovery phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised To Test $2,800 Support Level If Market Downtrend Persists – Analyst However, failure to maintain support above $230 could lead to further downside. A break below this critical level would expose SOL to deeper losses, with the next major support zone around the $200 mark. A decline to this level would mark an even steeper correction, potentially erasing more of its recent gains.

While Tron and Sui face market struggles, February could bring a shift in momentum for emerging tokens like 1Fuel. 1Fuel’s innovative features and rising demand have already delivered over 200% returns in the presale phase, with analysts projecting another 500% surge after its official launch. Tron’s ecosystem upgrades boost future price outlook Tron is currently trading at $0.2471, having increased 5% in the past 24 hours. The altcoin’s growing adoption is cementing its position as one of the top 20 cryptos in 2025. Recent updates highlight notable progress in its ecosystem, with founder Justin Sun revealing plans to eliminate gas fees. If successful, this move could significantly boost Tron's influence within the stablecoin market. Efforts to enhance the network's security have reportedly curbed illicit activities by $6 billion. TRM Labs data shows that 49% of Tron's unlawful transactions are tied to sanctioned entities, while 32% involve blocklisted funds. Despite these strides, Tron still accounts for 58% of illegal blockchain transactions, with Tether’s USDT often used in these activities. Coincodex predicts Tron will hit $0.256981 by February 2, 2025, reflecting a 3.83% increase. As one of the top 20 altcoins in 2025, Tron’s evolving ecosystem continues to attract attention amid challenges and opportunities. Will Sui’s demand zone spark a rebound or deeper decline? Sui’s price action has taken a bearish turn after losing momentum near the $5 level, leading to a sharp drop below the $4 support. Despite an 8% loss over the past week, Sui has gained 8% on the daily charts, settling around the $3.94 demand zone.While the dip raises concerns, this zone has historically acted as a springboard for buyers, similar to patterns in leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The $3.5 mark remains a crucial support level for the Sui network. A drop below this point could ignite further selling pressure and profit-taking, weakening the bullish sentiment. Sui’s long-term prospects appear promising. Projections estimate a climb to $24.19 by 2029, translating to a 514.05% gain from its current price. 1Fuel’s one-click transactions take usability to a new level 1Fuel is making waves in the crypto space with its standout cross-chain compatibility, enabling seamless transactions across multiple blockchains directly from the wallet. This feature addresses interoperability challenges, making it a game-changer for users managing diverse digital assets. Combined with cold storage options and a built-in privacy mixer, 1Fuel offers unmatched security and anonymity, making it a smart choice for privacy-conscious investors. 1Fuel’s one-click feature is designed to make managing digital assets effortless. This feature enables users to transact several blockchains without switching wallets or platforms. This simplified functionality removes the complexities of cross-chain transactions, making 1Fuel a perfect option for investors who value simplicity and efficiency. Furthermore, 1Fuel is set to introduce crypto cards, adding another layer of convenience for its users. These cards allow holders to spend digital assets in real-life transactions, merging crypto with conventional finance. Support for several cryptocurrencies means users can purchase things, pay bills, and access ATMs with complete blockchain protection and transparency. This crypto card feature ranks 1Fuel among the best DeFi presale tokens in the market. Currently in its third presale stage, 1Fuel is attracting significant investor interest. With 160 million tokens sold at just $0.017 each, the project has already raised over $1.5 million. Early adopters stand to gain from exclusive presale benefits, with analysts projecting up to 500% returns before 1Fuel launches on major exchanges. In the long term, 1Fuel is forecasted to deliver 100x gains, cementing its reputation as one of the best DeFi presale tokens for 2025.

By 2028, BC/USD could achieve a price of $0.0330. By 2031, BCGame coin might touch $0.0543 with an average trading price of $0.0524. $BC is the native coin of the BC.GAME ecosystem, which plays the role of utility and governance token, offering various practical applications and incentives to users. BC.Game is a major crypto casino offering a flexible and trusted service. Among its major offerings are online casino, online lotto, and sportsbook.

However, investors are wondering if BCGame coin can break it’s all-time high of $0.008572 and pump beyond $0.1 in the long term. To answer this question, let’s get into the BCGame ($BC) price prediction and forecast.

This token gained 3% in the last 24-hours, showing decent volatility. The current local resistance level is at $0.007864, whereas the support is set at $0.006761. On January 29th, 2025, BCGame price analysis revealed a rising trend. The token’s value rose to $0.008572, and formed a sharp wick before going lower. It then recovered slightly before experiencing another dip to $0.005784 on 20th January, before moving towards the upside again. Since then, it has been consolidating sideways with a strong floor at $0.006761, which is a positive signal. BC coin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of BCGame confirmed a sideways consolidating trend, as the candle sticks continue to oscillate between a range of $0.007864 and $0.006761. This means that BC/USD must break above $0.007864 and hold that level, in order to be able to retest $0.008572 later, which happens to be it’s all-time-high. BCGame 1-day price chart, Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is currently within a neutral area. While it may be considered high at 55, the RSI also continues to consolidate in line with the price movement. Currently, however, it may be signaling a small price dip. BC/USD 4-hour price analysis The four-hour price chart of BCGame confirms that a dip is imminent. After touching $0.00817, the price tumbled down for several intervals in a row, and found support at $0.00675. However, we can then see sharp wicks forming again after touching $0.00750. With the RSI in the slightly oversold zone, there is a high chance that we’re about to see a dip in the price. BCGame 4-hour price chart, Source: TradingView This begs the question, will BCGame coin hold the support line at $0.006761? Well, the chances of that happening are quite solid since BC has already tested this zone three times and rebounded. For now, it is gearing up to retest the support lines again. BCGame technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.00727 SELL SMA 5 $0.00722 SELL SMA 10 $0.00709 SELL SMA 21 $0.00718 SELL SMA 50 $0.00724 BUY SMA 100 $0.00739 BUY SMA 200 $0.00742 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.00726 BUY EMA 5 $0.00722 BUY EMA 10 $0.00726 BUY EMA 21 $0.00721 BUY EMA 50 $0.00716 BUY EMA 100 $0.00717 BUY EMA 200 $0.00723 BUY What can you expect from the BCGame price analysis next? BCGame price analysis gives a bullish prediction, considering the fact that crypto casinos are currently a hot narrative. The coin’s value rose to $0.008572 and hovered in a nice range since then despite facing a small correction. However, this temporary correction is expected to end with a breakout after the accumulation phase. After all, the BC coin has seen 60% green days over the last month. Is BCGame a good investment? Yes, BCGame is a good investment, as it has a strong potential for growth. Since this is a utility token, its growth is directly tied to the underlying crypto casino platform. However, its supply of 10 billion circulating tokens may raise certain questions. Hence, diversification into other tokens is advised. Like always, invest responsibly and maintain your risk tolerance. Why is BCGame coin up? BCGame coin has rebounded to its current price of $0.007256 after touching a local low at $0.00675. However, the volatility is quite high, as it has increased by 3% in 1 day. The price is currently moving in a sideways fashion. Will BCGame reach $0.50? Yes, in the long term, BCGame coin can reach $0.5. However, to achieve this target, the underlying crypto casino needs to target more players and continue to build in Web3 in 2025. Will BC/USD reach $1? Considering the current value of BCGame and its maximum supply, it is difficult to reach a price of $1 but certainly not impossible. If a large number of players adopt the BCGame casino, the BC token’s price would automatically rise. Will BC/USD reach $5? Due to its high amount of tokens, it is unlikely that the BCGame coin will ever reach $5. However, diamond hand investors may have the tolerance to take such risks. Does BC have a good long-term future? BC/USD is a utility token that powers a fair and trusted casino. This casino hosts various games including live casino games, classics, sportsbook, and a lot more. Considering its use case and the viral potential of this casino, BCGame coin is a solid investment for the future. Furthermore, the coin is expected to break the resistance level at $0.008572 . However, to achieve that, it must first test and break above the local resistance at $0.007864.

Musk Buys Solana (MUSKSOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Buys Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Buys Solana by entering its contract address (CA) – HZgXdFhQK1KTn8wM6hfRPtyGuKskETTzWM31qAdXJVRV – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|DOGE|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-29 15:35:00

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/japanese-company-metaplanet-announces-the-number-of-bitcoins-it-will-purchase-by-the-end-of-2026-here-are-the-details/,"Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed Metaplanet announced that it plans to accumulate 21,000 Bitcoin (BTC) by the end of 2026, making it one of the largest institutional Bitcoin purchases in Asia. Japan's Metaplanet Announces Ambitious Plan to Buy 21,000 Bitcoins by 2026 The initiative, dubbed the “21 Million Plan,” involves issuing 21 million shares via rolling strike warrants to raise about 116.65 billion yen ($740 million). The company aims to accumulate 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 21,000 BTC by 2026, positioning itself as one of the largest institutional Bitcoin holders in the world. Metaplanet currently has over $180 million in assets and has adopted a Bitcoin-first treasury approach. Unlike traditional companies that measure performance in fiat currencies, Bitcoin Strategy Director Dylan LeClair emphasized that Metaplanet evaluates its success by BTC Yield, which is the return measured in Bitcoin rather than fiat currency. “Bitcoin is not just an asset; it is an exit strategy,” LeClair said. “We are here to accumulate and direct, not to sell.” The 21 Million Plan also aims to protect shareholder value and prevent dilution often seen in traditional capital raisings by setting the warrant exercise price at 100% of the previous day's closing price. Following the 41.7% BTC Return in Q3, Metaplanet has reinforced confidence in its Bitcoin acquisition strategy by reporting an impressive 309.82% BTC Return in Q4 2024. The company has set a target of 35% BTC Return per quarter going forward. Investors' confidence in the plan was reflected in the stock market, with Metaplanet shares closing 5% higher on Wednesday. The bold Bitcoin accumulation strategy underscores a growing trend of companies, particularly in Asia, embracing Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. If successful, Metaplanet could join the ranks of MicroStrategy and other large institutional Bitcoin holders in reshaping institutional adoption of digital assets. *This is not investment advice.

Meanwhile, PlutoChain is drawing whale interest with its innovative use of AI and smart contracts to enhance Bitcoin. With millions of tokens already sold in its presale, the project is rapidly gaining traction. As XRP prepares for major growth and PlutoChain positions itself as a potential disruptor, both are shaping the future of crypto. Let’s take a closer look. XRP’s Pivotal Moment: SEC Updates and Pro-Crypto Administration Could Drive XRP Toward $10 XRP is currently trading slightly above the $3.05 zone, with a slight 0.6% uptick in the past 24 hours. When it comes to the technical analysis, XRP has support at $2.75, meaning it could bounce back up if the price drops to that point. The resistance level is at $3.21. Ripple’s XRP recently hit a new high above $3, resulting from optimism around the legal battle with the SEC and expectations of a crypto-friendly regulatory shift under President Trump. Experts have different opinions on XRP’s future. According to Nico4theshow , there are two possible scenarios for XRP – either it breaks below the current support, potentially dropping to $1.75, or it experiences a bullish breakout, reaching a new all-time high around $4.50. Could PlutoChain Be the Missing Puzzle Piece in Unlocking Bitcoin’s Full Potential for DeFi Applications? PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might just be the solution to one of Bitcoin’s biggest challenges—its slow transaction speed. While Bitcoin reigns as the leader of blockchain assets, its 10-minute block time makes it less ideal for more complex applications that today’s networks demand. This is where PlutoChain could step in. As a Layer-2 solution, it could speed things up with a 2-second block time, making transactions feel as fast and seamless as using your everyday payment app. Early testnet results have been promising, showing the system’s ability to handle over 43,200 transactions a day. For context, that’s hundreds of transactions in the time it takes Bitcoin to confirm just one block. PlutoChain also has the potential to bridge multiple blockchain ecosystems. By combining Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum’s EVM compatibility , users could experience the best of both worlds. This may open the door for developers to build DeFi apps and NFT marketplaces directly on Bitcoin, which could attract those who have felt excluded from the DeFi space. On top of that, PlutoChain could introduce a more democratic governance model. Instead of top-down decisions, the community would have the power to vote on key protocol changes, making the platform more in tune with user needs. To ensure security and build trust, PlutoChain has passed comprehensive audits by reputable firms like SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . Final Thoughts As XRP moves closer to its $10 target, the growing regulatory support and expert optimism create a strong foundation for its potential. At the same time, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might be interesting to watch as a new project that could bridge Bitcoin and Ethereum, and bring powerful applications. By integrating Ethereum’s EVM compatibility with Bitcoin’s robust security, PlutoChain could enable smart contracts, NFTs, and more. – – – Remember, this article is not financial or trading advice.

Specifically, he hopes that Paul Atkins, nominated by Donald Trump to lead the SEC, might take a more lenient stance towards crypto companies, possibly dismissing enforcement actions based solely on registration issues rather than fraud. In a January 28 discussion for XRP Community Day 2025, Alderoty acknowledged the SEC’s bureaucratic nature and expressed his hope that under Atkins, the commission might focus on fraud-related cases. “Litigation, regulation by enforcement, is not the path that this country should be pursuing. I believe the new SEC understands that, and I remain cautiously optimistic that at some point during 2025, the case will be voluntarily withdrawn,” he said. The Senate has not yet scheduled a confirmation hearing for Atkins, but if he assumes the role, Alderoty believes that the SEC could back away from civil suits against crypto firms, especially those where the main concern is a lack of registration. Ripple, which is currently involved in a lawsuit with the SEC over the classification of its XRP token as an unregistered security, has been in legal limbo since December 2020. The case has seen significant developments, including a federal judge ruling in August 2024 that Ripple was liable for over $125 million. Both Ripple and the SEC have filed appeals, with Ripple contesting the decision. The outcome of the SEC’s leadership transition could significantly impact Ripple’s legal landscape and its future with the agency.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-29 15:38:29

To say that MicroStrategy (MSTR) has been at the lead of creatively raising capital with which to buy massive amounts of bitcoin (BTC) would be an understatement. Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the company this week opened a new front along those lines with its perpetual preferred stock offering (STRK). Preferred stock sits between equity and debt on the corporate balance sheet, offering investors the regular return of bonds while giving them an ownership stake in a company. Well-followed MicroStrategy analyst Ben Werkman, posted on X about the attraction preferred stock can offer institutional investors due to its lack of maturity risk, stable yield and optional equity upside. ""I could see a scenario where [the preferred stock] starts taking some of the convertible bond space for fixed income accumulation due to the lack of any point in time maturity risk,"" said Werkman. ""Preferred stock has the potential to be massively more accretive than any convertible offering has been and definitely more accretive than [share sales]."" Similar sentiments came via Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Investments, who called MSTR's preferred stock offering one of the most compelling securities in the market and a next-generation investment vehicle. ""STRK is a near-perfect instrument,"" wrote Park. ""It gives you two chances to win: First, when rates go down, it's a huge boon to the principal, and two, if MicroStrategy goes up first, then you have a deep in-the-money (ITM) option to convert and own the higher volatility asset or just directly sell."" The largest of the U.S. preferred stock ETFs is the BlackRock iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (PFF), which has roughly $15 billion in assets under management. The largest holders of PFF ETF are major corporations such as Boeing (BA), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citi Group (C).

Zuckerberg has had several private meetings with the US President to pledge his “allegiance,” doubling back from their heated relationship during Trump’s first term. According to sources familiar with the matter, cited by the Financial Times , Zuckerberg has set his sights on purchasing a property in Washington, D.C. The CEO is likely going to use the property keep close ties with the White House and purportedly to advise President Trump on AI matters. The move signals Mark Zuckerberg’s ambition to work closely with the Trump administration as he seeks a role in influencing regulation in areas such as artificial intelligence https://t.co/SHwUMftXcX pic.twitter.com/OzAvBigq59 — Financial Times (@FT) January 29, 2025 Meta has not corroborated the story, but one source speaking to FT indicated that a specific property had already been identified. The 40-year-old tech billionaire’s move to Washington signals a change of heart from his relationship with Trump back in 2016 when they bashed heads over Meta’s “content moderation” policies. These shifts come as Meta targets to be the leading company in artificial intelligence worldwide, competing with companies like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft. The startup hopes that with President Trump’s support, it will overcome the regulatory hurdles set by the previous US administration. President Trump’s camp: Zuckerberg needs to do more Zuckerberg’s recent overtures and Right-Wing remarks are yet to satisfy Trump’s team, according to one senior member of the President’s administration. “ He can’t just snap his fingers and make the past not happen, ” the official told the news outlet, Rolling Stone. They added that the Meta chief would need to “show more commitment” to Trump’s agenda. “ Zuckerberg’s current efforts are a good start, but not nearly enough .” During President Trump’s first term, Zuckerberg was at odds with the administration over issues like immigration. Per a Washington Post report , in 2015, Trump made a controversial Facebook Post, summoning the US government to stop Muslims from coming into the country. The social platform’s employees, together with the CEO, became jittery about the statements and requested it to be pulled down. This made Trump and Zuckerberg’s relationship worse, and up until recent times, the former did not see eye to eye with many social media platforms in America, calling them tools for spreading “fake news.” However, this time around, the Meta CEO appears to be taking a different approach to avoid the wrath of the US President, known for “punishing” anyone who goes against his plans. Zuckerberg was among the invitees to Donald Trump’s Presidential Inauguration Ceremony on January 20, alongside Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla Billionaire CEO Elon Musk. Reports suggest that Zuckerberg has assured Trump’s team that he will not oppose the president’s policies and will work to make Meta’s social platforms “censorship-free.” Moreover, Meta itself has also taken steps to appease conservatives, recently ending its third-party fact-checking program and donating $1m to Trump’s inaugural fund. Can Zuckerberg be trusted? Earlier this month, Meta replaced its global policy chief, Nick Clegg, with Joel Kaplan, a prominent Republican figure with ties to the Trump administration. In 2020, when President Trump was serving his first term, Meta and Zuckerberg often deferred to Joel Kaplan behind closed doors. The company implemented several policies on content, promotion, and fact-checking that appeared to favor Republican interests, stemming from Kaplan’s ties to Trump. However, even Kaplan’s help was not enough to keep the Facebook co-founder on Trump’s good graces. Per a Reuters report , Trump threatened to take legal action against the tech billionaire in 2021, accusing Meta, alongside X (then Twitter) and Google, of interfering in elections and labeling the company an “enemy of the people.” The 47th US President also called for the CEO to be jailed if he dare meddled in the 2024 presidential race. After Meta announced the end of its third-party fact-checking program, Former President Joe Biden told reporters that the decision could lead to the “spread of misinformation.” “ The idea that a billionaire can buy something and say, ‘by the way, from this point on, we’re not going to fact-check anything,’ is really shameful, ” Biden said during a press briefing on January 10. The criticism follows Zuckerberg’s claim that the Biden administration pressured Meta to censor discussions about COVID-19 vaccine side effects. Earlier this month, during an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast , Zuckerberg said his company was solicited to remove certain content about COVID-19 vaccinations, even when it contained accurate information. “ They pushed us super hard to take down things that were honestly true, ” Zuckerberg told Rogan. “ Anything that said vaccines might have side effects, you basically need to take down. ” The American businessman did not specify which officials made the requests but asserted that he regretted some of the company’s decisions during the pandemic.

According to Bailey, Trump is committed to building a pro-crypto environment in the US through policy management. Trump said that Bitcoin will witness unseen highs, and the US is going to ‘outcompete China or any other country that wants to take that away from us’. This statement confirms Trump’s new approach towards crypto. During his first term, he was quite skeptical about Bitcoin and other crypto assets, deeming them unregulated and volatile. However, Trump’s latest presidential campaign was quite different in its attitude to cryptocurrencies. He openly expressed his support for the crypto economy and even accepted donations in crypto. What’s more, Trump is now eyeing Bitcoin as a key component to tackle the $35 trillion national debt. There are even talks of establishing a Bitcoin reserve at both the federal and state levels. Bitcoin hit new highs when it crossed the $109,000 mark after Trump’s election as the POTUS. Since then, the price has cooled, with BTC currently trading at around $102,500. However, Bitcoin looks ripe for a fresh move , and with all the government support it’s getting, we may soon see BTC reach a new high. Additionally, Trump also launched his own meme coin, $TRUMP. While it made good money for early investors and is still among the top cryptos in the world in terms of market capitalization, it has been tanking after the initial 2-day frenzy. The token has fallen from the high of $75 to $27, marking a 64% decrease. Trump supporters aren’t happy with the dismal performance of $TRUMP. However, with Bitcoin rallying , it’s worth turning your attention to Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE). Just about sold out in its presale, and having raised some $63M, it’s shattered all the records in terms of prelaunch performance and ranks as one of the hottest crypto presales with the potential to make you a millionaire in 2025 . Why Should You Buy $WEPE? Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is a frog-themed meme coin dedicated to empowering small-time investors. For long, the crypto markets have been dictated by a handful of whales with exclusive access to insider information. $WEPE is here to change that. $WEPE token holders will get access to insider strategies, information, alpha calls, and market strategies. This community of token holders, known as the $WEPE army, will collaborate and share market knowledge to build a new generation of millionaires. The token has already raised close to $64M and is currently in the last stage of its presale, which will end in a matter of days. It’s the final boarding call for early buyers, as with a presale raise rate of almost $1M a day, $WEPE will most likely sell out by early next week when it reaches the hard cap of $72M. Available at just $0.0003665 per token, this might be the cheapest you’ll be able to buy $WEPE for. If this is your first time investing in a crypto presale, here’s an in-depth guide on how to buy $WEPE . More good news for $WEPE investors is that even whales have been getting in on it. Etherscan data shows that a whale bought $200K worth of $WEPE in a single transaction on December 16. Furthermore, purchases of $115K , $82K , and $66K were made in just the last couple of weeks. $WEPE is the latest successor of frog-driven meme coins like $PEPE and $PEPU. In case you missed it, the frog frenzy is alive and well in the crypto market. $PEPE, for instance, made a whopping 1,200% return for early investors, whereas $PEPU made 5x just on its listing. $WEPE also plans to do the same, and a 100x valuation doesn’t look far-fetched. The project’s tokenomics also look solid. Wall Street Pepe’s developers have reserved 15% of the total token supply for smooth listing and a whopping 38% for marketing and community building. For more information, check out $WEPE’s whitepaper and its X feed . Conclusion You can buy $WEPE from the official Wall Street Pepe website by linking a wallet like Best Wallet . Click on ‘Buy $WEPE’ and choose your wallet. Scan the code from your wallet app and approve the linking. Then, select the number of tokens you want and confirm the transaction. Voilà! You’ve got $WEPE! However, always ensure you do your own research before making any investments in crypto, as the market can be pretty volatile.

Meanwhile a new meme coin sensation has been stealing their thunder. The presale launch of Panshibi($SHIBI) has sent ripples through the crypto space, particularly in the Asian market, where its cultural inspiration and innovative features have captured massive attention. Emerging as a fresh contender in the meme coin arena, Panshibi is proving to be more than just a fleeting trend, offering both engagement and value for its growing community of investors. So how are these projects likely to perform over the next financial quarter? DOGE Price Drops By 15% In A Week The DOGE price has been very unsteady lately, with a 15% loss in the last week . However, Dogecoin has seen a slight resurgence in the last 24 hours, suggesting its price may be stabilizing just for a moment. The problem with Dogecoin’s growth is that it has relied heavily on public endorsements and social hype rather than any genuine utility. One exception to this is Dogecoin’s occasional use as a tipping solution on select internet platforms, though this use case alone is unable to sustain Dogecoin’s value. Dogecoin continues to face criticism for its lack of significant technological advancements Shiba Inu News: Trading Volume Dips By 50% At the time of writing, Shiba Inu news suggests the asset is following Dogecoin’s trading, with its trading volume dipping by a stark 50% in the last 24 hours. This comes as Shiba Inu posted a 10% weekly loss, could this suggest a drop off in investor interest? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has faced similar criticisms to Dogecoin for its lack of modern features. However, Shiba Inu is owed some leeway as the developers did make notable technical progress in 2024 with the release of Shibarium and the introduction of new staking options for Shiba Inu holders. Nonetheless, Shiba Inu is on the edge, and the next month will be pivotal in dictating Shiba Inu’s fate. Panshibi Sets a New Standard for Meme Coins Panshibi is breaking away from the typical mold of meme coins that rely solely on hype. Drawing on the panda as its symbol, the project has struck a chord with the Asian market, blending a relatable theme with robust features. This combination has positioned it as a standout choice for investors who value substance alongside potential gains. The Panshibi ecosystem introduces a gamified experience, where holders can take part in AI-powered challenges to earn rewards. This isn’t just about holding tokens—it’s about being part of an active and connected community that rewards involvement. By creating an engaging platform, Panshibi is redefining the user experience for meme coin enthusiasts. While others, like Dogecoin, continue to rely on their Doge price momentum, Panshibi is shifting the focus toward active participation. Another key element of the Panshibi project is its staking feature, which allows holders to earn up to 1,200% APY. This opportunity appeals to investors looking for more than just speculative price action by offering steady and meaningful returns. While many meme coins have little to offer beyond market volatility, Panshibi’s staking rewards create a compelling reason to hold $SHIBI for the long term. Security and Trust at Its Core Panshibi is built to stand the test of time. With a fully audited smart contract, the project prioritizes investor safety. To further bolster trust, the liquidity pool has been locked for 10 years, ensuring long-term stability. Meanwhile, team tokens are locked for 2 years, eliminating concerns about early sell-offs. Early investors also enjoy exclusive benefits through the Bamboo Private VIP Members Club. This club grants unique perks like first access to upcoming projects and special giveaways, setting Panshibi apart in the meme coin landscape.

39658344,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/ai-predicts-doge-shiba-inu-will-decline-in-february-as-panshibi-gains-traction,1738165857,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/39658344.jpeg,AI Predicts DOGE & Shiba Inu Will Decline in February as Panshibi Gains Traction,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/ai-predicts-doge-shiba-inu-will-decline-in-february-as-panshibi-gains-traction,"The onset of 2025 has dealt a severe blow to some of the original meme coins, particularly Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, which have both experienced significant drops over the past week. Meanwhile, a new meme coin has been making waves. The presale launch of Panshibi($SHIBI) has created a stir in the crypto world, especially in the Asian market, where its cultural appeal and innovative features have garnered considerable attention. Emerging as a fresh competitor in the meme coin sector, Panshibi is demonstrating it's more than a passing fad, providing both engagement and value for its expanding community of investors. What can we expect from these projects in the upcoming financial quarter? DOGE Price Slides 15% Over the Week The DOGE price has been notably erratic lately, suffering a 15% decline over the past week . Despite this, Dogecoin has experienced a minor recovery in the last 24 hours, indicating a potential temporary stabilization. Dogecoin's growth has largely depended on public endorsements and social buzz instead of real utility. While it is occasionally used as a tipping mechanism on certain online platforms, this function alone isn't enough to maintain Dogecoin's value. The coin continues to face criticism for its lack of major technological advancements Shiba Inu Update: Trading Volume Plummets 50% Currently, Shiba Inu updates indicate that the asset is mimicking Dogecoin's trading pattern, with its trading volume dropping by a significant 50% over the past 24 hours. This follows a 10% weekly loss for Shiba Inu, possibly signaling diminishing interest from investors. Shiba Inu (SHIB) faces similar criticisms to Dogecoin regarding its limited features. However, Shiba Inu deserves some credit as the developers achieved notable technical improvements in 2024 with the launch of Shibarium and the introduction of new staking options for its holders. Despite this, Shiba Inu is at a critical juncture, and the coming month will be crucial in determining its future. Panshibi Establishes a New Benchmark for Meme Coins Panshibi is breaking the mold of typical meme coins that depend solely on hype. By embracing the panda as its emblem, the project resonates with the Asian market, combining a familiar theme with powerful features. This unique blend has made it a favored choice for investors who prioritize substance along with potential profits. The Panshibi ecosystem offers a gamified experience, where holders can participate in AI-driven challenges to earn rewards. This goes beyond merely holding tokens—it's about being an active part of a connected community that values participation. By fostering an engaging environment, Panshibi is transforming the experience for meme coin fans. While others, like Dogecoin, continue to lean on their Doge price momentum, Panshibi is turning the spotlight on active involvement. Another important aspect of the Panshibi initiative is its staking feature, which allows holders to earn up to 1,200% APY. This feature appeals to investors seeking more than just speculative price movements by providing consistent and substantial returns. While many meme coins offer little beyond market fluctuations, Panshibi’s staking rewards give a compelling reason to hold $SHIBI for the long term. Security and Reliability at Its Foundation Panshibi is designed to endure. With a thoroughly audited smart contract, the project places a high priority on investor security. To further reinforce trust, the liquidity pool is locked for a decade, ensuring long-term stability. Additionally, team tokens are locked for two years, alleviating concerns about premature sell-offs. Early backers also gain access to exclusive benefits through the Bamboo Private VIP Members Club. This club offers unique advantages like early access to new projects and special giveaways, distinguishing Panshibi in the meme coin arena. While Shiba Inu updates often emphasize community-driven initiatives, Panshibi’s emphasis on delivering tangible value through its ecosystem gives it a competitive advantage. Investors Hurry to Acquire $SHIBI Tokens The Panshibi presale has generated over $140,000 within just five days, offering tokens at an attractive price of only $0.002. Investors are eager to join this promising venture, with analysts forecasting a 1,200% price increase during the presale phase alone, and further growth following its launch. For those aiming to be part of the next significant phenomenon in meme coins, Panshibi presents an opportunity not to be missed while the presale is still in its early stages.

Why New Viral Meme Has Trended On Twitter/X For 24 Hours Straight,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/solana-price-prediction-is-500-coming-soon-why-new-viral-meme-has-trended-on-twitterx-for-24-hours-straight,"Solana has been making headlines the past few days. The crypto market fluctuations caused a pullback that erased Solana's Trump-fueled gains. However, that hasn't deterred analysts from making positive Solana price predictions. Recently, analysts tipped the stalwart altcoin to beat the previous ATH of $295 and reach $500 in the coming months at the heel of a growing meme craze and institutional interest. Can Solana reach this monumental height? Can a new trending meme coin surpass Solana and dominate the altcoin space? Let's dive into this Solana price prediction. Solana Price Prediction: Analysts Eye $500 Target for SOL Solana (SOL) has weathered the bearish storm that hit the crypto market while posting an impressive performance in recent months. On January 19, 2025, Solana hit a record-breaking all-time high of $293.31. Although Solana has tumbled 19% from the ATH price, many analysts are confidently setting their sights on a $500 price target for the token. One of the key drivers behind the positive Solana price prediction is Solana's expanding ecosystem and global partnerships. Its collaboration with Japan’s SBI Group to launch exclusive NFTs on SBI’s Web3 Wallet and its integration with Ethereum’s Solidity through Hyperledger Solang are attracting more developers. On-chain metrics also paint a positive picture. Total Value Locked (TVL) soared from $10.11 billion to $11.64 billion in just a week. The monumental development had market analyst Andrew Griffiths predict a medium-term target of kd $500, especially with rising DeFi and NFT adoption. Technical indicators reinforce this sentiment. All key EMAs signal strong momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 51.65 indicates a stable market. Analysts like Natalie Dormer see a ""cup and handle"" formation on the weekly chart—a bullish signal often preceding major breakouts. Panshibi: The new viral meme coin presale trending on X (Twitter) Just a few days after its highly anticipated presale launch, Panshibi has been disrupting the meme and crypto worlds with its ingenious meme culture. Panshibi's ecosystem is designed to engage users through interactive social-fi features and AI-powered challenges, fostering a vibrant community. The project emphasizes decentralization, sustainability, and trust, with the Bamboo Valley serving as the heart of its operations. This approach aims to create a harmonious environment for investors and users, setting Panshibiapart from other meme coins in the market. The opportunity to earn while experiencing innovation resonated with many investors, too. Panshibi provides myriads of earning opportunities, including a stake-to-earn program, exclusive platform rewards and the right to the Bamboo Valley experience. Launched with a 60-day presale event, Panshibi aims to raise $10 million, offering early investors the opportunity to acquire tokens at a discounted rate. The presale is structured in 15 stages, with the token price increasing incrementally from $0.002 to $0.026. This strategic pricing model has attracted attention from investors seeking early-stage opportunities in the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion While analysts debate Solana's potential to reach $500, the cryptocurrency market's inherent volatility makes such predictions uncertain. In contrast, Panshibi presents a unique investment opportunity. Panshibi offers a compelling case for investors seeking exposure to the meme coin sector with its structured presale, engaging ecosystem, and strategic focus on community building. The project's emphasis on early-stage investment and community engagement positions it as a noteworthy contender in today's meme mania.

Due to fluctuations in the crypto market, Solana's gains, spurred by links to Trump, have been wiped out. Nonetheless, analysts remain optimistic about Solana price predictions. Experts are speculating that the well-established altcoin might surpass its previous all-time high of $295 and potentially reach $500 in the near future, fueled by a rising meme trend and growing institutional interest. Is this ambitious target achievable for Solana? Could a newly popular meme coin overtake Solana's position in the altcoin market? Let's explore this Solana price prediction. Solana Price Forecast: Experts Set Sights on $500 for SOL Despite the bearish trends that have swept through the crypto space, Solana (SOL) has shown remarkable resilience and strong performance in recent times. On January 19, 2025, it achieved a historic peak of $293.31. Although Solana has since dropped by 19% from this peak, many analysts are confidently aiming for a $500 price milestone for the token. A major factor supporting the positive Solana price prediction is the expansion of Solana's ecosystem and its international collaborations. Partnerships like the one with Japan’s SBI Group to launch unique NFTs on SBI’s Web3 Wallet and its integration with Ethereum’s Solidity via Hyperledger Solang are drawing in more developers. On-chain data also suggests a positive trend. Total Value Locked (TVL) surged from $10.11 billion to $11.64 billion over one week. These significant developments led market expert Andrew Griffiths to predict a medium-term goal of kd $500, especially given the increasing adoption of DeFi and NFTs. Technical analysis supports this outlook as well. All major EMAs indicate strong momentum, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 51.65 suggests a stable market. Analysts like Natalie Dormer have observed a ""cup and handle"" pattern on the weekly chart—a bullish signal that often precedes significant breakouts. Panshibi: New Meme Coin Taking Over X (Twitter) Trends Shortly after its highly anticipated presale, Panshibi has been making waves in both the meme and cryptocurrency spheres with its creative meme culture. Panshibi's ecosystem is crafted to involve users through interactive social-fi features and AI-driven challenges, creating a lively community. The project prioritizes decentralization, sustainability, and trust, with the Bamboo Valley at its core. This strategy aims to foster a balanced environment for both investors and participants, setting Panshibi apart from other meme coins on the market. The opportunity to earn while enjoying innovative experiences has resonated with numerous investors. Panshibi offers various ways to earn, including a stake-to-earn program, exclusive platform rewards, and access to the Bamboo Valley experience. Introduced with a 60-day presale, Panshibi aims to raise $10 million, enabling early investors to purchase tokens at a reduced price. The presale is divided into 15 phases, with token prices gradually increasing from $0.002 to $0.026. This strategic pricing approach has captured the interest of investors looking for early-stage opportunities in the crypto market. Conclusion While there is debate among analysts about Solana's potential to hit $500, the inherent unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market leaves such forecasts uncertain. In contrast, Panshibi offers a distinctive investment option. Panshibi makes a strong case for investors interested in the meme coin sector through its well-structured presale, engaging ecosystem, and strategic focus on community development. The project's emphasis on early investment and community involvement positions it as a significant player in the current meme coin craze.

Unlike many of its peers, the finance giant opted not to sell during the recent cryptocurrency selloff, initiated as a spillover from the technology sector in the wake of DeepSeek’s release, and it has loaded up on an additional 11,000 BTC in the last 7 days. Such activity ensured that the total value of BlackRock’s Bitcoin holdings, at press time on January 29, amounts to a high $62.25 billion, per the data Finbold retrieved from Arkham.

This upgrade gives Cardano ( ADA ) holders direct voting power over key blockchain decisions, including protocol changes, treasury management, and governance proposals. The Plomin hard fork marks a shift from centralized decision-making to a system where the community has greater control. Before this upgrade, governance decisions were primarily influenced by the Cardano Foundation and other core contributors. Now, ADA holders can vote on governance actions either directly or through delegated representatives. For a hard fork to be enacted, certain technical and governance requirements must be met. In this case, three key thresholds were passed: at least 85% of stake pools upgraded to a compatible Cardano node, over 51% of stake pool operators voted in favor of the upgrade, and more than 67% of the Interim Constitutional Committee determined that the upgrade was constitutional. Tonight, Cardano evolves. The Plomin hard fork takes effect, marking the transition to full decentralized governance. $Ada holders gain real voting power—on parameter changes, treasury withdrawals, hard forks, and the blockchain’s future. A milestone in blockchain governance. — Cardano Foundation (@Cardano_CF) January 29, 2025 You might also like: Trump media to allocate $250m to crypto, fintech expansion Seven governance actions The Plomin hard fork introduces seven governance actions outlined in Cardano Improvement Proposal CIP-1694. These include allowing ADA holders to propose and vote on constitutional changes, approve treasury withdrawals, and initiate votes of no confidence against governance structures. Additionally, staking reward withdrawals will now be restricted to accounts that delegate to a DRep, reinforcing decentralized decision-making. This governance model aligns with Cardano’s long-term goal of minimizing centralized oversight. By enabling the community to control blockchain upgrades and treasury spending, Cardano aims to build a system where power is distributed rather than concentrated.

Panshibi($SHIBI) is a meme coin that is rapidly gaining traction in the cryptocurrency industry and investors in Stellar (XLM) and Hedera (HBAR) have taken notice. As the meme coin industry continues to grow, these well-known cryptocurrencies are keeping a careful eye on Panshibi's ascent because of its distinct appeal and promise. Why are Stellar and Hedera so interested in Panshibi's increasing market share, and what does this portend for their future? Stellar’s Price Woes Stellar, a blockchain designed to facilitate international payments, has been experiencing significant issues with its pricing performance. Despite the platform's strong ties to financial institutions and potential for broad adoption, most Stellar price predictions have been negative. As of late January 2025, XLM is trading at $0.40 , a significant decrease from its high in previous years. The increasing rivalry in the blockchain sector has been a significant contributor to this price drop. Other projects with faster, more scalable systems have eclipsed Stellar's fame. Additionally, the broader market volatility and economic uncertainty have made XLM's lack of momentum worse. Hedera’s Struggles Another blockchain project that has faced difficulties of its own is Hedera. Hedera is renowned for its speed and scalability and offers a very efficient architecture for NFTs and decentralized apps (dApps). Regardless of this, HBAR hasn't been able to match other blockchain ventures' zeal and price momentum, despite its technological advancements. HBAR is currently trading at $0.30 as of late January 2025, finding it difficult to expand on its prior gains. Hedera is dealing with more competition in the market, much like Stellar. Despite having a strong dAppecosystem, the platform has not gained the same amount of traction or price growth as more recent initiatives, especially meme coins that take advantage of viral marketing and community engagement. Panshibi: The New Sensation One of the most intriguing new meme coins on the market is Panshibi, which has developed amid Stellar and Hedera's price difficulties. Investors have quickly taken notice of Panshibi's presale because of its community-driven strategy and potential for viral growth. In contrast to more established cryptocurrencies like XLM and HBAR, Panshibi's value is mostly determined by the strength of its community and social media buzz. Panshibi's potential for exponential expansion is what makes it particularly alluring. Many investors view it as a unique chance to participate early in a project with high-profit potential, as evidenced by the tremendous level of interest generated by its presale. Investors have the opportunity to transform modest deposits into substantial returns thanks to Panshibi's 500/1 odds, which further enhance its appeal. The Shift in Investment Strategies As Hedera struggles to find traction and Stellar price predictions continue to be muted, many investors are searching for methods to diversify their holdings. In an increasingly unpredictable market, meme coins like Panshibi provide an alluring alternative with the potential for large profits. Panshibi is a more alluring option for short-term gains due to its quick expansion and community-driven success and may turn out to be a wise long-term investment. As investors turn to high-risk, high-reward options instead of typical cryptocurrencies, this change in investment strategy is becoming increasingly noticeable. In the cryptocurrency space, meme currencies are quickly taking over, with initiatives like Panshibi at the forefront. Conclusion Although Stellar and Hedera still have potential in the long run, their price issues have reduced their appeal in the near term. Panshibi has a far more alluring investment potential because market volatility and competition have a significant impact on their price performance. Panshibi has the potential to become one of the most talked-about tokens of 2025 because of its viral potential and community-driven appeal.

Panshibi($SHIBI), a meme coin, is swiftly making a name for itself in the cryptocurrency arena, and it's drawing attention from investors in Stellar (XLM) and Hedera (HBAR). As the meme coin market expands, these established cryptocurrencies are closely monitoring Panshibi's rise due to its unique appeal and potential. What's causing Stellar and Hedera to focus on Panshibi's growing market presence, and what implications does this have for their future? Stellar’s Price Challenges Stellar, known for its blockchain designed to streamline cross-border transactions, has been facing major pricing challenges. Despite its strong connections with financial institutions and the potential for widespread use, the majority of Stellar price forecasts have been pessimistic. As of late January 2025, XLM is trading at $0.40 , a notable drop from its previous peaks. The decline in price can largely be attributed to increasing competition within the blockchain industry. Other projects offering faster and more scalable solutions have overshadowed Stellar's reputation. Additionally, the overall market instability and economic uncertainties have further weakened XLM's momentum. Hedera’s Challenges Hedera is another blockchain project encountering its own set of challenges. Renowned for its speed and scalability, Hedera provides a highly efficient framework for NFTs and decentralized applications (dApps). However, HBAR has struggled to keep up with the enthusiasm and price momentum of other blockchain ventures, despite its technological breakthroughs. Currently, HBAR is trading at $0.30 as of late January 2025, and it is finding it hard to build on its previous progress. Much like Stellar, Hedera faces stiff market competition. Even with a robust dApp ecosystem, the platform hasn't achieved the same traction or price surge as newer projects, especially meme coins that excel in viral marketing and community involvement. Panshibi: The Emerging Phenomenon Panshibi is one of the most captivating new meme coins to emerge amid Stellar and Hedera's pricing struggles. Investors have quickly taken note of Panshibi's presale, thanks to its community-focused approach and potential for viral expansion. Unlike more established cryptocurrencies like XLM and HBAR, the value of Panshibi is largely driven by its community's strength and social media buzz. The prospect of exponential growth is what makes Panshibi especially appealing. Many investors see it as a rare opportunity to get in early on a project with high-profit potential, as evidenced by the overwhelming interest in its presale. Investors have the chance to turn small investments into substantial returns thanks to Panshibi's 500/1 odds, further enhancing its appeal. A Shift in Investment Approaches As Hedera struggles with gaining traction and Stellar's price forecasts remain unenthusiastic, numerous investors are looking to diversify their portfolios. In an increasingly unpredictable market, meme coins like Panshibi offer an enticing alternative with the potential for substantial profits. Panshibi is an attractive choice for short-term gains because of its rapid growth and community-driven success and may prove to be a wise long-term investment. As investors lean towards high-risk, high-reward options over traditional cryptocurrencies, this shift in investment strategy is becoming increasingly evident. Meme currencies are swiftly overtaking the crypto space, with projects like Panshibi leading the charge. Conclusion While Stellar and Hedera still hold long-term potential, their current price challenges have lessened their short-term appeal. Panshibi presents a more attractive investment opportunity given the significant impact of market volatility and competition on their price performance. Panshibi has the chance to become one of 2025's most talked-about tokens due to its viral potential and community-driven allure.

This potential move, led by Governor Aleš Michl, could position the CNB as the first major central bank in the West to hold digital assets. BREAKING: 🇨🇿 Czech National Bank governor says #Bitcoin “has zero correlation to bonds and is an interesting asset for a large portfolio.” “Worth considering.” 🙌 pic.twitter.com/PqwlWEbpGy — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) January 29, 2025 Key Takeaways The CNB may invest up to 5% of its €140 billion ($146.13 billion) reserves in Bitcoin. Governor Michl emphasizes Bitcoin's potential for diversification despite its volatility. The proposal is set to be presented to the bank's board for approval on January 30, 2025. A Shift Towards Bitcoin Governor Aleš Michl has expressed a desire to diversify the CNB's asset portfolio, highlighting Bitcoin as a viable option. In an interview , he stated, ""For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good."" This statement reflects a growing trend among financial institutions to explore BTC as an alternative investment. The proposed investment could amount to approximately €7 billion ($7.3 billion) in Bitcoin, which would surpass the CNB's current gold holdings of €4.3 billion. If approved, this allocation would represent a significant shift from traditional reserve assets, which typically include gold and U.S. dollars. Related: Trump Signs Executive Order to Explore a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve The Rationale Behind the Proposal Several factors are driving the CNB's consideration of Bitcoin: Increasing Institutional Interest : The launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by major asset managers like BlackRock has sparked renewed interest in Bitcoin as a legitimate investment. Diversification Strategy : Michl believes that Bitcoin's low correlation with traditional assets like bonds makes it an attractive option for diversifying the bank's reserves. Changing Regulatory Landscape : The recent regulatory changes in the U.S., particularly under President Donald Trump, have created a more favorable environment for cryptocurrencies, further encouraging the CNB's exploration of Bitcoin. Risks and Considerations Despite the potential benefits, Michl acknowledges the inherent volatility risks associated with investing in Bitcoin. However, he remains optimistic about its long-term value, stating, ""It’s possible to have a big range of outcomes, that Bitcoin will have a value of zero or an absolutely fantastic value."" The CNB's board will need to conduct a thorough analysis before making a final decision. Michl emphasized the importance of thoughtful consideration, stating, ""The bank board decides, and no decision is imminent.""

If approved, this decision could pave the way for other central banks to follow suit, reflecting a broader acceptance of digital assets in the financial landscape. As the CNB prepares to present its proposal, the world watches closely to see if this bold step will redefine the role of Bitcoin in national reserves.",central bank|buy bitcoin|Bitcoin Strategic Reserve|Czech|News|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2025-01-29 16:10:50

Today, AI Companions ($AIC) topped the charts of the highest gainers in the last 24 hours, rising as high as 75% above $0.2. A new meme coin fork, $PORK, also stole the spotlight among the meme coin community. So, where does $CHONE fit in this competitive landscape? Could $CHONE be the next big player in the meme market? AIC: Building The Generation of Personalized AI AI Companions is a crypto project on a mission to transform our digital companionship. As the world’s exposure to AI grows, the need for personalized experiences creates a market that must be attended to. AI Virtual Companions provides a wide range of features that leverage artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain technology, and its AIC tokens to create immersive and unique digital experiences for its users. The buzz around DeepSeek and its revolutionary AI has sent shockwaves through the world. This Chinese company has given a much-needed boost to solidifying the notion that AI is the future. This hype around AI likely sent the price of AIC tokens more than 75% in a single day, making it a top gainer. AIC could revolutionize not just how we interact with each other online but how users get work, school, relationships, business, and others done in the future. $PORK: Are Glory Days Still Ahead? $PORK has been a standout meme since 2024. Its popularity rode on the existing market presence of the PEPE meme coin. PORK, derived from Pepe-fork, is a fork of PEPE. Immediately after its launch in 2024, it rose by 500% in 48 hours. Its market value exceeded $200 million at the time. It has, however, declined since then, losing more than 18% since its all-time high. Today, PORK surged to $0.0000000097 following its uptick since Jan 27. However, it has declined today, currently trading at $0.0000000066. This surge could be seen as a sign of hope, especially with the bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market. $CHONE Could Lead The Meme Market $CHONE conveniently checks the box of the most successful meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Its narrative, meme-worthiness, and relativity are something that rank it high among memes with a higher potential to go viral in 2025. Chill Drone ($CHONE) introduces a new haven for outcasts who defy the status quo of endless grind looking for the next big thing in the market. It suggests a rather relaxed approach to investment where fun, humor, individuality, and creativity are not lost but embraced on the journey to the moon. The relaxed-looking meme coin sends a narrative through the market of “chilling out and making cash.” While everyone is rushing to dominate the market, we will sit back in a fluffy cloud, relaxed and moving at our pace—away from pressure and chaos. $CHONE is also available on the Solana ecosystem, which is the headquarters for memes currently shaking the market. With a strong community backing like the one already gathering around the project, a 10x surge is possible.

With January almost over and the Dogecoin price closing the month on a positive note, the next outlook is what lies ahead for the meme coin and whether Dogecoin investors can see a similar price trend in February. Dogecoin Price Performance In January Dogecoin’s price movement in January was full of intense volatility. The meme coin opened the month trading around the $0.315 price level, having declined in the latter half of December. Interestingly, this opening price proved to be an important support level throughout the month, with Dogecoin repeatedly testing and bouncing off it in response to market fluctuations. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To Breakout To $1.4? Analyst Reveals Critical Levels To Watch For A Pump Or Crash In terms of performance, Dogecoin’s price swings in January mirrored the turbulence seen across the crypto market, with significant manipulation playing a role in its trajectory. After starting the month at approximately $0.315, the meme coin trended upwards for the first seven days, in line with Bitcoin’s resurgence above the $100,000 price level. This first upward movement saw the Dogecoin price reach $0.39 on January 7. However, it was short-lived, as the intense volatility mentioned above saw those gains erased within 48 hours. Following a rejection near $0.4, Dogecoin fell by about 19% in two days before eventually bouncing off support at $0.31. Interestingly, Dogecoin would come to retest this level two times within the next five days. The second retest of this support zone led to a strong 40% rally that pushed DOGE above the $0.40 resistance level again after multiple attempts. This upward momentum peaked with Dogecoin reaching $0.4313 on January 18. However, this price high was met with another rejection, leading to a fresh downtrend. Dogecoin and many other cryptocurrencies witnessed a surge of outflows in capital rotation as many investors FOMOed on Donald Trump’s meme coin, launched on January 17. Despite this huge setback, Dogecoin once again found support at the $0.315 level, reinforcing its importance as a solid price floor. What To Expect In February: Sustaining Momentum Or Facing A Reversal? The euphoria surrounding Donald Trump’s election and meme coin has ended, the market seems to be cooling down, and Dogecoin has begun a gradual recovery above $0.31. As January draws to a close, the interest is on February to see if the memecoin can maintain its current momentum during the month or undergo another volatile movement within a range. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts When Dogecoin Price Will Hit $3 This Cycle At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.33, up by about 4.25% from its January open. According to historical price data from CryptoRank, the Dogecoin price has trended downwards in February more often than not. However, February 2024 proved to be a positive month for the meme coin, as it closed the month on a 50% gain from its open. A similar performance would see Dogecoin closing February around $0.5 if it were to close January at its current price. According to a crypto analyst, current market dynamics suggest DOGE will soon undergo a strong pump above the $0.4 price level. However, the most important thing right now would be for Dogecoin to hold above $0.315 and $0.3. Failure to hold above these levels could erase bullish momentum.

Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to build momentum, nearly slipping below $100,000 as it dropped to a low of $100,265 before recovering and moving to its current level of $101,600. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 1% over the past 24 hours and almost 4% over the past week. Other cryptocurrencies have not fared any better, falling back into the red after recovering on Tuesday. Ethereum (ETH) slipped below $3,200 and is currently trading around $3,110, down 2.50%. Solana (SOL) is down nearly 3% over the past 24 hours and almost 9% over the past week as it struggles to find a footing above $230. The Ethereum killer is trading at around $229.

Cardano (ADA) , Toncoin (TON), Hedera (HBAR), Stellar (XLM) , Polkadot (DOT), Litecoin (LTC) , and AI tokens also registered substantial drops. French Investigators Open Probe Against Binance French investigators announced they have opened a fraud probe into money laundering, tax fraud, and other related charges against Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. Binance has denied all allegations against it. The Paris Prosecutor’s Office’s economic and financial crime section said the probe involves money laundering in connection with drug trafficking. According to the Prosecutor’s office, the investigation will examine the period from 2019 to 2024, involving offenses committed in France and the European Union. A Binance spokesperson stated the exchange denies all allegations against it and will fight any charges against it. The new probe against Binance comes after former CEO Changpeng Zhao spent four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating US money laundering laws. Binance also agreed to pay a penalty of $4.3 billion. US authorities alleged Binance was using a “Wild West” model that welcomed criminals and other bad actors. They also alleged the platform did not report over 100,000 suspicious transactions. Binance has said the platform has made considerable advances in anti-money laundering (AML) compliance and implemented the required KYC and employee training protocols. Coinbase Launches In Argentina Coinbase has secured approval to begin operations in Argentina, with the platform targeting 5 million users in the South American nation. The platform announced it has received Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registration from the country's National Securities Commission. The registration allows Coinbase to provide services in a country where cryptocurrencies are crucial in the financial system. “Coinbase has received regulatory approval to launch in Argentina, where 5 million Argentinians use crypto daily.” The platform's operations in the country will be overseen by Matias Alberti, a fintech expert who has worked with Beunbit and Clara. Fabio Plein, Coinbase’s Director for the Americas, stated, “Matías brings a wealth of experience and a deep understanding of the local market. We’re confident in his leadership as we work to bring crypto services to millions of Argentinians.” A Coinbase survey highlighted the potential of cryptocurrencies in Argentina. 87% of respondents believed crypto can positively impact and enhance financial independence. Additionally, 79% of respondents were open to receiving their salary in crypto. “This launch is more than just an expansion. Its a commitment to empowering Argentinians and providing them with the tools needed to regain control over their financial futures. Through education and a trusted platform, Coinbase is helping Argentinians harness the power of cryptocurrency to overcome financial challenges and build a more prosperous future.” DeepSeek Leaves Markets Reeling The tech industry was left reeling after DeepSeek, a Chinese company, launched its R1 model. The launch rattled investor confidence, wiping over $1 trillion from the US markets. The fallout from the launch impacted some of the biggest names in the tech industry, with NVIDIA registering the largest single-day market loss in US history, losing a staggering $600 billion in value. Google's parent company, Alphabet, also posted a drop of $100 billion, while Microsoft lost $7 billion. DeepSeek’s R1 model has sent shockwaves in global markets thanks to its performance, rivaling established players like OpenAi’s o1-mini while requiring significantly fewer resources and capital. According to DeepSeek, R1 was developed at a cost of $5.6 million, shattering the perception that similar models require between $100 million and $1 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called DeepSeek’s work invigorating and praised its ability to deliver results at a fraction of the price. “DeepSeek's r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price. We will obviously deliver much better models, and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor! We will pull up some releases.” DeepSeek's impact extended beyond major tech stocks, reverberating across the crypto market, primarily about GPU-reliant mining companies and AI-centric crypto tokens. DeepSeek's capabilities raised questions about the sustainability of GPU-dependent industries, triggering marketwide uncertainty. As a result, crypto mining firms saw significant losses. Leading Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT) saw its shares plummet over 15% on January 27. Another key player Cipher Mining (CIFR) registered an even more substantial decline, falling 25%. The market turbulence impacted the crypto ecosystem as well, with AI tokens facing a significant selloff. Render (RENDER) saw a decline of over 11% over the past week. Similarly, The Graph (GRT), a blockchain indexing protocol, saw a drop of 15%, while Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) saw a drop of 14%. However, the marketwide selloff appears to be a knee-jerk reaction rather than a fundamental shift in the market. However, markets remain bearish thanks to several macroeconomic factors at play. Some analysts believe the disruption could be a boon for the crypto market, particularly for AI-crypto tokens. This is because of DeepSeek's open-source nature and reduced costs. By lowering the cost of running AI-powered blockchain applications, DeepSeek can potentially make crypto projects more sustainable in the long run. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is looking to reverse its recent decline, with the price up just over 1% over the past 24 hours. The bulls are struggling to build momentum and have been unable to push above $103,000 during the current t session. BTC’s labored price action comes as markets await the outcome of the first FOMC meeting of 2025. Analysts expect the Federal Reserve to keep its benchmark rate steady, given inflation remains above target. “Bitcoin is consolidating between $100,000 and $102,000 as markets await today’s FOMC meeting, the first monetary policy decision of 2025. While inflation has eased, it remains above target, making it likely the Fed will keep its benchmark rate steady at 4.25%-4.50%. If the Fed chair adopts a hawkish stance, Bitcoin could experience some temporary volatility. Key levels to watch are resistance at $102,200 and support at $99,330.” However, despite BTC’s ongoing recovery, markets remain on edge. The uncertainty will also lead to heightened volatility. A note by CoinSwitch Markets Desk stated, “Markets remain on edge ahead of the FOMC decision, with the CME FedWatch tool pricing in a 99%+ probability of no rate cut. Given the heightened uncertainty, volatility is expected to remain elevated, and traders are advised to exercise caution.” BTC is currently hovering around $102,000 and is up marginally during the ongoing session after declining for four consecutive days, spending most of the current week in the red. BTC began facing significant volatility towards the end of last week as it lost momentum after surging to a new all-time high. The price dropped over 2% on Wednesday before volatility set in on Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to gain the upper hand. Buyers ultimately came out on top as the price registered a marginal increase and settled at $104,004. Buyers retained control on Friday and attempted a move past $107,000 as BTC rose to an intraday high of $107,038 before losing momentum. The price ultimately settled at $104,874 after registering an increase of 0.84%. Source: TradingView Sentiment changed over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal drop on Saturday before dropping over 2% on Sunday and settling at $102,655. The price plummeted to an intraday low of $97,766 on Monday as markets collapsed following the launch of DeepSeek. However, it recovered to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $102,064. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price dropped 0.69% to $ 101,362. Buyers are struggling to build momentum, and price action remains muted. If sellers regain control and push BTC below $100,000 and the 50-day SMA, the price could drop to $90,000. If this level is breached, BTC could witness a drop to $75,000-$80,000. The RSI is currently at 53, just above the neutral zone. However, the MACD has flipped to bearish, indicating bearish pressure and suggesting a downtrend. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is also struggling to build momentum, with several key indicators pointing towards growing bearish sentiment. ETH has struggled since slipping below the 20-day SMA last weekend. The price recovered by Tuesday but could not move past the moving average and was back in the red on Wednesday, dropping 2.57% to $3,242. The price recovered on Thursday, rising 2,99% and moving to $3,339, but listing momentum at the 20-day SMA. Buyers attempted a move past the 20-day SMA on Friday as the price surged to an intraday high of $3,427. However, selling pressure forced ETH back below the 20-day SMA and settled at $3,309 after dropping nearly 1%. Source: TradingView ETH registered a marginal increase on Saturday before dropping 2.55% on Sunday to end the weekend in the red at $3,232. Bearish sentiment intensified on Monday as ETH plummeted to an intraday low of $3,020. Buyers prevented a further decline as ETH recovered to settle at $3,183 after a drop of 1.51%. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ETH dropped over 3% and settled at $3,077. The current session sees ETH marginally up and trading just above the $3,100 level. If sellers regain control, ETH could slip below $3,000. Should this happen, the price could fall as low as $2,800 before recovering. Technical indicators highlight growing bearishness, with the RSI well below the neutral zone and the MACD flipped to bearish, indicating a downtrend. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) has declined rapidly during the week as sellers look to drive it below the 20-day SMA and $200. SOL has struggled to push above $260, losing momentum after surging to $295 last Sunday. SOL dropped to a low of $229 the following session before recovering and rising to $272 on Wednesday. However, sellers returned to the market on Thursday as SOL dropped nearly 2% to $253. SOL encountered significant volatility on Friday as buyers pushed the price to an intraday high of $270. However, SOL lost momentum after reaching this level and ultimately settled at $253, registering only a marginal increase. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control on Saturday as SOL rose 1.17% to $256. However, sentiment changed on Sunday as the price plummeted over 6%, slipping below $250 and settling at $240. Bearish sentiment intensified on Monday as markets collapsed. As a result, SOL dropped to an intraday low of $220 before recovering to settle at $235. Sellers retained control on Tuesday, with SOL dropping 3.45% to $226. However, the price has recovered during the current session and is up nearly 1% as buyers try to prevent SOL from dropping below the 20-day SMA and towards $200. While the RSI is just above the neutral zone, the MACD has flipped to bearish, indicating a possible downtrend. Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Analysis Dogwifhat (WIF) has steadily declined since the beginning of last week when it slipped below the 20-day SMA. The price had dropped to a low of $1.35 after registering a drop of over 9% on Monday. WIF recovered on Tuesday thanks to support at lower levels, rising 4.49% to $1.45. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and WIF was back in the red on Wednesday, falling to $1.41. Buyers struggled to build momentum on Thursday as WIF registered only a marginal increase. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as WIF slipped below a key support level, dropping nearly 10% to $128. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control over the weekend as WIF registered a marginal drop on Saturday and over 5% on Sunday to settle at $1.20. WIF fell to an intraday low of $1.07 before recovering to settle at $1.18. The price plummeted nearly 11% on Tuesday as sellers attempted to drive it below $1. As a result, WIF fell to an intraday low of $0.975 before recovering to reclaim $1 and settle at $1.05. The current session sees WIF up nearly 13% as buyers look to reclaim key levels and push above the 20-day SMA. Internet Computer (ICP) Price Analysis AI tokens have registered a significant decline this week following the emergence of DeepSeek. Internet Computer (ICP) is down nearly 6% over the past 24 hours as AI-focused tokens grapple with uncertainty. The token has declined almost 10% over the past week and looks set for further declines this week. ICP took a bearish turn since mid-January when it slipped below the 20-day SMA after reaching an intraday high of $11.46. Selling pressure intensified last Monday after buyers failed to move past the 20-day SMA after rallying to an intraday high of $10.81. By Wednesday, ICP had slipped below the 200-day SMA and dropped to $9.09. The price recovered on Thursday as buyers attempted to prevent a drop below $9. As a result, ICP rose nearly 2% and settled at $9.25 but could not move past the 200-day SMA. Source: TradingView Sellers returned to the market on Friday as the price dropped 2.38% to $9.03. ICP experienced a mixed weekend, registering an increase of nearly 2% on Saturday before dropping 4.13% to slip below $9 and settle at $8.82. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as markets collapsed. With AI tokens bearing the brunt of the collapse, ICP plummeted to an intraday low of $8.07. However, buyers propped up the price, and ICP ultimately registered a marginal increase and settled at $8.85. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as the price dropped nearly 4% to $8.52. ICP remains in the red during the current session, with the price down almost 1% and trading at $8.45.

39660836,https://invezz.com/?p=2492750,1738170173,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Bitcoin holds steady around $100K ahead of Fed interest rate decision; WIF, UNI, TAO see gains",https://invezz.com/news/2025/01/29/bitcoin-holds-steady-around-100k-ahead-of-fed-interest-rate-decision-wif-uni-tao-see-gains/,"Bitcoin traded in a tight range today as investors braced for volatility ahead of the FOMC meeting that could provide fresh signals on interest rate policy and economic outlook. The overall cryptocurrency market cap dipped below $3.6 trillion for the third time this month and was down 2.53% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin dominance continued to rise throughout the day to 58.5% as the subdued performance was seen across the altcoin market with only a few of the top tokens in the green when writing. Aligning with the current market sentiment, the crypto fear and greed index dropped three points from the previous day to 50, which indicates a lack of confidence in the market. Why is Bitcoin going down? Bitcoin traded within a tight range between $100,272 – $103,541, with the $100,000 level currently acting as a crucial psychological support level. The bellwether crypto’s future direction will be greatly influenced by the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision later today. Traders are on edge, as any shift in policy could set the tone for Bitcoin’s next move. If the Fed maintains its current stance and keeps rates steady, as widely expected, Bitcoin’s reaction may remain muted in the short term. While a neutral policy signals stability, it also keeps liquidity conditions unchanged, meaning Bitcoin could continue trading in a tight range unless new catalysts emerge. On the other hand, a more hawkish stance—hinting at future rate hikes or keeping rates elevated for longer—could weigh on Bitcoin’s price. A stronger dollar typically means risk asset classes like cryptocurrencies are less attractive to investors. As such, it could trigger some downside pressure as investors rotate funds into safer, yield-bearing assets like U.S. Treasuries and money market funds. Conversely, a dovish tone from the Fed helps bulls push Bitcoin into price discovery mode as it currently trades a little 6% shy of its all-time high when writing. Lower interest rates generally lead to increased risk appetite, encouraging capital to flow into assets like Bitcoin. According to CME’s FedWatch tool, the regulator is expected to keep interest rates unchanged with a 99.5% chance. However, traders must note that Bitcoin fundamentals currently remain strong as institutional interest and developments around BTC as a state-backed reserve asset have solidified its long-term appeal. On top of this, regulatory clarity in key markets like the United States has also bolstered trader confidence. Long-term predictions for 2025 have ranged between $120,000 up to and beyond $200,000. Currently, besides the uncertainty around the Fed’s decision, a lack of retail interest is also preventing Bitcoin from moving higher. Pseudonymous analyst Charlie flagged this in a January 28 X post, stating that it has hit levels last seen during the 2021 bear market bottom. According to some analysts, Bitcoin needs to reclaim the $103,000 support level before it can continue higher. Fellow analyst AlphaBTC visualized a drop below $100k if bulls fail to breach this key support level. On the contrary, reclaiming it would hint its “game on again,” the analyst wrote. Such a scenario could transpire as there’s a concentration of bids between $95,500 and $101,500 according to crypto commentary channel Material Indicators. Some traders may be attempting to suppress the price temporarily to fill orders at lower levels, they explained. If Bitcoin’s price dips into this bid ladder, it could trigger strong buying activity, potentially setting the stage for a rebound. However, as analyst Charlie cautioned, newly formed buy walls can sometimes disappear abruptly, leading to unexpected volatility. For analyst and trader Carl Moon, BTC could be looking at a drop to $97,000. He pointed to a bearish flag formation on the BTC/USDT daily chart which if confirmed could lead to a deeper correction if Bitcoin drops below $100k. At the time of writing, one Bitcoin was selling for $101,892, down 1% over the past 24 hours. Altcoin market tanks The total altcoin market capitalization slipped 8.3% over the past day to $1.53 trillion as most of the top tokens traded in the red throughout the Asian trading hours. However, the altcoin season index saw no change from the previous and was sitting at 42. Single-digit gains were posted by a handful of tokens. The top performers were as follows: dogwifhat As of the last check on Wednesday morning U.S. time, Dogwifhat (WIF) was the top gainer among the 100 largest cryptocurrencies in the market. Source: CoinMarketCap The meme coin rose 8.2% over the past 24 hours, trading at $1.23 as it recovered most of its losses from the past four days. Its market cap stood at $1.2 billion, while its daily trading volume tripled to a massive $1.46 billion. Today’s gains may have been driven by an announcement from Dogwifhat’s official X account. The post stated that the token’s mascot would appear on the Las Vegas Sphere. Although unofficial, this sparked renewed buying activity from whales and increased WIF accumulation on exchange wallets. The most notable was a whale wallet named “Ansem,” which bought 915,828 WIF for 1.2 million USDC—its first purchase in three months. WIF is now its only major meme coin holding as of press time. Uniswap Uniswap (UNI) was up 5% over the past day, exchanging hands at $11.67 at the time of publication. Its market cap was standing at $7 billion with a circulating supply of around 600 million UNI tokens. Source: CoinMarketCap The altcoin’s gains could be driven by investor interest ahead of the Uniswap v4 launch. Scheduled for release this week, the upgrade is expected to enhance Uniswap’s infrastructure with improved liquidity provision and support for hooks and integrations. Analysts have noted that UNI recently broke out of a symmetrical triangle pattern, a bullish signal that could mean the altcoin could likely see more gains. Bittsensor Bittensor (TAO), an AI token that holds the 43rd position among the largest crypto assets in the market held on to 5% gains recorded over the previous day when writing. With an intraday high of $487.17, TAO extended its weekly gains to over 11% while its market cap stood at $3.76 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap Gains for TAO followed after asset management giant Grayscale announced it had opened its Decentralized AI Fund to accredited investors. TAO is one of the AI-focused cryptocurrencies that investors can gain exposure to via this fund. Some of the gains were also fuelled by some dip buying among traders after the TAO price crashed as the DeepSeek fiasco unraveled.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin rebounds above $100k, Solana surges past $140, and Remittix gains traction as the next XRP. Table of Contents Tuttle Capital files for Solana ETF as analysts project massive growth Remittix attracts big whales as presale gains momentum Why Remittix is the next XRP After witnessing a sharp decline in the past few days due to the upcoming US FOMC meeting, Bitcoin ‘s price has recovered above $100k, with popular altcoins like Solana bouncing back. The Solana price has risen above the $140 mark as Tuttle Capital files for the Solana ETF, a move that could boost institutional adoption of the top crypto coin. Meanwhile, the new cross-border payment solution Remittix (RTX) has continued to gain attention in the market, with analysts picking it as the next XRP. Within months of launching the presale, the RTX value has surged by over 400%, signalling massive demand for the DeFi coin. With cross-border payment projected to hit $250 billion in 2027, Remittix is tipped to be a major player in the lucrative industry. You might also like: Utility tokens like Solana, Remittix outshine Shiba Inu, Dogecoin this cycle Tuttle Capital files for Solana ETF as analysts project massive growth Tuttle Capital, an investment advisory firm, on Monday filed for 10 leveraged crypto exchange-traded funds, including Solana and the newly launched Melania and Trump meme coin. Reacting to the news on X, Bloomberg intelligence analyst James Seyffart thinks that the new application is a case of an issuer testing the limits of what the new SEC is going to allow. Solana’s price has reacted positively to the news, gaining over 5% in the past 24 hours while trading above $240 at the time of writing. The Solana market cap has also gained over 5% to stand above $116b with market activity also booming. Crypto analyst WorldOfCharts, in the latest Solana price analysis, thinks the altcoin is consolidating within a tight bullish pennant. A breakout could push the Solana price towards the $300 mark. So far, the Solana market sentiment is bullish with the Fear and Greed index 71 (Greed). The altcoin is trading above the 30-day SMA with over 20 market indicators flashing buy signals. With the positive news and rising momentum, a rise to $300 is possible soon. This puts it among the altcoins to watch in Q1. Remittix attracts big whales as presale gains momentum The Remittix (RTX) presale has witnessed massive growth in the past weeks, triggered by the massive adoption by whales. Barely a few weeks after launching the presale, over 395 million RTX tokens have been sold with over $9 million raised in cryptocurrency ICO funding. Analysts think it is following the pattern of Blockdag which raised over $100 million in presale. The RTX price has also surged to $0.0456 from the initial $0.006. This means early investors’ ROI has jumped by over 600%, making RTX one of the top-performing DeFi coins in the past few weeks. Market watchers attribute the driving factor to the cross-border payment solution. With the DeFi market facing issues of crypto-to-fiat payment, Remitix is developing a platform that will allow users to convert over 40 different cryptos to fiat. All these are done without any hidden fees, which are outside the flat fees charged. Given the simple nature of the Remittix ecosystem, it is difficult for the recipient to notice that the transaction originated as a crypto payment. To ensure transparency, all transactions are immutable, making them hard to alter when initiated. Businesses and companies can also utilize the Remittix platform to pay their international employees or accept cryptos from customers as a form of payment and settle transactions in fiat. The peer-to-peer approach removes the need for a third party, giving users full control over their assets. With the rising adoption of DeFi in financial transactions, analysts think RTX will hit $1 in 2025. This puts it on the list of top altcoins on investors’ watch lists. Why Remittix is the next XRP The DeFi market is witnessing massive growth as investors ditch traditional financial institutions with numerous issues like security, privacy and high fees. With Remittix, all these issues are resolved. Transactions in the ecosystem are stored in a public ledger like XRP, allowing anyone to view the details of every transaction. The P2P approach gives users full control over their assets. All these will likely increase its adoption with a high possibility of hitting 100x in 2025.

However, an initial pullback may occur in Q1 if the newly inaugurated Trump administration fails to introduce the anticipated “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” at the pace expected by the fast-moving crypto market. Even without a fully implemented reserve strategy, bitcoin is expected to rally, driven by bullish momentum. We anticipate the price to enter the $130,000–$150,000 range by Q2 of 2025, supported by strong market catalysts. You're reading Crypto Long & Short , our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Key catalysts driving growth Regulatory progress: With major regulatory barriers cleared in jurisdictions like the U.S., corporate interest in bitcoin has surged. Corporate and institutional demand: A growing number of corporations are actively planning to deploy capital into cryptocurrency. Hedge funds, large corporates, and family offices are showing unprecedented enthusiasm for bitcoin exposure. This widespread interest signifies a strong foundation for bitcoin’s upward trajectory in 2025. Quantitative models and risks While optimism runs high, our quantitative models flag no potential risks under $90,000. Specifically: The Vanguard model, which recently flipped to a buy signal for the first time this year, confirms bullish momentum around bitcoin. Weekly price closes above $100,000 should keep the bullish sentiment alive. Insights from DeMark indicator The DeMark TD Sequential indicator suggests bitcoin is on a bullish setup on the weekly timeframe after reaching its propulsion target of $108,300 and completing one of its typical 10% corrections down to $90,000, which was bought with conviction. A propulsion target is a predefined price level derived from a series of calculations that help traders identify key areas of potential support or resistance. These targets are designed to indicate where the price might move in the future, often serving as potential breakout or exhaustion points. Bitcoin is approximately seven weeks away from completing its bullish TD setup phase eyeing its first potential propulsion target of $119,270. Weekly price closes above $107,300 could trigger the next bullish acceleration. The week of Trump’s inauguration, the DeMark TD Sequential indicator showed topping patterns on the daily timeframe introducing a bearish direction towards $90,000, but as long as bitcoin price stays above $104,400, the downside risk is limited. Dollar strength and macro risks The U.S. dollar’s weakness in the coming weeks and months presents another catalyst for crypto: Capital inflows into the U.S. economy Optimism around Trump’s ""America First"" policies DXY technical charts indicative of topping patterns Summary Despite potential near-term volatility and choppy price action, we maintain a strong bullish outlook for bitcoin in 2025, with projected highs reaching $150,000 or more. Key risks include corrections toward the $90,000s, should buy signals fail to emerge. We will be navigating this dynamic market for potential long-term value investing at around the $82,000 and $85,000 range. Additionally, weekly price closes below $99,000 should be the trigger for the next bearish leg down.",CoinDesk Indices|Crypto Long & Short|Opinion,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-29 17:04:08

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255.

The Chinese tech company argued that Qwen 2.5 surpassed the highly-acclaimed DeepSeek-V3. Alibaba posted on its official WeChat account that Qwen 2.5-Max outperformed almost all AI models, including GPT-40, DeepSeek-V3, and Llama-3.1-405B. The company’s news came in the wake of the release of DeepSeek’s AI assistant (DeepSeek-V3) on January 10 and the January 20 release of its R1 model. The recent release of DeepSeek’s R1 model sent a shockwave in the U.S. tech companies’ stocks tumbling, especially Nvidia. DeepSeek claimed that it created the R1 model with only $6 billion compared to the billions of dollars other U.S. tech firms spend in the AI space. The tech company also caused some momentum in its own domestic market, with other Chinese tech firms rushing to release updates to their AI models. A report from Reuters revealed that two days after the release of DeepSeek-R1, ByteDance also released an update to its flagship AI model. The TikTok parent company argued that it outperforms Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s o1 in tests that measure how well AI models understood and responded to complex instructions. Alibaba releases its new version of the Qwen2.5 AI model The burst of DeepSeek V3 has attracted attention from the whole AI community to large-scale MoE models. Concurrently, we have been building Qwen2.5-Max, a large MoE LLM pretrained on massive data and post-trained with curated SFT and RLHF recipes. It achieves competitive… pic.twitter.com/oHVl16vfje — Qwen (@Alibaba_Qwen) January 28, 2025 The Chinese tech company announced on Monday that the new AI model, Qwen2.5-VL, could perform a number of text and image analysis tasks. The firm also said Qwen2.5 was similar to the model powering OpenAI’s recently launched Operator. The AI model can understand videos, parse files, and count objects in images, as well as control a PC. According to benchmarking tests conducted by the Qwen team, the Qwen2.5-VL model outperforms OpenAI’s GPT-40, Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 sonnet, and Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash. The new AI model could beat its rivals in video understanding, math, document analysis, and question-answer evaluations. Alibaba confirmed that the Qwen2.5-VL was available for testing in its Qwen Chat app and for downloading from the AI dev platform Hugging Face. The Qwen team said that the AI model can analyze charts and graphics, extract data from scans of invoices and forms, and “comprehend” multiple-hour-long videos. The AI model can also recognize IPs from films and TV series, as well as a wide variety of products. The Qwen team disclosed that the model had certain restrictions on topics it could discuss in Qwen Chat due to the fact that the AI was developed by a Chinese company. According to the team, China’s internet regulator gauges many models developed in the country to ensure their responses “embody core socialist values.” Several Chinese AI companies, like Ernie , also deflect responses to topics that might raise the ire of regulators or that might be deemed too sensitive. Qwen’s team reveals Qwen2.5-VL’s capabilities Qwen2.5-VL’s dev team revealed that one of the AI model’s interesting features is its ability to interact with software, both on PCs and mobile devices. Philipp Schmid, a technical lead at Hugging Face, showed the AI model launching the Booking.com app for Android and booking a flight from Chongqing to Beijing. “Despite all the DeepSeek Hype, Qwenn just dropped the best open Multimodal! Qwen 2.5 VL is a Vision Language Model that can control your computer, similar to the OpenAI operator, extract structured information from charts, and more!!” – Philipp Schmid , Tech Lead at Hugging Face Vaibhav Srivastav, data scientist at Hugging Face, showed how the Qwen2.5-VL model controls apps on a Linux desktop but couldn’t accomplish much beyond switching tabs. The demonstration aligned with Qwen’s benchmarking, which showed Qwen2.5-VL scored poorly on OSWorld, a benchmark that tries to mimic a real computer environment. The Chinese AI tech company also revealed that the two smaller, less sophisticated models in the Qwen2.5VL series, Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, were available under permissive licenses. The flagship Qwen2.5-VL-7B will still be under Alibaba’s custom license, which requires that firms and devs with more than 100 million monthly active users request permission from Qwen or Alibaba before deploying the AI model commercially.

According to the announcement , this new listing increases the variety of stablecoins available on the exchange, which already offers popular options like USDT. With RLUSD included, Margex users can now enjoy a wider selection of stablecoins, making it easier to trade reliably and efficiently. Margex Added Several Features to its Platform RLUSD, a stablecoin backed by the U.S. dollar, provides stability and security, helping traders manage the cryptocurrency market’s ups and downs. As more people look for trustworthy digital assets, adding RLUSD is an important step for Margex to stay competitive in the fast-changing crypto market. Furthermore, Margex has added new features to its platform, including advanced charting tools from TradingView. These tools are popular with traders because they provide detailed technical analysis. As such, Margex users can accurately make better trading decisions with the improved charting features. Additionally, Margex supports Dogecoin (DOGE) for instant deposits and withdrawals. This adds to the platform’s range of assets, including other digital currencies like Kaspa (KAS) and TON. Dogecoin’s fast transaction speeds allow users to enjoy more flexible and seamless transactions. Looking ahead, Margex also plans to unveil an ultra-modern wallet designed to offer users enhanced control over their digital assets. Undoubtedly, Margex is becoming a user-friendly exchange focused on meeting the needs of its customers. RLUSD Becomes Fourth Most-traded Stablecoin Recently, RLUSD scored a 2000% surge in trading volume , as outlined on CoinMarketCap. It is worth noting that the surge happened less than three weeks after the official launch of the stablecoin. As of the time of the report, the trading volume metric was at $612.85 million , underscoring the receptive nature of crypto investors and traders towards the stablecoin. With such figures, RLUSD is the fourth most-traded stablecoin product. Though the trading volume speaks for itself, many netizens are doubting the accuracy of this data, judging by the short time between its launch and the data release. RLUSD Gains Momentum With Major Exchange Listing Interestingly, Ripple Lab’s newly launched stablecoin is steadily making waves in the crypto world. With its recent adoption by prominent exchanges like Bitstamp and Bullish, Ripple’s President Monica Long envisions a broader expansion. In a recent interview, Long confidently hints that Coinbase could join the roster. If this happens, it could mark another significant milestone in RLUSD’s journey toward global adoption. RLUSD offers on and off-ramps, allowing users to move funds between traditional and digital currencies. Monica Long also said RLUSD would be supported by XRP, which does not rely on other parties. This makes the asset more stable and easier to use.

These top altcoins, once the undisputed kings of meme coins, are now faced with a new and addictively fun meme token: Panshibi ($SHIBI) . The rapid adoption of $SHIBI by the OG meme traders alongside its exclusive Asian-panda charm is draining market capital from SHIB and DOGE as traders anticipate a potential 120X price surge. This news in the crypto world has everyone, especially dogecoin holders talking because of several key factors. Let us delve into them below Shiba Inu Loses Lead Developer; Are Whales Next? On January 27, Shiba Inu news outlets reported that lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has stepped away from his visionary role at Shiba Inu to take on the position of lead ambassador. Shiba Inu’s new lead ambassador will now work to build crypto alliances while creating a smooth transition process towards decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). SHIB, the second-largest meme coin by market capitalization, saw a period of volatility as prices plunged 11.7% within a 48-hour period to eventually close trading at $0.0000189 on January 27. This volatility has sparked a migration of capital to Panshibi, where investors see clearer upside. “Shiba Inu’s long-term potential remains, but the smart money is diversifying into presale gems like $SHIBI,” notes a crypto analyst. It’s not all gloomy though, as top Shiba Inu news outlets report that its ecosystem tokens Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) and TREATS have demonstrated modest growth indicating that investors are showing greater confidence in the project. Top Shiba Inu analysts and even the Shib Army have admitted that SHIB has a future as a crypto with sustainable and practical use cases beyond meme coin status. Analyst’s Ponder Can Dogecoin reach $1 Investors have long yearned for Dogecoin to reach $1 even though doubts about its ability to do so persist. To reach $1, DOGE needs a 199% price increase from the current $0.334 value which could raise Dogecoin’s market capitalization to nearly $148 billion just behind Ethereum’s current market valuation. While Elon Musk has often endorsed Dogecoin, including plans to integrate DOGE payments into X (formerly Twitter), critics highlight DOGE’s unlimited supply- 5.3 billion new DOGE minted annually, as a structural barrier to sustained price growth. Analysts like CoinCodex project a $1 target by 2030 if adoption accelerates, but dogecoin technical analysts note resistance at $0.47–$0.50 must break first. While a community-inspired rally or Musk-driven catalyst could spark short-term spikes for dogecoin, most experts argue $1 remains a moonshot without radical utility shifts or supply burns. As crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tweeted, “DOGE needs more than memes to escape gravity.” Panshibi is Q1 2025’s Hottest Crypto Play: Join The $SHIBI Presale! “This isn’t just a token—it’s a cultural phenomenon,” declares a Panshibi dev. “We’re building a legacy, not a pump-and-dump.” The core feature attracting people to Panshibi is its super fun culture and anti-dump tokenomics system. A comprehensive audit of Panshibi smart contracts has shown high security. Additionally, 60% of $SHIBI’s 2 billion total supply has been allocated to the ongoing 60-day token presale. $SHIBI’s current $0.002 token price during Stage 1 is a steal for smart investors looking to rapidly grow their portfolio. Users who join during the early adopter phase receive access to Bamboo Private VIP Club while earning impressive 1,200% APY rewards to enhance long-term token retention. The presale’s momentum is undeniable. Stage 1 of $SHIBI token presale has reached 56% completion within just 4 days. With 56 days left to go, analysts predict a 1200% price rally following the conclusion of the presale. Don’t Miss $SHIBI Presale- 120X Window Closes Soon! While Shiba Inu news outlets dissect whale movements and Dogecoin loyalists cling to Elon Musk’s occasional tweets, Panshibi has emerged with a game-changing approach: blending meme-worthy fun with real-world utility. The $SHIBI presale guarantees you’re an early participant in the Panshibi ecosystem with benefits like exclusive access to Bamboo Private VIP Members Club. Eager investors have already bought out 56% of this stage’s allocation, raising a total of $113,710 during this first round of $SHIBI presale so far. Time remains a critical factor for investors who are seeking potential 120X returns on their investments. The meme coin throne is up for grabs—you have 56 Days to back the new heir!!!

This shows Ondo’s aim to deliver high-quality, transparent financial products for non-US investors. Conclusion While ENA, ONDO, and JASMY show promise but offer less short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone.

However, another promising contender, FXGuys ($FXG), is grabbing investors’ attention with its potential to turn $100 into $10,000. Experts agree that FXGuys has the potential to turn $100 into $10,000 and have chosen the token as the best crypto to invest in now. But investors are asking why they should pick $FXG and not PEPE or SUI. Read on to learn why! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Increased On-Chain Activities Sparks a PEPE Token Bull Run Data from Coinglass shows that PEPE’s Futures Open Interest (USD) recently crossed $555 million. This growth in open interest sent the PEPE token into a positive price action. PEPE ended December 2024, priced at $0.000021, after rising 5% from $0.000020 on December 1, 2024. However, the PEPE token price dropped 9.52% to $0.000019 in just 24 hours into January 2025. PEPE’s value decline continued as the token lost another 15.79% to reach $0.000016 on January 21, 2025. However, experts predict PEPE’s price could rebound and cross $ 0.000072 in the following months. Despite PEPE’s future price prediction, $FXG has huge potential to turn $100 into $10,000. It’s why analysts regard the $FXG as the best crypto coin to buy now . A Rising Open Interest Drives the SUI Price Surge, But Is It the Best Crypto Coin to Buy Now? Another token that saw modest growth due to increased on-chain activities is SUI. Data from Coinglass shows that SUI’s Futures Open Interest (USD) recently reached $1.56 billion. This growth is supported by a SUI price surge and positive market sentiment. SUI jumped 44.61% from $3.34 to $4.83 just 14 days into December 2024. By December 31, 2024, SUI dropped by 16.36% to hit $4.04. However, SUI recovered by 18.56% to $4.79 just 21 days into January 2025. After the modest growth, experts predict a higher SUI price surge in the next few months. Some forecast that the price of SUI could cross $6.65 as the year progresses. However, despite experts’ predictions for PEPE and SUI, investors looking to turn $100 into $10,000 are shifting focus to $FXG for maximum gains, which is hailed as the best crypto coin to buy now.

Those who invest now can earn up to 150% in returns by the time $FXG launches on major exchanges at $0.10.

Pendle and ListaDAO offer access to passive income from the program, even for external users with no Binance profile. Binance Launchpool is one of the long-running passive income incentive programs, tied to BNB users with a Binance Web3 wallet. The program connects token holders with new projects, not yet launched on the Binance platform. The Launchpool has worked as a pre-listing mechanism and even as marketing for tokens coming soon to a full Binance listing and has included multiple prominent assets. Usually, the Launchpool also works as a distribution mechanism for a share of each project’s tokens. Owners of BNB and other eligible assets could choose to lock their tokens for a predetermined period in each campaign to earn additional token airdrops. ListaDAO extended the Launchpool rewards through its two assets, slisBNB and clisBNB, which have been in circulation for the last few months. LisaDAO has partnered with Pendle, a tokenized yield trading platform, to carry its own version of clisBNB and offer passive income through exposure to BNB staking and BNB Launchpool locking. Pendle and ListaDAO to offer more agile tools for BNB passive income The decentralized protocols Pendle and ListaDAO offer their own wrapped versions of BNB, which can be eligible for rewards similar to locking tokens through the Lauchpool reward program. For the first time in 2025, Pendle will also distribute the wrapped versions of clisBNB and slisBNB, with its own possibilities for locking and staking. Gaining exposure to Binance Launchpool events is now as easy as just HOLDING Pendle's clisBNB in ANY wallet. YT-clisBNB and the SY portion of Pendle LP will earn: 🔹Launchpool APY – claimable in BNB 🔹BNB Staking APY – claimable in slisBNB pic.twitter.com/a2K6TmHRsx — Pendle (@pendle_fi) January 27, 2025 Pendle will carry clisBNB, a new form of the wrapped token issued by ListaDAO. The token combines two forms of passive income for BNB Smart Chain users. The new tokens on Pendle will have two forms of yield – YT-clisBNB, with Launchpool rewards and BNB staking rewards, and PT-clisBNB, with a fixed stable yield of 45.21% annualized, paying out 1 BNB at maturity and trading at a discount. Once again, owners can choose the type of asset and pool for their preferred form of yield. Binance Launchpools remains riskier since the potential value of new tokens remains uncertain, even after a free airdrop. ListaDAO offers clisBNB as an asset on BNB Smart Chain and will distribute the token through Pendle’s services. Staking the token will grant the same yield as staked BNB, in addition to BNB Launchpool rewards. Currently, participation in the Launchpool requires the holding of Lista-staked BNB (slisBNB) through the Binance Web3 wallet. Pendle and ListaDAO simplify the process by granting the same rewards for holders of clisBNB held in any wallet. The two tokens, clisBNB and slisBNB, will remain the only on-chain possibilities for tapping Binance Launchpool rewards but will have different entry points for Pendle users. Within ListaDAO and Pendle, the asset can be further locked in two forms to choose which type of yield to receive. As of January 2025, slisBNB has a supply of 576,748.51 tokens, trading at $681.68, tracking the price of the underlying BNB token. For now, Pendle has not given a projected supply for its version of clisBNB, instead relying on upcoming demand. Pendle locks in $5.31B in total value, producing $28.72M in annualized fees from its activity with yield derivatives tools. What is slisBNB and clisBNB The two tokens are derivatives of BNB Coin, created through different on-chain actions. The slisBNB asset stands for Liquidity Staked BNB. The creation of clisBNB hinges on collateralized BNB. Both assets are used to participate in campaigns in the BNB Smart Chain ecosystem. The tokens can give different forms of access to Binance launchpool campaigns, TrustWallet launchpools, Megadrop events, airdrop points for specific projects, and similar use cases. The two tokens add another tool to stake BNB, producing new tools for liquidity in the decentralized Binance ecosystem. ListaDAO aims to fill the gap of lending protocols in the BNB Smart Chain ecosystem. The platform’s initial goal was to mint stablecoins, but it ended up developing clisBNB and slisBNB as new liquidity, staking and reward-bearing tools.

These new contracts will be the first cryptocurrency options from CME Group to be financially settled, with expirations available each business day, Monday through Friday. Financially-settled options, also known as cash-settled options, are derivatives contracts where the settlement at expiration does not involve the physical delivery of the underlying asset. Instead, the profit or loss from the option is calculated based on the difference between the option's strike price and the market price of the underlying asset at the time of expiration, and this amount is then paid in cash. ""We are pleased to offer these new options that provide traders with even greater precision to manage short-term bitcoin price risk,"" said Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group’s Global Head of Cryptocurrency Products. ""Building on the success of our Bitcoin Friday futures, the smaller size of these contracts, along with daily expiries, offer market participants a capital-efficient toolset to effectively adjust their bitcoin exposure."" CME Group said these financially-settled options will enhance its lineup of other cryptocurrency derivatives, which already includes physically-settled options on Bitcoin and Micro Bitcoin futures. ""Given the increasing density of tradable catalysts in crypto, CME Group's new option suite on Bitcoin Friday futures provides the granularity that market participants need for hedging and expressing nuanced views on Bitcoin,"" said Joshua Lim, Global Co-head of Markets at FalconX. Since their launch on September 29, Bitcoin Friday futures have become CME Group's most successful cryptocurrency product, with over 775,000 contracts traded and an average daily volume of 9,700 contracts.

Table of Contents Catzilla unleashed: The meme coin for crypto warriors Dogecoin: From meme to mainstream attention Conclusion With the current bull run invigorating the crypto market, enthusiasts are eagerly monitoring Dogecoin’s potential rise. However, attention is shifting towards a fresh contender that promises substantial returns. This emerging crypto claims to offer gains surpassing 15,000%. As investors watch closely, the race to $1 becomes more competitive, raising curiosity about which digital coin will reach this milestone first. You might also like: SUI, ADA stall while CATZILLA gains traction with Solana whales Catzilla unleashed: The meme coin for crypto warriors Forget everything people say about meme coins — Catzilla has arrived, and it’s here to shake up the battlefield. A ferocious fusion of feline chaos and crypto power, this legendary cat warrior is on a mission to dominate the market. 14 stages. Limitless gains. No second chances Catzilla’s presale isn’t just a launch — it’s a movement. Spanning 14 adrenaline-charged stages, early believers can multiply their holdings by up to 700% before the token even goes public. With every stage, the stakes rise, and so do the potential rewards. But beware: the clock is ticking. Only the fastest and fiercest investors will claim their share before Catzilla stomps its way to the top. The rise of meow money: Why cats are the new kings of crypto For years, the crypto space has been dominated by dog-themed tokens. But now? The cats are clawing their way to the throne. MEW: This feline sensation clawed into the top 15 meme coins with a stunning 103.7% surge in just three months. Popcat: More than just a viral meme — it skyrocketed by 157.44%, proving that cats aren’t just cute; they’re unstoppable. These aren’t just flukes. The era of meme coin dominance is shifting, and if MEW and Popcat were just the beginning, Catzilla is the endgame. Forget chasing DOGE’s tail — this is where the real action is. The mission: Crush the old rules. Build the future. Catzilla isn’t just another coin — it’s a movement. It’s here to wreck the outdated systems, break through barriers, and hand the power back to the warriors of crypto. Each presale stage fuels the unstoppable rise, bringing higher rewards, bigger wins, and a shot at life-changing gains. But this window of opportunity won’t stay open forever. The battle is on, and only those who act fast will ride the wave of destruction straight to the top. Dogecoin: From meme to mainstream attention Dogecoin (DOGE) emerged in 2013 as a lighthearted take on cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu meme as its logo. It was crafted to be abundant, setting itself apart from Bitcoin by having no supply limit and consistently producing 10,000 coins per minute. Initially seen as a “meme coin,” Dogecoin captured significant attention in 2021. Social media influence, especially from Elon Musk, and a wider crypto surge helped push its market value beyond $50 billion, ranking it among the top ten cryptocurrencies. Though it began as a jest by creators Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, Dogecoin has underlined how community support and social media can sway financial markets, though individual assessments on its current appeal may vary. Conclusion Coins like DOGE have less short-term potential. Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero, aiming to bring financial freedom to all. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale, starting at $0.0002 and rising to $0.0016 over 14 stages, it has triple utility: governance, incentives, and staking.

Analyst Talks About the Four-Year Cycle and Donald Trump,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoins-big-bear-in-2026-analyst-talks-about-the-four-year-cycle-and-donald-trump/,"Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan believes that President Donald Trump’s latest crypto executive order could challenge the long-standing four-year market cycle in the crypto space. Hougan wrote in a client note today that if historical trends continue, 2025 will be a strong year for crypto. “We forecast the BTC price to double to over $200,000 this year, driven by flows into ETFs and Bitcoin purchases by corporations and governments. This is conservative,” he wrote. Despite his optimism, Hougan also noted potential overheating in the market. An increasing number of companies are raising capital and taking on debt to buy Bitcoin, while lending programs allow investors to leverage their BTC holdings without selling them. In addition, the proliferation of derivatives contracts and leveraged exchange-traded funds suggests increased speculation in the sector. Typically, these trends would reinforce the classic four-year cycle, Hougan noted. But Trump’s executive order establishing a task force to investigate a strategic digital asset reserve presents an overwhelming bullish case that could upend the pattern. “The launch of ETFs was a big deal, bringing hundreds of billions of dollars from new investors into the crypto ecosystem,” Hougan said. “But I believe the full-scale adoption of crypto, envisioned in Trump’s executive order, where banks hold crypto alongside other assets, stablecoins are broadly integrated into the global payments ecosystem, and the largest institutions have positions in crypto, will bring in trillions.” Related News: The First FED Interest Rate Decision of 2025 is Expected in Bitcoin Today! What Time Will It Be Announced? Here Are the Expectations and Everything You Need to Know! Historically, Bitcoin follows a well-defined four-year cycle, with three years of significant gains followed by a sharp decline of 58% to 74% in the fourth year. By this logic, 2025 will also be a strong year, but a correction could occur in the market in 2026. “The four-year crypto cycle mirrors traditional economic booms and busts, amplified by catalysts like the 2011 exchange launch, the 2014 collapse of Mt. Gox, and the SEC’s 2018 ICO crackdown,” Hougan said. While some analysts attribute the cycle to Bitcoin’s quadrennial halving, Hougan argues that investor psychology and speculation play a larger role. According to Hougan, the current bull run was catalyzed by the collapse of firms like FTX, Three Arrows Capital, and Celsius in 2022. It was officially ignited in March 2023 when Grayscale won a key legal defense against the SEC, paving the way for spot Bitcoin ETFs to be approved in January 2024. Institutional participation has since pushed Bitcoin from $22,000 to over $100,000 in a year, ushering in what Hougan calls a “mainstream era” in crypto. While Trump’s executive order and changing political dynamics are bullish for crypto, Hougan warns that it could take years for the full impact to sink in. This raises a crucial question: If the next major rally doesn’t peak until 2026, does that mean another “crypto winter” is inevitable? “If BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is calling for $700,000 Bitcoin, are we really going to see a 70% pullback?” Hougan questioned. While he believes the four-year cycle is not completely invalid, he predicts future corrections will be less severe as the market matures. *This is not investment advice.

The news got buried in part due to Trump’s inauguration and subsequent rumblings of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), but developer b10c recently published research showing that F2Pool — a mining pool representing ~11% of hash power on the Bitcoin network — is censoring OFAC-sanctioned transactions… again . In case you don’t know what this means: the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) maintains a list of sanctioned entities, including a number of Bitcoin addresses; it’s illegal to do business with these entities under US law. It’s actually unclear if this means miners cannot include transactions to and from these addresses in blocks they produce — but F2Pool appears to be rather safe than sorry. Now, as long as it’s just F2Pool applying this policy, this is not really an issue. Some transactions will be delayed by about ten minutes or so, once in a while, but that’s about it. If more pools start doing it, the delays will get longer and more frequent — but still not terrible. Not even if it’s a majority of pools. The real issue will arise if a majority of mining pools not only censors transactions, but also refuses to build on top of blocks that do include these transactions. If this were to happen, these transactions wouldn’t confirm at all anymore… not for as long as these mining pools remain a majority. Bitcoin would no longer be censorship-resistant. I can’t really fault F2Pool for adopting their policy. Although I would much prefer it if no mining pools censor, we unfortunately live in a world where even open source software developers may face prison time for enabling users to transact freely. Rather than flirting with an SBR, it would be great if the new Trump administration first just stopped such state attacks on Bitcoin. This article is a Take .

The recent decline comes as investors await the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) decision on interest rate cuts, heightening caution across the board. Despite the dip, Solana has showcased notable potential, with its native token, SOL, recently surging to a record high of $295, fueled by meme coin mania linked to Donald and Melania Trump. Solana seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At press time, Solana is trading at $228, marking a daily loss of over 3%. On the weekly chart, the cryptocurrency has shed 11% of its value. This uncertainty has propelled Solana into the spotlight of cryptocurrency discussions, with analysts closely monitoring its next moves. ChatGPT sets Solana price for Q1 2025 To assess Solana’s future potential, Finbold analyzed market data and sought insights from OpenAI’s advanced ChatGPT-4o model, which outlined both bullish and bearish scenarios for the token. The bullish projection points to a potential rally toward $280, influenced by macroeconomic improvements, ecosystem expansion, and recovering market sentiment. Conversely, the bearish scenario highlights risks tied to declining network activity and broader market pressures, which could weigh on Solana’s performance and push its price down to $200. Bullish scenario: SOL surges to $280 ChatGPT noted that a combination of favorable macroeconomic developments and ecosystem expansion could influence Solana’s near-term trajectory. The potential approval of spot Solana exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) could act as a catalyst, attracting significant institutional interest and liquidity. The ETFs, filed by major players such as Bitwise, VanEck, and 21Shares through the Cboe BZX Exchange, would position Solana alongside Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) as a key investment option in traditional markets. Solana Derivatives data. Source: CoinGlass Derivative market data also signals growing optimism. Solana’s options market has seen a 24.62% increase in volume and a 1.62% rise in open interest, indicating increased speculative activity. Higher long/short ratios on major exchanges like Binance and OKX, at 3.9068 and 4.09, respectively, further reflect confidence in Solana’s recovery. If these trends persist, combined with a broader market recovery, the AI model notes that Solana could rally to $280 by the end of Q1 2025. ChatGPT outlook on Solana. Source: ChatGPT/Finbold Bearish scenario: SOL drops to $200 However, ChatGPT also identified potential risks that could limit Solana’s growth. Prolonged market uncertainty, particularly if the FOMC decision results in unfavorable economic conditions, could weigh heavily on cryptocurrency sentiment. The AI further pointed to declining on-chain activity and a drop in Total Value Locked (TVL) as indicators of waning user interest. In less than a week, Solana’s TVL fell by 6.3%, from $12.12 billion on January 24 to $11 billion, with major protocols like Jito and Raydium contributing to the decline. Moreover, daily transactions on the network declined sharply , dropping to 62,945 as of January 28 from 71,738 on January 23, reflecting reduced user engagement and network activity. Derivative data adds to the cautious outlook, with Solana’s trading volume plunging by 25.57% to $9.36 billion and open interest in futures declining by 3.15%. Additionally, $12.12 million in liquidations over the last 24 hours, primarily from long positions, further indicates caution among traders. These factors, coupled with macroeconomic headwinds, could see SOL struggle to maintain its value, potentially dropping to $200 by the end of Q1 2025. That being said, Solana’s price trajectory remains uncertain, with its fate hinging on key developments in the coming months. Investors and analysts will closely monitor the interplay between regulatory decisions and market trends as Q1 progresses.

This article will discuss six cryptocurrencies priced under $1 that are likely to expand tremendously in the upcoming bull run. Among them is Rexas Finance (RXS), a fledgling token redefining real-world asset (RWA) tokenizing tool. These assets offer the ideal chance for anyone wishing to create a portfolio valued at $10,000 or more with low starting capital. Rexas Finance (RXS): Redefining Real-World Asset Tokenizing. Designed on the blockchain, Rexas Finance is a groundbreaking tool for tokenizing real-world assets, including real estate, commodities, and collectibles. At $0.175 in Stage 11 of its presale, RXS is a reasonably priced entrance point with great room for expansion. The presale shows great investor confidence, with 98.02% of its current stage sold, raising $39,526,129. The price will increase to $0.20 in the next stage, confirming its value trend. Rexas Finance distinguishes itself by emphasizing democratizing access to typically illiquid and high-value assets. By permitting fractional ownership and using blockchain technology, Rexas is opening doors for ordinary investors to engage in markets long reserved for institutional players. The project’s CertiK audit strengthens its reputation by assuring the platform’s dependability and security. Its appearance on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap (CMC) also gives a worldwide audience more access. Additionally, holding a $1 million giveaway campaign, Rexas Finance gives 20 lucky winners RXS tokens valued at $50,000 apiece. RXS is a must-watch coin for 2025 since this project promotes community development and incentivizes involvement. VeChain (VET) Transformational Supply Chain Management Established blockchain tool VeChain (VET) addresses inefficiencies in worldwide supply networks at just $0.04494. Already embraced by big companies all over, VeChain is based on open and safe tracking of products. VeChain’s dual-token systems (VET and VTHO) guarantee scalability and utility. As companies use blockchain for supply chain optimization and logistics, VeChain’s acceptance will probably hasten, increasing its value. VeChain is a good candidate priced reasonably at around $1 for investors wishing to include an established project in their portfolio. Arbitrum (ARB), spearheading the Layer-2 Ethereum Revolution One of Ethereum’s most exciting Layer-2 scaling options, Arbitrum ($0.7385), allows faster and more affordable transactions, addressing Ethereum’s well-known problems with high transaction fees and poor processing times. Arbitrum has become rather popular in decentralized finance (DeFi), with developers and initiatives actively expanding on its platform. Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum are expected to become more important as Ethereum continues expanding following the merger. Given that ARB is far below $1, this token can achieve long-term and short-term profits. Algorand (ALGO): Scalable Sustainability Blockchain Algorand, a blockchain system at $0.3709, provides sustainability, scalability, and security priority. With low energy use guaranteed by their Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism, one of the most ecologically friendly blockchains is Algorand is rising in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and government-backed digital money projects. Its alliances with governments and institutions further demonstrate its possibilities. At around $0.50, ALGO is a reasonably priced choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolios with environmentally friendly initiatives. Bonk (BONK): A Meme Coin Increasingly Useful Costing $0.00002741, Bonk (BONK) is another fascinating addition to this list. Originally becoming well-known as a meme currency, Bonk has developed to incorporate NFT partnerships and decentralized finance (DeFi) tools as actual usefulness. Its energetic community and widespread appeal make it a fascinating but speculative choice. Since meme coins have historically shown tremendous expansion during bull runs, Bonk presents the possibility of large gains at a shockingly low entrance price. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): Where Memes and NFTs Intersect Trading at $0.03266, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) are tokens supporting an ecosystem of NFTs, collectibles, and community-driven projects. Pudgy Penguins is unique in the packed crypto and NFT sectors thanks to its excellent branding and involved community. PENGU’s unique position as a hybrid meme and NFT token gives it great development potential as NFTs gain popularity. Given its low pricing, investors wishing to investigate the intersection of NFTs and cryptocurrencies will find it an easily available choice. Conclusion Particularly with careful choice of undervalued assets, the beauty of cryptocurrencies is their capacity to turn modest investments into great wealth. While VeChain, Arbitrum, Algorand, Bonk, and Pudgy Penguins offer varied exposure to many high-potential sectors, Rexas Finance (RXS) leads the charge as a revolutionary platform for real-world asset tokenization. These six tokens provide a great basis for investors wishing to turn pocket change into a $10,000 portfolio during the next crypto bull run. Staying educated and making good investments will help you to take advantage of their future expansion in 2025 and beyond.

As CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, the Wall Street firm that acts as the U.S. banker for leading global stablecoin issuer Tether, the Massachusetts Democrat said Lutnick backed a crypto operation with ""clear ties to criminal activity."" ""You played a critical role in the rise of Tether, a shadowy crypto firm with profits exceeding $7.7 billion in 2024,"" Warren wrote in a letter to Lutnick , who is making his case Wednesday to the Senate Commerce Committee that's considering his confirmation to Trump's cabinet. As Tether's U.S. Treasuries dealer and the main custodian of its Treasury reserves, she suggested Lutnick's firm shares responsibility for illicit abuse of its stablecoin ( USDT ) by criminals and terrorists. She also contended that Cantor Fitzgerald owns part of Tether, though Lutnick testified on Wednesday that the firm has a convertible bond but not a direct equity stake. ""The use of Tether’s stablecoin has been the subject of over 150 investigations across four continents, including here with the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury,"" Warren wrote to Lutnick, who led Trump's transition team as he returned to the White House.

One of the most trending meme coins attracting significant attention from traders and investors is FLOKI (FLOKI). However, with the rise of a new trend in town—AI cryptocurrencies—Ozak AI is emerging as a strong contender. As whales shift their focus to AI tokens, could Ozak AI surge by an impressive 5000% in 2025? Let’s dive into FLOKI’s current position and explore Ozak A I’s potential as a rising player in the market. FLOKI (FLOKI) Price Prediction Another meme coin, FLOKI, launched in September 2021, alongside Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. So far, the FLOKI trading price sits at $0.0001198 with market capitalization set at $1.8B and ranked as the 77th on CoinMarketCap. Despite facing strong resistance levels, its optimistic price target for 2025 is set at $0.00080303. Ozak AI – The New Star in AI Tokens Although the prospects of FLOKI are unclear, Ozak AI represents a new exciting cryptocurrency on the horizon. It presents an advanced platform that fuses artificial intelligence with blockchain in the provision of predictive analytics to be used for making decisions in finance, and that is very interesting for an investor who wishes to minimize risk while maximizing return. The native $OZ token is trading at $0.003 in its presale phase 3; however, its presale was quite impressive, surpassing more than $600K. Even though the price of the $OZ token is set to rise above $0.05, its listing price, this marks a gain of over 4,900% from its initial price of $0.001, offering huge potential to investors. Additionally, crypto experts predict that Ozak AI’s price could rise even higher, potentially reaching $1 in 2025, surpassing its listing price. Considering the potential growth of the AI sector, Ozak AI has predictive analytics tools that investors are increasingly depending on to reduce risk and enhance returns. This growing popularity and increasing demand for AI technology attract whales who see this long-term investing opportunity. Conclusion: Future of AI Tokens and FLOKI Ozak AI is a new development in the cryptocurrency market, representing AI tokens. FLOKI is going to see some price fluctuations, but Ozak AI is gaining momentum very fast, and predictions are on to increase by 5000% by 2025. Therefore, those investors who seek growth and diversification in the crypto space should add AI-driven tokens like Ozak AI to their portfolio.

The small percentage of addresses that made a loss suggests that only a fraction of Bitcoin holders bought at prices higher than the current market value. Alphractal points to the Active Supply (7-day) metric, which tracks the movement of newly acquired BTCs to gain deeper insight into market trends. Historically, spikes in this metric have correlated with price peaks or periods of high volatility, indicating strong investor and institutional activity in key price zones. In another notable market development, Alphractal noted that the Bitcoin futures market on Binance is trading at a record discount of -$55 compared to the spot market price.

A big shift in the core ethos of things. Regardless of what you think about politics in the wider world, Bitcoin itself as a network and protocol was something explicitly designed to function in a hostile environment, in an environment where politics and governments are actively antagonistic towards it. The core value proposition of Bitcoin itself is that, as a system, it can continue functioning despite such antagonism in a hostile environment. It can be a foundation for us to build upon, with everything built upon it inheriting that resilience to some degree in the face of a well equipped antagonist. It seems like faith in that core value proposition has almost completely evaporated in this ecosystem. Determination to build upon that foundation, and to protect its soundness at all costs, seems to have evaporated. In its place we now have cheerleading politicians, favor trading for selectively beneficial regulation, and prioritization of short term financial gain over the preservation of what makes Bitcoin valuable in the first place. People are less concerned with the creeping web of business relationships in the mining ecosystem, which is the bedrock of Bitcoin’s foundation of openness and censorship resistance, and more concerned with whether President Trump is going to just pump our bags, or pump the bags of shitcoiners too. We are counting our chickens before they hatched. Bitcoin has issues regarding mining centralization, and that part of the ecosystem’s vulnerability to regulatory attacks and mandates from governments that could put at risk the ability of people to openly use the network without fear of censorship. It has issues in terms of scalability, and the ability to support enough users using the network self-custodially to actually be a viable means of protests and opting out at a large enough scale to matter to governments. The custodians people otherwise will have to use are just as regulatorily vulnerable as miners are becoming. It also has a serious privacy issue, which opens users themselves to regulatory pressure forcing them into self censorship. Bitcoin has all of these problems, and rather than focusing on solving them so that Bitcoin can remain the resilient system that made it valuable in the first place , people are more concerned with currying political favor with the current US Presidential Administration for token policy wins and short term financial gain at the cost of major concessions that very well could seriously damage Bitcoin’s foundation.

Get in now, watch Catzilla wreck the market, and bring chaos to the competition! Sui (SUI) Price Set to Soar Amid Market Speculations Sui’s price is in a promising position within its current $3.54 to $4.52 range. The coin is gaining attention with a notable 435% increase over the past 6 months. Although there has been a recent downturn of 20% in the past week, its potential for growth remains strong. The nearest resistance sits at $5.16, with further potential to challenge $6.14. With the Relative Strength Index slightly below neutral and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence just under zero, there’s room for further bullish sentiment. Breaking $5.16 could mean a gain of nearly 14%, while reaching $6.14 might offer a rewarding climb of about 36%. Sui’s path appears promising. Toncoin Eyes Breakout: Could Surge Over 20% Toncoin currently trades between $4.65 and $5.29. It’s been on a downward trend, with price dips of nearly 7% in the past week and over 14% in a month. Yet, the current range clings above crucial support at $4.36. If upward momentum builds, the nearest resistance sits at $5.65. A clear break could target the next resistance at $6.29, presenting a potential rise of roughly 20% from current levels. The relative strength index suggests it’s not oversold, hinting at room for recovery. The 10-day moving average is slightly below its 100-day counterpart, indicating a potential shift. Keep a lookout for positive moves in this volatile phase. Stellar Awaits Breakout: Steady Gains or Pullback Ahead? Stellar (XLM) has been dancing around $0.38-$0.45 recently. It shows potential with its 1-month price increase of nearly 18%. The 6-month surge of 300% highlights its significant rebound. However, the current RSI at 46.13 suggests it’s no longer overbought, signaling a possible upward move. The nearest resistance stands strong at $0.50, with the next at $0.57, offering growth targets. If momentum slows, watch for support around $0.36, with a safeguard level at $0.29. While the MACD indicates mild bearish pressure, the simple moving averages suggest stability. Stellar seems poised to test resistance, making it an altcoin to watch for future rallies.

However, as the industry matures, seasoned investors are looking beyond meme-driven hype toward projects with stronger fundamentals and long-term growth potential.

Crypto sleuths suggest Lightchain AI could be the next profitable addition to portfolios for those holding PEPE or SHIB. Appeal of meme coins like PEPE and SHIB Pepe and Shiba Inu have built massive followings through social media-driven enthusiasm and meme culture. These tokens have been able to generate significant short-term gains thanks to their viral appeal and strong community support. However, meme coins often lack the utility and technological innovation needed for sustained growth, leaving them vulnerable to market downturns.

In a clip shared by crypto influencer Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie) on X, Hoskinson hinted at a direct connection with U.S. President Donald Trump. Amelie highlighted Hoskinson’s recent announcement of working with the U.S. government to guide cryptocurrency policies, suggesting that a potential collaboration between Cardano and Ripple could be on the horizon. WOW! CHARLES HOSKINSON, FOUNDER OF CARDANO IS IN DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH TRUMP! HE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED HE‘LL BE COLLABORATING WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON CRYPTO POLICIES! RUMORS ARE THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO WITNESS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN #XRP AND $ADA … pic.twitter.com/WAWB0qKpmi — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) January 26, 2025 Hoskinson’s Role in Shaping U.S. Crypto Policies Hoskinson’s involvement with U.S. government officials comes at a critical juncture for the industry, with policymakers working to establish clearer guidelines. Hoskinson’s engagement with influential figures like Trump suggests Cardano’s growing prominence in discussions around blockchain policy. Ripple, which has similarly established relationships with U.S. policymakers, stands to benefit indirectly from Hoskinson’s contributions. Earlier this year, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty met with Trump , further solidifying Ripple’s political connections. Ripple and Cardano’s Renewed Collaboration Hoskinson’s relationship with the XRP community, once strained, saw a turning point in late 2024. After years of disagreements, he reconciled with the community and expressed interest in Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin project. This shift opened the door for closer collaboration between Ripple and Cardano , sparking rumors of a potential partnership. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A collaboration between these two blockchain ecosystems could unlock new opportunities. Cardano’s smart contract infrastructure and XRP’s expertise in cross-border payments could lead to technological innovation and expanded use cases. Such a partnership would enhance the utility of both networks, creating a mutually beneficial ecosystem. Potential Market Impact on XRP and ADA The possibility of a partnership between Cardano and Ripple has fueled optimism among investors and analysts. XRP and ADA could experience significant price surges if their ecosystems integrate. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, which Hoskinson has shown interest in , could serve as a key element in strengthening the relationship between the two platforms. Donald Trump and his pro-crypto administration could open numerous doors for XRP and Cardano, and this potential partnership makes their combined offerings more attractive to institutional and retail users. Ripple’s executives already have a good relationship with Trump. Now that Hoskinson is connected to the president, these prominent crypto figures can advocate for sensible crypto regulation and help the market reach new heights under the current administration and beyond.

According to the recent press release, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain interest rates at their current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. This decision follows after the committee lowered rates three times consecutively last year. Fed Pauses Rate Cuts Despite Trump’s Call As expected, Federal Reserve officials decided not to change interest rates after their recent two-day meeting, the first under President Trump’s second term. They made this choice even though President Trump has been pushing them to lower the rates. At their December meeting, US Federal Reserve officials voted 11 to 1 to cut the main interest rate by 0.25% to a range of 4.25-4.50%, just as Wall Street predicted. This marked the Fed’s third consecutive rate cut in 2024 and followed another 0.25% cut in November. The committee led by US Fed Chair Jerome Powell now expects to make just one or two interest rate cuts in 2025. This decision comes after recent reports showed that consumer prices are still somewhat high in the United States. After increasing the policy rate by 5.25 percentage points since March 2022 to tackle the worst inflation in 40 years, the Fed has kept the rate steady since July 2023. This pause aims to stabilize high inflation and gradually reduce it to the target range of 2%. Crypto Market Remains Stable The crypto market stayed fairly stable because it had already expected the decision to keep interest rates unchanged. Fed Chair Jerome Powell previously mentioned that the committee isn’t rushing to lower the key benchmark interest rates and will proceed more cautiously with any rate cuts. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Bitcoin price made a minor decline in recent minutes. The BTC price dropped from the peak of $102.9K to the low of $101.7K. The crypto market’s attention will turn to the next FOMC meeting and comments from Powell on future rate cuts. Any unexpected developments or surprises will likely be the key drivers of Bitcoin’s price action. President Donald Trump is following through on his campaign pledge to remove illegal immigrants from the U.S., starting deportation flights over the weekend. Estimates suggest that the total number of deportations could be anywhere between one million and 10 million. Analysts believe that large-scale deportations could strengthen the labor market and lead to higher inflation Additionally, Trump has threatened to impose 25% import tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada starting as soon as Saturday. Most economists believe these actions are more likely to increase inflation rather than help to reduce it. Although the president does not have control over the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions, he and Fed Chair Jerome Powell have clashed over policy since Trump’s first term in office. Just last week, Trump stated that he would “demand an immediate drop in interest rates.”",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-29 19:18:20

It slowly reaches an exhaustion point but its bullish trajectory is still intact while is set for another buy. Following the yearly bullish start that saw the price to a new high after two weeks, XRP halted buying and initiated drops due to rejection. That drop led to a two-week pullback and the price tested a low of $2.66 on Monday. It sharply rejected this low with a bounce and closed with a small gain. Although volatility turned out low yesterday and the asset remained indecisive throughout the day. Buying volume appears low today but it currently shows signs of strength and looks prime for an increase despite the latest market bleeding. A rise in the daily volume should bring a notable increase. The newly marked high may pose a little threat before breaking out massively. Failure to break may result in suspense of the bullish move while subjecting briefly to a sideway move. Looking at the daily chart, XRP’s volume indicator is currently on the fall, indicating a potential divergence. If that happens, the crypto may lose momentum and turn bearish in no time. But for now, the bulls are taking charge. XRP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The $3.4 level is considered the next key resistance for a test. A break above it should rally the price to $4. The higher level to watch for an increase is $4.5. Holding Monday’s $2.66 low as support, a drop below it could cause a serious decrease to $2.2 and $1.9. If all these supports fail to hold, the next key level for a broad correction would be $1.

The price currently looks weak on the day as it broke down steadily from a five-month support line. Looking back, SUI’s performance has been highly impressive following an overwhelming gain in the past few months. Its overall structure is still considered bullish on the daily chart; But the trend has shifted briefly to the downside as it undergoes a major correction for the first time in five months. This correction came after increasing by over 10x to $5.36 – marked as the current all-time high. That led to a breakdown from a mid-term rising support line and is now looking bearish on the daily timeframe. Although the market is still in favour of the bulls in the long-term despite the latest price weakness. A drop below the holding $3.5 level could trigger a major drop capable of dipping the price to a low of $1. But from the look of things, the price is likely to retest the $4.3 level before advancing bearish correction. If SUI manages to stay above the mentioned support, it could resume swing high in no time. But as it stands, the bears are much more likely to resume pressure amid rising supply. SUI Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Breaking down the current holding level could bring more sell actions in the market. The potential level to consider for support is $2.973 and the $2.37 level. Right below it lies the key $2 level. For a retest, the $4 level is the closest resistance for the bulls. A push above this level could pave the way for more increase to the current all-time high of $5.36 before breaking to $7.

How to Buy To buy Trump Buys SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Buys SUI by entering its contract address (CA) – 7chY3Yw9cArR4CGQQ2N6mciszZvWB3rW6WoBNTfwyitu – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|SUI|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-29 19:24:00

Oppenheimer downgraded it from “outperform” to “perform” amidst weak sales. The reason behind this is that the tech giant is struggling to adapt to a competitive AI landscape. The brokerage has removed its $250 price goal because it sees weak iPhone sales in the next year to a year and a half. Oppenheimer’s concerns are a lack of innovation in AI and difficulties in the Chinese market. In fact, there was a 25% drop in iPhone shipments in China last quarter. Oppenheimer stated, “This resulted in a year-to-year market share decline from 19% to 15%.” The company added that Apple’s capacity to expand in the region will be restricted by competition from local Android manufacturers. The company also expressed doubt about Apple’s capacity to initiate an AI-driven upgrade cycle in the near future. It stated, “Given the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, lack of gen AI ‘killer apps’ for consumers, and rapid improvement of other gen AI models’ capabilities, we expect a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle leading into FY26.” Apple’s shares are expected to drop Oppenheimer reduced its profits per share estimate for the year 2026 by 4% to $7.95 – less than the average estimate of $8.23. The company now thinks Apple’s sales will be $438 billion in FY26, lower than the earlier prediction of $456 billion. The retail brokerage company explained that the primary reason for its estimate revisions is the reduction of iPhone sales estimates for FY25-26. The estimated growth in iPhone shipment growth for FY25 has been reduced from 5% to 2%. In addition, the growth outlook for FY26 remains at 2%. Analyst Martin Yang said that Apple is dealing with two main problems affecting iPhone sales: more competition in China and not enough interesting AI apps. Martin Yang has also raised concerns that Apple struggles to show how its software and services are different from its hardware. He bases this estimate on the delayed rollout of Apple Intelligence, the scarcity of consumer applications for generative AI, and the rapid improvement of other AI models’ capabilities. Meanwhile, today, shares of the tech giant remained low in early trading. They lost 1.5% of their value after Oppenheimer downgraded them. Apple (AAPL) Stock Price Performance | Source: Forbes However, most analysts still think Apple’s stock will do well. Out of 48 analysts, 32 suggest buying or strongly buying the stock. Apple’s stock is currently valued at 29.2 times its expected profits for the next year. It is much higher than its average of 20.4 times over the past 10 years. Oppenheimer argues there is little upside for Apple right now, making it hard to explain its high price. Apple is expected to report muted revenue growth – Here’s why For status, Apple and its competitors Samsung and Google have been relying on AI features to increase smartphone sales. When Apple released its latest iPhone, it didn’t have those features. Also, some AI services haven’t launched in certain areas yet. This means less revenue. According to reports, Apple had problems with its AI this month when news sources like the BBC reported that the company’s AI summary tool was creating wrong headlines. Apple later took away the tool from its operating system. Jane Hepburne Scott, investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, which owns shares in the tech giant said , “AI is the new technology innovation, the fact that Apple’s handsets are lagging behind on capabilities is a key reason why their competitive positioning has weakened and the company has lost market share.” In addition, the Chinese government is giving money to help people buy smartphones to boost spending in the country. However, these subsidies are only for budget to mid-range phones that cost less than $800. This means high-end iPhones are not included. Of course, iPhones will sell less. Moreover, Apple can’t add AI features to the iPhone 16 in China. The government requires companies to get permission before launching such products, which has led Apple to seek agreements with Chinese companies to launch its AI feature. That’s not all. Apple is having problems in a key smartphone market. Indonesia has banned the iPhone due to the country’s content rules. Apple suggested investing $1 billion in Indonesia’s manufacturing sector. However, the government said that amount is not enough to meet a rule that requires 40% of the material in devices to come from local sources.

As XRP attempts to move towards this target, a new DeFi coin still in its ICO phase, FXGuys ($FXG) , gears up for an explosive rally. This presale token aims to multiply investors’ profits 35-fold in 2025. Continue reading to find out more about $FXG and XRP! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Expert Forecasts Ripple’s XRP Will Rise to $4 Renowned crypto pundit Ali Martinez has shared a forecast of Ripple’s XRP future price, noting its potential to rise monumentally this cycle. Taking to X on January 19, 2025, Ali cited a pattern on the Ripple coin’s chart that could spur XRP to $4 soon. Ali’s chart pointed out a bullish flag, a pattern that often signals an impending rally. The upper layer of this flag is around $3.27, a resistance level the price has now broken out of. Breakouts as such set the tone for a subsequent rally, and with XRP flipping the previous resistance level into support, XRP’s trajectory has become more evident. Using a measured dimension of the flagpole, Ali projects a surge to $4, which may be imminent for XRP. With the current market conditions favoring a rally, hitting this price level in the short term is impossible. Over the week, Ripple’s XRP has risen 20.72% and is now trading at $3.10. New investors will realize a 29% gain when Ripple’s XRP hits $4.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. IntelMarkets is drawing attention from SHIB and SOL investors, with predictions of a 1,800% jump in 2025. Table of Contents The price of IntelMarkets surges 811% in ongoing crypto ICO event Shib Knight: The Shiba Inu price is going to pump hard Solana looks ready for a 20% price breakout, analyst suggests What gives IntelMarkets the competitive edge over Shiba Inu, Solana? The crypto market is all about locating the next token to explode, and it looks like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Solana (SOL) investors are setting their sights on a new name: IntelMarkets (INTL) . This presale star is now in phase nine and has already sold over 17m INTL tokens. In fact, early buyers of this altcoin are 811% richer, and this percentage is predicted to surge before the presale ends. In fact, some experts predict another 1,800% jump potentially coming in 2025. While market analysts like Shib Knight and Ali remain bullish for SHIB and SOL, investors turn to INTL as it could have higher upside potential than them thanks to its ties to the AI market.

Many investors see it as the best ICO this year. It has given early buyers an 811% return while raising over $7m. Certain projections indicate this number could reach $10m before this month ends. Interest in IntelMarkets is high since it aims to disrupt the crypto trading space. It will accomplish this by launching the very first AI-powered smart trading platform. On it, users will get access to self-learning trading robots that do not make the same mistakes twice, as well as AI-powered trade signals that will help traders identify high-probability opportunities. All these features could maximize trader profit while minimizing risk. The INTL native token will fuel this platform and its ecosystem. The IntelMarkets team announced that all INTL holders will get governance voting rights and various discounts. Therefore, countless traders are now rushing to buy this altcoin. INTL costs only $0.082, but this price will reach $0.091 after phase ten of the presale starts. After a Tier-1 crypto exchange like Uniswap lists it, INTL is expected to soar to $0.11 – a 34% return. Shib Knight: The Shiba Inu price is going to pump hard Shiba Inu is one of the best meme coins, but it has faced some turbulence recently. CoinMarketCap shows that its value fell from around $0.000022 to nearly $0.000018 in the past 30 days. In other words, the Shiba Inu price dropped over 15% in just a few short weeks. However, crypto analyst Shib Knight remains bullish for Shiba Inu. According to his X post, this meme coin is seeing a massive accumulation before it rises soon. He also said that the Shiba Inu crypto will pump hard soon. Although this Shiba Inu price prediction has excited some traders, many investors are still sidestepping it. This is because the Shiba Inu market cap sits at $10b, suggesting it needs a lot of new money to see a noteworthy pump. But, crypto coins like INTL will not face this issue. Solana looks ready for a 20% price breakout, analyst suggests Solana is another altcoin that has been seeing red price charts. On the one-week chart, the Solana price fell around 10%, as per CoinMarketCap. Its value sank from around $250 to nearly $230 during that time. Nevertheless, some market experts like Ali still have excited traders with their bullish Solana statements. For instance, Ali made an X post saying this altcoin looks primed for a 20% breakout. While this Solana price prediction is making waves, many investors are turning to INTL instead. Since its value has surged over 150% on the YTD chart, its highest upswings may have passed. Therefore, INTL is seen as a smarter choice among some traders. What gives IntelMarkets the competitive edge over Shiba Inu, Solana? Although Shiba Inu and Solana could see price rebounds soon, IntelMarkets is capturing the spotlight. This altcoin will have a smaller market cap than both these tokens, which means faster price growth. Additionally, IntelMarkets is strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the growth of the AI market. Since Statista predicts this market could be worth $826B by 2030, IntelMarket’s future looks bright. Due to all these factors, many experts foresee a potential 1,800% price jump for INTL in 2025.

A new crypto-friendly administration stands ready to create crypto clarity through new appointments at the SEC and the CFTC. New acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham has proposed an uncommon approach, namely the regulatory sandbox. A regulatory sandbox is a waiver of regulations but in a supervised environment. Projects can test innovative ideas outside rigid regulatory frameworks. Federal digital asset sandboxes may come sooner than you think, but current state sandbox models fall short in the digital assets context, with extremely limited scopes and durations. We propose a “Sustainable Sandbox” and develop Pham’s idea, along with similar proposals from SEC Commissioner Peirce, and various initiatives in states and the Federal Reserve . The Sustainable Sandbox will give regulators enough time and information to draft thoughtful and sensible rules governing digital assets. Without such a stopgap, the digital assets industry would end up in the same place–trying to work with rules that do not make sense. How sandboxes work At its core, a regulatory sandbox allows businesses to conduct live experiments with innovative technologies while regulators observe and gather data. Businesses apply for waivers from certain laws that may technically apply to their activities but do not align with the unique nature of their innovations. For example, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform might be exempted from securities regulations that were designed for traditional financial intermediaries. This exemption provides the freedom to innovate without being hamstrung by outdated rules. Importantly, regulatory sandboxes do not equate to a regulatory free-for-all. Participants must adhere to baseline standards for consumer protection and financial stability, ensuring that accountability is not sacrificed in the name of innovation. In practice, regulatory sandboxes have proven to be valuable tools for identifying outdated regulations. By generating real-world data, they enable lawmakers to assess whether certain rules should be reformed or repealed. Without such mechanisms, unnecessary or impractical regulations risk stifling progress and innovation. Lessons from the U.K. and beyond The U.K. has been a pioneer in implementing regulatory sandboxes. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced its sandbox in 2016, offering a structured environment for businesses to test new ideas. Participants have ranged from large law firms to cryptocurrency projects, reflecting the sandbox’s inclusivity and flexibility. In terms of digital assets innovation, the U.K.’s success can be attributed to its focus on fostering both collaboration and innovation. By allowing businesses to experiment within a regulated framework, the sandbox has attracted a diverse array of participants and provided critical insights into how emerging technologies interact with existing laws. Other regions, such as Singapore and the UAE, have also embraced sandboxes as tools for driving innovation. Singapore’s Monetary Authority (MAS) has used its sandbox to advance tokenization in financial services, while the UAE has leveraged its framework to attract blockchain startups. These examples highlight the potential of sandboxes to position countries as global leaders in the digital asset space. Challenges facing regulatory sandboxes Despite their benefits, the existing regulatory sandboxes face several limitations: Narrow scope: Most sandboxes are restricted to specific industries or activities, limiting their applicability to broader regulatory challenges. Participants must also apply and be accepted, so not all projects are treated equally. Short duration: Sandboxes often have fixed timelines, requiring businesses to exit the program without long-term regulatory clarity. High costs: Participating in a sandbox can be resource-intensive for both businesses and regulators, deterring smaller players from applying. To address these challenges, we propose the ""Sustainable Sandbox"" – a redesigned framework tailored to the unique needs of the crypto industry. Designing the 'sustainable sandbox' The ""Sustainable Sandbox"" builds on the strengths of existing models while addressing their shortcomings. Here’s how it would work: 1. Simplified automatic enrollment Participants that complete a form filing process will be automatically enrolled, and will not be subject to an application and acceptance process by the regulator. Businesses that don’t fit the default form, such as DAOs or decentralized exchanges, could propose their own compliance frameworks (subject to regulatory approval) aligned with broad policy goals set by regulators. 2. Data-driven decision-making Regulators would collect and analyze data from sandbox participants to evaluate the effectiveness of waived regulations. This information could inform broader reforms, creating a feedback loop that aligns regulation with innovation, and enabling regulators to write new sensible rules. 3. Seamless transitions At the end of the sandbox period, participants could transition to a tailored safe harbor (which SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has long envisioned ) or receive no-action letters (but remain subject to light oversight), providing long-term regulatory clarity. This ensures that businesses do not face a regulatory cliff, which could disrupt operations and deter participation. Why now? The need for a ""Sustainable Sandbox"" in the U.S. has never been greater. Innovative industries like blockchain and AI are evolving rapidly, but outdated legal frameworks threaten to stifle their potential. At the same time, many regulators lack a deep understanding of these technologies, making it difficult to craft effective rules. By setting broad policy goals and collaborating with industry stakeholders, regulators can bridge this knowledge gap and create a more adaptive legal framework. The recent Supreme Court decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo further underscores the urgency of regulatory innovation. By removing courts’ deference to agency interpretations of their authority, the ruling shifts power toward regulated industries, emphasizing the need for more collaborative governance. The ""Sustainable Sandbox"" offers a path forward, balancing the needs of regulators and innovators in a rapidly changing landscape. Final thoughts As the crypto industry continues to grow, so does the need for regulatory frameworks that can keep pace with innovation. The ""Sustainable Sandbox"" provides a blueprint for balancing experimentation with accountability, fostering a collaborative environment where both regulators and businesses can thrive. By embracing this model, the U.S. has an opportunity to lead the world in crypto innovation while ensuring consumer protection and market stability.

Here are the highlights of what Powell said at the press conference: The economy remains generally strong, with labor market conditions remaining robust, if cooling. Inflation remains high. GDP is expected to exceed 2% in 2024. Hardware investments appear to have slowed. Inflation is closer to target, but still slightly elevated. The labor market is not a source of inflationary pressure. The unemployment rate remains low at 4.1%. We do not need to rush to adjust the policy rate. Long-term inflation expectations appear robust. We cannot comment on Trump's statements. Current policy is significantly looser than when we first started lowering interest rates. Before reducing interest rates, there needs to be significant progress in inflation or weakness in the labor market. We decided to shorten the statement on inflation without intending to send a signal. There is currently a certain degree of high uncertainty in the market due to significant policy adjustments, but this will pass. The Fed needs to see progress in inflation over 12 months. The Fed will not act until it sees more progress than it currently does. I would say our interest rate is significantly above the neutral rate. We don't need 2% inflation to lower interest rates again. A statement that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) did not include in its January statement could be a bigger signal to markets than what the committee included in its statement. Related News: BREAKING: FED Releases Highly Anticipated Interest Rate Decision - Here's Bitcoin's First Reaction The latest statement reads, “Inflation remains moderately elevated.” The December version of this sentence was longer and read, “Inflation has made progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent target but remains moderately elevated.” This change may be one of the reasons why the FED paused after cutting interest rates three times in a row. Although Trump has no authority over what policy the Fed should pursue, he and Powell have been at odds on policy since the president’s first term in Washington.

In a new company blog post , Coinbase says it’s adding four new political and economic leaders to its global advisory council, one of them being Chris LaCivita, a campaign strategist for Trump during his successful 2024 presidential run. Others added to the council include former Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Bill Dudley, as well as Luis Alberto Moreno, a Colombian native and former president of the InterAmerican Development Bank Group. LaCivita – who currently serves as the Chief of Staff for the Republican National Committee – said that the US is on its way to a new era led by pro-crypto leaders and lawmakers. “The crypto industry deserves better than what it received from the previous administration. I look forward to working with Coinbase as our country transitions into a new political era – led by the first-ever pro-crypto president, and most pro-crypto administration and Congress in history – to help make America a crypto leader on the world stage.” According to Coinbase, its global advisory council was created to bring together world leaders with strategic insights that could advance the firm’s vision of “ushering in a new era of the internet through crypto and blockchain technologies.” Other notable members of the council include former Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey, former Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan, and Antonio Villaraigoisa, the former Mayor of Los Angeles.

There is tension in the air between the FOMC and the Oval, so many expect the Fed chair to comment on Trump’s persistent interference, but as usual, he’s downplaying it, showing he’s not one bit worried about President Trump. When asked directly whether he has been in contact with Trump, Powell gave a curt “No.” He also said that he’d never have any comments or response to whatsoever the president has said or will say in the future. According to him, it’s “inappropriate” to comment. He did say he was committed to making sure the Fed’s policies align with Trump’s executive economic orders, but has nothing more to say beyond that. As usual, he shared his support for the Fed’s decision to “pause,” saying he believes the economy is still strong and “in a very good place.” This is a developing story.

Over the weekend, Bitcoin ( BTC ), the leading digital asset, saw a sharp decline but managed to hold its ground above $100,000 at press time. In light of these developments, Finbold turned to DeepSeek itself—one of the primary factors behind the recent market downturn—to craft an optimal cryptocurrency portfolio tailored for 2025. DeepSeek’s ideal crypto portfolio for 2025 DeepSeek prioritizes blue-chip cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ), dedicating 70% of its portfolio—$700 out of an initial $1,000—to these established digital assets, known for their stability and risk mitigation qualities. Bitcoin, comprising 40% of the portfolio, is favored for its increasing institutional adoption, global demand, and rising status as a store of value and hedge against inflation. With persistently high inflation and Trump’s pro-cryptocurrency stance acting as additional catalysts, the outlook for the sector, particularly Bitcoin, remains optimistic. DeepSeek on blue-chip digital assets. Source: Finbold and DeepSeek DeepSeek has allocated just 25% of its portfolio to altcoins, a cautious move despite growing expectations of a shift in market dynamics. Analysts predict a potential decline in Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), a key metric tracking Bitcoin’s share of the cryptocurrency market, which could pave the way for a significant ‘altseason.’ Within its altcoin allocation, DeepSeek has earmarked 10% for Solana ( SOL ), citing its expanding developer ecosystem, cost-efficient transactions, and diverse use cases as major growth drivers. Solana’s prospects are further supported by the potential approval of spot Solana exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) filed by industry giants Bitwise, VanEck, and 21Shares. If approved, these ETFs could position Solana as a mainstream investment option, attracting significant institutional interest. Another 10% of the portfolio is allocated to XRP , driven by increasing institutional demand and ecosystem expansion. Ripple’s regulatory approval of its RLUSD stablecoin in December 2024 marks a key milestone, enhancing the asset’s bullish outlook. Coupled with factors like legal clarity following the SEC’s appeal and Trump’s pro-cryptocurrency stance, XRP appears poised for further growth in the evolving crypto market. Finally, Chainlink ( LINK ) accounts for 5% of DeepSeek’s portfolio, supported by its rising prominence in the blockchain space. Its appeal is rooted in its expanding partnerships and growing adoption, which continue to strengthen its position as a vital player in the industry. DeepSeek on altcoins. Source: Finbold and DeepSeek Lastly, stablecoins make up 5% of DeepSeek’s portfolio, equating to $50 from the initial $1,000 allocation. The AI model recommends Tether ( USDT ) or USD Coin ( USDC ) as preferred options, emphasizing their role in providing liquidity and stability within a volatile market. DeepSeek on stablecoins. Source: Finbold and DeepSeek This allocation acts as a safeguard, offering flexibility for potential reallocation during market shifts. Anchored by blue-chip cryptocurrencies, supported by high-potential altcoins, and stabilized by a small allocation to stablecoins, DeepSeek’s portfolio offers a balanced approach, enabling investors to navigate the expanding digital asset market while effectively managing risk.

Arizona’s Senate Finance Committee approved the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB1025) by a 5-2 vote. The proposal, co-sponsored by Republican Senator Wendy Rogers and Republican Representative Jeff Weninger, is now pending approval before the Senate Rules Committee. It would ultimately need approval from the Arizona State Senate to then advance to the state’s House of Representatives for a vote. The bill would allow the state treasurer, the Arizona State Retirement System and the Public Safety Personnel Retirement System to invest up to 10% of the public money under their control into digital assets. Arizona is one of several states considering crypto reserve proposals, including Utah . The bill would also allow the state to place its crypto holdings within a secure, segregated account within a potential crypto reserve launched by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. A new federal crypto working group, established by an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump, is charged with exploring the creation of a digital asset stockpile as well as making recommendations to make the country a leader in digital assets.

According to IMX’s daily chart, this support level has always been favorable for the altcoin, often triggering upward momentum. Immutable (IMX) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level Since July 2024, IMX has reached this level more than six times, and each time, it has witnessed impressive upside momentum. Considering its historical price movement, experts and analysts expect a similar kind of rally in the future. Source: Additionally, IMX is trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating a downtrend. IMX Price Prediction Based on the recent price action, if IMX holds above $1.00, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 60% to reach the $1.70 level in the coming days. IMX has also witnessed a bullish divergence on its daily timeframe, indicating a perfect opportunity for a price reversal. Large Transaction Volume Surges 360% With this strong bullish price action, long-term holders and crypto whales have shown significant participation in the token, as revealed by the on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock. According to the data, IMX’s large transaction volume has surged by 360% in the past 24 hours.

Source: Coinglass The data further reveals that if market sentiment remains unchanged and IMX’s price falls below the $1.02 level, nearly $365,380 worth of long positions will be liquidated. Conversely, if sentiment shifts and the price rises to $1.105, approximately $425,170 worth of short positions will be liquidated.

Ripple and Solana may soon see ETF funds unlocking massive demand, while DTX Exchange ICO sets new standards by raising over $13m. Table of Contents Is the wait for a SOL ETF over? XRP ETF to change PayFi DTX could be the biggest DeFi game-changer of 2025 There is a lot of speculation that Ripple and Solana will soon receive their own ETF funds, which could unlock massive demand for them in the upcoming bull run. Exchange-traded funds, like the possible SOL ETF and XRP ETF, help expand regulated investment options. They will track the performance of Solana and Ripple, which will be traded on traditional stock exchanges. Solana and Ripple are trading near their all-time highs, and their prices have seen incredible momentum. With a SOL ETF and an XRP ETF in the picture, everyone can be part of the growth of both these crypto giants. Standing tall in competition with Solana and Ripple is DTX Exchange . The DTX ICO has broken all barriers and will set a new standard in the altcoin market once its token is listed. Currently, the presale for the hybrid trading platform is in its last stage, having raised more than $13m. You might also like: SOL sets sights on $200 as DTX gains momentum in the market Is the wait for a SOL ETF over? A SOL ETF would track Solana’s price without requiring direct ownership. The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is in the middle of a leadership change, and we have yet to hear news about the approval of the SOL ETF. Perhaps a more comprehensive framework is required by the SEC to approve the SOL ETF. These filings come on the heels of a new US Administration swearing into office and hopes of establishing a pro-crypto SEC, with Mark Uyeda serving as interim SEC chair. The SEC now has a dedicated crypto task force to ensure regulatory compliance for digital assets and more regulatory clarity for the common man. With a favorable SEC administration, there is hope that the SOL ETF will be approved soon. With a spot ETF, investors will have safe exposure to Solana. The Solana token has been one of the standout cryptocurrencies of last year, and it hit its all-time high price of $268 just this month. A SOL ETF can only take this positive trajectory. XRP ETF to change PayFi As the demand for better payment solutions becomes more pressing, Ripple is leading the charge with its blockchain-based cross-border payment solution. There is news that the XRP ETF could boost the ripple price to $10 if the ETF approvals roll in. Ripple doesn’t have the best history with the SEC, but it is important to get the XRP ETF approved to open the floodgates for traditional investors to dive into Ripple. Ripple’s network has real-time settlement and lower transaction costs, making its use case one of the most fascinating projects in digital finance. Whales are bullish about the Ripple price and hold their positions, which means they are in for the long haul. One of the key predictors of a Ripple bull run is the possibility of an XRP ETF being available soon. It will simplify the challenge of direct custody of a crypto token and allow traditional retail and institutional investors to partake in crypto trading. DTX could be the biggest DeFi game-changer of 2025 DTX is about to turn the multibillion-dollar trading industry on its head and bring together centralized and decentralized finance for investors tired of using multiple platforms. Once DTX Exchange launches, users can trade traditional assets alongside crypto assets. By bridging cryptocurrency and fiat systems, DTX Exchange addresses the crucial pain points of traders worldwide. It provides a solution that is gaining recognition as the finest DeFi project of this year. The presale has gained over $13m in funding, and the token is still priced at an affordable $0.16.

This price rebound has reignited discussions among analysts about the underlying market dynamics and potential future trends. Recent insights from CryptoQuant contributors shed light on key metrics influencing Bitcoin’s price behavior, focusing on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Now Capitulating: Bottom Here? Current Stance On MVRV Ratio And Its Implications For Bitcoin The MVRV Ratio is a widely used metric that measures Bitcoin’s market value relative to its realized value. It can be used to identify whether the market is overbought or oversold. CryptoQuant analyst KriptoBaykusV2 has analyzed the current MVRV Ratio, which stands at 2.2, indicating a balanced market state. This metric offers valuable insights into Bitcoin’s price cycles, shedding light on historical overbought and oversold conditions. The MVRV Ratio is calculated by dividing Bitcoin’s market value (the total Bitcoin supply multiplied by its current price) by its realized value (the aggregate value of all Bitcoins based on their last movement price). This ratio provides insight into the profitability of Bitcoin holders, helping to gauge market sentiment. Historically, an MVRV above 3 has signaled overbought conditions with higher correction risks, as seen during the 2017 and 2021 bull runs. Conversely, an MVRV below 1 has identified oversold zones, marking potential buying opportunities during bear markets like those in 2018 and 2020. Currently, with the MVRV Ratio at 2.2, the market is in a neutral state, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This indicates a balanced environment with the potential for trend shifts. According to KriptoBaykusV2, the MVRV Ratio’s position provides critical signals for both short-term traders seeking tactical opportunities and long-term investors aiming for strategic positioning. Selling Pressure and Short-Term Market Trends Meanwhile, another CryptoQuant analyst, G a a h, highlighted the prevailing short-term selling pressure affecting Bitcoin’s market dynamics. The Take Buy Sell Ratio indicator reveals that selling activity outweighs buying, suggesting that supply currently exceeds demand. This trend is often observed during profit-taking phases near resistance levels, resulting in price corrections or sideways trading. Additionally, short-term holders are reportedly liquidating positions, with many sales occurring at little to no profit. This behavior contributes to increased market volatility and short-term downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Although Bitcoin has seen a quick recovery in price now trading above $96,000, G a a h wrote: On the price chart, a bearish structure is forming with a high probability of continuation given the circumstances in the data presented.

39666255,https://nulltx.com/?p=141660,1738180844,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Ripple Price Prediction: Experts See XRP Climbing to $11 With Increased CBDC Adoption,https://nulltx.com/the-ripple-price-prediction-experts-see-xrp-climbing-to-11-with-increased-cbdc-adoption/,"Ripple (XRP) is gaining momentum as Binance analysts forecast a potential climb to $11, fueled by the increasing adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and expanding institutional partnerships. Meanwhile, PlutoChain is gaining attention by attracting whale interest through its innovative integration of AI and smart contracts into Bitcoin. With millions of tokens already sold in its presale, the project is steadily gaining momentum. As XRP gears up for significant growth and PlutoChain positions itself as a potential disruptor, both are influencing the future of the crypto market. Let’s look into the details. Ripple Price Prediction – Could Increased CBDC Adoption Push XRP to $11? XRP is currently trading around $2.91, with Binance analysts predicting a potential rise to $11 as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) gain mainstream adoption. Ripple’s growing adoption by financial institutions and government interest in blockchain is boosting optimism. Its real-time cross-border payment utility could drive price gains. XRP is retesting key resistance at $3.49; holding this level could push it to $5 and later $11. Rising liquidity strengthens its role in digital payments. Institutional demand for Ripple’s ODL services supports a bullish outlook as enterprises seek cost-effective transactions. TradingView signals consolidation, with XRP maintaining an uptrend. A neutral RSI suggests a breakout potential. Historically, breaking resistance leads to rapid gains. Expanding CBDC adoption and regulatory clarity could push XRP toward $11. Is PlutoChain the Future of Bitcoin’s Scalability and Cross-Chain Functionality? PlutoChain could introduce a revolutionary Layer-2 framework that’s designed to enhance Bitcoin’s scalability and expand its use cases beyond simple transactions. It offers a 2-second block time and processes up to 43,200 transactions per day. This alone might solve Bitcoin’s well-documented speed limitations while preserving its robust security. Unlike traditional Layer-2 solutions that focus solely on scalability, PlutoChain integrates additional functionalities that might bring new utility to Bitcoin’s ecosystem. One of PlutoChain’s standout features is its full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, which could allow Ethereum-based smart contracts to operate seamlessly on Bitcoin’s network. This capability might bridge two of the largest blockchain ecosystems and potentially enable developers to deploy DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and AI-powered applications directly on Bitcoin. As a result, PlutoChain could also unlock entirely new use cases for Bitcoin holders and developers alike. Beyond its technical strengths, PlutoChain introduces a decentralized governance model, which ensures that upgrades and network decisions are driven by community participation rather than centralized control. Security is also a top priority, with PlutoChain undergoing rigorous audits from leading cybersecurity firms such as SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . These audits validate the network’s reliability and ensure that it meets high-security standards before broader adoption. Final Words XRP’s expanding role in cross-border payments and institutional finance keeps it a dominant force in the market. However, PlutoChain’s cutting-edge hybrid Layer-2 technology and focus on scalability might make it a project worth keeping an eye on. PlutoChain could emerge as a unique solution by enhancing Bitcoin’s speed, interoperability, and functionality. It could attract whale attention because of its potential to expand Bitcoin’s utility, making it worth taking a closer look at. ——— The information in this article does not represent financial or investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Shiba Inu and Rexas Finance are emerging as top contenders for exponential gains by 2026. Table of Contents Shiba Inu: Riding the meme coin wave Rexas Finance: The RWA revolution The verdict Investing in cryptocurrencies has always been about timing, patience, and spotting initiatives with exponential development promise. Among the tokens attracting investor attention are Shiba Inu (SHIB), a meme coin phenomenon, and Rexas Finance (RXS), a novel token targeting real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and DeFi innovation. Although the volatile world of cryptocurrencies offers no certainties, both coins show convincing arguments for large gains under the correct market conditions. Shiba Inu: Riding the meme coin wave Shiba Inu became notable in 2021 as a meme coin used as a community project. The Shiba Inu ecosystem has since grown, with a decentralized exchange, metaverse, NFTs, and more. With dedicated supporters driving its ongoing acceptance, SHIB remains a top-20 cryptocurrency by market capitalization despite volatility. To provide exponential returns by 2026, SHIB would need a significant price rise, which may be connected to ecosystem developments and general acceptance of its use. Analysts suggest that SHIB might revisit or exceed its all-time high as large burns steadily lower its supply. However, SHIB’s reliance on speculative trading and market sentiments makes its road to massive and sustainable returns not without hazards. You might also like: This crypto presale could surge faster than Shiba Inu did Rexas Finance: The RWA revolution Rexas Finance presents another approach. Riding the wave of enthusiasm is only one aspect; using the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization lays a strong basis for long-term development. Imagine ownership, via a digital token, of a fraction of a luxurious condominium in Dubai, a share of a rare Picasso, or even a piece of a gold mine. RWA tokenization has great power, and Rexas Finance aims to make it available to anyone. This creative approach to investing might transform many sectors, from real estate and banking to art and collectibles. By fractionalizing high-value assets, Rexas Finance will democratize access to investment prospects that are out of reach for most people. This is bound to generate additional development opportunities, supporting the project’s ability to provide outstanding returns. Rexas Finance will also help markets become more efficient. Buying and selling tokenized assets will be simpler, which creates a more active and accessible market. Furthermore, transaction expenses will be much lower since RXS will remove the intermediaries, making investing more affordable. You might also like: Solana’s path to $200b market cap: Timeline and tokens poised to rally with SOL Rexas Finance uses blockchain technology to guarantee that every transaction will be publicly documented. This builds confidence and lowers fraud risk, strengthening the investment environment’s security and dependability. In addition, Rexas Finance will offer a series of easy-to-use tools — including its creative Launchpad and Token Builder — which will enable anyone to create and oversee their tokens. These tools are designed to stimulate creativity and increase the digital economy’s opportunities by drawing developers and consumers to the platform and supporting its long-term expansion. Already proving its promise, Rexas Finance has raised $39.4 million and sold over 416 million RXS tokens, currently in its 11th presale stage. Leading blockchain security company Certik has audited the project, with features on Coinmarketcap and CoinGecko reinforcing its reputation. The verdict Although both Shiba Inu and Rexas Finance offer the possibility for large returns, Rexas Finance makes a more convincing argument for long-term wealth building. Its emphasis on practical use, creative technology, and expanding community build a better basis for sustainable development and a more reasonable road to massive returns by 2026. However, the crypto market is erratic and volatile. No investment guarantees profits, so one must conduct extensive studies and grasp the associated hazards before deciding what to invest in.

The findings, published by S&P Global’s financial analysis division Crisil Coalition Greenwich, suggest that near-complete adoption of digital assets among fund managers could be on the horizon. The report notes a significant shift in institutional sentiment, noting that many firms are comfortable trading a small number of crypto assets, but 40% of asset managers overseeing funds over $100 million have expanded their exposure to altcoins. “This is a major shift from years ago,” the report says, pointing to the growing risk appetite for cryptocurrency investments among large financial firms. Related News: Data Revealed: How Many of Bitcoin Investors are in Profit and How Many are in Loss? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs last year played a major role in this shift. These ETFs attracted $107 billion in assets under management in a single year, setting a record for the ETF market. The report suggests that fund managers are moving beyond a single crypto asset and exploring more diversified investment strategies, including: Multi-asset crypto ETFs that can offer exposure to a basket of cryptocurrencies. Direct ownership of digital assets as well as crypto derivatives. Moving beyond the top three or four assets to DeFi tokens and altcoins. “This represents a gradual shift from the past few years, when investors piled into the top three or four assets,” the report said, adding that the increased use of DeFi tokens and altcoins will likely solidify their role in institutional portfolios. The survey also revealed that 75% of fund managers want the ability to stake and earn yield directly from their crypto assets. Ethereum’s $105 billion staking market is a prime example of how institutions can engage with yield-generating opportunities. Beyond native staking, liquid staking and re-staking provide institutional players with additional ways to maximize returns. *This is not investment advice.

The proposal underscores Texas’ ongoing push to integrate Bitcoin ( BTC ) into its financial strategy and reinforce its status as a blockchain-friendly state . “Over the last four years, the Texas Senate held the line, fighting back against President Biden’s disastrous agenda,” Patrick said. “Now, with President Trump back in office, Texas has a friend in the White House.” Texas has seen tensions between crypto miners and the government, highlighted by a recent lawsuit from a mining firm, Lejilex, against the SEC over crypto regulation and token classification. In Feb. 2024, The Texas Blockchain Council and Riot Platforms sued the U.S. Department of Energy, the EIA, and the OMB, challenging the emergency data collection on crypto mining energy use.

33767162,[object Object],1738184437,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin Set For Double Bull Runs As Price Follows Bullish Chart Pattern,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-set-for-double-bull-runs/,"The much-anticipated major rally for Dogecoin, potentially toward its present all-time high continues to face significant setbacks due to unfavorable market conditions . Given recent price developments, a crypto expert forecasts that the meme coin could see a back-to-back bull run soon. Dual Bull Runs In Sight For Dogecoin As Dogecoin gradually recovers from the recent market dip, Trader Tardigrade, a crypto expert and investor has outlined a promising outlook for DOGE in the short term. According to the expert, DOGE’s price performance hints at multiple bullish scenarios that could push the meme coin toward uncharted territory. Trader Tardigrade claims that DOGE looks to be gearing up for two consecutive rallies, bolstered by a promising chart formation that indicates robust upside momentum. Navigating the meme coin’s price action on the weekly time frame, he points to an alignment with the Gaussian Channel pattern. Specifically, a Gaussian channel formation is a technical pattern that aids in spotting market trends and trading opportunities. With the formation indicating breakout possibilities, the analyst predicts notable price increases for Dogecoin as it draws closer to key resistance levels. Historically, this indicator has preceded significant upward movements, resulting in two bullish runs as seen in the expert’s chart. The chart shows that DOGE initially left the channel when it was red, and then retested the mid-channel line, allowing it to gather enough strength for an uptrend. Should past scenarios repeat, Trader Tardigrade is confident that Dogecoin will witness two consecutive major rallies to a new all-time high shortly. DOGE is presently experiencing the first bull run, which suggests that more growth is still ahead as the second draws closer. At the end of the second bull run, marking the upper line of the pattern, the meme coin will be valued at $3. This anticipated move to $3 may also represent a market top for Dogecoin in the ongoing cycle. Renewed optimism and growing confidence in DOGE among investors might spur upside strength in the coming days, which may kickstart the much-anticipated move. DOGE Transition Into A Bullish Period Given the massive market decline a few days ago, DOGE faced bearish forces , causing its price to drop sharply. Even though this decrease has hindered positive movements, Trader Tardigrade highlighted that the meme coin might be regaining steam toward an upward trajectory. Trader Tardigrade has spotted an impending Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) bullish crossover on the 4-hour time frame. Such MACD crossovers are typically a precursor for price recovery after a period of volatility. As a result, the expert noted that DOGE is generating short-term momentum, shifting from bearish territory to bullish territory. With Dogecoin gathering steam, the next key level to watch is the $0.35 mark. The $0.35 level has turned out to be a critical juncture due to the significant portion of short positions that will be liquidated. Technical expert Ali Martinez warns that about $766.45 million of short positions are at risk of liquidation once DOGE rebounds the price mark.",Dogecoin|Ali Martinez|Doge|doge price|dogecoin|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Gaussian Channel Pattern|MACD|MACD Crossover|meme coin|Moving Average Convergence Divergence|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-29 21:00:37

This major upgrade, confirmed by the Cardano Foundation, will grant ADA holders direct voting power over key network decisions, including parameter adjustments, treasury withdrawals, and hard fork initiations. Cardano’s Full Decentralized Governance Era The Cardano blockchain will transition to a decentralized governance structure after the Plomin hard fork takes effect. This hard fork introduces multiple critical changes to Cardano’s governance and functionality. It enables all seven governance actions outlined in the Cardano Improvement Proposal CIP-1694, including treasury withdrawals, new constitution proposals, and votes of no confidence. Moreover, it activates decentralized representative (DRep) and stake pool operator (SPO) voting on applicable governance actions. “A Milestone In Blockchain Governance” The Cardano Foundation posited in a Jan. 29 post on X: “The Plomin hard fork takes effect, marking the transition to full decentralized governance. $ADA holders gain real voting power — on parameter changes, treasury withdrawals, hard forks, and the blockchain’s future, a milestone in blockchain governance.” https://twitter.com/Cardano_CF/status/1884549197552115829 The Plomin hard fork was officially approved last week for enactment after meeting all three necessary thresholds for such a transformation during the network’s interim governance period. The results saw that at least 85% of stake pools had elevated to a Cardano node version capable of processing the rules associated with the new protocol version. In addition, more than 51% of stake pool operators voted in favor of the upgrade, and over 66% of the Interim Constitutional Committee found that the hard fork was constitutional, setting the stage for Cardano’s transition to decentralized governance. ADA was trading hands for $0.9465 as of press time, up 3.3% on the day, according to CoinGecko data. The token is up over 76% over the past year, outshining rival Ether’s 34% yearly growth. A powerful move above the $1 threshold could pave the way for further gains toward its current all-time high of $3.09.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,FORKS|ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|MINING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-29 21:02:30

Ripple CEO Bradley Garlinghouse has reiterated his backing for the creation of a diversified US strategic crypto reserve under the Donald Trump administration instead of one focused solely on Bitcoin. Garlingh ouse Rejects Bitcoin-Focused US Reserve Brad Garlinghouse supports the idea of a U.S. digital asset reserve encompassing multiple tokens, not just Bitcoin or Ripple-promoted XRP. “I own XRP, BTC, and ETH, among a handful of others — we live in a multichain world, and I’ve advocated for a level-playing field instead of one token versus another. If a govt digital asset reserve is created — I believe it should be representative of the industry, not just one token (whether it be BTC, XRP, or anything else),” the Ripple boss wrote in a post on X. US President Donald Trump recently signed his first crypto executive order proposing the creation of a strategic national digital assets stockpile, which was one of his campaign promises. Many expect the potential reserve to include the world’s largest and oldest crypto by market cap, Bitcoin. Garlinghouse, however, is against the maximalism that claims that no coin other than Bitcoin has a place on the US government’s balance sheet. According to him, there is a need for collaboration in the industry instead of unnecessary competition. “Maximalism remains the enemy of crypto progress, and I’m very glad to see fewer and fewer folks ascribe to this outdated and misinformed thinking,” Garlinghouse explained. Tensions Rise Over Strategic Asset Reserves The friction between XRP supporters and Bitcoin maximalists crescendoed when crypto industry figures started bashing Ripple’s active push for a multi-coin national digital assets stockpile. As ZyCrypto previously reported , Pierre Rochard, Vice President of Research at Riot Platforms, accused Ripple of being the “biggest obstacle” to a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve because it backs the inclusion of multiple coins, including XRP. Meanwhile, lawmakers in Washington and at the state level have been gearing up for what they are terming a “strategic Bitcoin reserve.” There are at least a dozen BTC reserve-related bills at different stages in states like Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Kansas, New Hampshire, Wyoming, Ohio, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Texas. The success of these bills could lure in the institutional investors who have been sitting on the sidelines. It could also lead to a rapid price appreciation in the BTC price.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Bitcoin News|Brad Garlinghouse|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|XRP|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-29 21:05:56

The traction gained by the Chinese AI firm led to a major shake-up across U.S. tech stocks, spilling into a direct crash in Bitcoin and altcoin prices. Although fear looms over the cheaper cost compared to the OpenAI model, Altman highlighted competitive efforts towards better AI models. We Will Deliver Better Models – Sam Altman In a recent post on X , Altman lauded DeepSeek’s emergence into the AI space, calling the R1 impressive. A factor that caught the community’s attention was the price: cheaper than the US company’s model. Altman expressed excitement over the new competition, stressing roadmap execution for his firm. “ …we will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases. But mostly we are excited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission. The world is going to want to use a LOT of ai, and really be quite amazed by the next-gen models coming, ” he added. Mixed reaction trailed the post, with some users restating the high cost and the sharp dip in US tech stocks. Generally, AI enthusiasts express delight in the competition and look forward to new OpenAI releases. AI adoption continues to soar globally as most companies integrate solutions into production. The boom also led to a fresh inflow into AI coins in the crypto market. Recently, Donald Trump pledged to make the United States the global AI and crypto capital as efforts intensify in other jurisdictions. Impact On Crypto Markets The recent US stock market shake-up led to a similar negative outlook in the crypto prices. Bitcoin price slipped below $99k before a rebound above the $100k mark. The last 48 hours saw huge inflows to centralized exchanges as whales dumped tokens to limit losses. Movement to centralized exchange points to crypto sales due to ease of transfers, while outflows point to long-term holdings. The last few hours have seen positive spikes in the market, especially across defi volumes and altcoins. As bulls seek to regain lost ground, digital asset analysts suggest caution due to present macro conditions.

Investors searching for the top cryptos to join now are setting their sights on projects that bring real utility, strong fundamentals, and long-term growth potential. Right now, three standout contenders are Qubetics, Litecoin, and Filecoin. Qubetics is disrupting traditional asset ownership through its Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, making high-value investments more accessible than ever. Litecoin remains a household name, offering a faster, more efficient alternative to Bitcoin for everyday transactions. Filecoin, on the other hand, is leading the charge in decentralized storage, providing a secure, scalable solution that could power the next evolution of the internet. Each of these cryptos offers something unique, making them top choices for investors looking to get in on the action today. Qubetics: The Future of Real-World Asset Tokenization Traditional asset investment has always been an exclusive game. Whether it’s real estate, fine art, or high-end commodities, getting a slice of these markets usually requires hefty capital. Qubetics is changing that narrative with its Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace , making these investments accessible to anyone with an internet connection. With Qubetics, businesses and individuals can tokenize physical and digital assets, turning them into blockchain-based investment opportunities. Imagine owning a fraction of a multi-million-dollar property without the paperwork, bureaucracy, or massive upfront capital. Or think about an artist who can sell shares of their artwork as digital tokens, allowing multiple collectors to own a piece of a masterpiece. For professionals, Qubetics unlocks an entirely new financial ecosystem. Entrepreneurs can raise funds by tokenizing their businesses, professionals can digitize intellectual property rights, and investors can diversify portfolios like never before. But Qubetics doesn’t stop at tokenization—it also introduces TICSScan, a comprehensive blockchain explorer designed to track transactions, manage smart contracts, analyze blocks, and monitor validator performance. This level of transparency and security sets Qubetics apart from other blockchain ecosystems. Currently in Stage 19 of its presale, Qubetics has already sold over 450 million tokens to 17,100+ holders, raising $11.3 million and counting. At $0.0606 per $TICS token, this is a prime entry point before the market catches on. Litecoin: The Silver to Bitcoin’s Gold Litecoin has long been regarded as Bitcoin’s faster, more efficient counterpart, and for good reason. It was designed to be lighter, cheaper, and quicker—a cryptocurrency that everyday users could rely on for smooth, low-cost transactions. Today, LTC continues to prove its strength in the market. Recently, Litecoin surged to $128.02, reflecting a 4.18% gain in just 24 hours. This momentum is being fueled by whale activity at the $113.4 support level, with on-chain data showing large transaction volumes rising from 73.14 million LTC to 83.17 million LTC in a single day. When institutional players and high-net-worth investors start making moves like this, it often signals a big price shift on the horizon. Beyond market speculation, Litecoin’s fundamentals remain solid. Its recent move above the 50-day SMA at $111 confirms sustained bullish momentum, while its 30-day annualized volatility of 83.19% highlights strong trading opportunities. Privacy features have also been enhanced thanks to the implementation of MimbleWimble Extension Blocks (MWEB), making Litecoin an increasingly attractive option for users who value secure and confidential transactions. With a strong technical setup, growing whale accumulation, and privacy improvements, Litecoin remains one of the top cryptos to join now for those looking for an established yet still evolving crypto asset. Filecoin: The Future of Decentralized Data Storage While most crypto investors focus on coins that handle payments and smart contracts, Filecoin is tackling a completely different problem—data storage. Instead of relying on centralized cloud providers like Amazon or Google, Filecoin offers decentralized, blockchain-powered storage solutions that are cheaper, safer, and censorship-resistant. The concept is simple: users rent out excess storage space, creating a decentralized network where data is stored securely across multiple nodes. Not only does this provide cost-effective storage, but it also eliminates single points of failure and reduces the risks of large-scale data breaches. Recently, FIL has struggled to push past its 20-day SMA of $5.46, facing resistance from sellers despite climbing to an intraday high of $5.46 earlier in the week. Still, FIL has maintained support at $4.60, and market analysts expect a breakout if it can reclaim key resistance levels. As Web3 adoption accelerates, Filecoin’s infrastructure will become increasingly crucial for developers, enterprises, and individuals looking for a more secure, censorship-resistant alternative to traditional cloud storage. For investors seeking exposure to crypto projects with real-world utility, Filecoin is an obvious choice, making it one of the top cryptos to join now for long-term potential. Understanding Real-World Asset Tokenization So, why is real-world asset tokenization such a big deal? Because it’s changing the way we think about ownership, investment, and financial access. In traditional finance, high-value assets—like real estate, commodities, and intellectual property—are often illiquid and difficult to access for the average investor. Tokenization fixes this problem by converting these assets into blockchain-based digital tokens, which can be bought, sold, and traded like stocks. Imagine owning a piece of a luxury hotel in Miami or fractional shares of a Picasso painting, all without dealing with banks, brokers, or endless paperwork. Tokenization makes it cheaper, faster, and more inclusive, allowing anyone to invest in markets that were once reserved for institutions and the ultra-wealthy. Qubetics is at the forefront of this movement, offering a seamless platform where businesses, investors, and individuals can tokenize and trade assets in a secure and transparent environment. As blockchain adoption grows, so will the demand for tokenized assets, making this one of the most exciting investment opportunities in crypto today. Final Thoughts: Why These Cryptos Deserve Your Attention The crypto market is filled with thousands of projects, but few offer the kind of long-term value and innovation that Qubetics, Litecoin, and Filecoin bring to the table. Qubetics is pioneering real-world asset tokenization, Litecoin is cementing itself as a faster, more private alternative to Bitcoin, and Filecoin is leading the charge in decentralized data storage. Each of these projects has strong fundamentals, a clear use case, and a dedicated community backing their success. For those looking for the top cryptos to join now, these three should be at the top of the list. Whether you’re after cutting-edge blockchain applications, solid investment opportunities, or a mix of both, now is the time to get in before the next big wave of adoption.

With 18 days remaining in its ICO, Wall Street Pepe is on track to exceed Pepe Unchained’s ICO total of $73 million. WEPE's community intelligence feature has caught the attention of savvy investors. Every token holder will join an exclusive group, gaining access to advanced market insights, trading setups, and tips on the best cryptocurrencies to invest in. In addition to this, millions are set aside for trading and staking rewards for WEPE holders.

More Websites Now Accept Payments,https://cryptopotato.com/trump-coin-goes-mainstream-more-websites-now-accept-payments/,"TL;DR Several online retailers and Travala have supposedly started accepting Trump’s meme coin, expanding its use beyond speculation. TRUMP surged past $70 but has since dropped 64% to around $26, with critics like Balaji Srinivasan and Mark Cuban questioning its legitimacy. TRUMP Receives Further Support Donald Trump made huge waves in the crypto world by launching his own meme coin. The token in question is called Official Trump (TRUMP), and it saw the light of day on January 18. According to a recent Bloomberg report , several online retailers selling Trump-themed merchandise have accepted the asset as a payment method. Those include GetTrumpWatches.com, GetTrumpFragrances.com, and GetTrumpSneakers.com. Prior to that, Travala – a blockchain-based travel booking platform that enables clients to pay for vacations, hotels, and flights in cryptocurrencies – also embraced TRUMP.

Its price exceeded $70, while its market capitalization surged past $14.5 billion. Thus, it briefly surpassed Shiba Inu (SHIB) to become the second-biggest meme coin. In addition, the price explosion allowed savvy traders to make multi-million profits overnight due to entering and eventually exiting the ecosystem at the right time. Ever since Trump’s inauguration, though, the token has been in serious decline. It currently trades at around $26 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 64% decline from the peak. The market cap has fallen below $5.5 billion, making TRUMP the third-largest in the meme coin niche with a slight lead over Pepe (PEPE). TRUMP Price, Source: CoinGecko While many industry participants believe it could enter a new bull run soon, others have criticized its existence. Balaji Srinivasan (the former CTO of Coinbase) claimed that such assets only damage the reputation of the industry instead of legitimizing it. The American billionaire Mark Cuban shared a similar thesis, arguing that the introduction of Trump’s meme coin is nothing but harmful to the cryptocurrency sector. “This is the biggest bunch of self-serving Bullsh*t I have ever heard. In your world, there is no ownership. Just speculation,” he said. The post TRUMP Coin Goes Mainstream?

Did the Company Sell Bitcoin?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/breaking-news-tesla-earnings-report-announced-did-the-company-sell-bitcoin/,"Tesla fell short of analysts’ gross margin estimates in the fourth quarter as the electric vehicle maker offered financing offers and discounts to revive demand for its aging product line. According to the announced report, Tesla did not sell Bitcoin (BTC). Shares of the Austin, Texas-based automaker fell 4% in after-market trading. As Tesla uses more affordable financing options to boost demand, analysts predict the company will gradually erode its auto profit margins in coming quarters as it absorbs the impact of higher interest rates. The electric vehicle pioneer's annual deliveries fell for the first time last year due to high borrowing costs and intense competition. Rivals such as Chinese BYD as well as European manufacturers BMW and Volkswagen have launched cheaper new models in a bid to seize market share. Tesla said it expects volume growth of 20% to 30% in 2025, and investors believe a cheaper model based on existing platforms to be launched in the first half of the year and higher deliveries of the Cybertruck will help meet the target. However, the company has not revealed details on pricing, features, and how it will differ from existing offerings. *This is not investment advice.

To read full editions, subscribe . Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan last week said that the US banking industry will have to adapt their businesses to allow for crypto payments, should regulations progress. “If the rules come in and make it a real thing that you can actually do business with, you’ll find that the banking system will come in hard on the transactional side of it,” Moynihan told CNBC at the World Economic Forum. Crypto exchange Kraken today launched a new payments platform — Kraken Pay , which allows customers to transfer assets directly from their exchange accounts. Kraken Pay supports more than 300 fiat currencies and crypto tokens. Sending assets is free, but converting assets from one currency to another when making a transfer will come with fees. ​​“Crypto isn’t just the future of finance — it’s the now,” Kraken global head of consumer Mark Greenberg said. “We’re eliminating the barriers of slow payments and outrageous fees while bringing real-world utility to your fingertips.” Kraken Pay is only the latest product in the growing crypto payments landscape. Payment service Venmo dipped its toe in the crypto pool back in 2021. Ripple says its payments product is getting a facelift this year. The payments space, from cross-border and remittances to peer-to-peer transactions, has long been an area crypto fans insist is ripe for disruption. With more crypto-friendly federal regulators in charge and increased retail and institutional investor interest, 2025 just may be the year we really start to see this sector of crypto take off.

This potential shift in trajectory comes after the cryptocurrency experienced a severe price crash that briefly pushed it below the $100,000 mark. Bitcoin Price Finds Strong Support At Double Bottom The Bitcoin price crashed below $100,000 earlier this week as the China-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) model DeepSeek gained significant popularity across the US and global investment market, overtaking OpenAI’s ChatGPT. While this decline came as a shock, triggering a massive sell-off, Bitcoin managed to recover over 50% of its losses in a short time. Related Reading: End Of The Road For Bitcoin? Analyst Reveals When Price Will Crash To $50,000 Following this severe crash, TradingShot revealed that Bitcoin had rebounded at a Double support level, using two strong support lines to prevent further price slips. The analyst shared a detailed price chart that highlights several Double Bottoms, including one forming near the 4-hour 200-Moving Average (4H MA200). A Double Bottom pattern is a chart formation that indicates a potential trend reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. It is characterized by two consecutive lows around the same price level and creates a W-shaped movement. Looking at the chart, the Bitcoin price is moving within an Ascending Channel, indicating a general uptrend. The 4H MA200 on the orange trend line is a strong Double Bottom support level, which Bitcoin recently tested for the first time in 12 days. TradingShot also mentioned a “Pivot trend line” in which Bitcoin previously faced resistance, starting from its ATH on December 17, 2024. This trend line now acts as a support line for the cryptocurrency, as its price has reversed near it. Notably, Bitcoin almost touched the bottom of January’s Channel Up, indicating a potential key support zone. This is similar to a pattern in December, where the cryptocurrency bounced off the same support and hit a new ATH. Key Resistance At 4H MA50 — Breakout Or Rejection? In TradingShot’s chart, the 4H MA50 is indicated on the blue line, acting as a dynamic resistance level for the cryptocurrency. Currently, Bitcoin is trading below this Moving Average, meaning a breakout above this level could trigger more upside. The analyst predicts that if Bitcoin breaks above the 4H MA50, it could continue its bullish momentum toward a higher price level between $110,000 and $112,000. This massive surge would mark a new ATH for the pioneer cryptocurrency, as the highest price Bitcoin has ever reached is above $108,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Upper Band Moves Above $105,400 – Where Price Is Headed Next Supporting this bullish scenario, the TradingView analyst highlights Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which shows oversold areas marked in green circles on the chart. Whenever RSI drops below 30, Bitcoin tends to rebound, indicating a potential for a strong bounce. Conversely, the analyst forecasted a bearish scenario for Bitcoin if it faces a rejection around the 4H MA50. He predicts that Bitcoin could revisit the Double Bottom at $98,000, a bearish level observed on both December 23 and January 13. An even deeper correction is expected for this cryptocurrency if it continues on a downtrend, with the analyst projecting a crash to $96,000.

Lutnick stated in a recent Senate hearing that it is important for stablecoins to be audited to ensure they are backed 1:1 by US Treasury bonds. “I believe that US dollar stablecoins should be regulated and 100% backed by US Treasuries,” Lutnick said. He also noted that issuers should honor their commitments to depositors and ensure that withdrawal values do not change. Related News: Bitcoin's Big Bear in 2026?

Tether has faced scrutiny, including from regulators, over its reserves, with some questioning the one-to-one dollar backing for USDT. Tether has consistently denied these claims. Tether has published verification reports over the years, but has faced criticism over its legitimacy when compared to audits. *This is not investment advice.

Peter Oppenheimer, the bank’s chief global equity strategist, has told investors today that markets aren’t crashing—just cooling. “In our view, this is a correction and not the start of a sustained bear market,” Oppenheimer told clients in a 16-page note titled Concentration & Correction – What to Do Next , released on Jan. 29. The report comes as tech stocks, led by the Magnificent Seven—think Apple, Microsoft, Google, and their mega-cap friends—take a hit after DeepSeek’s debut. But Goldman isn’t seeing doom. They see an opportunity. Goldman bets on diversification as crypto bleeds Oppenheimer pointed out that the tech sector’s dominance isn’t irrational hype. “It’s backed by fundamentals,” he wrote, pointing to massive profit gains compared to other sectors. But he also warned that investors shouldn’t stick only to tech. “We’re not in a period where everything that’s outperformed will crash,” he said. Instead, he expects “market broadening,” a move where investors look at other areas of growth while holding their key positions in winners like Big Tech. Goldman is advising clients to keep holding stocks but to hedge their bets. The bank recommends diversifying into assets like safe bonds and mid-sized U.S. stocks through indices like the S&P Midcap 400 and the S&P 500 Equal-Weighted Index. “Global growth names outside tech are cheaper and more diversified,” Oppenheimer noted. He believes these names could benefit from investors looking to reduce risk but still chase returns. Meanwhile, DeepSeek also wreaked havoc on crypto markets. The price of bitcoin has dropped to $98,000 at one point but has since recovered back above $103,000 as of press time. On Jan. 27, Nasdaq futures dropped 3%, dragging crypto down with it. Shares of Coinbase fell 6%, while MicroStrategy slid 1%. Core Scientific and Terawulf each saw their stocks plunge 29%, and Iren (formerly Iris Energy) dropped 24%. DeepSeek claims its AI model rivals those of U.S. tech giants like Google and OpenAI—but at a fraction of the cost. That claim is spooking investors, with fears that Big Tech’s spending on AI models and data centers could take a hit. Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick explained the risks in a note on Monday: “Today’s 3% decline in Nasdaq futures (on DeepSeek news) has driven digital asset liquidation overnight.” According to Geoff, bitcoin’s fate remains tied to tech’s performance. “Bitcoin is much more correlated to the Nasdaq than to gold,” he said. Data from Coinglass shows over $250 million in long Bitcoin positions were liquidated in just 24 hours. Traders who used leverage to bet on rising prices were forced to sell their assets to cover losses as prices tanked. The market sell-off is also tied to President Donald Trump’s executive order on crypto, issued last Thursday. The order had been hyped for weeks, with traders expecting a pro-crypto policy. But the actual details disappointed some. Instead of committing to regularly buying bitcoin (a “reserve” strategy), Trump’s order focused on creating a stockpile. This means the U.S. government will hold on to its current Bitcoin but won’t actively buy more. Bitcoin had hit a record $109,000 last week in anticipation of the order. But once traders saw the details, the hype evaporated. At press time, BTC was worth $104,149.

The company's fourth quarter earnings report shows its 9,720 bitcoin valued at $1.076 billion as of the end of 2024. That's up from what had been $184 million for several quarters prior. Alongside that change, Tesla also recorded a GAAP income boost of $600 million on its digital holdings. For perspective, the company had overall GAAP income of $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter. A new rule from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requires corporate holders of digital assets to begin marking those assets to market each quarter, no later than the first quarter of 2025. Companies could take advantage of the new rule prior to that at their own discretion, which Tesla has appeared to do. Prior to this new rule, corporate holders of digital assets were required to report those holdings at what was their lowest valuation during the time of ownership. Tesla overall reported adjusted EPS of $0.73 in the fourth quarter, missing estimates for $0.76. The gain on its bitcoin holdings was for GAAP purposes and would have had no effect on adjusted EPS.

Yeti Ouro (YETIO) , a fresh meme-inspired altcoin, has taken the market by surprise, gathering over $2 million during Stage 2 of its presale. With Dogecoin gaining traction and Yeti Ouro unveiling an innovative Play-to-Earn ecosystem, the crypto landscape is buzzing with potential. Investors are flocking to the YETIO presale, motivated by a limited-time 20% bonus offer ending on the 31st to celebrate the Chinese New Year. Dogecoin Price Forecast: DOGE Nears Critical Resistance Amid Rising Whale Activity Dogecoin is slowly bouncing back, with its price recorded at $0.3345 on Coinmarketcap following a period of significant volatility. The cryptocurrency has seen a 2.33% decline over the past week, highlighting the ongoing market fluctuations. Traders are closely watching Dogecoin as it nears a critical resistance zone between $0.335 and $0.34. Ali Martinez suggests that breaking above $0.35 could trigger a short squeeze, potentially liquidating $766 million in short positions. Data from Coinglass shows that liquidations within the $0.3397 to $0.3436 range could involve $2.26 billion, intensifying the pressure on short sellers. Additionally, the number of large holders, or whales, has surged, with inflows increasing by 323.86% over the past month and a staggering 3722.46% over the last 90 days. Experts note significant buying pressure around the 20-week exponential moving average and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. Should Dogecoin exceed $0.35, forced liquidations could lead to a rapid price increase. Conversely, falling below the $0.313 mark might lead to further drops towards $0.27 and $0.23.

People were lining up to get in, but let’s face it—some folks blinked and missed the boat. Fast forward to today, and Pepe Coin has exploded, becoming one of the hottest meme coins to date. Those who didn’t get in during the ICO are now left rethinking their decisions, watching as the price skyrocketed and the early investors are celebrating their timely investments. It’s that classic “if only I had known!” moment. Enter BTFD Coin—one of the best new meme coins with 100X potential on fire right now! While people are still wishing they had grabbed Pepe Coin during its presale, BTFD Coin’s presale is heating up and there’s still time to join before it officially launches. As of today, over $5.78 million has been amassed, and more than 68 billion $BTFD coins have already been handed out. Plus, there’s a super exciting feature that sets BTFD Coin apart from the rest: the referral program . It enables you to earn big rewards simply by sharing the love and bringing others into the presale. You’ll get the chance to dive into that juicy detail a little later, but first, here’s a little background on that missed opportunity with Pepe Coin and how BTFD Coin could be your next golden ticket. Pepe Coin’s ICO: One for the Crypto Books The Pepe token came out of nowhere, and its ICO was nothing short of a fireworks show. Launched in April 2023, the coin quickly gained a cult following, largely due to its meme-heavy appeal, being already famous on the internet, and the surge in popularity of meme coins. By the end of its ICO, Pepe Coin raised millions of dollars, and the price soared to wild levels almost instantly after hitting the market. The Numbers Don’t Lie Launch Price: $0.0000013 per coin Peak Price: $0.00002803 (recorded last December) Current Market Cap: Over $ billion While early investors are sitting on massive gains, many missed out due to either not understanding the opportunity or, honestly, not believing in meme coins back then. For those who missed out, the FOMO is real. But don’t fret, this doesn’t have to be your fate, because BTFD Coin is ready to steal the spotlight. BTFD Coin: The Next Best New Meme Coin with 100X Potential Whether you’ve heard about it or are just diving into the meme coin scene, BTFD Coin is shaking things up. It’s currently in its 14th stage of presale, having already raised over $5.78 million, with more than 68 billion $BTFD coins sold. More than 9,800 investors are already on board, and the presale momentum is only getting stronger. But you need to learn all about that referral program—because this is where things get interesting. Here’s the lowdown: Extra Tokens for Your Friends: Anyone who uses your code to buy $50 or more will get an extra 10% BTFD tokens on top of their purchase. Leaderboard Rewards: If you make it into the top 20 on the leaderboard by the end of the month, you’ll receive a 10% bonus in BTFD tokens based on the total amount raised by your referrals. Just connect your wallet, share your unique referral code, and watch your $BTFD count go up with each passing day! Why BTFD Coin Could Transform Your Passive Income Game Get into the numbers game with a simple investment example: Say you throw down $1,000 at today’s price of $0.00016. Here’s how your potential 100X gains could play out: If the price hits $0.0006 upon listing (a 3.75x increase), your $1,000 investment will grow to $3,750 —a nice return! If BTFD Coin hits $0.006 (a 37.5x increase), your $1,000 will further explode into $37,500 . Yes, you read that right. The potential here is huge. BTFD Coin has already proven to be a crowd favorite, and with its referral rewards program, it’s making waves across the meme coin world. It also features a rewarding P2E game, staking with a 90% APY , and more. Conclusion: BTFD Coin Is Your Next Big Shot at a 100X Meme Coin If you missed Pepe Coin’s ICO, you have another shot at something massive with BTFD Coin. With its explosive presale success, a built-in referral program to earn extra tokens, and a community already over 9,800 strong, this is one of the best new meme coins with 100X potential you’ll find right now.

With the Plomin upgrade now live, ADA token holders will be able to shape Cardano's future, including voting on treasury measures and hard forks. Plomin comes just four months after Cardano implemented the “Chang” hard fork , which put in place many of the mechanisms that went into effect on Wednesday. (Hard forks are major updates made to a chain that render older versions of that blockchain as obsolete). The biggest change coming to Cardano with Plomin is the full implementation of Delegate Representatives (dReps), who will vote on governance issues on behalf of ADA token holders. Previously, Cardano's three founding entities—the Cardano Foundation, Input Output Global (IOHK) and Emurgo—were in charge of governance changes and triggering chain upgrades. Moving forward, the keys they held and those responsibilities are delegated to new Cardano governance groups. Ahead of Plomin, Stake Pool Operators needed to upgrade their nodes and approve the upgrade with a 51% vote. As of this week, roughly 85% of nodes were with the new version, allowing the network to proceed with the changes. As for what’s next with Cardano, the community is already tackling a series of new issues to implement. “In short, we want to make Cardano faster, we want to add some privacy preserving features and we want to add more utility for developers,” said Giorgio Zinetti, CTO of the Cardano Foundation, in an interview with CoinDesk. “So the development will be what the community wants.” Read more: Cardano’s Chang Hard Fork Goes Live, Introducing On-Chain Governance",Tech|Cardano|Cardano Foundation|hard fork|Upgrade,EN,0,0,ADA|FORKS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-29 21:47:58

In an earlier article on why memecoins matter , I argued that memecoins are ushering in a new era of civic engagement by forming speculative markets in which citizens are able to trade coins tied to government policies. I suggested that holder distributions and market caps in those markets would signal popular support for underlying policies to lawmakers, who would then take them into account when crafting public policy, fostering a new form of political dialogue between citizen and state. I called this dynamic PolicyFi and presented it as a constructive use of memecoins. With the Trump administration coming into office and the President-Elect and First Lady launching memecoins , it is a good time to ask if we are entering the PolicyFi era and, if so, whether we should welcome it. I believe the answer to each of these questions is yes. The convergence of a meme administration, a meme citizenry and meme advocacy has created fertile conditions for PolicyFi and, perhaps counter-intuitively, for better policy making. Meme Admin, Meme Citizenry, Meme Advocacy PolicyFi requires the installation of meme-sensitive government actors, or a “meme admin.” In the original piece, I suggested that the incoming administration fit the bill because it understood and respected the power of memes. When I wrote that, I was thinking mainly of Elon Musk and his affinity for dogecoin but also of Trump’s own adeptness at creating and harnessing memes on the campaign trail and while in office. Admittedly, the President-Elect’s issuance of his own Solana memecoin ( Trump ), soon followed by his wife’s ( Melania ), a few days before he took the oath of office surprised even me. (I suspect the timing was driven by concerns over the Emoluments Clause .) The Trump memecoins immediately soared, draining liquidity from every crypto ecosystem and almost breaking the Solana blockchain. If you are a crypto-native, you will always remember where you were when the President-Elect and soon-to-be First Lady announced the launch of their memecoins. The Trump coins sharply divided the crypto industry. But, more importantly for present purposes, they put beyond doubt that Americans had elected a “meme admin” that was prepared to engage with financialized memes, and was therefore more likely to engage with them while in office. The Trump coins contributed another essential ingredient for PolicyFi: the en masse onboarding of the citizenry to memecoins and, in particular, political coins. The stats around the Trump and Melania memecoins, which were explicitly marketed as a form of political expression, are staggering and telling. Most holders were new retail buyers. Around 50% had never bought a Solana altcoin (i.e. tokens on the Solana blockchain excluding SOL and stablecoins) before. Nearly half of buyers created their wallets on the day that they purchased the tokens, and more than 80% of Trump and Melania holders hold less than $1,000 worth of assets on Solana , further suggesting retail popularity. Many of these meme recruits seem puzzled about what to do next with their crypto. (I expect they’ll figure it out.) Alongside this meme admin and meme citizenry is the proliferation of more (and more innovative) policy-focused memecoins. Many of the policy memecoins that I mentioned in the original piece, such as D.O.G.E. (Department of Government Efficiency) and SBR (Strategic Bitcoin Reserve), attracted substantial trading volume as the new admin took office and investors began to speculate on its initial policy steps. Read more: Ivo Entchev - Why Memecoins Matter However, these policy tokens are still relatively primitive from the perspective of PolicyFi because they place more emphasis on attention flows or prediction (like a prediction market) than on engagement with government actors. Another token, MILK , fits the PolicyFi thesis better. The express purpose of the MILK meme token is to change U.S. food policy to allow for the sale of unpasteurized milk. The MILK community advances that tangible policy position through its token holdings (2,000 people hold MILK), the market cap of the token (as high as USD $1M) and the community’s production of MILK memes on social media (constant). In an era of PolicyFi, we would expect to see a Cambrian explosion of tokens in the mold of MILK. A Dialogue with Leviathan The expression of political will through meme policy markets is necessary but not sufficient for PolicyFi. Governments must also begin conversing with those markets when crafting policy. We may be seeing early indicators of this as well. President Trump has long viewed public markets and especially the stock market as a barometer of his performance and has tried to satisfy them. More recently, he has adopted a similar stance towards the price of bitcoin (which is itself a brand of financial policy) and is doubtless monitoring the price of his own memecoin, which represents the majority of his net worth on paper. Other members of the political establishment from Elon Musk to Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY.) have engaged with memes that bear on government policy. Policymakers have yet to engage with narrowly prescriptive memecoins, such as MILK. If this were to change, I would expect it to arise in disruptive areas that have spawned more general memes, such as government efficiency (e.g. D.O.G.E.), industrial policy (e.g. e/acc) and health policy (e.g. MAHA). Is PolicyFi Good for Governance? Assuming we are advancing towards PolicyFi, is that a good thing? There are a few strong reasons to believe that it is. First, introducing speculative markets into government decision-making improves the quality of the most important input in decision-making: information. Speculative markets can process a large volume of information by motivating people to acquire it, share it via trades and crystallize it into consensus prices that persuade a wider audience. A form of government known as “ futarchy ” leverages speculative policy markets specifically towards improving information flows within government and overall policymaking. Second, PolicyFi creates positive externalities, in the form of civic engagement and education, despite being driven by greed. Indeed, anyone hoping to make money in PolicyFi will need to become an expert on how the government works, how policy is made, and which emerging policies are undervalued and why. It is difficult to imagine a stronger incentive for ordinary Americans (who are already prodigious sports gamblers) to engage constructively with politics. The PolicyFi degen is, paradoxically, a model citizen. Third and finally, PolicyFi is engaging an expanding class of citizens who are internet-native and accustomed to expressing himself through speculative markets. That was the citizen drove the GameStop frenzy , which was about income inequality and sticking it to Wall Street, just as it’s currently driving the price of memecoins like SPX and Fartcoin , which lampoon traditional finance. In short, public financial markets have become the medium of ridicule, satire and political expression for a new generation that would much rather buy a memecoin or send a stock to the moon than write their congressman. A common objection to PolicyFi markets is that they are susceptible to manipulation by our enemies. This is a concern but perhaps not as big as assumed. The same argument was applied to Polymarket, the permissionless prediction market that consistently favored a decisive Trump win in the election. Despite the strong incentive for foreign interference, Polymarket was not only the best barometer of voting sentiment leading up to the election but also the best predictor of election results, affirming the information processing-power of speculative markets. My aim here is not to advocate for PolicyFi, or to be an apologist for memecoins in general. However, I believe memecoins represent a powerful viral capital formation technology that matters and will impact a range of domains, including politics. I will be watching closely, and so should you.",Opinion,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-29 21:48:49

If Dogecoin's price rebounds to $0.35, $766.45M in short positions will be liquidated. The liquidation could significantly impact Dogecoin's price movement going forward. Similarly, Solana’s price stabilized on January 28, erasing some of the losses experienced on Monday when Bitcoin and other altcoins crashed. The SOL token faces different catalysts that could push its price even higher in the longer term, including Grayscale's filing for Solana and Litecoin ETF launch and the potential inclusion into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The move comes as investors are now considering the Remittix(RTX) presale, which has seen significant milestones, including a price rally to $0.0456 and presale funding of over $9M. Dogecoin Rally to $0.35 Might Trigger Massive Short Squeeze The up-to-date liquidation heatmap suggests hefty short positions between $0.3397 and $0.3436. It also emphasizes the value of understanding high liquidity areas since they serve as magnet areas where big players or whales seize the chance to execute sizable trades, with the magnate zone sitting just below the $0.35. Liquidations play a crucial role in the crypto market and rapidly influence price swings when traders with significant leveraged positions are forced to close out. Moreover, Ali’s analysis of the Dogecoin price aligns with the overall technical analysis , which suggests that the DOGE token might be at a make-or-break juncture. Meanwhile, the price of Dogecoin remains above its crucial 0.32 Fib retracement, a support level that has been preventing further dips during the latest market sell-off. On the upside, the 0.5 retracement level at $0.394 remains a key level. A sustained recovery near this threshold could spark greater bullish confidence, with potential resistance emerging around the $0.476 and $0.592 region if Dogecoin regains enough uptrend force. Solana Price Target If It Enters The SBR Despite the Solana price dip, which led to the spread of fear within the crypto market, the SOL token has stabilized to hover above the $235 region . This recent rebound also mirrored that of most altcoins as Bitcoin surged to $103K. The recent rally in Solana’s price has been attributed to several factors, including a recent SOL overtake of Ethereum in fees, which has collected over $220M this year. Moreover, the Grayscale filling of Solana ETFs and the odds that the SEC will approve SOL ETFs rising to 86%, according to Polymarket, have also propelled the token price. This move could lead to over $6B in fresh institutional inflows. Technical indicators suggest that the price of Solana has more gains ahead. The SOL token has remained above its rising trendline, which links the lowest swings since November 2023. The SOL price has also moved past a key support level of $210, which was its March 2024 highs. Moreover, Monday’s crash also led to a small hammer candlestick pattern, a popular bullish reversal signal. Therefore, the inclusion of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could allow the SOL token to cross its ATH high, with the next target being the $500 level. Remittix (RTX): The Next DeFi Project Seeking to Capitalize On Cross-Border Payments Remittix (RTX), a PayFi altcoin, addresses cross-border transfers with its near-instant crypto-to-fiat system, freeing users from the hidden fees and tiresome processes associated with traditional processes. Rather than working through corporate deals, Remittix (RTX) opens its door to anyone looking for cheaper and faster conversions, setting it apart from competitors like Wise, Stripe, and Coinbase. Moreover, Remittix's capability to seamlessly facilitate crypto-to-fiat transactions directly to banks is something that its competitors have failed to achieve. With a transparent flat-fee model, Remittix will ensure recipients receive the amount sent without hidden charges like foreign exchange wires or conversions. This feature has positioned Remittix as the most cost-effective alternative to traditional banking systems. Beyond payments, Remittix also introduces the Pay API, allowing businesses and freelancers to accept crypto payments from customers and settle them in fiat to any bank account globally. Its merchant account gives businesses complete control over their cash-outs in over 30 fiat currencies and 50-plus crypto pairs, enhancing operational flexibility. This has already seen the RTX token raise over $9 million in presale funding. Moreover, its price has surged to $0.0456 as early investors hope to capitalize on its growing momentum. Remittixalso has a 30% running Trump Bonus that will end soon. Which Is The Best Crypto Investment for 2025? DOGE, SOL, Or RTX Dogecoin is set to liquidate $766.45M once its price hits the $0.35 level, a move that could significantly impact the future price movement of the DOGE token.

I'm Ben Schiller, CoinDesk’s Opinion and Features editor. In this issue: Movement Labs rolls out dev mainnet Cardano hard forks to decentralized governance SSV DAO unveils SSC 2.0 Musk pushes blockchain in government Network News MOVEMENT LABS ROLLS OUT DEVNET: Blockchain firm Movement Labs has deployed a developer mainnet to advance its goal of bringing Facebook (META)'s Move Virtual Machine (MoveVM) to Ethereum. The developer mainnet's launch will begin the deployment of Movement's core infrastructure and allow selected partners to start implementing decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, according to an emailed announcement on Tuesday. The release follows the initial mainnet launch of Movement in December and precedes the planned public mainnet beta release next month. Move was developed as a part of Facebook's ill-fated digital currency project Diem, which was shelved at the start of 2022 . The technology was also used to create the Sui and Aptos layer-1 networks. Movement Labs, with the help of a $38 million Series A funding round led by Polychain Capital , is extending the programming language to an Ethereum layer 2 for the first time. Coinciding with the public mainnet's deployment, Movement will also unveil a multi-asset liquidity program to provide the foundation for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Read more. CARDANO HARD FORKS TO DECENTRALIZATION: Proof-of-stake blockchain Cardano was due to switch to decentralized governance Jan. 29 after the Plomin hard fork takes effect, Cardano Foundation, a non-profit organization backing the project, said on X. ""The Plomin hard fork takes effect, marking the transition to full decentralized governance. ADA holders gain real voting power – on parameter changes, treasury withdrawals, hard forks, and the blockchain’s future,"" Cardano Foundation said . ""[It's] A milestone in blockchain governance."" Cardano's ADA token changed hands at 93 cents at press time, up 1.4% on the day, according to data from CoinDesk and TradingView. A hard fork is a non-backwards compatible change to the blockchain's programming. The Plomin hard fork needs Stake Pool Operators to upgrade their nodes and approve the upgrade with a 51% vote. As of last week, nearly 80% of nodes had elevated to the new version. Read more. SSV DAO 2.0: The SSV DAO, the decentralized autonomous organization behind the decentralized staking protocol SSV Network , unveiled a new framework, called “SSV 2.0,” allowing applications to make use of “based” technology by leveraging Ethereum validators. SSV 2.0 will be the most ambitious project for the SSV Network, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk, and will bring based applications (bApps) to Ethereum. “Based” applications, especially “based rollups,” are a new type of technology attracting the attention of Ethereum developers as it allows for better interoperability while improving the security of networks on top of Ethereum. Based rollups specifically can be seen as a solution to the many layer-2 networks on Ethereum today, which have caused much fragmentation across the space. By leveraging “based” technology, those protocols or applications can “base” their security and execution operations off of Ethereum’s layer-1 validator set. Currently, layer-2 networks use “sequencers” to order transactions and post those back to Ethereum. Sequencers are criticized for being single points of failure. By using layer-1 validators to do the execution and security work, networks can avoid the downfalls of using centralized sequencers. Ethereum developers agree that based rollups allow for better interoperability in the network. Ethereum ecosystem members have gathered over the last few weeks to find ways to solve this issue, and based rollups are seen as a major breakthrough for that. Now the SSV Network will also tackle these issues by bringing applications with based technology to Ethereum. Read more. MUSK PUSHES BLOCKCHAIN: in his role leading the new Department for Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), Elon Musk suggested that using a digital ledger would be a cost-efficient way to track federal spending, secure data, make payments and manage buildings, according to people familiar with the matter. Several representatives of public blockchains have met with affiliates of D.O.G.E., the people said. The department was created in response to the federal government’s spending of $6.7 trillion in fiscal 2024, which Musk in October called “wasted” money . He promised the department — whose acronym is a nod to Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency, dogecoin (DOGE) — would slash the figure to at most $2 trillion. Given the department’s name and Trump’s determination to establish crypto-friendly policies in the U.S., Musk’s plan to incorporate blockchain technology doesn’t come as a surprise. In addition to creating D.O.G.E. on Jan. 20, Trump signed an executive order to create a working group on digital assets led by venture capitalist David Sacks with a mandate to identify all regulations that currently touch crypto within 30 days, among other things.

While major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH) have strong use cases, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN sets itself apart as the most exciting opportunity for exponential value creation. Here’s why this token is dominating the conversation. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stands Out 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity With a total supply capped at 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN ensures scarcity that fuels long-term value. Unlike BTC and LTC, which have slower growth due to high circulation, this token’s deflationary model guarantees increasing demand. 2. Exclusive Availability Unlike UNI and DOT, which are available on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity gives early adopters an edge and keeps the token’s growth stable and controlled. 3. Unparalleled Growth Potential Analysts project that THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN could deliver returns of up to 2,000%, thanks to its early-stage momentum and community-driven development. While Bitcoin and Polkadot are well-established, they can’t match the rapid trajectory of this groundbreaking token. 4. Investor Demand at Record Levels Raising $1,000,000 within minutes of its presale launch, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven its appeal. Investors recognize its potential to redefine the market, driving interest far beyond what UNI, BTC, or LTC have recently seen. How THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Compares Uniswap (UNI): A strong DeFi platform but lacks the exclusivity and demand-driving scarcity of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Polkadot (DOT): Reliable for interoperability but cannot match the early-stage explosive growth seen here. Bitcoin (BTC): A store of value, yet its market maturity limits growth opportunities compared to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Litecoin (LTC): Known for efficiency, but it hasn’t captured the market excitement that this new token has. Secure Your Tokens Today THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers unmatched features and exponential growth potential, making it the standout crypto of 2025.

Users can earn these points by engaging with the platform, creating original content related to cryptocurrency, and interacting with others, particularly those in the Inner Circle CT group. The recent launch of Kaito Connect, a pre-token generation event (TGE) launchpad, allows users to vote on selected projects based on their Yap points. This initiative is generating interest among creators, who can monetize their Yap votes for $3 to $5 each weekly. The first wave of voting has reportedly yielded valuable rewards, indicating a promising start for Kaito's airdrop strategy.

Polygon (POL) Bold Prediction Amid Market Downturn Today, January 30, 2025, while examining the current outlook, the expert noted that POL is on the verge of a 44% price drop, potentially reaching the $0.23 level. #Polygon $POL could be on the verge of a 44% correction to $0.23! pic.twitter.com/QLg7GkmfXX — Ali (@ali_charts) January 29, 2025 However, this post on X has gained widespread attention from the crypto community due to its massive price drop prediction. The potential reason for this prediction is the bearish market sentiment and the formation of bearish price action on the daily time frame. Polygon (POL) Technical Analysis and Price Action According to expert technical analysis, with the recent price drop, POL has breached the support of its descending triangle price action pattern and has successfully retested the breakout area. Based on historical price momentum, if POL holds below the $0.45 level, there is a strong possibility it could drop by 30%, reaching the $0.29 level. Source: Trading view At present, POL is trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame, indicating that it is in a downtrend. On the negative side, POL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands just above the oversold area, suggesting that the asset has enough room to continue its price drop in the future. Investors Found Dumping POL Tokens Looking at the bearish price action and price prediction, investors and long-term holders have been seen dumping their tokens, as revealed by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from the spot inflow/outflow shows that exchanges have witnessed an inflow of $2.56 million worth of POL in the past 24 hours. In the cryptocurrency landscape, inflow refers to the movement of assets from holders’ wallets to exchanges, which potentially signals dumping and sell-offs. However, it has the potential to create selling pressure and lead to further price decline. Current Price Momentum POL is currently trading near $0.40 and has witnessed a price surge of over 2.75% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume jumped by 15%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|MATIC|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-29 22:03:39
