This surge is not merely a speculative dream; it is grounded in a confluence of market dynamics, technological advancements, and growing institutional interest. Meanwhile, RCO Finance (RCOF) , an emerging altcoin, is capturing attention with its ambitious trajectory from $0.1 to an astonishing $3 within the same timeframe. Built on the Ethereum ecosystem, investors believe its potential surge will be within the same timeframe. Ethereum Price Journey to $10,000: Institutional Backing and National Reserve Speculation The Recent Ethereum price performance has positioned it as a top contender for institutional investors, sparking discussions of its price reaching $10,000. Currently oscillating at around $3,087, Ethereum’s market capitalization has surpassed $410 billion, with trading volumes increasing by 34% to $34 billion daily. Bullish sentiment is evident as Ethereum futures open interest hit $33 billion, signaling strong confidence among traders. The driving force behind this optimism is Ethereum’s potential inclusion in the United States’ national digital asset reserves, a development that could dramatically increase demand. World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance project with ties to Donald Trump, has accelerated its accumulation of Ethereum, amassing 74,228 ETH, nearly half acquired in just three days. This institutional interest underscores Ethereum’s growing recognition as a valuable asset. With technical patterns indicating an impending rally and institutional demand soaring, the Ethereum price seems poised for explosive growth. Analysts widely expect it to challenge $10,000 within months. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Altcoin on Whale’s Radar Set to benefit from the potential Ethereum price surge, RCO Finance (RCOF) uses Ethereum’s network to build a unique, AI-integrated DeFi project. This innovation improves user engagement and boosts trading returns, making RCOF an attractive investment option for all investors.. At the core of RCO Finance’s appeal is its AI Robo Advisor, designed to simplify investing for everyone. Imagine a new trader unsure where to begin, this tool analyzes market trends, historical data, and live price movements from sources like Reuters to create personalized strategies tailored to individual goals.

Even those with little market experience can achieve efficient results, making RCOF a game-changer in DeFi, bridging the gap between innovation and user accessibility. Moreover, RCO Finance addresses a critical challenge in cryptocurrency trading: the need for diversification. By offering access to over 120,000 asset classes, including traditional stocks, bonds, ETFs , and tokenized real-world assets like real estate, RCOF empowers investors to build well-rounded portfolios. Enhancing its appeal, RCO Finance introduces an Automated Market Making (AMM) system powered by ML algorithms, ensuring a fast and profitable trading experience. Additionally, RCOF provides leverage options of up to 1000x, allowing traders to significantly amplify their potential returns, even with modest initial investments. With its recent beta launch , RCO Finance has introduced a sleek, cutting-edge interface that’s already turning heads, drawing over 10,000 users in record time. While the current features are impressive, the buzz is building around the upcoming alpha phase, now in testing, which promises game-changing upgrades. Security and user privacy are paramount in today’s crypto landscape, and RCO Finance excels in this area with its no-KYC policy. Regular audits by SolidProof further bolster user confidence in the platform’s reliability and integrity. The Lucrative RCO Finance (RCOF) Presale As RCO Finance prepares for the alpha launch of the platform, the presale is significantly gaining traction. The RCOF token presale has raised over $12 million, with its Stage 5 public presale picking pace.

Moreover, analysts project the potential surge of the platform to over $3 translating to over 25000% in ROI from the current price. Investing now allows you to benefit from discounted prices and grants access to exclusive features such as staking opportunities that yield attractive returns and quarterly dividends based on holdings. Moreover, holders of the RCOF token have access to governing rights, which play an important role in key decision-making.

With Bitcoin holding strong above $100,000 and a surge of interest in decentralized solutions, the opportunities for profit are abundant. This article highlights the best cryptos to buy now, focusing on projects that combine innovation, scalability, and real-world utility to position themselves as leaders in the next wave of blockchain growth. 1. Web3Bay (3BAY) Web3Bay (3BAY) is transforming the online shopping experience with its innovative decentralized platform. Built on a secure Layer-1 blockchain, Web3Bay empowers users with full control over their transactions and data, offering a refreshing alternative to traditional e-commerce giants. By utilizing smart contracts and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), Web3Bay ensures secure and transparent transactions while minimizing the risk of data breaches. This creates a trustworthy and efficient marketplace where buyers and sellers can connect directly, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing costs. But Web3Bay’s appeal goes beyond just security and efficiency. Its native token, 3BAY, offers a range of benefits for users, including a 5% discount on purchases, staking rewards, and voting rights on key platform decisions. This fosters a strong community and incentivizes user engagement, creating a thriving ecosystem around the Web3Bay platform. The ongoing presale of 3BAY has already demonstrated strong investor confidence, raising over $950,000 across four stages. With over 250 million tokens sold and a projected launch price of $0.1959, early investors are looking at a potential 6,430% return on investment. This impressive performance underscores the demand for decentralized e-commerce solutions and positions Web3Bay as a leading contender in the Web3 space. 2. TRUMP ($TRUMP) The recent launch of the $TRUMP meme coin has generated significant attention, highlighting the influence of public figures and market sentiment on the crypto world. After an initial surge that saw the coin’s price peak at $75, $TRUMP has stabilized around $38.64, reflecting the inherent volatility of meme coins. While the long-term trajectory of $TRUMP remains uncertain, some analysts predict a potential rise to $132.11 by February 2025, fueled by ongoing developments and political influences. However, investors should approach meme coins with caution, recognizing their speculative nature and the potential for significant price fluctuations. 3. Raydium (RAY) Raydium is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM) built on the Solana blockchain, known for its high speed and low fees. As of January 2025, RAY is trading at $7.53. Raydium’s recent introduction of perpetual futures trading has significantly expanded its offerings and attracted a surge in trading volume. With over 70 trading pairs and up to 40x leverage, Raydium is becoming a key player in the DeFi space, providing users with advanced trading tools and opportunities. 4. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that plays a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem. By enabling smart contracts to securely interact with real-world data, Chainlink provides a vital link between the blockchain and the physical world. Currently priced at $24.64, LINK has experienced a slight decline from its previous close. However, Chainlink continues to expand its ecosystem and form strategic partnerships, strengthening its position as a foundational component of the blockchain infrastructure. As the demand for reliable and tamper-proof data integration grows, Chainlink’s importance will only increase, making it a compelling long-term investment. Investing in the Future of Crypto February 2025 presents a unique opportunity for crypto investors to capitalize on the growing momentum in the market. Whether you’re seeking the stability of established platforms like Chainlink or the explosive potential of emerging projects like Web3Bay, there are ample opportunities to diversify your portfolio and potentially achieve significant returns. By focusing on projects with robust ecosystems, proven utility, and forward-looking roadmaps, you can align your investments with the evolving dynamics of the blockchain world and position yourself for success in the exciting future of crypto.

Analyst Weighs In,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoins-next-move-a-final-leg-up-or-just-the-beginning-analyst-weighs-in/,"Bitcoin is showing signs of a gradual recovery following its earlier pullback. After dipping below the $100,000 mark, the cryptocurrency has regained ground, currently trading above $102,000. This represents a 6.3% increase over the past two weeks. Amid this upward trajectory, a CryptoQuant analyst has assessed the patterns of Bitcoin’s realized capitalization and UTXO age bands for clues about what might come next. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hovers Above $104K—Analyst Reveals What’s Next Based on Funding Rates What the Data Suggests About Bitcoin’s Future IT Tech, a contributor to the CryptoQuant QuickTake Platform, recently shared insights on Bitcoin’s current cycle behavior. According to the analysis, the proportion of younger UTXOs—coins that have moved recently—has begun to rise. Historically, high levels of younger UTXOs have coincided with cycle tops, as seen during the peaks of 2013, 2017, and 2021. Although the current cycle has not yet reached these extreme levels, the increase in younger UTXOs suggests that newer market entrants are becoming more active. According to IT Tech, based on historical trends, a high proportion of young UTXOs typically signals increased speculation, which can lead to heightened volatility and a potential market top. If this trend continues, Bitcoin could see another leg up before significant distribution takes place. Conversely, if long-term holders maintain their positions, the current rally may still have room to grow. IT Tech emphasized that while current indicators point to increased market activity, the younger UTXO levels remain below historical peaks. Bitcoin’s Next Move: Are We Approaching a Cycle Top or Just Gaining Momentum? “Suggests that we are entering a phase of increased market activity, but the proportion of young UTXOs is not yet at the historical peak levels.” – By @IT_Tech_PL Link 👇https://t.co/fVO3Kuavlw pic.twitter.com/pxegbBrpBX — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 28, 2025 This provides room for Bitcoin to continue its upward trajectory, but market participants should remain vigilant. IT Tech concluded by noting: The chart suggests that we are entering a phase of increased market activity, but the proportion of young UTXOs is not yet at the historical peak levels. This could mean that Bitcoin still has room for further upside, but traders should closely monitor the ratio of young coins to long-term holdings for potential warning signs of a top. Bitcoin Market Performance At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at a price of $102,768 marking a 1.3% increase in the past day. This slight surge in price has boosted BTC’s market cap back above $2 trillion—a notable surge from $1.96 trillion seen on Monday. Interestingly, despite this increase, Bitcoin’s daily trading volume has seen an opposite trend currently sitting at a valuation of $50.2 billion, a notable decrease from over $100 billion seen last week.

According to the company announcement shared with Cryptonews , the campaign will feature a variety of learning modules, engaging challenges, and interactive experiences. A Deep Dive Into the Soneium Ecosystem Soneium Conquest invites creators, developers, and blockchain enthusiasts to explore the Soneium ecosystem and discover the potential of Web3 . The campaign, hosted on the Galxe platform, will focus on four key areas: creativity, connection, joy, and immersion. We’re thrilled to announce our latest integration with @soneium !

The second week will focus on how Soneium works with its community and boosts communication and collaborations within the digital realm. Weeks three and four will delve into the world of blockchain gaming , showcasing how Soneium leverages entertainment and fosters user engagement. Soneium Aims to Empower Creativity and Openness Soneium, an Ethereum Layer-2 developed by Sony BSL, is a platform designed to empower creativity and foster a more open and inclusive internet. On Jan. 14, Sony launched the mainnet for Soneium to streamline blockchain interactions and provide a more user-friendly Web3 experience. Built on the OP Stack from the Optimism Foundation, the platform incorporates Sony’s non-fungible token (NFT ) -based Fan Marketing Platform and Soneium Spark, which support creators, developers, and fans. Soneium also leverages partnerships with Sony Pictures, Sony Music, and Sony Music Publishing. These collaborations utilize NFTs to grant fans access to exclusive content and foster deeper engagement with their favorite artists and entertainment. Mixed Reactions and Clarification on Blacklisting The mainnet launch has received a mixed response from the community. While some users praised the platform’s potential, others expressed concerns regarding the “blacklisting” of certain contract addresses.

These claims stem from Soneium’s policy of restricting addresses suspected of intellectual property (IP) infringement, which is outlined in their official documentation. . @soneium rugged users >$100k in ETH on launch day I've never seen anything like it Want to be a permissioned chain? fine.

The company confirmed that users and developers have the right to appeal these decisions and that proactive communication is ongoing. According to Soneium, no funds were frozen, and the blacklist only restricted public RPC interaction with the flagged contracts.

According to blockchain “de-anonymizing” platform Arkham , the UK government holds about $6,270,000,000 worth of Bitcoin, most of it from when it seized coins belonging to convicted money launderer Jian Wen. Prosecutors say Wen converted Bitcoin into cash and property, though her lawyers allege that someone else was the brains behind the operation. Now, with holes in the UK’s fiscal situation, the Daily Mail reports that Rachel Reeves, the UK’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, has been instructed by insiders to consult with experts on when to sell the BTC to achieve the best deal for the British taxpayer. Says Chris Etherington, a partner at accounting firm RSM, “There is a strong case for selling the Bitcoin right away. The currency is too volatile, too speculative. Rachel Reeves will be looking at it given the political pressure she is under as she waits for the Office For Budget Responsibility forecasts. Germany cashed in last year. Let’s face it – it is a get out of jail free card for her.” Says lawyer Quentin Hunt, “It [forfeited crypto-currency] gets paid back into the public purse to the Consolidated Fund, which is where all the monies go to which are effectively seized. That money is managed by the Treasury – so it effectively goes back into the public purse.” Last year, the German government sold off 50,000 of its BTC under similar circumstances.

Over the years, blockchain technology has evolved, and with it, the crypto market has grown into a diverse ecosystem of tokens, projects, and use cases. From smart contracts to decentralized finance (DeFi), crypto projects now serve as alternative investment instruments, offering both innovation and significant returns. For investors seeking to escape the volatility of traditional stocks or diversify their portfolios, crypto has proven to be an attractive option. It’s not just about speculative trading anymore; it’s about tapping into the future of digital economies and decentralized systems. Among the growing pool of projects, some names have established themselves as cornerstones in the industry. In this article, let’s explore three standout crypto projects: Qubetics , Hedera, and Ethereum. Each has carved its niche and continues to shape the investment landscape. From disruptive presales to well-established giants, these projects cater to different appetites and investment strategies. Qubetics: The Best Crypto Presale to Buy for 2025 Qubetics is revolutionizing the crypto market as the world’s first Web3 aggregator , designed to simplify and enhance access to decentralized applications (DApps), DeFi services, and blockchain networks. By focusing on interoperability, Qubetics enables seamless communication across multiple blockchains, removing the friction that typically bogs down the Web3 experience. Imagine a world where businesses, professionals, and individuals can interact with different blockchains as easily as opening apps on a smartphone. That’s what Qubetics is aiming for. For example, a logistics company operating in South America could use Qubetics to track shipments on a Hedera-based supply chain network while simultaneously processing payments on an Ethereum-based DeFi app. Such interoperability isn’t just a fancy buzzword; it’s the foundation for real-world efficiency and innovation. Now, let’s dive into the numbers that are making waves. As of January 28, 2025, Qubetics is in its 19th presale stage, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.0606. Over 449 million tokens have already been sold, raising an impressive $11.2 million from more than 16,900 token holders. Analysts predict the $TICS token could reach $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering early investors a potential return of 312.18%. Looking further ahead, predictions for $TICS range from $1 to $15 post-mainnet launch, translating into returns as high as 24,630.58% for early adopters. Such numbers highlight why Qubetics is considered the best crypto presale to buy for 2025. Its emphasis on interoperability, coupled with its groundbreaking Web3 aggregation capabilities, positions it as a must-watch project. Whether you’re a business streamlining operations or an individual exploring blockchain use cases, Qubetics is redefining what’s possible. Hedera: The Enterprise Blockchain Solution Hedera Hashgraph has always stood out for its enterprise-grade solutions and eco-friendly design. Leveraging its unique Hashgraph consensus algorithm, Hedera offers a fast, secure, and energy-efficient alternative to traditional blockchains. With transaction speeds exceeding 10,000 TPS (transactions per second), Hedera has attracted enterprises seeking scalability without compromising on security. In recent developments, Hedera integrated with MetaMask via HIP-583, enhancing accessibility to its DApps. This move opens the door for MetaMask users to explore Hedera’s ecosystem seamlessly. Additionally, Hedera’s stablecoin remittance pilot with Shinhan Bank and SCB TechX has demonstrated the network’s capability in cross-border transactions, settling payments in real-time across multiple fiat currencies like the Thai Baht and South Korean Won. Hedera’s market position is solidified by its governing council, which includes industry giants such as Google, IBM, and Boeing. These partnerships bring credibility to the project and underscore its commitment to building a sustainable, decentralized future. For investors, Hedera’s $0.32 price point as of January 28, 2025, offers a gateway into a high-performance network that’s reshaping industries ranging from finance to healthcare. Known for its transparency and low environmental impact, Hedera remains a go-to project for businesses and developers looking for reliable blockchain solutions. Its success proves that crypto isn’t just about speculation; it’s about solving real-world problems. Ethereum: The Pioneer of Smart Contracts Ethereum needs no introduction. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum has set the standard for what a blockchain network can achieve. Its introduction of smart contracts laid the foundation for decentralized applications, fueling the rise of DeFi, NFTs, and countless innovations. While Ethereum’s early days were marked by scalability challenges, the network’s transition to Ethereum 2.0 has significantly improved its performance. The move to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) has reduced energy consumption by over 99%, making it more environmentally friendly and future-proof. With an active developer community and ongoing upgrades, Ethereum continues to be the backbone of the blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum is trading at $3,205.44, reflecting its robust market position. Investors often see Ethereum as the “blue chip” of crypto, a stable and reliable asset in a volatile market. Its versatility—from hosting DeFi protocols to powering metaverse projects—has made Ethereum a favorite among developers and institutions alike. Ethereum’s dominance in the blockchain space is a testament to its innovative spirit and adaptability. While newer projects like Qubetics and Hedera offer niche solutions, Ethereum remains the generalist that continues to expand the boundaries of what’s possible in crypto. Conclusion: Why Qubetics Stands Out Qubetics, Hedera, and Ethereum each offer unique value propositions, making them standout players in the crypto world. However, for those looking to get in early on a project with groundbreaking potential, Qubetics is the best crypto presale to buy for 2025 . With its focus on interoperability, Web3 aggregation, and jaw-dropping analyst predictions, $TICS is setting itself apart as a game-changer. Don’t miss out on what could be one of the most lucrative opportunities in the crypto space. The presale is already generating significant buzz, and every stage brings it closer to reshaping how blockchains work together.

Table of Contents Analysts split between $500 and $50 for Solana Toncoin’s potential to hit $20 1Fuel positioned for growth Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON) are known for their high growth potential, with analysts predicting substantial increases. However, traders are preferring a new altcoin, 1Fuel (OFT), over these already popular cryptocurrencies. 1Fuel is also set to achieve massive growth this year, and this growth is expected to be especially better because it’s still in the presale stage. Analysts split between $500 and $50 for Solana Solana has had ups and downs lately, although the token increased by 21.11% in the past month. Analysts have both bearish and bullish forecasts for SOL, and there’s no telling which one is more likely. The bullish forecasts expect SOL to hit the $500 mark, supported by the Solana ecosystem growth. If this happens, SOL might remain a leading crypto investment for this year. On the other hand, critics suggest concerns over market volatility and competition from other altcoins can drive SOL down to $50. Toncoin’s potential to hit $20 Toncoin is currently valued at $4.79, with an 8.23% decline over the past week. Most analysts suggest it’s unlikely for TON to leap to $20, as this would be an increase of over 250% from its current price. However, they are optimistic that it will continue to surge owing to its ecosystem, which is elevating among other top Layer-1 blockchains.

It has already sold over 159 million tokens, a significant milestone that has boosted investor confidence. 1Fuel is growing even further because of its DEX wallet, offering an edge over MetaMask and Trust Wallet. Traders are picking 1Fuel over tokens like Solana and Toncoin, relying on its robust DeFi ecosystem to drive further growth after its public listing in Q2 2025. 1Fuel will support diverse financial tools in its DEX wallet, which will make it easy for users to manage their assets. These include a P2P exchange, crypto debit and credit cards, and AI tools. What’s more, users can transact across blockchains with the cross-chain swap, which offers another edge over established platforms like MetaMask. To keep user information safe and private, the 1Fuel DEX wallet will feature an inbuilt privacy mixer, disposable wallets, and more. These features make 1Fuel a potentially leading crypto in 2025.

The ministry will draft an amendment to the Enforcement Decree of the Prosecutors’ Office Act. And the ministry’s move could also “adjust the number of prosecutors” assigned to the unit. This, it reportedly says, will allow the prosecution to “respond to virtual asset crime efficiently and systematically.” The unit, as its name suggests, comprises more than just prosecutors. Its members also belong to regulatory bodies like the Financial Supervisory Service and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). Other government bodies are also involved, including the National Tax Service, the Korea Customs Service, and the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation.

In a memo reportedly sent on Jan. 24, the Navy informed personnel that the generative AI model must not be used “in any capacity,” citing serious security and ethical risks tied to its Chinese origins. The directive applies to both work-related and personal use, according to a Jan. 28 report by CNBC. This strict decision comes as DeepSeek’s AI technology crashes global financial markets and triggers debate about the future of AI and US dominance in it. But the Navy’s warning, which was distributed to all operational personnel, actually came days before the markets went ballistic over DeepSeek’s latest model, R1, which rivals tech from US companies like OpenAI. Navy sees security risks The memo, distributed under the Operational Navy (OpNav) system, left no room for ambiguity. CNBC claims it read: “We would like to bring to your attention a critical update regarding a new AI model called DeepSeek. It is imperative that all personnel refrain from downloading, installing, or using DeepSeek’s AI in any capacity. This includes work-related tasks and personal use.” The message was signed off by the Naval Air Warfare Center Division Cyber Workforce Manager, showing the high-level concerns over DeepSeek. Unsurprisingly, the concern comes mainly from DeepSeek’s status as an open-source model, meaning it is accessible to developers worldwide, including those operating in high-risk environments. America thinks that’s a problem, likely because they are not familiar with open-source at all. DeepSeek claims the R1 was built in just two months with a modest $6 million budget. The app has since skyrocketed to the top of Apple’s App Store, overtaking OpenAI’s ChatGPT in popularity. But according to the report, the Pentagon has gotten more and more wary of the AI’s rapid adoption, particularly given its origins in a country under heavy US tech sanctions. The ban also comes as DeepSeek temporarily restricted user registrations earlier this week, citing “large-scale malicious attacks” on its systems. Operations resumed shortly afterward, but the incident heightened concerns over the security vulnerabilities of open-source. Trump calls DeepSeek a ‘wake-up call’ “DeepSeek is a wake-up call,” President Donald Trump, who took office just last week, declared during a press briefing on Jan. 27. “America’s tech companies need to step up. This is not the time to get comfortable.” David Sacks, a venture capitalist and Trump’s newly appointed AI and crypto czar, also commented on the situation, saying, “DeepSeek R1 shows just how competitive the AI race has become. I’m confident in the US, but we cannot afford complacency.” The Trump administration’s first major AI deal was last week’s announcement of Stargate, a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. The project will funnel over $500 billion into AI infrastructure in a mission to solidify America’s AI dominance. DeepSeek has done a lot of damage though. On Monday, Nvidia suffered its worst trading day since March 2020, with shares plummeting by 16.9%. Broadcom followed closely, with its stock falling 17%. Together, these two giants lost $800 billion in market value, making the worst kind of history. Micron Technology and Arm Holdings dropped over 11% and 10%, respectively, while AMD and Broadcom saw losses of 6% and 17%. Even power infrastructure companies tied to AI development, like Constellation Energy and Vistra, faced massive declines of up to 28%. Nvidia did come out and acknowledge DeepSeek’s innovation that very same day. In a statement to CNBC, the chipmaker said, “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. Their work shows how new models can be created using widely available models and export-compliant compute.” Meanwhile, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has reportedly launched four “war rooms” within its generative AI department to address the competitive threat that is DeepSeek. These teams are gonna be developing strategies to defeat their newfound Chinese rival, according to a Jan. 27 report by The Information.

This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Fuks Robots can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Robots could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Robots launched with over $40,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Robots on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Robots by entering its contract address (CA) – 9yuANCwHs443YpCDnUr2GfSkDSTxUweQL1m2vMaYnTT5 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-28 23:40:00

Arctic Pablo is Your Opportunity Among the Top New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns,https://thecoinrise.com/skip-goatseus-maximus-arctic-pablo-is-your-opportunity-among-the-top-new-meme-coins-for-exponential-returns/,"Meme coins have overtaken the crypto world, turning everyday investors into overnight millionaires. From Dogecoin’s initial days to Shiba Inu’s rise, the frenzy around meme coins is undeniable. But what about the missed chances? Remember when Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) first launched? Early adopters saw meteoric returns. If you’re feeling the FOMO, it’s not too late to get in on the next big thing. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) has arrived to rewrite the script. Its unique presale structure and explosive ROI potential make it the perfect opportunity for anyone seeking the top new meme coins for exponential returns. Arctic Pablo: The New Frontier in Meme Coins In the frigid, mythical expanse of the Arctic, a daring adventurer named Pablo embarks on an extraordinary journey. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) captures the magic of this story, combining it with an exciting new presale model that has the crypto world buzzing. Unlike traditional meme coins, Arctic Pablo isn’t just a token—it’s a movement. Each phase of its presale represents a new location on Pablo’s epic journey, creating urgency and excitement. Currently in Glacier Grove, the seventh location of the presale, Arctic Pablo Coin is priced at just $0.000043. With over $550,000 already raised and a final presale price of $0.0008, early investors can secure incredible returns. Upon its listing price of $0.008, APC promises an ROI of 18,546%. Let’s break that down. Investing $500 now gives you 11,627,835 APC. At launch, that investment would be worth a staggering $93,022.68. If that doesn’t grab your attention, nothing will. Arctic Pablo’s deflationary tokenomics add even more value. With weekly token burns for unsold coins, the total supply is continually reduced, creating scarcity and boosting demand. Investors can also participate in staking, earning an eye-popping 66% APY. This staking program locks tokens for two months post-launch, rewarding long-term holders while fueling the ecosystem’s growth. Arctic Pablo isn’t just a coin; it’s a story you don’t want to miss. It is one of the Top New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns . The Rise and Missed Opportunity of Goatseus Maximus Goatseus Maximus entered the meme coin scene with a bang, offering a mix of humor, community-driven appeal, and massive potential. During its early days, GOAT’s price was less than a fraction of a cent, but as word spread, its value skyrocketed. Investors who bought in during the initial phase saw gains they could’ve only dreamed of. From its presale days to its peak, Goatseus Maximus minted millionaires. However, not everyone was so lucky. Despite its success, GOAT’s appeal as a fresh opportunity has waned. With a market cap near $200 million and over 999 million coins in circulation, the once underdog has cemented its position, leaving little room for exponential growth. It’s no longer the low-entry giant it once was, and for those seeking the next breakout star, it’s time to look elsewhere. This is where Arctic Pablo Coin comes into play. While Goatseus Maximus might have been the meme coin of yesterday, Arctic Pablo is shaping up to be the meme coin of tomorrow. If you missed GOAT, Arctic Pablo offers a fresh chance to capitalize on an icy-hot opportunity. Conclusion: Your Chance to Ride the Arctic Wave Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin is the ultimate opportunity among the top new meme coins for exponential returns. Its presale structure, deflationary tokenomics, and staking rewards make it a once-in-a-lifetime chance to enter the crypto market at the ground level. The story of Pablo’s journey and the coin’s explosive ROI potential set Arctic Pablo apart from anything else in the meme coin universe. Don’t let this chance slip away. With weekly price increases and token burns, the window to secure Arctic Pablo at its lowest price is closing fast. Join the presale now and become part of the legend. This isn’t just an investment; it’s an adventure.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With Bitcoin and Cardano’s momentum waning, an expert suggests including Panshibi in portfolios. Table of Contents More chops for the Bitcoin price Cardano shows big sell-offs Panshibi: The new frontier in memecoins Conclusion In 2024, Bitcoin (BTC) experienced significant growth. However, its price is currently consolidating. Additionally, recent news regarding Cardano (ADA) indicates a bearish outlook. In contrast, Panshibi (SHIBI) is getting attention as a promising option. A prominent expert suggests that the new altcoin could experience a massive rally following its launch, with a target of 100x gains. More chops for the Bitcoin price The Bitcoin price is currently trading sideways. An analyst shared that new capital has been going to BTC these past weeks, even though its price hasn’t really moved. This isn’t very surprising as it takes millions of dollars actually to move the Bitcoin price in any direction. Because of this, experts believe that BTC will continue to chop. Cardano shows big sell-offs According to recent data, Cardano whales have sold over 180 million ADA tokens. ADA is currently trading at $0.91, with a dip of over 8% in the past week. This drop in price is mainly because of the recent sell-offs. Experts believe Cardano whales are selling because of ADA’s slow movements, with the crypto failing to go back above $1 after the post-elections rally. This shows that Cardano is losing strength and maybe even interest from the market. As such, experts believe that ADA’s price will continue to fall or remain in its current range for the coming weeks.

As a new memecoin, Panshibi has massive potential ahead, with its launch coming at a time when memecoins are still dominating the market. Panshibi also brings a new vision to the market, combining three huge communities – Asia, pandas, and memecoins. Panshibi isn’t just a regular memecoin. This project comes with utility and long-term potential. Its tokenomics show that 60% of the total SHIBI supply will be allocated to the presale and another 15% for staking and community rewards. The rest will be set aside for marketing and CEX listings. As for the roadmap, Panshibi plans to grow its community by offering lucrative staking rewards, access to NFTs, and participating in charities. All of these are set to boost Panshibi’s visibility and allure to the general population. Conclusion SHIBI is currently in Stage 1 of its presale, offering tokens at $0.002. Joining in Stage 1 could bring 1,200% presale gains, as SHIBI is set to launch at $0.026. However, these gains could be short compared to what SHIBI might bring after it launches. Since SHIBI has potential and is focused on growth, experts see its price rising by 100x. They also believe that SHIBI will continue its run after that, potentially becoming a major player in the crypto space. For more information on Panshibi, visit their website , Telegram , or Twitter .

BTC open interest declined by 17,225 BTC, the largest daily decline. Analysts at K33 Research estimate that the decline in OI was driven by active market participants who reduced their exposure by 14,875 BTC tokens. Data shows that January contracts expiring on Friday could push OI lower. Though premiums may have returned to slightly positive territory, CME activity is a clear indicator of bearish sentiment among derivatives traders and favors caution this week. Bitcoin’s Monday decline could be considered noise on the longer timeframe, however the aggressive derisking on CME fuels a narrative of caution among traders as BTC premium slipped into the negative territory for the first time.

Bitfinex analysts identified the 30-day rolling Pearson correlation between Bitcoin, the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ as 0.7. The numbers are coincidental but likely an indicator of traders treating BTC as a risk-on asset, moving in lockstep with traditional equities. Over the course of last week, Bitcoin options implied volatility reduced by 13%. It can be interpreted as traders expecting no major movements in BTC price this week. Bitcoin traders keep their eyes peeled for the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision this week. Considering the impact of the previous FOMC meeting, the sentiment has shifted towards derisking ahead of the announcement, traders can gear for a decline in BTC price prior to the announcement. Bitcoin price has noted heightened volatility within the first 20-30 minutes post U.S. macro releases since the beginning of the bull run in 2024. DeepSeek’s launch impacted NVIDIA negatively, and BTC was not immune to the event. DeepSeek therefore eclipsed the “Trump effect” on Bitcoin, even as traders await updates on the national Bitcoin stockpile and strategic reserve, events in tech and AI continue to jolt BTC and altcoins, alongside equities. Top 5 altcoins to watch during the shifting AI and tech tide Data from SoSoValue, an AI-powered crypto investment platform, shows that the DeFAI and AI agents category has corrected the most in response to DeepSeek’s arrival in the U.S. market. The DeFAI sector’s market cap corrected 28.73% in 24 hours. The top four tokens in the sector suffered double-digit corrections, over 20%. Among DeFAI tokens, Griffain ( GRIFFAIN ), Orbit (GRIFT), Hive AI (BUZZ) and Neur.sh (NEUR) noted steep corrections on Monday; the tokens have started their recovery in the past 24 hours. Top 5 tokens in the DeFAI category on CoinGecko | Source: CoinGecko In the AI agents category, leading projects such as Fartcoin and mainstream AI tokens, ai16z, AIXBT, and AI Rig Complex were corrected in double-digits. The meme coin sector was not immune to DeepSeek’s release and suffered over 8% decline in its market capitalization within a 24 hour timeframe. Pepe ( PEPE ) observed the steepest correction in the top meme coins, down by 11.33% on Monday, offering sidelined buyers an opportunity to buy the dip. Layer 1 tokens suffered the least among other categories, and tokens like Jupiter ( JUP ) and Onyxcoin bucked the trend, emerging as key altcoins to add to a portfolio to tackle similar events in the future. Expert insights on AI market trends, crypto portfolios Jawad Ashraf, CEO of Vanar, a decentralized Layer 1 blockchain focused on RWA adoption, believes crypto’s short history and frequent “regime shifts” offer limited data to train predictive AI models for portfolio management. Commenting on the use of AI in crypto portfolio management, Ashraf told Crypto.news: “Geopolitical wildcards compound the challenge, introducing unexpected market conditions that AI can’t easily anticipate, making human oversight and risk management essential.” Discussing Trump’s executive orders and actions in crypto, Ashraf said: “Despite no major executive actions on crypto in Trump’s first 100 orders, the administration’s openness to digital assets was hinted at when both Trump and Melania dabbled in meme coins—blurring lines between personal ventures and government influence. Combined with a strong “America First” attitude toward tech, this can accelerate a “Wild West” environment if certain tokens receive overt government endorsement or implicit backing.” Ashraf believes U.S. based AI and crypto projects could benefit from a more favorable policy stance on the sector, and foreign initiatives could face headwinds in adoption. Alvin Kan, COO of Bitget Wallets told Crypto.news in an exclusive interview: “The Trump administration is expected to promote AI innovation by reducing regulatory constraints, potentially boosting AI tokens and the broader AI sector. The repeal of Biden’s AI executive order might shift focus from ethical considerations to rapid development, influencing market dynamics. Industry sentiment is mixed, with optimism for growth but concerns about oversight and ethical AI use.” The rivalry between Huawei and NVIDIA is fueling a high-stakes “arms race” in AI hardware — driving down costs and encouraging faster innovation. Meanwhile, new entrants from other major tech giants are racing to release specialized chips, widening the competitive field. On one side, NVIDIA remains the global GPU market leader; on the other, Huawei benefits from strong domestic support within China, potentially giving it a leg up in certain markets. This competitive push should accelerate Gen AI’s expansion across industries, including blockchain applications. However, geopolitical tensions and supply-chain uncertainties — amplified by the U.S.-China tech rivalry — could temper how quickly these benefits reach the broader market. Discussing the Huawei and NVIDIA rivalry, Ashraf cites the example of an “arms race.” According to the Vanar CEO: “The rivalry between Huawei and NVIDIA is fueling a high-stakes “arms race” in AI hardware—driving down costs and encouraging faster innovation…On one side, NVIDIA remains the global GPU market leader; on the other, Huawei benefits from strong domestic support within China, potentially giving it a leg up in certain markets.” The competition between the two giants continues to weigh heavily on Bitcoin and crypto, given the impact of AI-related developments on the sector. Noting the massive correction in the AI agent category amidst their rising relevance this week, Ashraf predicts rapid evolution in architecture and possible integration with LLMs, making the current agent designs obsolete. For traders and investors, Ashraf’s advice is to: “Distinguish between short-term hype and genuine utility: scrutinize the underlying tech, project roadmaps, and real-world partnerships. Portfolio-wise, small, diversified positions can be prudent, while keeping an eye on the sector’s broader evolution toward more advanced AI-driven networks.” Bitget Wallet COO Kan believes that the AI agents sector could continue to expand in the first half of 2025, potentially reaching a market capitalization of $20 to $25 billion. Kan warns traders, “…However, there’s a risk of market correction which could see the cap drop to around $12B if growth was largely speculative. The actual outcome will hinge on broader market trends, regulatory developments, and real-world adoption of AI agents.” Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Conversely, Ethereum (ETH) price faces downward trends, as bearish signals indicate likely short-term stabilization and reduced market strength. BlockDAG (BDAG) , however, is capturing significant interest. Its active partnership with Inter Milan showcases blockchain capabilities worldwide, engaging countless football enthusiasts with its innovative technology. Currently identified as the best crypto to buy, BlockDAG boasts over 170,000 holders, with its presale approaching the $600 million goal, and a price increase of 2380% since launch. XRP Bullish Outlook: Possible Rally Upon Resistance Break The XRP bullish outlook depends on overcoming significant resistance levels and maintaining momentum above crucial support. Trading at $3.17, XRP could consolidate yet holds long-term upward potential. Analysts point to $3.40 as a critical breakout point, with goals at $4.20, $5, and $6.60 achievable if surpassed. Meanwhile, supports at $2.52 and $2.32 are vital for continued upward movement. Despite recent price adjustments, the XRP bullish outlook suggests that surpassing $3.40 could trigger a rally, echoing broader market expectations for additional increases. Ethereum Price Challenges: Insights from Technical Indicators The Ethereum price is challenged by bearish indicators predicting continued downward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 41.6, showing diminishing strength yet above the oversold territory. Further, the Directional Movement Index (DMI) indicates growing selling activity, with the -DI surpassing +DI, although a low Average Directional Index (ADX) of 14.1 signals a weak trend. Critical support lies at $3,158, with a potential decline to $2,927 if broken. While near-term stabilization is probable, Ethereum price needs to break through the $3,334 resistance to hint at a trend shift. BlockDAG Enhances Global Presence with Inter Milan BlockDAG’s collaboration with Inter Milan connects the blockchain to a global audience through the allure of a top football club. Utilizing Inter Milan’s broad international following, BlockDAG showcases its advanced blockchain technology, which is based on the DAG structure for quick, safe, and clear transactions. This approach appeals to sports enthusiasts worldwide, providing an accessible gateway to understanding blockchain technology. This alliance significantly raises BlockDAG’s profile and establishes its credibility as a premier Layer 1 blockchain initiative. The partnership ensures extensive exposure via LED displays at Inter Milan’s stadium during matches, broadcasting the BlockDAG brand to a vast audience of fervent supporters and international spectators. Such enhanced visibility leads to increased interest in BDAG coins, impacting their demand and value. With $185.5 million collected in its presale and over 18.2 billion BDAG coins distributed, the presale is already among the largest in the cryptocurrency sphere, drawing over 170,000 holders. This trend highlights BDAG’s growing influence in the blockchain space. BlockDAG’s unprecedented presale is close to reaching its $600 million goal. At its present rate of $0.0248, BDAG is recognized as one of the best cryptos to buy , providing an affordable entry for those aiming to benefit from its increasing demand. With its limited supply and extensive global reach, BDAG is poised to be a unique opportunity in today’s cryptocurrency market. End Notes The XRP bullish outlook continues to captivate, with crucial resistance levels posing a chance for a substantial rally if overcome. Conversely, Ethereum price faces near-term hurdles, with indicators suggesting limited room for growth. Meanwhile, BlockDAG capitalizes on its international appeal through its collaboration with Inter Milan, introducing blockchain technology to millions of soccer enthusiasts worldwide. This exposure boosts BDAG coin demand and fast-tracks BlockDAG’s presale toward its $600 million mark, now with over 170,000 holders involved. With BDAG currently priced at $0.0248, its emerging status as the best crypto to buy encourages early and strategic engagement.

Cardano is making a serious push towards a $4 valuation, fueled by impressive network growth and a series of upcoming upgrades. But while Cardano grabs the headlines, a new player is quietly making waves: Web3Bay (3BAY) . This blockchain-powered e-commerce platform is turning heads with its innovative approach to online shopping, and its presale has just surpassed a whopping $950,000. Let’s dive into the latest crypto news and see why these two projects are capturing the attention of savvy investors. Cardano’s Hydra Upgrade: Speed Boost for the Blockchain Cardano (ADA) is on a mission to become a major player in the blockchain space, and its recent progress is certainly turning heads. Despite a recent dip in price, Cardano’s network activity is booming, with daily active addresses hitting over 50,000. This suggests that more and more people are using the Cardano blockchain, which is a great sign for its long-term growth. Analysts are keeping a close eye on Cardano, and many believe that it could hit $4 in the near future. But it’s not all smooth sailing for Cardano. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, and there are always challenges to overcome. Cardano faces some short-term headwinds, including bearish sentiment in the futures market. However, if it can maintain its current momentum and continue to attract new users, Cardano could be well on its way to reaching that $4 milestone. Decentralized Marketplace: Web3Bay’s User-Centric Approach While Cardano focuses on building a robust blockchain infrastructure, Web3Bay is tackling a different challenge: revolutionizing the online shopping experience. This blockchain-powered e-commerce platform is turning the traditional marketplace model on its head, offering users a secure, transparent, and user-friendly alternative. One of Web3Bay’s key innovations is its integration of Layer-2 rollups. This technology allows for lightning-fast and cost-efficient transactions, making it a game-changer for online shopping. And with plans to launch an NFT marketplace, offer staking rewards, and enable cross-chain compatibility, Web3Bay is building a comprehensive ecosystem that caters to the needs of both buyers and sellers. But perhaps the most exciting aspect of Web3Bay is its commitment to decentralization. The platform is transitioning into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which means that token holders will have a direct say in shaping its future. This is a truly revolutionary approach that puts the power back into the hands of the users. Web3Bay’s presale is generating a lot of buzz, and it’s easy to see why. The platform has already raised over $950,000, and with its native token, 3BAY, currently priced at just $0.004562625, investors are eager to get in on the action. And with a projected launch price of $0.1959, those early investors could be looking at a staggering ROI of 6,340%. That’s the kind of return that can make even the most seasoned crypto investor’s heart skip a beat. Cardano & Web3Bay: Two Sides of the Same Crypto Coin Cardano and Web3Bay represent two different but equally exciting facets of the crypto world. Cardano is focused on building a powerful and efficient blockchain infrastructure, while Web3Bay is using that infrastructure to revolutionize the e-commerce industry. Both projects are attracting significant attention from investors and are poised to play a major role in shaping the future of the crypto landscape. Whether you’re interested in the technical advancements of Cardano or the user-centric approach of Web3Bay, these two projects are definitely worth keeping an eye on. The Crypto World is Heating Up As the crypto market continues to evolve, projects like Cardano and Web3Bay are leading the charge with their innovative solutions and ambitious visions. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just starting your crypto journey, these two projects offer compelling opportunities to participate in the exciting world of blockchain technology. So, stay tuned, do your research, and get ready for the next chapter in the crypto revolution.

Bitcoin (BTC) changed the lives of early investors with its groundbreaking returns, and Ethereum (ETH) reshaped the crypto world with its smart contracts. Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin, is being called the next big opportunity for exponential growth. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Ultimate Choice 1. A Fresh Entrant With Massive Potential: As a newly launched coin, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors the chance to enter at the ground floor. Its early-stage momentum makes it one of the most promising opportunities to achieve life-changing gains. 2. Record-Breaking Presale Success: Raising $1 million almost instantly, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven itself as a high-demand asset. This presale success has cemented its place as a token with unmatched growth potential. 3. Exclusivity That Drives Demand: Unlike ETH, MATIC, or APT, which are widely traded on multiple exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity creates urgency and scarcity, increasing its value to early adopters. How It Stands Up Against Competitors XRP: A leader in payments, but it no longer offers the early-stage returns seen with this new coin. Solana (SOL): Strong in scalability but can’t match the momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Optimism (OP): A rising Layer-2 solution but lacks the excitement surrounding this token. SEI: Innovative but doesn’t have the same presale success or exclusivity. Secure Your Position Before It’s Too Late With its record-breaking presale and massive growth projections, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly becoming the most talked-about investment of 2025.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. The Rexas Finance presale is expected to surge faster and higher than Shiba Inu in 2021. Table of Contents The rise of Shiba Inu Rexas Finance Conclusion With its amazing surge, Shiba Inu (SHIB) created history and became among the most unforgettable success stories ever among cryptocurrencies. From its presale price of $0.00000006 to an all-time high of $0.00008845 in October 2021, SHIB registered an unprecedented 147,000% increase in just over a year. This explosive rise made early investors millionaires. Crypto watchers suggest there’s another chance for those who missed Shiba Inu’s historic surge. The Rexas Finance (RXS) project is expected to surge and create millionaires faster than SHIB. The rise of Shiba Inu Shiba Inu became well-known thanks to a low entry price, organic community marketing, and the meme-coin frenzy in 2021. Early SHIB investors saw their holdings skyrocket as the token acquired popularity and use. This shows the advantage of early adoption in crypto investment. Although SHIB’s narrative is amazing, the crypto market is changing, and new initiatives with even more transforming power are coming up. You might also like: Shiba Inu millionaire forecasts next move, 2 coins to be the next SHIB Rexas Finance Rexas Finance is a new, transformative cryptocurrency designed to close the distance between digital assets and the actual world. With just one click, the creative platform will let consumers purchase and tokenize actual assets with either full or fractional ownership. Real estate, artwork, and intellectual property are examples of which RXS users will be able to tokenize and trade effortlessly, providing countless opportunities. Rexas Finance distinguishes itself with a utility-driven ecosystem featuring the Rexas Token Builder, Rexas Launchpad, Rexas Estate, QuickMint Bot, and Rexas GenAI. All while streamlining difficult procedures, these tools will let users create and manage tokens, start projects, and access tokenized real-world assets. Drawing analogies to SHIB’s early success but with considerably more practical uses, this value proposition distinguishes RXS in the crypto world. The RXS presale has been remarkable. In its 11th presale round, Rexas Finance has already sold about 414 million RXS tokens, generating an amazing $39.07 million. Reflecting great investor demand and project confidence, the presale phases have regularly sold out ahead of schedule. You might also like: 2025’s leading crypto presale with growth potential revealed Early investors in Rexas Finance have already enjoyed notable gains; the token price has surged almost 500% from the start of the presale stage to its present price.

The Certik audit of Rexas Finance guarantees the security and openness of the project, increasing investor confidence.

Rexas Finance is leveraging a multi-trillion-dollar industry by providing a platform on which anybody may tokenize and trade assets worldwide, guaranteeing continuous demand and price momentum for its token. Analysts estimate that RXS could match SHIB’s iconic surge but at a faster speed. RXS’s capacity to serve retail and institutional investors is expected to drive this rapid expansion. Conclusion For those who regret missing Shiba Inu’s meteoric rise, Rexas Finance offers a second chance to potentially achieve massive returns. Strong presale performance, creative technology, and real-world use cases indicate RXS’s potential to exceed SHIB in speed and size.

Bearish Pressure Mounts,https://coinpedia.org/news/suis-35-crash-incoming-bearish-pressure-mounts/,"The post SUI’s 35% Crash Incoming? Bearish Pressure Mounts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Amid this bearish market sentiment, SUI, the native token of the Sui blockchain appears bearish and is likely headed for a double-digit price drop, as it has formed a bearish price action pattern on its daily time frame. This bearish outlook on SUI has shifted as it fails to hold the crucial support from the ascending trendline that it has been witnessing for a prolonged period. SUI Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to the expert technical analysis, with today’s price decline, SUI has successfully confirmed its bearish breakdown and has shifted the entire sentiment toward the bearish side. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action and historical momentum, if SUI holds itself below the $4 level, there is a strong possibility it could drop by 35% to reach the $2.30 level in the future. On the positive side, SUI’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 35.5, indicating that the asset has sufficient room for further price declines. SUI is currently trading near $3.66 and has witnessed a price decline of over 8.50% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 55%, indicating lower participation from traders. $18.5 Worth of SUI Outflow Besides, SUI’s bearish price action and strong bearish market sentiment, long-term holders seem to be accumulating the token, indicating a potential buying opportunity, as revealed by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from the spot inflow/outflow revealed that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of over $18.5 worth of SUI tokens. This substantial outflow from the exchanges indicates a potential accumulation and can cause buying pressure and further price surges, which seem hard to experience due to the bearish sentiment.

According to m, DOGE’s price is gearing up for a move that could send it above $2. Dogecoin Gears Up For 600% Run Above $2 In an X post, Javon Marks predicted that Dogecoin could record a 600% price rally and surge above $2. This came as he provided some optimism despite the recent pullback, with DOGE dropping to as low as $0.30. He stated that the price action is “refreshing” because prices still look on track for another great bullish performance. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts When Dogecoin Price Will Hit $3 This Cycle Marks added that history suggests that another run of 600% or more could happen, sending the Dogecoin price above $2.28. In line with this, he remarked that the next wave can be historical. The analyst had previously alluded to DOGE’s historical performance when he predicted that the meme coin could rally above the 1.618 Fib extension, which is currently at $2.2. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade also recently alluded to Dogecoin’s historical performance when he predicted its price could rally to as high as $20 in this market cycle. The analyst noted that Dogecoin experienced bull rallies after surpassing the previous candle body high in 20217 and 2021, with gains of 3,000% and 8,000%, respectively. Therefore, he remarked that DOGE could reach this $20 target if a similar pattern plays out again. However, in the short term, the Dogecoin price could still drop to as low as $0.26 before it records any parabolic rally to the upside. This is based on crypto analyst Behdark’s DOGE analysis, in which he explained that the drop to $0.26 is part of the C wave corrective move. Once the price correction is done, the analyst predicted that the meme coin could rebound to $0.50. DOGE Failed To Touch The Trendline During The Recent Drop Crypto analyst Master Kenobi noted that the Dogecoin price failed to touch a trendline he highlighted on the charts during this latest drop. In line with this, he questioned if it meant that DOGE could still witness more pullbacks or a bullish reversal from its current price level. While he didn’t provide an answer, the analyst alluded to an earlier analysis, in which he predicted that DOGE could record a 3x price increase and reach $1.05 between February and March. Related Reading: Dogecoin Traders Remain Extremely Bullish Despite Price Crash, Here Are The Numbers Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s price action might have shifted from bearish to bullish following this recent pullback. In an X post, Trader Tardigrade stated that DOGE’s MACD bullish crossover was approaching on the 4-hour chart. He explained that this signals a short-term momentum shift for DOGE from bearish to bullish.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. IntelMarkets emerges with the potential to push Shiba Inu from the top 10 list with its AI-blockchain combination. Table of Contents IntelMarkets: The next big thing in crypto trading Shiba Inu Why IntelMarkets could outperform Shiba Inu Conclusion Shiba Inu (SHIB) has had its moment of glory. However, as the market evolves, investors are paying more attention to coins with real utility alongside a high rate of growth. One of them is IntelMarkets (INTL) – a trailblazing DeFi project powered by Artificial Intelligence. IntelMarkets: The next big thing in crypto trading In contrast to SHIB’s meme origins, IntelMarkets enters the market with a clear vision: to share actionable insights for disrupting crypto trading through the adoption of AI technology and decentralized finance concepts. IntelMarkets is entirely different from conventional exchanges in the way it uses powerful AI to study market trends and provide INTL users with profit maximizing strategies. Composed of a team from MIT and Open AI experts, IntelMarkets is a leader in both blockchain and AI development. The INTL presale has raised $7.72 million in a few weeks, demonstrating the market’s belief in the further development of the project. Entering the 9th stage of the presale, INTL tokens can be bought for $0.082. Planned for a Q2 2025 release, industry experts anticipate a possible 5x growth once INTL tokens get listed on tier-1 exchanges like CoinBase, Binance, Uniswap and Bybit. You might also like: Red alert as Shiba Inu price forms two risky patterns Shiba Inu The Shiba Inu token was created in August 2020, and its price began to grow, becoming one of the most successful tokens on the market. The Shiba Inu price rose to its record high of $0.00008845 in October 2021, mainly due to mania within the community and the support of celebrities. SHIB’s ecosystem has grown into ShibaSwap, Shib.io, Shibarium , and NFTs. However, its price has undergone tremendous crashes from its ATH. Currently, SHIB is trading at around $0.00001801, with a 15% decline over the last month. Though the token maintains value and utility, its price has little room for massive growth due to a high market cap and limited institutional capital inflows. Nonetheless, analysts suggest that a SHIB ETF could result in a rally for the Shiba Inu price. Why IntelMarkets could outperform Shiba Inu The strength of the SHIB token is based on community support and meme-style advertising while IntelMarkets has a long list of application-based features. For example, users will gain access to the Intell-M algorithms with AI-driven insights into the best trading strategies. Furthermore, IntelMarkets will run on a dual-chain solution that combines two different blockchains: Ethereum and Solana. This feature increases scalability while expanding the platform’s use for a large audience. While Shiba Inu has many drawbacks because of its meme coin status, IntelMarkets provides a competitive and efficient tool for today’s traders. Conclusion Shiba Inu is still mainstream and has significant potential for growth, but at the same time, this pace is significantly lower than that of IntelMarkets. Given its unique approach to deploying AI to help in the trading process, IntelMarkets has a chance to rise in market ratings and oust SHIB from the top ten.

39631623,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/solana-blockchain-proves-highly-valuable-to-trump-coin-but-is-1fuel-the-next-step,1738112067,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/39631623.jpeg,Solana Blockchain Proves Highly Valuable To Trump Coin But Is 1Fuel The Next Step?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/solana-blockchain-proves-highly-valuable-to-trump-coin-but-is-1fuel-the-next-step,"Investors are buzzing with excitement as Solana blockchain surged back into the spotlight, thanks to the launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin. While Solana’s rise reminds investors of its lightning speed and cost efficiency, another contender, 1Fuel (OFT) , is making waves with its innovative cross-chain wallet and unmatched utility. In a market where sustainability and massive profits are prized, analysts are forecasting that 1Fuel (OFT) is all set to deliver over 100x returns on launch. Let’s find out why! The trump effect: How one meme coin revitalized Solana Last weekend, Solana's SOL token soared following the launch of a meme coin tied to Donald Trump, a self-proclaimed ""crypto president."" The market was shaken by Trump's announcement that he is launching a meme coin named Official Trump (TRUMP) on the Solana blockchain. The selection of Solana as an issuance network increased demand and sentiment for SOL coins. Following the debut, SOL trade volumes skyrocketed to over $26 billion. That is an almost 3,000% increase from December 2022, when confidence for Solana was damaged by the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its well-known investor Sam Bankman-Fried, which brought the market to three-year lows of $9. In the meanwhile, Solana has consistently been marketed as an Ethereum alternative that is ""faster, cheaper."" Since last year, the blockchain, which is home to several DeFi projects, has emerged as the global hub for meme coins. A few of the meme coins that have now made Solana essential to its business include PEPE, WIF, PENGU, and MOTHER. Real utility, real returns: What sets 1Fuel apart from the crowd Big profits and long-term sustainability are the two main factors that crypto investors are always on the lookout for. 1Fuel (OFT) is one such project that provides real-life utility and massive returns, appealing to investors of all levels. 1Fuel’s one-click cross-chain cryptocurrency wallet allows its users to store and exchange digital assets across several blockchain networks, without the need of having multiple wallets and paying hefty fees. Through this, it streamlines the digital assets management process, an easy game that investors of all experience can play. The platform further ensures that each user's assets are safe and secure. It does this by providing cold storage options for offline storage saving them from online threats. Furthermore, it has an integrated privacy mixer to make transactions anonymous ensuring user’s privacy. Why are analysts predicting 100X growth for 1Fuel? The whole 1Fuel ecosystem is powered by OFT tokens, which are currently available to be bought in its presale. With nearly $1.5 million from the sale of over 160 million tokens, investors are purchasing tokens at an unparalleled momentum. At $0.017, each OFT token provides its users with a low-cost entry point. Analysts are quite excited about 1Fuel's future potential. They anticipate a 100x increase upon the project's listing on tier-1 exchange platforms. These opportunities and 1Fuel's innovative offerings set it apart from the heavy competition in the market. Final thoughts While Solana proves its resilience with the TRUMP coin rally, 1Fuel (OFT) is carving out its niche as the ultimate crypto wallet solution. Its focus on cross-chain functionality, security, and passive income opportunities positions it as a frontrunner in the race for innovation. With analysts predicting exponential growth, the question isn’t if 1Fuel will succeed, but how far it will go. Secure your financial future with 1Fuel’s cutting-edge technology, act now!

Since their trades can move prices significantly and create ripples felt across the market, knowing what they are up to sometimes offers clues about market trends, potential price changes, and helps uncover market opportunities. Recently, a new trend has been noticed among Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales. These SHIB early adopters are migrating to Remittix (RTX), a new crypto they believe has multi-billion-dollar potential. Many experts argue that Remittix could be the next crypto to 100x, providing both short-term and long-term opportunities for investors. But what is it about Remittix that is attracting such significant whale interest? Could this new crypto project live up to market expectations? Let’s uncover the details. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Early Success and Current Struggles Launched in 2020, Shiba Inu burst into the market with a vibrant community of dog lovers and memecoin faithfuls shortly after. Due time has seen SHIB grow from a mere speculative asset into a utility-driven ecosystem. Last week, Shiba Inu unveiled ShibOS , a blockchain-based OS with the goal of improving Web3 adoption. This operating system would aid developers in building scalable and privacy-conscious applications optimized for various use cases. This launch marks a major milestone, introducing 36 different chambers to develop apps, each tailored for a specific purpose. Despite this exciting development, SHIB has been struggling in the market. Currently valued at $0.00001856 , SHIB suffered a steep 11.52% decline in a single day after moving sideways last week. The token’s price is now 18.4% lower than its value a month earlier. On Monday, SHIBsaw a new monthly low after slipping past the critical $0.00002 support level. SHIB’s bearish behaviour has raised concerns among investors. Interestingly, buyer sentiment remains hesitant as the market evaluates SHIB’s troubling trajectory. By observing whale movements, investors tend to gain insight into the trend of the market. Analysts have noticed that some early movers of Shiba Inu are now changing their focus and accumulating Remittix, a new crypto project with huge profit potential. These movements have triggered the increased interest of retail investors, and many are willing to follow in their footsteps. Why Are SHIB Whales Accumulating Remittix? On-chain metrics indicate a significant influx of SHIB whales into Remittix. The primary reason for this shift is the compelling use case offered by Remittix in solving one of the most pressing issues in the financial sector—cross-border payments. Remittix provides an efficient and cost-effective alternative to improve B2B and B2C relations. With a flat fee structure, businesses and customers can make crypto-to fiat transactions and receive the exact amount sent by the recipient. Thus, eliminating hidden charges and offering lower fees when compared to its market competitors. The Future of Remittix and Market Opportunities As the presale of Remittix continues to heat up, RTX’s target of raising $36 million through its ongoing ICO would be over in a little less than two weeks. The realization of this has left investors scrambling to get in early. They are willing to hop the project and follow the lead of SHIB whales. Moreover, Remittix successfully passed a smart contract audit with no issues, further revealing its commitment to security and transparency and blowing off concerns of a rug pull.. With an imminent boom on the horizon, SHIB whales are confident that Remittix will offer them both short-term gains and long-term stability. The compelling use-case of the new crypto project and its growing adoption make it one of the best altcoins to buy this season. Conclusion Sometimes, identifying the best altcoins to buy could require careful observation of whale activity. The recent accumulation of Remittix by SHIB whales signals strong confidence in its potential. Investors looking for the next crypto to 100x should look too far away, as Remittix could very well be the next multi-billion-dollar project this year.

Their significant trades can impact prices and create market waves, so understanding their actions can sometimes reveal market trends, potential price shifts, and hidden opportunities. Recently, a new pattern has emerged among Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales. These early investors in SHIB are now shifting towards Remittix (RTX), a new cryptocurrency they believe holds multi-billion-dollar potential. Many analysts suggest that Remittix might be the next crypto to 100x, offering lucrative opportunities both in the short and long term for investors. So, what is it about Remittix that draws such considerable interest from whales? Can this new crypto project meet market expectations? Let’s explore the details. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Early Success and Present Challenges Introduced in 2020, Shiba Inu quickly gained attention with a lively group of dog enthusiasts and memecoin supporters. Over time, SHIB transformed from just a speculative investment into a utility-focused ecosystem. Recently, Shiba Inu introduced ShibOS , a blockchain-based operating system aimed at boosting Web3 adoption. This OS is designed to help developers create scalable, privacy-oriented applications that are optimized for diverse use cases.

The token’s value is now 18.4% less than a month ago. On Monday, SHIB hit a new monthly low after falling below the critical $0.00002 support level. SHIB’s downward trend has caused concern among investors. Interestingly, buyer sentiment remains cautious as the market scrutinizes SHIB’s challenging path. By tracking whale patterns, investors typically gain insights into market trends. Analysts have observed that some early Shiba Inu investors are now redirecting their attention towards Remittix, a new cryptocurrency project with significant profit potential. These movements have sparked increased interest among retail investors, many of whom are keen to follow suit. What Draws SHIB Whales to Remittix? On-chain data shows a notable entry of SHIB whales into Remittix. The main reason for this shift is the attractive use case provided by Remittix in addressing a critical issue in the financial industry—cross-border payments. Remittix offers a streamlined and budget-friendly solution to enhance B2B and B2C relationships. With its flat fee model, both businesses and consumers can conduct crypto-to-fiat transactions without any hidden costs, ensuring the recipient receives the exact amount sent. This makes it a cost-effective option compared to its market rivals. The Prospects for Remittix and Market Potential As the presale of Remittix gains momentum, RTX aims to raise $36 million through its ongoing ICO, which is expected to conclude in just under two weeks. This has prompted investors to act quickly and join the project, following the lead of SHIB whales. Additionally, Remittix has successfully completed a smart contract audit without issues, highlighting its focus on security and transparency, and alleviating fears of a rug pull. With potential growth on the horizon, SHIB whales are optimistic that Remittix will deliver both immediate profits and long-term stability. The project’s promising use case and increasing adoption rate make it one of the top altcoins to purchase this season. Conclusion Sometimes, identifying the top altcoins to purchase requires careful monitoring of whale activities. SHIB whales' recent acquisition of Remittix demonstrates strong confidence in its potential. Investors seeking the next crypto to 100x should not overlook Remittix, which could indeed be the next multi-billion-dollar venture this year.

Pseudonymous trader Credible tells his 459,900 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum may be in the midst of carving a local bottom before igniting fresh rallies. According to the analyst, Ethereum bulls should hold ETH’s immediate support at around $3,000 otherwise the leading smart contract protocol could plunge to below $2,800. “Here we are. The first of two levels that I believe will mark our bottom on ETH. Moment of truth here, let’s see if it holds. If it’s lost, then we hit the monthly demand below which should mark our HTF (high time frame) bottom. Many other coins also hitting key/pivotal levels right now.” Source: Credible/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that ETH could rally above $4,000 after bottoming out. At time of writing, ETH is worth $3,170. Turning to Bitcoin, the analyst thinks that the current BTC correction is a positive rather than a negative for the crypto king. According to Credible, the retracement is setting the stage for a potential Bitcoin short squeeze. A short squeeze occurs when a sharp rise in the price of an asset forces traders who had previously sold short to close their positions, fueling more rallies. Short selling means selling borrowed shares of a stock with the expectation that the price will fall. Says Credible, “BTC is simply heading down to one end of our range that we’ve been trapped in for the last week, nothing to be freaking out about. In fact, I’m glad we’re going for the lows first because it’s healthier for us to take liquidity from the lows of this range while leaving liquidity behind at the highs. Eyes on the range lows to see if this is just a liquidity grab at one end of the range before going for the other…” Source: Credible/X While Credible believes BTC is positioned to spark a short-term rally, he predicts that Bitcoin may witness one more leg down after the surge before launching a parabolic upside move en route to $150,000. “In a perfect world…” Source: Credible/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $102,080.

BONK: The Shiba Inu Memecoin That’s Energizing Solana’s Scene BONK is a fresh memecoin on the Solana blockchain, boasting a Shiba Inu mascot that's drawing attention. Unlike other tokens dominated by large investors, BONK aims to empower the community. It achieved this by airdropping half of its total supply to participants in Solana's NFT and DeFi projects. Following its listing on Coinbase, BONK's value more than doubled, reflecting the excitement surrounding this community-focused coin. Despite hurdles like a massive total supply and typical memecoin volatility, BONK is making its presence felt. It’s becoming integrated into Solana’s expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications, including the launch of its own exchange, BonkSwap. This engagement signals potential for BONK's future. In a market where memecoins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have made significant impacts, BONK offers something distinctive by empowering its users. Its rapid ascent and novel approach make it a coin to watch in the current market cycle. From Frog Meme to Cryptocurrency Hit: Discover PEPE PEPE is a new digital currency that began as a homage to the iconic Pepe the Frog meme. Built on Ethereum, it's a deflationary memecoin with the goal of becoming a leading meme-inspired cryptocurrency. PEPE embraces the playful side of crypto, with no taxes and a straightforward approach. Between late April and May 2023, PEPE's value soared, reaching a market cap of $1.6 billion. Early investors gained substantial returns, and a dedicated fan base formed around the coin. This surge initiated a ""memecoin season,"" with other meme tokens experiencing dramatic price fluctuations. Many question whether PEPE has further growth potential. Its roadmap includes listing on major exchanges and a strategy for a ""meme takeover."" While it lacks new technology, its strength lies in its community and the allure of internet memes. Compared to other meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PEPE maintains simplicity and fun. In the current market cycle, with anticipation of Bitcoin’s halving and potential bull runs, PEPE appears appealing to those who believe in the power of memes and community-driven initiatives. The memecoin trend illustrates that sometimes, enjoyment and simplicity can captivate the market's attention. Conclusion Though BONK and PEPE have their merits, XYZVerse, the trailblazing all-sport memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth, is stepping up as the next crypto giant.

Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) has seen notable price activity recently. Over the past week, its price dipped by 1.53%, but the overall trend remains positive. In the last month, SOL's price rose by 21.94%, and it has climbed 38.74% over the past six months, demonstrating strong upward momentum despite short-term fluctuations. SOL is currently trading between $222 and $265.87, with the nearest resistance at $291.3. Breaking past this could lead to a target of $335.17, representing around a 26% gain from the upper range. On the downside, the closest support is at $203.56, with a potential drop to the second support at $159.69, about 28% from the lower range. Technical indicators show a mixed picture. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 53.18, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is $238.34, slightly below the 100-day SMA of $247.87, hinting at possible consolidation. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) stands at 0.7619, suggesting mild bullish momentum.

In the last week, its price increased by 26.57%, with a monthly rise of 40.82% and an 18.72% gain over six months. These positive trends suggest strong momentum for this cryptocurrency.

The Stochastic oscillator is at 72.30, underscoring this perspective. Looking forward, the nearest resistance is $1.55. Surpassing this could lead to targeting the second resistance at $2.07, a notable percentage increase from current levels. On the downside, the nearest support is $0.51, providing a buffer if prices retreat. Based on the current data, JUP's price might continue to rise, but traders should monitor these crucial levels closely.

Looking ahead, the nearest resistance is at $5.91. Moving above this could suggest an increase of about 11% from the current high. On the downside, the nearest support is at $4.17, a potential decrease of around 7%. The second resistance and support levels are at $6.78 and $3.30, marking critical points for future movements. Based on this information, NEAR may face ongoing challenges but could find opportunities for growth if it surpasses key resistance levels.

Currently trading between $0.23 and $0.26, TRX has demonstrated resilience in the crypto market.

Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are at $0.25, indicating price stability. TRX is nearing its closest resistance level at $0.28. Breaking above this could target the second resistance at $0.32, suggesting a potential gain of about 23% from current levels. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.21, with further support at $0.17. If bullish momentum continues, TRX could reach higher levels, but traders should remain vigilant for possible pullbacks.

With its revolutionary wallet, focus on security and privacy, and jaw-dropping presale gains, this project has captured the attention of risk-takers eager to ride the wave to potential 100X returns. The buzz is real, and early adopters are already reaping the rewards. Let’s take a closer look at these projects. PENGU plunge: What’s behind the 36% drop? As the market continues to hit lower lows, PENGU investors are left with no option but to decrease their exposure to the assets. According to CoinMarketCap, PENGU investors have lost 36% in the last month as the market narrative has shifted against them. PENGU has fallen after failing to breach the resistance level of 0.025364, and if sideline whales start selling, this decline might get worse. The PENGU netflow on Coinglass indicates that $801,340 worth of the asset has been sold, adding to the rejection at the prior resistance, indicating that certain cohorts of market whales have already started selling. PENGU investors are now turning their heads towards 1Fuel's (OFT) ongoing presale which has managed to grab their attention through its phenomenal growth rate, as clear by its total funding which currently stands at over $1.5 million. Leadership crisis: Kusama’s exit and its impact on SHIB The sudden resignation of Shiba Inu's leading figurehead, Shytoshi Kusama, shocked the cryptocurrency community. Shiba Inu changed from a meme coin to a robust ecosystem under Kusama's leadership, but his exit has left the market unsure. Investors' worries about the project's trajectory as it shifts to a new leadership model were reflected in the 6% decline in SHIB's pricing on the last day. His departure underlines the problems of maintaining innovation and community trust in the fast-paced sphere of Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi). According to analysts, Shiba Inu has established a solid foundation, but how well the community can carry out its plan without Kusama leading the charge will determine how successful it is in the long run. Meanwhile, SHIB investors are exploring 1Fuel (OFT), an upcoming project that is offering massive returns alongside revolutionary technology. Why 1Fuel’s presale is a must-join opportunity 1Fuel (OFT) is an upcoming cutting-edge crypto wallet that will simplify and secure all of your crypto transactions. In contrast to conventional cryptocurrency exchanges, 1Fuel's distinctive and user-friendly design is intended to make managing and trading digital assets across several blockchains easy and economical. The other two main features that the 1Fuel ecosystem offers are asset safety and anonymity. In order to ensure optimal security, it provides cold wallet alternatives that enable assets to be kept offline and out of the reach of hackers. The integrated privacy mixer in 1Fuel will let investors interact anonymously and maintain total control of their assets. The project is currently in its presale phase and its trajectory is evidence of 1Fuel’s rapid adoption. Analysts anticipate 500% presale gains ahead before the token gets officially listed. Since the smart early investor acquired OFT tokens at the initial price of $0.01, they have already reaped 70% ROI, and are all set to gain further. Additionally, 1Fuel provides investors with the opportunity to generate passive income from their long-term investment through staking incentives of up to 30% annually. Before its official listing, early supporters have a chance to reap the greatest rewards. Final thoughts In a market fraught with uncertainty, 1Fuel (OFT) is a center of innovation and promise. As Pudgy Penguin and Shiba Inu struggle with investor confidence, 1Fuel is blazing its trail with an ecosystem built for privacy, security, and profitability. Its presale success and groundbreaking wallet technology is proof of its potential to dominate the crypto landscape. Say goodbye to high fees and complex transactions, and join 1Fuel’s game-changing platform!

Trump Buys SUI (TRUMPSUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPSUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Buys SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys SUI launched with over $29,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Buys SUI by entering its contract address (CA) – 7chY3Yw9cArR4CGQQ2N6mciszZvWB3rW6WoBNTfwyitu – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|SUI|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-29 01:08:00

JP Morgan Analyst Thinks So. Hedera Price Set For 20% Drops In February,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/could-payfi-star-remittix-be-the-next-ripple-xrp-jp-morgan-analyst-thinks-so-hedera-price-set-for-20-drops-in-february,"In the continuously changing realm of cryptocurrencies, professionals and market analysts closely monitor new initiatives that have the potential to pose a threat to established coins. A prominent digital currency recognized for its cross-border payments, Ripple (XRP), has drawn interest in PayFi Star Remittix as a possible competitor. This advance has led to the discussion of its potential as a crypto to invest in, analysts have compared XRP to PayFi Star Remittix. Is PayFi Star Remittix The Next Ripple? Due to its emphasis on transforming the remittance sector, PayFi Star Remittix is becoming more and more popular as a viable substitute for Ripple(XRP). Like Ripple's use case, the platform seeks to harness blockchain technology for quick, safe and affordable cross-border transactions. According to experts discussing the top crypto to invest in, PayFi Star Remittix's creative strategy may help it achieve comparable success to XRP in the upcoming years. The potential of PayFi Star Remittix has also been recognized by J.P. Morgan analysts, who point to its creative application of blockchain technology to address inefficiencies in cross-border payments. Its expansion plan, they believe, fits in nicely with new developments in the remittance business. This perspective has increased investor interest in Remittix as a strong rival to Ripple (XRP). Industry observers, however, are betting that the scalability of PayFi and blockchain that underlies it will ultimately permit Pay Fi to compete with XRP's dominance in this space as one of the top cryptocurrencies to buy, argues a commentary on top crypto to invest in topics. Hedera Price Outlook February 2025 Forecast Investors are taking notice of PayFi Star Remittix but Hedera (HBAR), another significant competitor in the blockchain market, is going through a difficult time. Recent estimates state that the February 2025 Hedera price prediction indicates a possible 20% decline in value as market conditions deteriorate. In this prognosis, the importance is put at the forefront of the risks that investors have to deal with as well as of the volatility of the market associated with cryptocurrencies. Hedera may struggle to attract new engineers and investors if this doomsday scenario is true, especially with the spike of interest among other blockchain projects to name a few. With the development of the crypto market, investors become more and more discriminating in selecting the top crypto to invest in, tending to focus on projects with strong use cases and scalability. Ripple XRP Future Trends What’s Next? In view of the current legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple (XRP) has struggled extensively. Nevertheless, XRP's strong on-market and global partnerships remain to be one of the most favored cryptocurrencies. Analysts predict that there will be significant growth in Ripple XRP future trends. The resolution of this legal issue will have a significant impact on XRP's future. Ripple XRP future trends could see a spike in investment and usage if Ripple prevails in its lawsuit against the SEC. More institutional investment and legal clarity would probably be advantageous for Ripple(XRP), which has the potential to be recognized as a utility token rather than a security. Could Remittix Redefine Cross-Border Payments? Remittix is rapidly becoming known for its novel way to address the inefficiencies in the global remittance market. Designed to streamline, secure and cheaply conduct cross-border payments, Remittix is well poised to become a key player in the blockchain payments landscape. Its speed of payments processing is almost real time and the low transaction/fee make it unlike standard methodologies. Analysts have made a comparison between Remittix and Ripple (XRP) and their success in the market is discussed, emphasizing Remittix's disruptive role in the industry. In the wake of growing interest from banks and with the scalability of Remittix as one of its main objectives the platform may well be the next force in cross-border payment. Conclusion As the cryptocurrencies market develops, PayFi Star Remittix is a potential contender to Ripple (XRP) offering disruptive solutions for cross border payments. During the time of XRP's entrenched leadership and Hedera's struggles this showcases the complexity of the industry but Remittix remains to show a potential to upend the market.

A major player in cross-border payments, Ripple (XRP), has caught the attention of PayFi Star Remittix as a potential competitor. This development has sparked discussions about its viability as a crypto investment, with analysts drawing comparisons between XRP and PayFi Star Remittix. Is PayFi Star Remittix Poised To Rival Ripple? With its focus on revolutionizing the remittance industry, PayFi Star Remittix is gaining traction as a promising alternative to Ripple (XRP). Like Ripple, the platform aims to leverage blockchain technology to facilitate fast, secure, and cost-effective international transactions. Experts discussing the top crypto investments suggest that PayFi Star Remittix's innovative approach could lead it to achieve a level of success similar to XRP in the years to come. J.P. Morgan analysts have also acknowledged the potential of PayFi Star Remittix, highlighting its inventive use of blockchain technology to tackle inefficiencies in cross-border payments. They believe its growth strategy aligns well with emerging trends in the remittance sector. This viewpoint has heightened investor interest in Remittix as a formidable competitor to Ripple (XRP). Industry experts, however, are confident that the scalability of PayFi and its underlying blockchain will eventually enable PayFi to rival XRP’s dominance in this arena as a leading cryptocurrency, according to a commentary on top crypto investments. Hedera's Price Prediction for February 2025 While investors are increasingly interested in PayFi Star Remittix, Hedera (HBAR), another key player in the blockchain industry, is facing challenges. Recent forecasts for February 2025 suggest that Hedera's value might decrease by 20% due to worsening market conditions. This prediction highlights the risks and market volatility that cryptocurrency investors must navigate. If this adverse scenario materializes, Hedera might find it difficult to attract new developers and investors, especially with growing interest in other blockchain projects. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, investors are becoming more selective in choosing the top crypto investments, favoring projects with robust use cases and scalability. Future Prospects for Ripple XRP: What Lies Ahead? Ripple (XRP) has faced significant challenges due to its ongoing legal dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite this, XRP's solid market presence and global partnerships continue to make it one of the most popular cryptocurrencies. Analysts foresee considerable growth in Ripple XRP's future trends. The outcome of this legal battle will be crucial for XRP's future. Ripple XRP's future trends may experience an investment and usage surge if Ripple wins its case against the SEC. Increased institutional investment and legal clarity would likely benefit Ripple (XRP), potentially leading to its classification as a utility token rather than a security. Could Remittix Transform Cross-Border Payments? Remittix is quickly gaining recognition for its innovative approach to overcoming inefficiencies in the global remittance industry. Designed to facilitate seamless, secure, and low-cost international payments, Remittix is well-positioned to emerge as a major player in the blockchain payment space. Its transaction speeds are nearly instantaneous, and the minimal fees distinguish it from traditional methods. Analysts have drawn parallels between Remittix and Ripple (XRP), noting their market success and emphasizing Remittix's disruptive potential in the industry. As interest from banks grows and with scalability as a primary goal, the platform could very well become a dominant force in cross-border payments. Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market evolves, PayFi Star Remittix emerges as a potential rival to Ripple (XRP), offering groundbreaking solutions for international transfers. With XRP's established position and Hedera's current difficulties, this highlights the sector's complexity, yet Remittix shows promise to disrupt the market.

Once soaring with the meme coin craze, its recent losses and struggles have left investors questioning its long-term viability. But with 2025 fast approaching, a new contender is emerging, 1Fuel (OFT) . Offering groundbreaking cross-chain capabilities and real-world utility, 1Fuel is gaining traction as the next big thing in DeFi. Analysts are forecasting 100x returns for this DeFi leader. Let’s find out why! PEPE down 30%: Is this just a dip or the end of an era? PEPE has been a chaotic trip for investors. After a difficult month in which it lost 30%, PEPE is currently down a staggering 13% last day, currently trading at $0.00001295. Despite its recent victories, PEPE's crypto analysis reveals flaws in its foundation. Speculative trading and community-driven buzz, two important components of the coin's success, are starting to wane. Technical indicators suggest a negative trend as the RSI approaches the overbought zone. Its progress was made worse as it failed to hold its significant support levels of $0.0000167 and $0.000014. The true issue is the oversaturation of meme coins in the market. Meme tokens' viral appeal and cultural significance, which previously set them apart, are now lost in a sea of copycat projects. PEPE still has a lot of support from the community, but it will need more than memes to survive in the meme currency market in the long run like creativity and utility. Without these, PEPE and its competitors could find it difficult to stay relevant in a market that is becoming tired of hollow promises. In the same landscape, 1Fuel (OFT) emerges as a promising project that is not only promising but delivering big returns backed with solid technology. 1Fuel: The DeFi revolution everyone’s talking about 1Fuel (OFT) is a new project that has recently emerged in the DeFi landscape capturing investors' attention from all around the globe giving tough time to coins with no real-life utility like PEPE. Its ground-breaking ecosystem distinguishes it from its direct competitors like Core Wallet and Ledger Wallet. 1Fuel streamlines digital asset management through the combination of user-friendly tools and sophisticated DeFi technologies. 1Fuel's DEX wallet, which allows one-click cross-chain transactions, is one of its most notable features. With this, users don't require numerous wallets or tokens to transfer assets between different blockchains, unlike traditional wallets. Complex transactions across different networks happen with the ease of one click only. As security is a primary concern in this age of blockchain transactions, 1Fuel with its integrated privacy protocols like built-in mixers and disposable wallets guarantees user anonymity and protection. Furthermore, by including useful financial instruments like cryptocurrency credit and debit cards, 1Fuel is influencing the direction of decentralized finance beyond trading. These encourage DeFi to become a part of daily life by enabling users to make cash transactions in the real world straight from their digital currency holdings. Through 1Fuel's integrated P2P exchange, users may purchase cryptocurrencies directly from one another without the need for centralized middlemen. In keeping with the core principles of decentralization, this functionality allows users complete control over their assets when trading. 1Fuel presale success: $1.6M raised and early investors reaping rewards With prices climbing from $0.01 to $0.017, 1Fuel, which is now in its presale stage, has already raised over $1.6 million and sold over 160 million tokens. Gains of more than 70% have been reaped by early investors and a 20% bonus in the current third presale stage on every purchase increases 1Fuel’s overall allure. Given the anticipated surge in DeFi usage, 1Fuel's cutting-edge ecosystem is all set for rapid expansion. Final thoughts While PEPE struggles to maintain its foothold in a rapidly evolving market, 1Fuel is charging forward with innovation and a clear vision for the future. The rise of decentralized finance is creating an ideal environment for projects like 1Fuel, which combines real-world utility, cutting-edge technology, and user-focused design.

This decline comes after the altcoin teased the $3.50 mark with a bullish run. Many XRP holders were riding high on this uptrend, but now it’s over, and they are seeking the best crypto coin to buy for more significant profits. A new project drawing massive interest from investors is Remittix, a fast-rising PayFi project set to revolutionize the global payments industry. Inefficiencies, pricey fees, and inaccessibility have long plagued these payment systems. Remittix (RTX) aims to transform this sector with a project developed for real-world applications. Providing a bridge between blockchain and traditional finance, Remittix is attracting interest in solving these challenges head-on while providing global practical value for users. This article details how the Ripple price and the Remittix platform are expected to perform in Q1 2025. Analysts Foresee Ripple Price Decline Amid Ongoing Legal Issues Recent crypto news updates highlight a new development in Ripple’s legal conflict with the SEC. Ripple’s developers and investors thought they were in the clear after a favorable court ruling. Yet, the SEC has now appealed the decision, with fresh briefs set to be filed soon. According to crypto news, this latest twist could potentially impact Ripple price efforts to stabilize recently. This legal uncertainty makes it challenging to predict Ripple price movements. Meanwhile, Ripple price recent dip is cause for concern. Analysts suggest that if selling pressure persists and buyers hesitate, Ripple price might drop below the crucial $2.45 support level. Some traders anticipate a rebound at that point, but that won't occur if demand doesn't pick up. Nevertheless, a renewed sense of investor confidence or a bullish market could propel a Ripple price rise toward its peak of $3.41. However, with the recent crypto news, sentiment around XRP remains wary, and analysts are staying vigilant. This uncertainty is precisely why savvy investors are favoring Remittix over Ripple as the best crypto coin to buy. Experts Evaluate Remittix (RTX) and Its Exciting Prospects Remittix (RTX) is a leading PayFi initiative aiming to streamline cross-border transactions by enabling crypto-to-fiat exchanges and worldwide payments. Early investors are drawn to this approach as it eliminates the hefty fees and processing lags typical of conventional remittances. By tackling this real-world issue, Remittix (RTX) is poised to attract a wider audience than many other tokens. Additionally, Remittix’s presale success underscores the project’s potential for growth. Having raised over $8.4 million and sold 390 million tokens in just four weeks, experts anticipate Remittix will be a valuable addition to investors’ portfolios as it continues to gain momentum. This is why some long-term Ripple (XRP) holders are switching allegiances, aiming to capitalize on a newer project set to surpass the XRP coin this year. While Ripple price movements have consistently made it a favored choice for many crypto investors, experts now caution about imminent sell-offs that could destabilize the asset. Many traders now see Remittix as the best crypto coin to buy to weather Ripple’s potential downturn. They prefer Remittix (RTX) due to its practical payment solution and ongoing presale success. Whether the Ripple price recovers or continues to drop remains unclear. Nonetheless, the shift towards Remittix (RTX) highlights how rapidly market sentiment can shift. Experts remain optimistic that this new altcoin can outperform the established XRP coin. Now is the time to get involved! Join the presale and community now!

This decline comes after the altcoin teased the $3.50 mark with a bullish run. Many XRP holders were riding high on this uptrend, but now it’s over, and they are seeking the best crypto coin to buy for more significant profits. A new project drawing massive interest from investors is Remittix, a fast-rising PayFi project set to revolutionize the global payments industry. Inefficiencies, pricey fees, and inaccessibility have long plagued these payment systems. Remittix (RTX) aims to transform this sector with a project developed for real-world applications. Providing a bridge between blockchain and traditional finance, Remittix is attracting interest in solving these challenges head-on while providing global practical value for users. This article details how the Ripple price and the Remittix platform are expected to perform in Q1 2025. Analysts Predict Ripple Price Dump Amid Legal Battle Latest crypto news headlines reveal a new phase in Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC. Ripple’s developers and investors assumed they were out of trouble, having gained a victory through an important ruling. However, the SEC has now appealed this verdict, with new briefs opening soon. According to crypto news, this latest twist in the legal battle could potentially affect Ripple pricejourney toward stability in recent days. This legal tension makes it difficult to forecast Ripple price trajectory. Meanwhile, Ripple price recent decline leaves worrying signs. Analysts believe if selling pressure continues and buyers remain uncertain, Ripple price could plummet below the critical $2.45 support. Several traders expect a bounce at that level, but that will not happen if demand doesn’t improve. Regardless, the possibility of renewed investor confidence or the market getting bullish could inspire a Ripple price surge toward its all-time high of $3.41. But with recent crypto news, the mood around XRP remains cautious, and analysts stay attentive. This tension is precisely why savvy investors tip Remittix over Ripple as the best crypto coin to buy. Experts Assess Remittix (RTX) and Its Promising Potential Remittix (RTX) is a top PayFi project seeking to simplify cross-border payments by facilitating crypto-to-fiat conversion and global payments. Early adopters find this concept appealing as it takes away the huge fees and processing delays that commonly plague traditional remittances. By solving this real-life problem, Remittix (RTX) is primed for a broader user base than many other tokens. Moreover, Remittix’s presale success clearly shows the project’s impending surge. With more than $8.4 million raised and 390 million tokens sold in just four weeks, experts believe Remittixwill be a successful addition to investors’ portfolios as it continues to go from strength to strength. This backing explains why some long-term Ripple (XRP) holders have jumped ship, hoping to make the most of a newer project set to outshine the XRP coin this year. Though Ripple price actions have always made it a top pick for many crypto portfolios, experts now warn of impending dumps that could rattle the digital asset. Many traders now believe Remittix is the best crypto coin to buy to survive Ripple’s impending dump. They prefer Remittix (RTX) for its real-world payment approach and ongoing presale success. Whether the Ripple price recovers or declines further remains uncertain. Still, the ongoing transition to Remittix (RTX) emphasizes how quickly market sentiment can change. Experts remain confident that this new altcoin can outperform the more established XRP coin. Now is the time to get on board! Join the presale and community now!

Is New Competitor A Diamond In Your Portfolio,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/why-has-xrp-grown-so-much-in-the-last-few-months-is-new-competitor-a-diamond-in-your-portfolio,"Ripple (XRP) remains one of the top crypto investments, and has experienced shocking growth in the past month. This has increased investor confidence, and also directed whales to other altcoins also offering top growth. One of these is 1Fuel (OFT) . A new cryptocurrency in its presale, 1Fuel OFT has shown great promise right from an early stage. Its DeFi ecosystem makes it an interesting investment to watch this year, especially for those who want high returns. XRP’s Growth Trajectory Shocks Investors Ripple’s (XRP) growth in the last few months has left investors excited for what is coming. Ranked as one of the leading crypto investments out there, XRP has achieved a whopping 41.30% growth in the past month alone. For a more short-term outlook, you can see that it’s up by 0.26% in the past seven days and 10.37% in 24 hours. As XRP continues to soar, it is gaining the interest of many investors including Ledger and Core Wallet holders. Its current value is $3.08 but some really optimistic investors are setting their price target at $15. Others are more conservative, expecting it to increase to $5 or surpass this level in 2025. New Altcoin Reveals Impressive Potential in 2025 Although XRP has grown in the past months, investors are interested in 1Fuel (OFT), which has an even better potential this year. 1Fuel stands as a top new altcoin in the crypto space, and is backed by a reliable DEX wallet which offers an edge over names like Ledger and Core Wallet. This has attracted many investors to the presale stage, as it has already sold over 160 million tokens in record time.. What’s more, 1Fuel has raised over $1.6 million, another proof of investor confidence. The presale price is currently $0.017 although it is expected to rise in the next stage. With analysts predicting 88x growth for 1Fuel this year, much higher than that of Ripple, investors have been accumulating the OFT token in the past weeks. 1Fuel (OFT) Stands Out with DeFi Ecosystem 1Fuel’s (OFT) growth potential is not a coincidence but is made possible with its robust DEX wallet, which is the center of its DeFi ecosystem. As an all-in-one cryptocurrency wallet and exchange, 1Fuel is positioned as a reliable investment for those who want a top new altcoin. The crypto wallet supports cross-chain transactions, which allows investors to interact with multiple blockchains from a single wallet. These transactions are completed with a single click, which makes 1Fuel a strong contender to wallets like Ledger and Core Wallet. 1Fuel is changing digital asset management as we know it, and supports crypto debit and credit cards which can be used for real life payments, P2P exchange and AI tools. It also features a cold storage and privacy mixer, anonymizing transactions in a way platforms like Ledger and Core Wallet can’t. The 1Fuel DeFi ecosystem is attracting the attention of many traders, making it a leading crypto investment for 2025. Due to this ecosystem, 1Fuel (OFT) might just grow by 88x this year. Join Investors to Accumulate 1Fuel OFT Crypto whales, including Ripple investors, are taking advantage of the low presale price to buy 1Fuel (OFT) ahead of its public listing. With positive analyst predictions, 1Fuel might just dominate the crypto space this year, and investors are looking out for its DEX wallet features. The 1Fuel presale is the best chance to make your investment before the price increases again.

Remittix (RTX), a fresh contender in the market, is making headlines with its groundbreaking crypto presale, while established players like Cardano (ADA) continue on their own paths. Having secured over $9 million from its presale, industry experts suggest that Remittix is on track to outpace well-known cryptocurrencies like Cardano (ADA). Read on to discover why it may be a smarter investment than Cardano. Expert Insights: Cardano’s Price Drop Could Be Near Cardano's price trends have always intrigued technical analysts, and the latest patterns present a mixed scenario. Earlier this month, ADA hit a double bottom at $0.882, triggering a brief upward surge to $1.16. However, this momentum didn't last; a double-top pattern emerged at $1.152, with a critical support level at $0.882 forming the neckline. A bearish cross between the 50-day and 100-day moving averages adds to the looming negative sentiment. Cardano has also slipped below the $1 psychological threshold, often a precursor to further declines. If the price breaks $0.882, the next target could be $0.762, marking a 20% drop from current levels. Remittix Positioned for Significant Expansion Remittix (RTX) is transforming global payments by combining blockchain technology with traditional fiat transactions, offering efficient and fast cross-border solutions. Supporting over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, the platform allows instant conversion to fiat currencies such as USD and GBP, facilitating direct deposits into recipients' bank accounts. By bridging the gap between crypto and fiat, Remittix surpasses conventional payment giants like Stripe and Wise and crypto-only systems like Coinbase Wallet. With support for more than 30 fiat currencies and over 50 cryptocurrency pairs, Remittix promotes inclusivity and accessibility for both businesses and individuals, streamlining global trade with its wide array of options. Moreover, the platform's straightforward flat-fee model offers cost savings and transparency compared to the high fees and poor exchange rates typical of traditional banks. This model ensures that the full amount reaches the recipient, positioning Remittix as a disruptive force in a payment industry often plagued by dubious practices. Currently available at $0.0418 during its presale, the RTX token represents an enticing investment opportunity. Projections indicate substantial growth, with an anticipated 25x increase during the presale and potential gains exceeding 5,000% post-launch, as demand for cutting-edge cross-border payment solutions continues to escalate. Remittix provides investors a chance to engage with a project exhibiting strong growth potential from an early stage as the cryptocurrency market progresses. RTX may not only match the success of leading altcoins but also redefine standards for blockchain-based financial solutions with rising adoption, a robust foundation, and clear market demand.

With its innovative crypto presale, Remittix (RTX), a new player, is creating waves as well-known cryptocurrencies like Cardano (ADA) navigate their own courses. After raising over $9 million in presale funds, experts believe Remittix will outperform established players like Cardano (ADA). Read in to learn why it is a better investment than Cardano. Expert Analysis: Cardano’s Price Decline is Imminent Technical analysts have long delighted in examining Cardano's price research, and recent trends seem to create a mixed picture. ADA made a double bottom earlier this month at $0.882, which sparked off a positive turnaround that briefly drove the price to $1.16. Still, the momentum was short lived; by $1.152, a double-top pattern developed with the neckline anchored by a pivotal support level of $0.882. The emergence of a bearish crossing between the 50-day and 100-day moving averages accentuates the forebative atmosphere. Cardano has also fallen below the psychological $1 level, which has always been a sign of upcoming declines. Should the price breach $0.882, the next stop, a 20% drop from the current levels, would be $0.762. Remittix is Set for Explosive Growth Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by integrating blockchain technology with fiat transactions, offering fast and cost-efficient cross-border solutions. With support for over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, the platform provides instant conversions into fiat currencies like USD and GBP, enabling seamless deposits into recipients' bank accounts. As a bridge between crypto and fiat, Remittix is the superior counterpart to traditional payment providers such as Stripe and Wise and crypto-exclusive platforms like Coinbase Wallet. Supporting 30+ fiat currencies and over 50 crypto pairs, Remittix ensures accessibility and inclusivity for businesses and individuals, simplifying global commerce with its extensive range of options. Furthermore notable is the platform's open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over exorbitant costs and inadequate exchange rates of conventional banks. This approach guarantees that the full amount sent reaches the recipient, making Remittix a game-changer in the payments industry, where shady practices are unfortunately all too common. Currently priced at $0.0418 during its presale, the RTX token offers a compelling investment opportunity. Forecasts predict significant growth, with a 25x multiplier expected in the presale phase and over 5,000% gains after launch, as demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions continues to rise. Remittix offers investors a chance to interact with a project with high growth potential at an earlier stage as the bitcoin market develops. RTX might not only equal the success of other top altcoins but also alter the benchmarks for blockchain-based financial solutions with increasing acceptance, a solid basis, and evident market demand.

With its presale already raising $1.5 million in just days, 1Fuel is quickly gaining traction as a top DeFi contender. Offering cutting-edge features like cross-chain transactions and AI-driven asset management, 1Fuel attracts retail traders and whale investors. Could 1Fuel’s upcoming listing be the next big move for DOGE gamblers seeking massive returns? Dogecoin could rally to $1 by Q1 2025 Dogecoin peaked above $0.40 before consolidating at approximately $0.33. The meme token’s market cap exceeded $50.7 billion in the last thirty days and has gained over 4% in value. Analyst Ali Martinez shared a chart suggesting Dogecoin might soon break out from a multi-year ascending channel. Martinez tipped a price target of $15, 30 times its current value. However, most traders think Dogecoin will hit $1 by the first quarter of 2025. The return of President Donald Trump to the White House has raised speculation regarding much more crypto-friendly laws that may increase the functionality of meme coins like Dogecoin. Elon Musk remains one of Dogecoin's biggest fans. As its most prominent advocate, his influence on the meme coin is undeniable. With Musk starting his term in the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), analysts believe Dogecoin could exceed expectations in the coming years. Elon’s DOGE gamblers are rushing to 1Fuel After Dogecoin's abysmal market performance, Elon’s DOGE gamblers are shifting focus to the 1Fuel (OFT) presale for big returns. 1Fuel garners attention with its innovative DeFi and digital asset management solutions.

The platform’s privacy mixer ensures complete anonymity for every transaction, supported by disposable wallets and military-grade cold storage. These features provide more protection than traditional privacy tools like Ledger and Core Wallet, giving users confidence in a secure transaction environment. 1Fuel’s storage functionality is just one aspect of its transformative approach to crypto asset management. The platform also offers a crypto debit and credit card for instant fiat exchanges, a peer-to-peer exchange for direct transfers, and AI-powered asset management tools. These features create a versatile, robust solution that appeals to investors seeking convenience and advanced functionality. 1Fuel could be the best ICO project in 2025 Whale investors are turning to 1Fuel for its high-profit potential in the rapidly growing DeFi sector. The ongoing presale sold over 160 million tokens and raised over $1.5 million. Analysts predict that 1Fuel’s price could surge 100x after launch, making its current low price of $0.017 a steal for early backers.

With projections of 30,000% returns by 2025, the AI token has become the focal point of investors seeking exponential growth. Its groundbreaking features, coupled with a fast-selling presale, are fueling its rise to prominence. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Future Of AI Tokens According To Goldman Sachs Analysts The Goldman Sachs analysts’ bold prediction that WallitIQ (WLTQ) will surpass Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) to deliver 30,000% returns by 2025 has sent shockwaves across the crypto community. The prediction hinges on observed facts. At just $0.0420 , the AI token’s presale offers an entry price that’s hard to ignore, especially as early investors will enjoy 406.5% ROI at its launch. Long-term projections further point to a staggering 30,000% growth in Q1 2025. This jaw-dropping potential attracts Goldman Sachs analysts, institutional investors, and retail traders alike, all eager to be part of the next big thing in crypto. While Solana (SOL) currently trades around $247.52 due to market volatility, analysts believe its high-speed blockchain capabilities could push it past $500 in the coming years. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, surged from just $10 in 2016 to a peak of $4,878 in November 2021 and is now trading near $3,199 . Analysts believe it has the potential to cross the $5,000 mark. However, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) unique AI utility and innovative features give it a noticeable edge as Goldman Sachs analysts predict. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale: Redefining Crypto Investments WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) presale is a resounding success, having raised $7 million and gearing towards its $4.5 million third-stage target. Starting at $0.0171, the price has climbed to $0.0420 , delivering 71.43% growth. Early adopters are already celebrating 261% profit gains, and the fourth stage promises an additional 48.15% jump, taking the price to $0.0620. The presale is on track to sell out, with Goldman Sachs analysts predicting a market debut price of $0.15. This trajectory means early investors will enjoy 406.5% returns upon launch, with long-term forecasts pointing to 30,000% growth. What drives this success? The recently announced MVP build of WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App is one of the key differentiators. The app offers an intuitive interface and powerful Wallet Management tools. It simulates the management of ETH and USDT wallets and instant crypto transfers to external addresses. The platform’s Scan & Pay QR feature , which displays QR codes for a user’s receiving wallet address, makes the Goldman Sachs analysts’ confidence in the AI token’s ability to outperform Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) unsurprising. Another feature is the Live Market Data that caters to real-time price tracking powered by the CoinGecko API , with interactive candlestick charts for trend analysis across multiple timeframes. These features, coupled with WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) SolidProof audit , highlight its commitment to practicality, innovation, transparency, and security. They make it a standout among AI tokens and a worthy rival to giants like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH), as indicated by Goldman Sachs analysts. Its ability to raise $7 million and deliver 261% returns during the presale underscores the AI token’s market potential. With projections of 30,000% growth by 2025, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is on track to redefine the crypto landscape and outpace heavyweights like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH). Secure Your Stake in WallitIQ (WLTQ) an AI Token With Unparalleled Growth Potential The crypto market is buzzing with Goldman Sachs analysts’ prediction that WallitIQ (WLTQ) will deliver 30,000% returns by 2025, surpassing Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) in the process. Currently priced at $0.0420 in its third presale stage, this AI token offers investors a rare opportunity to secure life-changing gains. Waiting for the fourth stage’s price jump to $0.0620 is delaying your chance at success. Join the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale today and be part of the future of crypto.

Currently trading at $0.13 , the Kaspa price has experienced a steady increase over the last year. Analysts believe its innovative technology and growing adoption are the driving forces behind this growth. Kaspa also boasts an active community and significant mining activity, with a hashrate exceeding 1.26 EH/s. These metrics highlight the network’s strength and reliability. In terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), Kaspa is expanding its ecosystem with Wrapped Kaspa (wKAS), which bridges Kaspa to Polygon and Binance Smart Chain. This integration is a game-changer, enabling interoperability and potentially boosting the Kaspa price as more users leverage the network. Web3Bay: Revolutionizing Decentralized E-Commerce While Kaspa focuses on revolutionizing blockchain technology, Web3Bay is tackling inefficiencies in traditional e-commerce. Built on blockchain, Web3Bay eliminates high fees, ensures transparency, and offers users complete control over their data. The platform’s hybrid payment system allows seamless transactions using both cryptocurrencies and fiat options, such as PayPal and Apple Pay. One of the most exciting aspects of Web3Bay is its 3BAY token , which powers the ecosystem. Early investors have flocked to the ongoing presale, which has raised over $830,000 and sold more than 250 million tokens at a price of $0.004562 . With a projected launch price of $0.1959 , investors are eyeing a staggering 6,340% ROI . Web3Bay’s roadmap includes NFT marketplaces, staking rewards, and decentralized governance, making it a comprehensive solution for the future of online shopping. Comparing the Growth Potential Both Kaspa and Web3Bay offer immense growth potential, but their approaches and use cases differ. Kaspa is ideal for those looking to invest in cutting-edge blockchain technology. Its ability to process transactions quickly and securely makes it a strong candidate for adoption in various industries, from financial services to supply chain management. On the other hand, Web3Bay appeals to investors seeking real-world utility in a market they understand—e-commerce. With the global e-commerce market projected to reach $8.1 trillion by 2026 , Web3Bay’s decentralized approach could disrupt the industry in much the same way Amazon did two decades ago. Investors are particularly drawn to Web3Bay’s community-driven governance model. Token holders will have a say in shaping the platform’s future, ensuring that it remains aligned with user needs. This level of empowerment is rare in the crypto space and adds to the platform’s appeal. Kaspa Price Prediction for 2025 The Kaspa price has shown resilience despite recent market fluctuations. Analysts predict that its unique blockDAG technology and growing adoption could push the price to $0.50–$0.75 by the end of 2025. The introduction of Wrapped Kaspa is expected to further enhance its ecosystem, attracting more developers and users. However, like all cryptocurrencies, Kaspa is not without risks. Short-term volatility and market sentiment could impact its price. That said, its innovative architecture gives it a competitive edge, making it a solid long-term investment for those who believe in its vision. Why Web3Bay Is a Must-Watch Project While Kaspa’s growth potential is rooted in its technological innovation, Web3Bay is driven by its ability to solve real-world problems. The platform’s use of Layer-2 rollups ensures fast and cost-efficient transactions, addressing one of the biggest challenges in e-commerce today. Web3Bay’s presale success is a testament to its strong investor confidence. As the platform transitions into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), it will empower users to shape its future, making it a true community-driven project. Early investors stand to benefit significantly from the token’s projected ROI, making Web3Bay one of the most exciting opportunities in the crypto market. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Both Projects The Kaspa price and Web3Bay’s presale performance highlight the immense potential of these projects. While Kaspa offers cutting-edge technology for blockchain enthusiasts, Web3Bay provides a practical solution for e-commerce challenges, appealing to a broader audience. Both projects are poised for significant growth in 2025 and beyond. Kaspa’s innovative blockDAG architecture and Web3Bay’s disruptive approach to online shopping make them standout investments. For those looking to diversify their portfolios, these two projects offer a blend of technology and utility that could redefine their respective industries.

Bitcoin MPI Has Seen Its 90-Day MA Cross Above The 365-Day As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin MPI momentum has recently given a bullish signal for Bitcoin. The “MPI” refers to an on-chain metric that keeps track of the ratio between the total miner outflow and its 365-day moving average (MA). Related Reading: $54 Million In Dogecoin Exits Binance As Price Crashes 9%: Sign Of Buying? The miner outflow here is naturally the amount of the cryptocurrency (in USD) that is being transferred out of the wallets associated with the network’s validators. When the value of the MPI is high, it means the miners are making more outflows than usual. Generally, the main reason why this cohort transfers tokens out of its wallets is for selling-related purposes, so this kind of trend can be bearish for the asset’s price. On the other hand, the indicator being low suggests the miners are withdrawing a lower number of coins than the average for the past year. Such a trend could be a sign that this group is preferring to hold for now. In the context of the current topic, the Bitcoin MPI itself isn’t of interest, but rather a derivative indicator known as the MPI Momentum. Like other momentum metrics, this one also involves two MAs: 90-day and 365-day. Below is a chart for the BTC MPI Momentum over the past few years. As displayed in the graph, the 90-day MA of the Bitcoin MPI recently broke above the 365-day one. This suggests miner selling has been gaining positive momentum. While this may sound bad, the cryptocurrency has actually historically benefited from the pattern. From the chart, it’s apparent that the crossover generally signals the start of an extended bullish period for the asset’s price. The last time that the two MAs of the MPI displayed this trend before the latest instance was back in December 2022. Related Reading: Solana Plunges 12%, But This Pattern Could Mean Decline Isn’t Over Yet So far since the most recent crossover, the 90-day and 365-day MAs have continued to diverge away from each other, implying that the momentum in the metric remains strong. Bitcoin has usually only hit tops when the 90-day has gained a large amount of distance over the 365-day. Thus, considering the current placement of the two lines, it’s possible that the cryptocurrency has some room remaining in this cycle, before miner selloff leads to a top. BTC Price Bitcoin fell towards the $98,000 mark during yesterday’s crash, but the asset appears to have found a rebound since then as it’s now back at $102,500.

Bitcoin (BTC) changed the game for early investors, delivering life-changing returns, and Solana (SOL) is recognized for its exceptional scalability. Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin in the market, is grabbing headlines with predictions of 55,000% growth potential. Having raised $1 million during its presale in minutes, it’s being closely watched by experts who see it as the next breakout token alongside top contenders. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is Creating a Buzz 1. Fresh Entry, Massive Upside Being new to the market, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers a rare opportunity to invest before its value skyrockets. Early investors stand to benefit from the kind of exponential returns only seen in the early days of tokens like SOL and XRP. 2. Exceptional Presale Success The presale success of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN , raising $1 million almost instantly, is a clear indicator of its high demand and market appeal. Its early momentum positions it as a leader among emerging cryptos. 3. Exclusivity Fuels Demand Unlike XRP, LINK, and DOT, which are widely available across exchanges, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively sold at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This controlled access ensures scarcity, increasing its value for early adopters. How It Stands Against Competitors XRP: Dominates payments but lacks the early-stage growth potential of this new coin. Solana (SOL): Scalable and fast, but its growth is already stabilizing compared to this fresh token. Chainlink (LINK): Strong in decentralized oracles but can’t match the excitement surrounding THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An emerging project, but its momentum falls short of this token’s presale success. Don’t Miss This Game-Changing Opportunity With experts predicting up to 55,000% gains, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is becoming the most talked-about crypto of 2025. Its record-breaking presale, exclusivity, and high-growth potential make it a must-watch token alongside Solana. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and join the revolution!

Amid this whirlwind of innovation, three names are turning heads: Qubetics, Sonic, and Solana. These aren’t just digital currencies; they’re the backbone of a technological evolution that’s changing how we think about finance, data, and global connectivity. What makes these projects stand out? Each tackles unique challenges with creative solutions. Whether it’s Qubetics solving blockchain interoperability issues, Sonic spearheading decentralized finance, or Solana pushing transaction speeds to new limits, these cryptos offer massive growth potential for investors and enthusiasts alike. Among these powerhouses, Qubetics is stealing the spotlight. Its presale is a runaway success, already selling over 449 million tokens to more than 16,900 holders and raising $11.2 million. But it’s not just about numbers. With game-changing interoperability features and the upcoming Test Net launch, Qubetics is shaping the future of blockchain technology in a way that older systems couldn’t. Qubetics: Redefining Blockchain with Unmatched Interoperability Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project—it’s a movement. With interoperability as its core feature, Qubetics connects diverse blockchain networks seamlessly. This isn’t a minor convenience; it’s a fundamental shift in how blockchains communicate. Imagine sending assets or data from one network to another without intermediaries, delays, or compatibility issues. That’s the power of Qubetics . Consider real-world scenarios: A multinational corporation operates on multiple blockchains for supply chain management, payment processing, and customer loyalty programs. Qubetics’ interoperability lets these networks work together, streamlining operations and cutting costs. Or think about developers—they can create dApps that interact with various blockchains without learning different coding languages for each. It’s like having a universal translator for blockchain. The ongoing presale is the perfect entry point. At $0.0606 per token, $TICS is accessible to anyone looking to get in on the ground floor of a transformative project. With its interoperability focus, Test Net launch, and growing adoption, Qubetics is poised to be one of the top cryptos for massive growth. Sonic: The DeFi Powerhouse Revolutionizing Finance If decentralized finance (DeFi) is the future, Sonic is the architect. This crypto project is laser-focused on creating a robust, accessible, and user-friendly DeFi ecosystem. Sonic’s platform offers lending, borrowing, staking, and yield farming, all designed with an intuitive interface that even crypto newcomers can navigate. Why is Sonic making waves? It’s all about accessibility and innovation. Picture a small business owner who wants to secure a loan without dealing with traditional banks. Sonic’s DeFi platform enables peer-to-peer lending, cutting out middlemen and reducing costs. Investors, meanwhile, can earn passive income through staking and yield farming, creating financial opportunities that traditional markets can’t match. Sonic’s community-driven governance is another highlight. Token holders can vote on platform updates, ensuring the ecosystem evolves in line with user needs. This decentralized approach fosters trust and engagement, making Sonic a standout in the crowded DeFi space. As DeFi adoption grows, Sonic’s user-friendly platform and innovative features position it as a leader in the field. For those seeking a crypto with real-world applications and growth potential, Sonic is a name to watch. Solana: The Speed Demon of Blockchain Speed is Solana’s calling card. This high-performance blockchain has redefined what’s possible in terms of transaction throughput, processing over 65,000 transactions per second. For comparison, Ethereum handles around 15 transactions per second, highlighting Solana’s game-changing capabilities. Imagine you’re an NFT collector participating in a hotly anticipated drop. On slower networks, delays or failed transactions can ruin the experience. With Solana, transactions are lightning-fast, ensuring you secure that coveted piece of digital art. Developers building dApps for gaming, finance, or other high-demand industries also benefit from Solana’s speed and efficiency. Solana’s scalability is another key advantage. While many blockchains struggle with network congestion, Solana’s architecture ensures consistent performance, even under heavy loads. This reliability makes it a go-to platform for projects that demand speed and scalability. From decentralized exchanges to NFT marketplaces, Solana’s ecosystem is thriving. Its commitment to speed, efficiency, and developer support makes it a top contender for massive growth in the crypto space. Interoperability: The Future of Blockchain Connectivity Interoperability isn’t just a buzzword; it’s the backbone of blockchain’s next evolution. Qubetics is leading the charge with a system that allows different blockchains to communicate effortlessly. This isn’t just about convenience—it’s about unlocking new possibilities. Think about cross-border payments. Traditional systems are slow and expensive, while blockchain promises speed and transparency. But when blockchains can’t talk to each other, the process hits a wall. Qubetics breaks down these barriers, enabling seamless transactions across networks. For businesses, this means faster settlements and lower costs. For individuals, it’s a more inclusive financial system. Qubetics’ interoperability also fuels innovation. Developers can build dApps that pull data or assets from multiple networks, creating richer, more versatile applications. It’s a game-changer for industries ranging from healthcare to supply chain management, where data integration is critical. Conclusion: The Time to Act Is Now Qubetics, Sonic, and Solana aren’t just cryptos; they’re catalysts for massive growth and innovation. Each project addresses unique challenges, offering solutions that set them apart in a crowded market. Whether it’s Qubetics’ interoperability, Sonic’s DeFi revolution, or Solana’s unmatched speed, these cryptos are shaping the future of blockchain. Qubetics’ presale is a golden opportunity. With over $11.2 million raised and 449 million tokens sold, it’s clear that investors recognize its potential. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this groundbreaking project. Visit the official site, join the presale, and position yourself for what could be the investment opportunity of a lifetime.

Trump Fuks DeepSeek (TRUMSEEK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMSEEK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Fuks DeepSeek can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fuks DeepSeek could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fuks DeepSeek launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fuks DeepSeek on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fuks DeepSeek by entering its contract address (CA) – 3QtYU6QPQPGbzHX9evKdxVHsoTnXyjUwY8xkaVnZ9QPc – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMSEEK.

While privacy coins like Toncoin and meme coins like Dogecoin have enjoyed their moments in the sun, investor attention seems to be pivoting toward Remittix (RTX), a game-changing blockchain platform with the potential to rival Ripple’s impact on global payments. Toncoin Rides Privacy Hype but Struggles to Hold Ground Toncoin (TON) recently crossed the $5 mark, fueled by significant events in the privacy coin sector. President Donald Trump’s pardon of Ross Ulbricht and the reversal of the Tornado Cash ban sent ripples through the market, spotlighting privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. Toncoin, created by the Telegram team, benefited from this surge of optimism, with whale investors reportedly snapping up $2.3 million worth of TON in the lead-up to these announcements. Despite these tailwinds, Toncoin’s rally appears precarious. While the coin’s double-bottom pattern hints at a possible 45% rally to $7.70, a bearish reversal looms if it dips below $5.30. The privacy coin cryptocurrency market trends are inherently volatile which makes TON’s future uncertain, leaving investors searching for more stable, high-growth opportunities. Dogecoin Faces Market Uncertainty Amid DOGE ETF Filing Dogecoin (DOGE), formerly the cryptocurrency world’s darling, has seen a sharp decline in value, dropping 6% in a single day. Optimism surrounding recent DOGE ETF filings has failed to translate into sustained price momentum. Adding to the bearish sentiment, the removal of Shiba Inu imagery from the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) website, a surprising nod to the meme coin, has left many Dogecoin enthusiasts disheartened. The D.O.G.E. ETF filings by major players like Bitwise and REXShares initially sparked excitement, with some analysts predicting DOGE could soar to $15. However, the removal of visual ties to its mascot and a steep 75% drop in trading volume signal waning interest. Even with predictions of short-term recovery to $0.39, Dogecoin’s long-term prospects remain clouded by uncertainty. Remittix, The 50x Gem Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments Remittix (RTX) has become a strong contender that has the potential to revolutionize international payments as Toncoin and Dogecoin struggle. Through the integration of blockchain technology with conventional currency systems, Remittix provides a smooth and economical way to conduct cross-border transactions. Over 40 cryptocurrencies are supported by RTX, including Ethereum, Cardano, and Dogecoin. Funds are put straight into recipients’ bank accounts and may be instantly converted into fiat currencies like USD and GBP. Slow transaction times and exorbitant costs are two major issues facing the remittance sector that this invention attempts to solve. Remittix is drawing interest from investors looking for a business with significant development potential due to its distinctive combination of speed, efficiency, and interoperability with numerous cryptocurrencies. Because it focuses on facilitating financial inclusion and cross-border solutions, early adopters have compared Remittix to Ripple (XRP). With the remittance market worth over $600 billion a year, Remittix’s ability to upend the status quo makes it a unique project with substantial long-term potential. Ripple XRP Maintains Its Momentum With a 530% surge in price after Donald Trump’s election victory, Ripple (XRP) has become a hot topic. The growing use of rIPPLE XRP’s stablecoin, RLUSD, and its partnerships with financial institutions further increase its use. Despite ongoing regulatory challenges, rIPPLE XRP has performed better than most, and many investors have staked their money on its long-term viability. However, compared to up-and-coming initiatives like Remittix, Ripple’s high price and established market position may limit its potential for explosive development because of its emphasis on institutional use cases. Investors Eye the Next Big Opportunity The cryptocurrency market trends’ evolving dynamics show the need for innovation and adaptation. While Toncoin and Dogecoin struggle to sustain their pace, Remittix has emerged as a viable challenger, with a daring vision for the future of global payments. With its state-of-the-art technology, broad cryptocurrency support, and focus on efficiency, Remittix has established itself as a high-growth potential that could surpass even well-established rivals like Ripple. For investors searching for the next big thing, Remittix is a project worth watching in the constantly shifting cryptocurrency market, check out their presale here : Website : https://remittix.io/ Socials : https://linktr.ee/remittix",Press Release,EN,0,0,DOGE|BUSINESS|XRP|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-29 02:37:04

BTC is facing resistance at $103,000 and might aim for an upside break. Bitcoin started a decent upward move above the $100,000 zone. The price is trading below $103,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $102,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another decline if it stays below the $103,000 zone. Bitcoin Price Holds Support Bitcoin price started a fresh decline below the $103,000 and $102,500 levels.

One such story is that of Book of Meme, a cryptocurrency that started humbly but skyrocketed into the stratosphere. In its early days, few believed in its potential. But those who did? They’re now reaping massive gains, basking in their foresight, while others are left wishing they had jumped in at the ground level. The question is: What if another chance like that comes along? Meet Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), one of the top new meme coins to invest in this week, currently making waves with its unique presale structure and sky-high ROI potential. If you’re among those who missed the early days of Book of Meme, Arctic Pablo might just be your redemption story. Book of Meme: The Missed Opportunity That Still Haunts Investors When Book of Meme first launched, few could have imagined it would achieve its heights today. Back then, the coin traded at mere fractions of a cent—around $0.00002. Many dismissed it as “just another meme coin,” a risky gamble in a volatile market. However, a small but savvy group of investors saw its potential. They believed in its quirky branding, community-first approach, and viral appeal. Fast forward to today, and those same investors are now sitting on life-changing returns. With its value surging over 1,000,000% from its early days, Book of Meme proved that the right meme coin at the right time can deliver jaw-dropping gains. But here’s the thing: missed opportunities don’t define you. Learning from them does. And right now, Arctic Pablo presents a strikingly similar chance to get in on the ground floor of what could be the next big crypto success story. Arctic Pablo: A Presale Adventure Packed with Potential While Book of Meme is a “what could have been,” Arctic Pablo is your fresh opportunity. Unlike traditional presales that roll out in stages, Arctic Pablo takes a storytelling approach, tying its presale phases to different locations in its adventurous narrative. Currently, the presale is in Glacier Grove , with the token priced at an accessible $0.000043. For those wondering why Arctic Pablo is one of the top new meme coins to invest in this week, let’s break it down: Massive ROI Potential: By the time the token’s launch price of $0.008 hits, early adopters could see a staggering 18,546% ROI. Staking and Rewards: During the presale, investors enjoy an impressive 66% APY, with opportunities to earn rewards by staking tokens or participating in referral programs. Deflationary Mechanism: Unsold tokens are permanently burned weekly, reducing supply and boosting scarcity—a win for long-term holders. Community Competitions: Active participation in the Arctic Pablo community comes with rewards, whether in APC tokens or USD. These features don’t just set Arctic Pablo apart—they create excitement and anticipation, drawing in investors who recognize its potential to be the next big thing. Why Arctic Pablo Stands Out as One of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in This Week Arctic Pablo isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a movement. With its adventurous theme and unique approach to presale, it bridges the gap between myth and reality, capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts. The narrative element—tying presale phases to locations like Glacier Grove—keeps investors engaged while building a story around the token. Additionally, the presale is already making waves, with over $550,000 raised so far. Compare this to Book of Meme’s early days, and it’s clear that Arctic Pablo has hit the ground running. By the time the presale concludes at a final price of $0.0008, those who got in early will already be sitting on gains. And once it launches at $0.008, the growth trajectory could mirror—or even surpass—that of early meme coin successes. What’s Next for Arctic Pablo? The current presale location, Glacier Grove, is just one stop on Arctic Pablo’s exciting journey. As the presale progresses, the coin’s value and community buzz continue to grow. But here’s the kicker: tokens become increasingly scarce thanks to the deflationary burn mechanism. The longer you wait, the more you risk losing a lucrative entry point. Arctic Pablo is one of the top new meme coins to invest in this week , with every element—from its pricing to its ROI potential—crafted to maximize value for early investors. If you missed Book of Meme, Arctic Pablo might be your second chance to turn small investments into substantial gains. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Arctic Pablo – Your Next Big Opportunity Awaits Book of Meme taught us that early belief in a project can lead to monumental returns. While the regret of missing that chance stings, Arctic Pablo offers a fresh opportunity to rewrite the story. With its innovative presale structure, deflationary mechanics, and a promising ROI that could rival the greats, Arctic Pablo stands out among the top new meme coins to invest in this week. So, the question is: Will you let this chance slip by, or will you grab it and secure your spot in what could be the next big meme coin success story? Don’t wait too long—opportunities like Arctic Pablo don’t stay on the ground floor forever.

The Russian Ministry of Finance in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Ludvig14 [CC BY-SA 3.0]) Media outlets say that the Central Bank wants to roll the coin out by early July this year, despite pushback from the nation’s commercial baking sector . Finance Minister Anton Siluanov first began speaking about his ministry’s intentions to test the CBDC’s budgetary capability over a year ago. The Central Bank says its testing “is ongoing.” It did not reveal any of the details of the pilot’s “budgetary” transactions. The Ministry of Finance has said that “so far” there are “no plans to make government payments to citizens” using the digital RUB. However, Siluanov has repeatedly talked up the use of the digital ruble to “ensure the targeted use of budget funds.” Two oil tankers hauling crude from Russia made U-turns as they sailed past France and are now at a standstill near the northern port of Cherbourg https://t.co/nYodJ1oMK7 — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) January 27, 2025 July Launch for Russia’s CBDC? Moscow officials have previously spoken about the coin’s potential in helping to eliminate public sector corruption. They also think they could mark or “color-code” certain digital ruble welfare payments to ensure citizens use government handouts correctly. This, they think, could help wipe out benefits fraud. Meanwhile, lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov, the head of the State Duma’s Committee on the Financial Markets, has suggested that the Chuvash Republic (Chuvashia) could become a major testbed for “budgetary”-themed digital RUB projects. Aksakov is the State Duma representative for the Cheboksary constituency in the Chuvash Republic, in the center of European Russia. The Chuvash Republic on a map of Russia. (Source: Marmelad [CC BY-SA 2.5]) The lawmaker is also the chief architect of Russia’s crypto, blockchain, and CBDC-related legislation.

Testing on the digital ruble started in August 2023. The Central Bank has since announced that all “systemically important credit institutions” (the nation’s biggest banks) will launch CBDC transactions “from July 1, 2025.” On December 4, 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his own intentions to ensure that Moscow begins using the digital ruble “in settlements within the federal budget” in 2025. Citizens Concerned About CBDC The Central Bank has previously urged citizens not to fear the digital RUB, despite multiple surveys demonstrating Russians’ distinct lack of appetite to adopt a CBDC. The Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina speaking in December 2024. (Source: Bank of Russia/YouTube/Screenshot) However, Putin, Moscow officials, and the Central Bank think they will be able to use the coin to trade with BRICS nations and other partners without the need for the US dollar. While the Finance Ministry believes Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoin payments can help Russian trade firms bypass US, UK, and EU-led sanctions, the Central Bank has long pursued a digital RUB-based solution instead. The bank says that the digital RUB will become Russia’s “third” form of currency, after cash rubles and “non-cash fiat.” The post Digital RUB: Moscow ‘Pilots Use of CBDC in Budgetary Payments’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|News|Central Bank Digital Currency|Russia,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-01-29 03:00:00

Recently, an analyst who made a massive profit by buying Solana (SOL) at its formative stage resurfaced to buy an AI token, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , which crypto experts believe has the potential to outperform Solana (SOL) by Q2 2025. Let’s discuss why Solana Price Dips Below All-Time High Solana (SOL) launched in 2020 as a fast, secure, scalable, developer-friendly blockchain platform. The blockchain platform sold its native token SOL to crypto community members in a public auction at $0.04, and soon its price rose to $0.22. Within this time, an analyst who saw its potential bought Solana (SOL) at that low price. In the first several hours of trading, Solana (SOL) hit an all-time high of $1.33, resulting in a massive yield for the analyst. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) continued to grow in value, reaching another all-time high of $259 in the crypto bull run of 2021. But Solana (SOL), alongside other assets in the crypto market, suffered a massive dip during the crypto winter that followed in 2022. However, by January 2025, Solana rallied to another all-time high of $293, making the analyst who bought the token around $0.11 a crypto millionaire. According to CoinGecko , Solana (SOL) has dipped to $247, ranking 5th in the crypto market, but before the dip, the analyst had taken profit and shifted attention to another token with the potential to make him a crypto billionaire. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Poised For Explosive Growth Amidst Presale As the climate began to turn bearish for Solana (SOL), the analyst shifted attention to WallitIQ (WLTQ) , which is currently offering its native token, WLTQ, at a low price of $0.0420 per coin to crypto community members. The analyst rushed into this presale, comparing how Solana (SOL) quickly rose from barely a dollar to $293. Thus, the analyst is confident that the token will surge to $10 by Q2 2025, surpassing Solana’s (SOL) gains. Several crypto market experts share the same sentiment with the analysts, even speculating a more ambitious prediction of $20 for the token. A surge to $20 will result in a 50,000% ROI for all early investors, including the analyst, making investors from all regions hurry to buy the token at its formative to secure their chances of profit. Aside from the ambitious prediction by crypto market experts on the platform’s native token, WallitIQ (WLTQ) also features an AI-powered crypto wallet designed to accommodate crypto experts and newbies with little or no knowledge of crypto wallets. The AI crypto wallet also has cool features like AI-driven smart suggestions, which take users to the next level, as AI algorithms offer recommendations and trading tips based on market conditions and individual wallet activities. In addition, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has unveiled an MVP launch of its crypto wallet management mobile app , which offers cooler features like simulated crypto trading and detailed transaction history for all wallet activities. WLTQ, the platform’s native token, will be instrumental in how both the platform and the mobile app operate, increasing their use cases and inherent value. However, everyone who buys and holds the native token will gain voting rights to participate in the platform’s governance. Aside from that, token holders who use the token as gas fees on the network will become eligible for discounts on their transactions. Conclusion Like Solana (SOL), the analyst is confident that he will profit massively from the WallitIQ (WLTQ) ecosystem by buying its native token in presale. Several other investors share this bullish sentiment, which is why millions of the tokens have already been sold. As a cherry on top, SolidProof , a world-renowned blockchain security firm, has thoroughly audited the platform’s smart contract, and the WLTQ token has been listed on Coinmarketcap. So, the analyst is calling on everyone to buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) today to secure their chances of becoming a crypto billionaire.

Recently, a crypto billionaire has brought attention to two notable ventures: Dogecoin (DOGE), the popular meme coin, and Lightchain AI , an innovative project combining blockchain and artificial intelligence. Currently in its presale stage at $0.005625 per token, Lightchain AI has already secured $12.8 million in funding, reflecting significant investor enthusiasm. This combination marks a shift in blockchain investment, merging widespread appeal with advanced technology to drive future success. Why Dogecoin Continues to Attract Billionaire Investors Dogecoin continues to captivate billionaire investors due to its unique blend of community-driven appeal and high-profile endorsements. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has been a prominent advocate, frequently expressing support that has significantly influenced Dogecoin’s market performance. The cryptocurrency’s lighthearted origin and widespread recognition have fostered a robust community, enhancing its attractiveness as a speculative asset. Additionally, Dogecoin’s increasing acceptance for transactions, including its use by companies like SpaceX, underscores its growing utility. The combination of influential backing, community enthusiasm, and expanding real-world applications makes Dogecoin a compelling choice for investors seeking both engagement and potential returns in the evolving crypto landscape. Lightchain AI- Next Big Opportunity in Blockchain Lightchain AI is revolutionizing blockchain technology with its forward-thinking innovations, making it a standout opportunity for investors. Its adaptive performance optimization ensures seamless AI-driven computations, addressing latency issues that traditional blockchains struggle with. The platform also pioneers real-time AI workflows, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) to execute complex tasks efficiently. Unlike many projects, Lightchain AI integrates dynamic resource allocation, optimizing network performance by allocating computational tasks based on complexity and node capacity. Its tokenomics emphasizes sustainability, with a balanced allocation of resources for staking rewards, development, and liquidity, fostering long-term growth. Additionally, its community-driven governance model ensures decisions align with collective goals. These groundbreaking features position Lightchain AI as a transformative force in blockchain, capturing investor attention for its innovative and practical approach. Lightchain AI is Golden Opportunity for Investors Lightchain AI is where two powerhouse technologies—blockchain and artificial intelligence—come together, creating an exciting opportunity for investors. With its unmatched versatility and scalability, this project is set to deliver impressive long-term returns. Right now, its presale price doesn’t reflect its true potential, making it the perfect moment to get in early and ride the wave of future growth. Even crypto heavyweights who backed Dogecoin are showing confidence in Lightchain AI, proving it’s more than just hype—it’s a game-changing venture. Combining cutting-edge innovation, strong community support, and real-world practicality, Lightchain AI is paving the way for a new era of blockchain investments.

While Dogecoin (DOGE), the beloved memecoin, has captured the hearts of many, its recent price volatility has driven investors to find alternatives in the growing AI altcoin market. RCO Finance (RCOF) , a rising AI altcoin, stands out by offering stability and the potential for generational wealth. With its innovative features and strategic market positioning, RCOF is well-equipped to take advantage of the current Dogecoin price dynamics, presenting a compelling investment opportunity in the altcoin space. Dogecoin Price Faces Resistance Amid Market Turbulence The recent crypto market sell-off has dealt a significant blow to the memecoin sector, with Dogecoin (DOGE) facing sharp declines. The Dogecoin price dropped by 10.85% within 24 hours, settling at $0.3133, while SHIB mirrored the downturn with a 10.15% decline. This Dogecoin price drop comes as Bitcoin (BTC) briefly dipped below the $99,000 mark, triggering widespread liquidations of over $630 million, primarily impacting long positions. Market fear has been compounded by global economic concerns, including a looming Western stock market crash tied to China’s AI advancements. Dogecoin’s valuation, currently hovering at $99.8 billion, faces downward pressure as investor sentiment wavers. These developments have prompted traders to reconsider their positions in memecoins, with the AI altcoin market presenting prospects like RCO Finance , poised to take advantage of the shifting market dynamics and position itself as a next-generation wealth creator. RCO FInance (RCOF): Is it Time for AI Altcoins to Shine As the Dogecoin price faces hurdles, attention is gradually shifting toward innovative AI altcoins like RCO Finance.

33767162,[object Object],1738119656,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Crypto Investors Gear Up for New Opportunities Amid US Political Shifts, Says Bernstein",https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-investors-opportunities-political-bernstein/,"Following a series of discussions with a diverse group of US investors, analysts at Bernstein have noted a notable observation: various market participants are increasingly convinced that “crypto is back.” This renewed enthusiasm comes on the heels of a political shift under the Trump administration, which has sparked growing curiosity about the potential implications for digital assets. According to Bernstein’s team, led by Gautam Chhugani, this optimism is not yet accompanied by a detailed understanding of the emerging regulatory space , but it’s clear that investors are preparing for increased involvement. Regulatory Developments And Institutional Interest Bernstein highlighted a broad spectrum of investor interest spanning traditional finance, payments, technology, and crypto-focused sectors. While there’s an eagerness to explore crypto-related equities—ranging from exchanges to AI-integrated miners—the analysts also identified a keen focus on Bitcoin price dynamics and stablecoins, especially as the US legislative environment evolves. Notably, new players in fixed income and convertible markets have shown heightened interest, with MicroStrategy’s strategic moves continuing to attract attention. Bernstein pointed to several key regulatory factors that could shape the future of the crypto market. Among them are President Trump’s executive orders to explore strategic digital asset reserves and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s potential repeal of regulations hindering US banks from holding digital assets. These measures, if implemented, may promote broader institutional participation and enhance liquidity. The analysts forecast a surge in corporate Bitcoin purchases, with annual volumes potentially doubling by 2025. Despite the broad interest, institutional investors remain neutral on Bitcoin’s current price trajectory, according to Bernstein. Rather than aggressive bullish or bearish stances , the prevailing sentiment suggests a wait-and-see approach. Equity investors, in particular, are concentrating on crypto-related stocks as direct spot Bitcoin investments remain out of reach for many. Corporate and Stablecoin Growth Investor discussions also touched on the evolving role of stablecoins and their potential to reinforce the US dollar’s dominance in digital finance. Bernstein predicts that stablecoin legislation will drive adoption in areas like cross-border payments and remittances, with banks and fintech firms exploring the revenue and integration possibilities these digital assets offer. On the corporate side, Bernstein’s analysts identified MicroStrategy as a key player in Bitcoin-linked capital markets. Although some view the company’s heavy Bitcoin exposure as risky, Bernstein argues that MicroStrategy’s approach—issuing convertible debt and preference shares—has been instrumental in advancing institutional Bitcoin adoption. With other corporations likely to follow suit, the firm anticipates overall corporate Bitcoin purchases to reach $50 billion annually by 2025. Bernstein maintains a positive outlook on several companies tied to crypto’s resurgence, including Robinhood, Riot Platforms, and Core Scientific. They see these firms as well-positioned to benefit from the growing momentum in the digital asset space, driven by regulatory clarity, institutional participation, and stablecoin innovation.

ETH is now consolidating losses and might face resistance near the $3,200 zone. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $3,150 zone. The price is trading below $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,250 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start another decline if it stays below the $3,220 level. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price started a fresh decline below the $3,250 and $3,200 levels, like Bitcoin . ETH even declined below the $3,050 level before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $3,021 and the price recently corrected some losses . There was a move above the $3,120 and $3,150 levels. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,425 swing high to the $3,021 low. However, the bears were active near the $3,220 resistance. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,250 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,150 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,220 level, the trend line, and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,425 swing high to the $3,021 low. The main resistance is now forming near $3,270. A clear move above the $3,270 resistance might send the price toward the $3,350 resistance. An upside break above the $3,350 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,420 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,220 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,050 level. The first major support sits near the $3,020. A clear move below the $3,020 support might push the price toward the $3,000 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,950 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,880.

This marks a 2.3% increase over the past day. However, the asset remains in a state of overall decline, down 3.3% over the week. While this modest rebound offers some relief, Ethereum is still grappling with the effects of an overall bearish trend. The ongoing price movement has prompted some analysts to revisit Ethereum’s underlying on-chain metrics to understand what may lie ahead for the cryptocurrency. One key area of focus is Ethereum’s spot exchange reserves. According to a recent analysis by Cryptoavails, a contributor to the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, the total reserves of Ethereum held on spot exchanges have been steadily declining. This long-term trend points to a shift in how market participants are managing their holdings. Related Reading: Ethereum Foundation Sells Another 100 ETH, But There’s Still ‘Hopium’ For Holders Ethereum Spot Exchange Reserves Trend According to Cryptoavails, Ethereum reserves on spot exchanges have gone through significant changes over the years. During the 2017-2018 bull market, reserves reached their peak, driven by a surge in investor interest. The 2020-2021 period saw another substantial increase, fueled by the rise of the DeFi ecosystem and Ethereum-based projects. However, starting in late 2021, reserves began a sharp decline as large withdrawals from exchanges became more common. By 2023, reserve levels hit a low point, and by 2024, these reduced levels persisted, signaling a potential supply shortage. This reduction in reserves often indicates that holders are withdrawing Ethereum from exchanges for long-term storage, rather than leaving it available for immediate trading. As a result, the diminished supply on exchanges can create upward pressure on prices. Cryptoavails noted that from 2022 onward, as reserves decreased, Ethereum’s price started to stabilize at higher levels. This pattern suggests that low reserve levels could support further price increases, potentially triggering a new upward trend. Technical Analysis Of ETH From a technical standpoint, Ethereum has shown patterns that analysts interpret as bullish. Several prominent figures in the crypto community have shared their insights. One renowned analyst known as Crypto Ceaser recently highlighted a bounce in Ethereum’s price as a significant opportunity, expressing a view that the cryptocurrency is undervalued and may be poised to reach new all-time highs. $ETH – #Ethereum bounced as expected. This was a huge opportunity. Send it. In my opinion Ethereum is heavily undervalued. I think we will see new ATH’s soon. pic.twitter.com/ljMa1lEpJO — Crypto Caesar (@CryptoCaesarTA) January 28, 2025 However, not all analyses paint a uniformly optimistic picture. Anup Dhungana, another crypto analyst, pointed out a divergence between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s market behavior. While Bitcoin has maintained a steady uptrend, Ethereum’s performance against Bitcoin has been less robust, with the ETH/BTC pair forming lower lows. This divergence reflects reduced investor interest in Ethereum relative to other assets.

A rebound from this level could potentially revive broader interest in Ethereum and altcoins, paving the way for another phase of growth.

Polkadot’s focus on multi-chain capabilities and developer engagement demonstrates how blockchain ecosystems can achieve scalability and utility. Similarly, World Chain leverages Chainlink’s CCIP to solve cross-chain communication challenges, improving interoperability within decentralized networks. However, Web3Bay sets itself apart by blending robust security measures, such as multi-signature wallets and encryption protocols, with cross-chain compatibility. Its strategic presale model further reinforces its commitment to fostering growth while prioritizing user trust. Together, these platforms highlight diverse approaches to advancing blockchain technology and reshaping its practical applications. Why Security and Presale Strategy Make Web3Bay a Standout Platform Web3Bay is redefining decentralized e-commerce with security and strategic innovation at its core. To begin with, to ensure user trust and safety in financial transactions, the platform employs a multi-layered approach. Specifically, key security measures include rigorous third-party audits for its smart contracts, minimizing vulnerabilities and safeguarding user assets. In addition, multi-signature wallets provide an added layer of protection by requiring multiple authorizations for fund access, reducing risks of unauthorized activity. Furthermore, coupled with two-factor authentication (2FA) and robust encryption protocols, Web3Bay prioritizes secure access and user privacy, setting a benchmark for decentralized platforms. At the same time, this commitment to safety is matched by Web3Bay’s innovative fundraising strategy. Currently, in Stage 4 of its 28-stage presale, the platform has already raised $950,000, selling over 250.52 million 3BAY tokens. As a result, early participants are benefiting from incremental price increases, with the current price at $0.004562625. Thus, this dynamic model not only rewards early supporters with cost advantages but also ensures a steady foundation for the platform’s long-term growth. Looking ahead, Web3Bay’s cross-chain compatibility with Ethereum and BNB Chain promises to elevate its ecosystem by enabling seamless asset transactions across multiple blockchains. Consequently, this strategy enhances liquidity and broadens the platform’s utility, positioning it as a bridge between fragmented blockchain networks. In summary, by combining robust security protocols, a user-centric presale strategy, and a visionary approach to interoperability, Web3Bay is laying the groundwork for a transformative e-commerce experience. World Chain Adopts Chainlink’s CCIP for Seamless Blockchain Connectivity World Chain has adopted Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to revolutionize its cross-chain operations. Notably, this integration empowers World Chain to enable secure and seamless communication across multiple blockchains, addressing the long-standing challenges of interoperability within decentralized ecosystems. By adopting CCIP, World Chain aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of its decentralized applications, providing users with unified access to diverse blockchain networks. This development highlights the increasing demand for interoperability solutions, as blockchain projects strive to bridge the gaps between isolated networks. To this end, Chainlink’s CCIP offers robust security and scalability, ensuring reliable data transmission and token movements between chains. Moreover, World Chain’s adoption of this protocol demonstrates its commitment to innovation, as it seeks to elevate user experience and broaden the scope of its decentralized services. Ultimately, this integration not only positions World Chain as a forward-thinking blockchain but also reinforces Chainlink’s role as a leader in cross-chain technology. Polkadot’s Breakout: A New Era of Growth for DOT Polkadot (DOT) has recently captured the spotlight with a significant price surge, signaling a potential upward trend. To begin with, this momentum is largely driven by increased developer engagement, particularly with its innovative parachain technology, which has become a hub for decentralized application (dApp) development. As a result, as the cryptocurrency market rebounds and interest in altcoins rises, Polkadot’s unique multi-chain capabilities position it favorably for future expansion. In addition, strategic alliances with various blockchain projects further enhance its ecosystem and utility. For instance, analysts are eyeing key resistance levels, notably the $8 to $10 range, as indicators of DOT’s trajectory. Consequently, a sustained bullish trend could propel the token to the $12 to $15 bracket, with long-term prospects potentially reaching $20, contingent on ongoing adoption and developer support. Final Say The advancements seen in platforms like Web3Bay, Polkadot, and World Chain reflect the ongoing evolution of blockchain technology. Polkadot’s multi-chain focus and World Chain’s integration of Chainlink’s CCIP address the critical challenges of scalability and interoperability, fostering greater connectivity across networks. Web3Bay distinguishes itself by integrating security, user trust, and strategic growth into a single platform, exemplifying how a holistic approach can redefine decentralized e-commerce.

Garlinghouse said that the U.S. reserve should include a diverse array of cryptocurrencies, rather than solely relying on Bitcoin. Garlinghouse expressed his belief that a diversified crypto portfolio would benefit the U.S. and support American crypto companies. He also dismissed claims that he was trying to undermine Bitcoin in favor of XRP, saying that the opportunities in the crypto space are large enough to allow for multiple winners. “The opportunities are so large, there will be many winners,” Garlinghouse said, stressing the importance of diversification. .

He recently addressed the issue of maximalism, criticizing those who insist on a one-token approach. “Maximalism remains the enemy of crypto progress,” he said, stressing that the future of crypto relies on cooperation rather than competition. He also said that he owns a variety of cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. He reiterated that the crypto industry should work together to achieve shared goals, rather than tearing each other down. “This is not, and never will be, a zero-sum game,” he added. Trump Recognizes Innovation Previously, Garlinghouse shared his thoughts on the relationship between the crypto industry and Donald Trump. He stated that after a period of conflict, the crypto industry has finally found a strong ally in Trump, who has also embraced the sector. Garlinghouse said that Trump recognizes the potential of innovation and entrepreneurship within crypto, and he’s optimistic about what the future holds. Garlinghouse pointed out that XRP has surged massively since the election, noting that the best-performing crypto assets are coming from U.S. companies and technologies.

Bitwise has officially filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a Dogecoin ( DOGE ) exchange-traded fund (ETF). The company submitted an S-1 registration on Jan. 28, which formalizes its intention to offer a spot Dogecoin ETF. Earlier, on Jan. 22, Bitwise had filed a registration in Delaware, signaling its plans to introduce the product. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted on X that while the filing had been anticipated, this step makes the proposal official with the SEC. We knew this was coming because they filed to register the trust last week but this makes it official with the SEC. https://t.co/J7GuVqujJw — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 28, 2025 Bitwise is not the only asset manager who filed for a DOGE ETF. Earlier, on Jan. 21, Rex Shares and Osprey Funds, a firm that focuses on ETFs and ETNs, filed Form N1-A for DOGE and many other cryptos, including Official Trump ( TRUMP ), Solana ( SOL ), Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ripple ( XRP ). ETFs offer investors a range of benefits, including diversification, cost efficiency, liquidity, and transparency, making them a convenient way to manage investments. A Dogecoin ETF would provide investors with exposure to DOGE’s price movements in a regulated environment, without the need for crypto wallets or exchanges. You might also like: Nasdaq seeks to allow ‘in-kind’ redemptions for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF As per CoinDesk , Bitwise’s ETF was filed under the “33 Act” and Rex and Osprey under the “40 Act”, says Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.

Rex has on e filed under 40 Act but that isn’t the same true blue physically backed structure — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 28, 2025 The 40 Act’s primary distinguishing feature is that it imposes tighter SEC oversight and better governance and limits on riskier manoeuvres like leverage and short-selling, offering investors stronger protections. In contrast, the 33 Act is commonly utilized for speciality ETFs like commodity-based ETFs with less stringent regulatory requirements. However, while a DOGE ETF would ease access for investors to gain exposure to DOGE without having to deal with crypto exchanges, it also raises eyebrows because meme coins often face criticism for their volatility. On Jan. 16, Max Buwick of Burwick Law pointed out that meme coins are the “ultimate evolution of multi-level marketing scams”.

39638283,https://nulltx.com/?p=141514,1738126374,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,World Liberty Financial: A Key Player in Cryptocurrency Accumulation,https://nulltx.com/world-liberty-financial-a-key-player-in-cryptocurrency-accumulation/,"World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the financial venture associated with Donald Trump and his family, and focused on cryptocurrency , is quickly establishing itself as a force to be reckoned with in the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Through its public wallet, the venture is making bold—and even some might say reckless—strokes in not only building but also flaunting an impressive cryptocurrency portfolio, as if to suggest it’s just a hair’s breadth away from having a solid digital cash equivalent. Significant Cryptocurrency Holdings The wallet of WLF has become a point of interest for both crypto lovers and analysts. Why? Because its holdings have grown substantially and because the kind of growth it has seen—and that WLF has seen overall—reflects the way to leverage blockchain technology properly. As of now, WLF’s wallet holds $370.4 million in total assets spread across 44 different cryptocurrencies. Among its most important assets are: – Ethereum (ETH): 59,269 ETH, representing a jaw-dropping 3,921% increase since pre-inauguration. Ethereum, with its virtual machine that runs smart contracts, remains WLF’s top choice, indicating that WLF is quite confident in its continued relevance in the DeFi space and as a driver of blockchain innovation during the next wave. – Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC): 647 WBTC, reifying a 3,570% surge since pre-inauguration. This tokenized form of Bitcoin enables its use within Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, making WBTC emblematic of WLF’s overall focus on DeFi. – Staked Ethereum (stETH): 19,399 stETH, up 309% from pre-inauguration. This asset highlights WLF’s interest in Ethereum’s staking ecosystem, which has grown in popularity since the network’s transition to proof-of-stake. In addition to its core holdings, the wallet contains some other well-known cryptocurrencies, including USD Coin (USDC), Tether (USDT), Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), and Ethena (ETHA). Surprisingly, WLF has even begun investing in meme coins like Pepe and Mog, signaling a diversification strategy that’s hard to beat. A Commitment to DeFi Leadership The considerable increase in WLF’s asset portfolio demonstrates its desire to emerge as a major force in the DeFi sector. Indeed, the venture’s strategy seems closely aligned with Donald Trump’s prior statements about making America the global leader in crypto and blockchain. WLF is not only diversifying its investments but also, by accumulating a substantial portfolio of assets, strengthening its position as an advocate of decentralized financial systems. This assertive accumulation plan highlights confidence in the long-term promise of the crypto market. WLF has 44 different assets in its portfolio and seems to demonstrate a good understanding of the need for diversification in the dangerously volatile crypto space. Its portfolio contains near-equal parts stablecoins; utility, governance, and other non-security tokens; and “meme” coins. This indicates a far-reaching yet well-considered diversification strategy that seems to presume at least some ongoing existence for a wide range of types of crypto assets. A Reflection of Policy and Market Confidence Many consider WLF’s behavior through its wallet to be a signal of the venture’s confidence in the strength and growth of the cryptocurrency market. Analysts have noted that this accumulation might also be a sign of something else—that WLF is expecting new, blockchain-friendly policies to emerge in the United States. The previous administration under Donald Trump indicated an interest in placing the U.S. at the leading edge of blockchain and currency digital innovation, and the steps taken by the newly formed WLF appear to mesh with that aim. By establishing a strong portfolio of digital assets, WLF might be attempting to set the stage for institutional investors considering an entry into the space. WLF’s participation in staking assets like stETH shows that it’s cognizant of the shifting dynamics of the crypto ecosystem—especially that of the increasingly popular proof-of-stake systems. Those familiar with the crypto space understand that staking is an alternative to mining in terms of how new transaction blocks are generated and how the network is secured, which means that lots of tokens (like ETH) are being used in yield-bearing activities. World Liberty Financial (WLF), the cryptocurrency-focused financial venture linked to Donald Trump and his family, continues to accumulate cryptocurrencies aggressively via its public wallet. Among key assets, the venture's holdings now sit at: 59,269 ETH (+3,921% since… pic.twitter.com/qeDbqpePAh — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 27, 2025 The Road Ahead The crypto accumulation by World Liberty Financial, aggressive as it is, has not escaped notice. As the venture lab works to amass assets and expands its reach in DeFi, it has made itself into a major player in the cryptocurrency market. The venture’s growth, particularly in Ethereum and Wrapped Bitcoin, speaks to a thoughtful movement—using the opportunity presented by the blockchain revolution. The future path of the crypto market is not yet clear. However, the actions of WisdomTree’s WLF in this space show a strong conviction in its potential. As regulations and policies come into place and the sector really begins to grow up, WLF’s diversified portfolio and huge commitment to DeFi innovation could make it a trailblazer for other institutional investors looking to venture into this new asset class. World Liberty Financial is more than a financial venture. It has $370.4 million in assets and a laser-like focus on decentralized finance. It makes clear the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Whether the WLF strategies will yield long-term success remains to be seen. One thing is certain: It has already made a significant presence felt in the world of digital assets. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Stablecoins like USDC and USDT provide liquidity amid crypto market volatility. Emerging assets like Ethena reflect higher volatility compared to blue-chip tokens. World Liberty Financial just made a $4.7 million crypto move—but here’s why it really matters. Instead of a single, high-impact purchase, the Trump-affiliated investment group used the Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) strategy to buy in strategically, avoiding price jumps, or letting its intentions known too early. So what does that mean? TWAP isn’t just about timing—it’s used as a tool to accumulate crypto with precision while staying under the radar.

And on top of this Bitwise has officially filed an S-1 registration with the SEC for a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), marking a major step in integrating meme coins into mainstream finance. This move has sparked excitement in the crypto market , as it signals increasing confidence in Dogecoin’s potential as a financial asset. Bitwise Dogecoin ETF officially filed pic.twitter.com/OvJqDIyAOP — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 28, 2025 Dogecoin ETF Sparks Optimism Bitwise’s s1-filing follows an earlier registration in Delaware, reinforcing its commitment to launching a Dogecoin ETF. Other firms, including Osprey Funds and Rex Shares, have also submitted proposals, highlighting the growing demand for a regulated investment vehicle for Dogecoin. However, the price dropped 4% following the news, which shows investors are not sure of memecoins due to unclear regulations. Yet, Dogecoin’s resurgence is linked to Trump’s pro-crypto administration. The creation of the Department of Government Efficiency under President Trump has fueled speculation about increased crypto adoption. Last week, Trump signed an executive order forming a working group to develop a federal regulatory framework for digital assets. He also appointed crypto-friendly Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, further signaling potential regulatory shifts in favor of digital assets. Dogecoin’s Market Position Dogecoin is no more a joke, it currently trades at around $0.32, with a market cap of $47 billion. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan emphasized the strong demand for Dogecoin investments, noting that it is the sixth-largest cryptocurrency and sees daily trading volumes exceeding $1 billion. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Time to Buy DOGE? Whale Buys 175 Million Dogecoin , Despite a slight 0.8% decline in the past 24 hours, Dogecoin remains a popular choice among retail traders. Being a low-cap asset, the Dogecoin ETF could boost its credibility and drive institutional interest if approved. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicts that Dogecoin’s price could surge to $15 if the ETF gains approval. It will be a best buying opportunity as the prices are still below $1 and stacking this memecoin may give good returns as per the analyst. With the changing regulatory scene and political support for ETFs, the market may open to new heights in the coming months. Memecoins have gained attention since Trump and the First Lady launched their meme tokens, showcasing a strong interest in them. While the market is taking memes as a serious investment option many analysts warn of them going zero as they are of no real-world use and pose a threat of regulatory scrutiny. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

What should interest us about this market ebb is how it reflects on our current understanding of investor behavior and unrealized losses now more common in discussions of Bitcoin. This is not just a Bitcoin narrative, as much of this talk involves the state of the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole. Following the correction to $99k, the #Bitcoin Seller Exhaustion Composite flashed an exhaustion signal, highlighting severe unrealized loss and investor capitulation across the weekly-monthly timeframe. pic.twitter.com/J8E7PBeGhF — glassnode (@glassnode) January 28, 2025 Seller Exhaustion Signals and Unrealized Losses The Seller Exhaustion Composite for Bitcoin, a key indicator used to assess market stress, has been flashing a warning sign to investors. In both the weekly and monthly timeframes, it has signaled investor exhaustion. What this means is that a growing number of people are thought to be holding onto severe unrealized losses. The result has been a failing market that has seen both retail and institutional investors give up and throw in the towel—in other words, capitulate. This trend centers on a downturn in the ratio of wealth held by novice Bitcoin investors—those who have joined the market within the last day to three months. Right now, this ratio is at 50.2%, and it’s a lot lower than the previous high points in the market cycles, like in 2017. At the pinnacle of the bull market in 2018, 85% of Bitcoin riches were owned by newly arrived investors. At 50.2%, the proportion of wealth held by new #Bitcoin investors (24H to 3 months), is still well below the levels seen during previous ATH cycle tops: 2018 peak: 85% 2021 peak: 74% https://t.co/hkTSpFVAPG pic.twitter.com/6gcOgIIlvM — glassnode (@glassnode) January 28, 2025 This figure peaked at 74% in 2021. The diminished wealth concentration among new investors underscores a more somber market atmosphere that is apparently in contrast to recent cycles. One could even say that the new normal is sustained market consolidation punctuated by the occasional breakout. Price Action and Key Support Levels The price of Bitcoin has encountered rejection at vital resistance levels, amplifying the trials faced by bullish investors. The cryptocurrency was turned away at the upper red pricing band of $109,400, a key marker that, in the past, has delineated overheated market sentiment. #Bitcoin $BTC was rejected at the upper red pricing band at $109,400. Failing to reclaim this level shifts focus to the next critical support at the orange MVRV pricing band, currently sitting at $91,700. pic.twitter.com/h0EgU11fWO — Ali (@ali_charts) January 28, 2025 Since Bitcoin has not been able to return to this level, our eyes are set on the next major support zone. And now, on the next major support zone analysts have got their sights on, which is the orange MVRV. MVRV stands for Market Value to Realized Value, and this band is at $91,700. The MVRV serves as a crucial marker for assessing whether Bitcoin is really undervalued or overvalued relative to what we call its “realized price.” A breakdown below this level could trigger selling pressure, but a bounce could reignite bullish momentum. ETF Outflows Signal Shifting Investor Sentiment Pushing market sentiment further toward caution is the recent outflow of funds from Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As of January 27, Bitcoin ETFs had a total net outflow of $457 million. That figure is a marked turnaround from a week of net inflows that had some observers thinking we were returning to a more bullish situation. The principal ETFs responsible for these outflows are: FBTC: Noteworthy outflow, $268 million. – GBTC: Faced a total net outflow of $108 million. Bitcoin spot ETF had a total net outflow of $457 million on January 27, the first net outflow after the net inflow in the past 7 days. FBTC and GBTC had outflows of $268 million and $108 million respectively. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG pic.twitter.com/DRemg2Laju — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 28, 2025 This development indicates that institutional investors, who usually delegate assets to ETFs, are being careful in the face of the broadly declining market. ETF inflows are down in part because many investors are uncertain about Bitcoin’s short-term price prospects and are reducing their asset exposure. Historical Context and Market Outlook The present market situation of Bitcoin recalls earlier times of consolidation that came after significant rallies in the bull market. By historical precedent, conditions of this sort have been followed by accumulation periods—during which long-term holders invest more in Bitcoin because they are attracted by its lower price. Nevertheless, compared to prior cycles, new investors hold a lower percentage of wealth, which could raise questions about the sustainability of the retail-driven rally. And when you put it together with the apparent investor exhaustion and the ETF inflows that seem to be tapering off, what the market is moving into looks a lot like Caution with a capital C and an E for Earnings on the cover of Fortune. Conclusion The $99,000 correction and subsequent $109,400 rejection emphasize why Bitcoin has a tough hill to climb in terms of upward momentum. Several indicators—notably the Seller Exhaustion Composite and ETF outflows—paint a picture that is anything but rosy for our favorite digital currency. They suggest that the current landscape is teeming with cautious investors who are reluctant to venture forth until we reclaim a landscape devoid of unrealized losses and diminished retail participation. As Bitcoin nears its next critical support at the $91,700 MVRV band, the concentration of attention will be on whether this can serve as a bottom and prevent the asset from sliding any further. Present conditions mandate that investors exercise an abundance of caution—that much is a given. Still, this does provide a likely window for long-term investors to really take a good look at the strategies they have in place and to figure out just where they stand in terms of the present market being a likely short- to medium-term opportunity. The next few weeks will be crucial in deciding what direction Bitcoin takes, as investors consider big-picture elements like the state of the macroeconomy, regulatory changes, and signals sent by the blockchain itself. No matter how the price might oscillate in the immediate future, Bitcoin’s status as the dominant digital asset remains under challenge and thus offers insights to both old hands and neophytes in the market.

While Bitcoin (BTC) also dipped to a low of $97,777, the flagship cryptocurrency has since recovered most of its losses, trading above the key $100,000 price level. Bitcoin Holding Strong Despite NASDAQ Sell-Off Bitcoin’s resiliency amid the stock market sell-off is ‘extremely bullish’, says Bitwise’s European Head of Research, Andre Dragosch. They highlighted that the leading digital asset has outperformed NASDAQ over the past two days and is currently showing limited downside risk. It is worth noting that BTC has gained close to $5,000 since yesterday’s dip to $97,777, trading at $102,758 at the time of writing. In contrast, the S&P 500 closed yesterday’s last trading session down 1.5%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profit-Taking Drops 93% From December Peak – What’s Next For BTC? The decoupling between BTC and the stock market is further evidenced by differing investor sentiments. According to the ‘Fear & Greed Index’, the stock market currently sits at 44/100, indicating lingering fear among investors after yesterday’s market downturn. Conversely, the Index’s reading for the crypto market stands at 72/100, suggesting a sentiment of greed toward digital assets. However, this could also indicate that the crypto market is lagging behind the stock market and may experience a further drawdown while the stock market seeks stability. Meanwhile, Keith Alan, co-founder of Material Indicators, shared a post on X, viewing BTC’s brief slump as a dip-buying opportunity and adding to his BTC position. Alan noted: That wick to $97,750 should not shake your confidence in this Bitcoin bull run, but it should remind you that a deep correction can, and most likely will, develop when the market gets over hyped. Similarly, seasoned crypto trader and analyst Rekt Capital shared insights on Bitcoin’s current price momentum, stating that it is “still relatively early” in BTC’s parabolic phase for this market cycle. Historically, this phase has lasted about 300 days on average, and BTC is currently at day 82. BTC Top Not In Yet? Although BTC reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $108,786 on January 20, some analysts believe the top is not yet in for the cryptocurrency. According to analysis by Stockmoney Lizards, BTC could reach a cycle peak of $400,000 by November 2025.

Most recently, those confident institutions have shown themselves to be big players in the so-called “Ethereum Name Service” (ENS). Active Addresses Hit a Record High The past week saw the average number of active Ethereum addresses shoot up beyond 620,000—the loftiest level seen since March 2024. This gathering momentum around activity highlights the burgeoning use cases and acceptance of the Ethereum blockchain—by means of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and creative layer-2 answers (which Ethereum seriously needs). The average number of active Ethereum addresses surpassed 620k last week, the highest since March 2024! pic.twitter.com/BzMQHr6tmP — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 28, 2025 An increase in active addresses shows that Ethereum isn’t just back; it’s healthier and more robust than ever. This unstoppable network is registering renewed interest from participants, with the DeFi and NFT sectors driving much of that interest. And that interest seems to be translating to very real engagement with Ethereum’s ecosystem—an ecosystem that appears to be thriving even amid the broader crypto downturn. Whale Activity Signals Accumulation The excitement surrounding Ethereum is heightened by the recent influx of large-scale investors. In just the last 24 hours, we’ve seen the addition of 13 new mega whales to the Ethereum network—each holding more than 10,000 ETH. This is a clear sign of strong accumulation, and it very likely points to a significant degree of confidence—on the part of these investors—in Ethereum’s long-term value. A clear trend in this accumulation is being set by World Liberty Financial (WLF), a venture focused on cryptocurrency and closely associated with some of the most prominent names in finance and politics. Just five hours ago, WLF invested $10 million to buy 3,247 ETH at a low point in the market. In the last 24 hours, 13 mega whales, each holding over 10,000 #Ethereum $ETH , have joined the network. This signals significant accumulation activity! pic.twitter.com/ODIMeCO4Ry — Ali (@ali_charts) January 28, 2025 This recent buy is part of a larger buying spree by WLF. Over the past week, the fund has plunked down $129.95 million to acquire 39,242 ETH at an average price of $3,312. Yet, despite stout and consistent uptrending price action over the past eight months, with Ethereum’s current price dipping, this investment has faced a temporary unrealized loss of $5.12 million — a 3.94% hit, to be precise. WLF’s rapid gathering of Ethereum indicates the firm’s long-term faith in the asset’s potential, even when it seems to be lobbing along at the short-term price extremes of a roller coaster. World Liberty Financial ( @worldlibertyfi ) spent $10M to buy 3,247 $ETH at the dip ~5 hours ago! Over the past 7 days, the fund has spent $129.95M to buy 39,242 $ETH at an average price of $3,312, now down by $5.12M (-3.94%).

As of January 27, Ethereum spot ETFs had experienced a total net outflow of $136 million, showcasing a sentiment shift among the institutions that put their money where their mouth is. Grayscale’s Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETHE) alone took a single-day net outflow of $84.24 million, but this was not an isolated instance. ETHE’s performance has largely mirrored the overall trend that we have been seeing in the ETFs that track Ethereum. Despite being down, these ETH ETFs still boast fairly hefty total net asset values (NAVs). Grayscale’s latest published ETH NAV is at almost $6 billion, and the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (VETHE) is at about half that. Navigating Market Volatility Ethereum’s recent performance underscores the dualism between on-chain activity and market mood. Accumulation by whales and an uptick in active addresses point to fundamental bullishness, yet the outflows from Ethereum ETFs show that institutions are not yet ready to dive back into Ethereum. In a market defined by volatility and swift price movements, this sentiment is not unusual. The average price of the cryptocurrency over the past week is $3,312. This figure illustrates the difficulty still being encountered in the navigation of a market that is not only maturing but also one that is under the influence of macroeconomic factors. Ethereum spot ETF had a total net outflow of $136 million on January 27, Grayscale ETF ETHE had a single-day net outflow of $84.2445 million. The current total net asset value of Ethereum spot ETF is $11.30 billion. https://t.co/Tvs2oCSxTg pic.twitter.com/C1zYV2KNen — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 28, 2025 Looking Ahead The rise in active addresses and whale accumulation highlights Ethereum’s strength as a top blockchain network. While Ethereum is now changing through network upgrades and innovations, it remains a bedrock of the greater cryptocurrency ecosystem. The recent outflows from ETFs and the short-term price volatility have been affecting investor sentiment. For long-term investors, these periods of price consolidation often present opportunities to accumulate assets at discounted prices. The utility and adoption of Ethereum are expanding rapidly. Yet its future still depends on a complex interaction of on-chain metrics; institutional interest; and, of course, broader market trends and events. Ethereum is not immune to the kind of short-term challenges that can afflict any crypto asset, typically arising from the fallout of key positive or negative developments. That said, the fundamentals of the network—decentralized, unfettered, and interoperable—put it in a position to deliver long-term growth and innovation. In the next few weeks, the market will be keeping a close watch for any signs that the situation might be stabilizing or that we might have renewed upward momentum. With our active address count really moving and some very significant whale action, Ethereum is still the centerpiece of the cryptocurrency landscape, trading its way through market waters that are as dynamic as they are uncertain.

This sudden rise has investors and analysts closely examining its potential. The surge, fueled by prominent players’ activity, has attracted financial professionals and casual traders. Baden Bower, a cryptocurrency agency , is helping craft the narrative, building confidence in a volatile yet exciting area. Dogecoin’s Unique Journey Launched in 2013 as a lighthearted take on Bitcoin, Dogecoin’s growth has surprised many. Its value has jumped by 6,000 percent since January, outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum in percentage growth. This has made it a standout among digital currencies. Several factors have contributed to its rise. More businesses now accept it as payment, and endorsements from well-known figures have brought it into the spotlight. Once considered a joke, Dogecoin now attracts a wide range of investors. Dogecoin’s story is different from that of Bitcoin and Ethereum. While those currencies are often viewed as more traditional, Dogecoin’s community-driven energy and rapid price changes offer a fresh perspective on digital investing, making it an ideal candidate to promote crypto to new audiences. Big Investors Drive Momentum The activity of large investors, often called “whales,” has fueled Dogecoin’s recent rise. For example, one day saw $258 million worth of Dogecoin exchanged, showing serious interest from major players. These transactions affect prices and encourage smaller investors to invest. Institutional interest is helping Dogecoin gain credibility as a long-term financial option. Similar dynamics apply when promoting an NFT project , where both large-scale backers and grassroots engagement contribute to traction and visibility. How PR Makes a Difference The rise of cryptocurrencies has made effective communication more important than ever. Baden Bower, a global firm with experience in finance and technology, helps clients share their stories in ways that align with different audiences. The firm’s PR team breaks technical concepts into simple, relatable messages, ensuring clarity for seasoned investors and newcomers. “It is important to break down technical concepts into simple, relatable messages,” says AJ Ignacio, CEO of Baden Bower. The firm balances Dogecoin’s playful beginnings with its growing role as a serious investment option. For individual investors, Baden Bower focuses on community engagement and growth potential. For institutions, the focus is on regulations and strategic benefits. These tailored messages help connect with all types of audiences. With thousands of published stories and strong ties to platforms like Forbes and Business Insider, Baden Bower helps clients gain visibility. This reach allows businesses to stand out and gain trust. What’s Ahead for Dogecoin? Dogecoin’s rise and the involvement of major investors show how quickly the cryptocurrency scene can change. As digital currencies blend more with traditional finance, clear and relatable communication will remain essential. Baden Bower supports clients by breaking down complicated ideas and helping them build trust with their audiences. Its efforts to help clients get featured in top-tier media outlets enhance credibility and create opportunities in the growing digital currency space.

She has a net worth ranging from $20 million and $75 million. On her son-in-law's advice, she purchased Bitcoin and became the first U.S senator to possess cryptocurrency. She possesses no less than $230,000 worth of Bitcoin. She adopted office on January 3, 2021, the term terminates on January 3, 2027. She has always been focused on advocating for Wyoming's future. She struggled her entire career fighting for Wyoming families, communities, businesses, and values. Beginning at the halls of the Wyoming House to the Halls of the U.S. House. Lummis was born on September 10, 1954, and graduated from the University of Wyoming, earning a bachelor's degree in animal science, and biology. She also achieved a Juris Doctor from the University of Wyoming College of Law. Her career experience comprises working as general counsel to previous Wyoming Governor Jim Geringer, Wyoming House of Representatives, as a treasure of Wyoming, and in the United States House of Representatives from Wyoming's at-large congressional district. In 1990, she also worked as the chair of Mary Mead's gubernatorial campaign and Ray Hunkins's gubernatorial campaign, in 2006, also served on Bob Dole's presidential steering committee in Wyoming. Through her firmly beneficial crypto position, she developed the reception and fair guidelines of computerized resources in the United States. She voluntarily organized a great foundation for herself as a significant Bitcoin financial backer. She is professed to continue encouraging the developing cryptocurrencies industry in the United States and all over the world in 2022. Her urge for transparency on cryptographic forms of money and stable coins in U.S. regulation will maintain on becoming tremendous. She had been always looking for a store of value, and she believes bitcoin specifically is a great store of value and knew that scarcity will protect its value going into the future, unlike the U.S. dollar that they are printing more of every single day. Investor has stepped in to support the crypto exchange. She has filed an amicus brief , accusing the SEC of abusing its power and bypassing Congress to impose unclear rules on digital assets. Lummis Challenges SEC’s Regulatory Tactics On January 24, Senator Cynthia Lummis submitted an amicus brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, siding with Coinbase in its legal dispute with the SEC . In her filing, Lummis criticized the regulatory approach taken by the agency under former Chair gary gensler gary gensler Gary Gensler is a pioneer and the current chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He has extensive experience that spans Wall Street, government regulation, and an angel teaching about cryptocurrencies and blockchain at MIT. Gary S. Gensler was on born October 18, 1957, in Baltimore, Maryland.He graduated from Pikesville High School in 1975, where he was later given a Distinguished Alumnus award. He also earned a degree in economics.Gensler served in the United States Department of the Treasury as Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets from 1997 to 1999, then as Undersecretary for Domestic Finance from 1999 to 2001He has expressed his desire to present crypto-related approach changes later on that include token commitments, decentralized finance, stablecoins, guardianship, exchange-traded resources, and advancing stages. Chairman stating that it lacks transparency and undermines the separation of powers. https://t.co/Jn8FiEMLM4 — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) January 28, 2025 Lummis argues that the SEC has been unfairly reinterpreting existing securities laws without clear guidelines and imposing those rules on crypto firms without prior notice. Meanwhile, Lummis’s filing strengthens Coinbase’s case, noting that the SEC has misapplied the Howey Test, which determines whether an asset is a security. She believes Congress, not the SEC, should decide how digital assets are classified and regulated. SEC’s Leadership Change Could Alter Its Stance? The timing of Lummis’ intervention is significant, as the SEC is experiencing a leadership shift. With Mark Uyeda now serving as Acting Chair, there is speculation that the agency might take a more balanced approach. Uyeda has already introduced a dedicated crypto task force to develop a clearer regulatory framework, signaling a potential change in direction. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Just In: French Investigation Opens Probe into Binance for Money Laundering, Tax Fraud and More , Coinbase’s Fight Continues Amid Global Expansion The SEC first sued Coinbase in 2023 , accusing the company of operating as an unregistered broker, exchange, and clearinghouse.

39639073,https://coinpedia.org/?p=411677,1738128053,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,XRP Price Prediction For January 29,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-january-29/,"The post XRP Price Prediction For January 29 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP has shown strong performance recently, but it remains below the all-time highs on the long-term chart. Although the price has formed marginally higher highs in some cases, it hasn’t sustained a definitive break into all-time high territory. As a result, it i s still in a phase of consolidation. Key Price Levels to Watch Currently, XRP is consolidating just below the $3.40 level, which has been a significant resistance point. While there hasn’t been a confirmed breakout into new highs, experts are closely watching for a move towards the $4.20 and $5 targets in the near future. These are key milestones for XRP to hit, with further upside potential possibly reaching $6.62 if the bullish momentum continues. For now, price action is creating an unclear microstructure, but it’s important to understand that the overall trend is still upward. Even with some short-term volatility, the bigger picture remains positive for XRP. Short-Term Patterns: Volatility and Key Support Levels On the smaller time frame, XRP had been in a triangle pattern that was completed around January 13, 2025. After the breakout, the price hit resistance below the all-time high area, which isn’t surprising given its importance in the market. Similar to Bitcoin’s struggle with the $100,000 mark, XRP might take multiple attempts before breaking out convincingly above its current resistance. The key support area to watch is at $2.52. If XRP holds above this level, it could mean a successful bounce from the correction. However, should the price drop below this support level, XRP may see a potential move towards $2.32, and possibly even as low as $1.96. While further downside is always a possibility, the $2.52 support level will act as a critical point for validation. If the price manages to stay above this level, the price might see an immediate breakout to the upside. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Gary Gensler will be a member of both the Global Economics and Management Group and the Finance Group, where he will work on artificial intelligence, finance, financial technology, and public policy, says the MIT press release , dated on Jan. 27. In addition to being a professor, he will also be the co-director of the FinTechAI at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT’s largest research lab. Before taking on the role of SEC Chair during the Biden administration and overseeing the $120 trillion U.S. capital markets, Gensler served as a Professor of the Practice at MIT Sloan from 2018 to 2021. He also served as Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under President Obama, overseeing the implementation of the post-2008 reforms of the $400 trillion swaps market. You might also like: Trump’s ‘golden age’ can be for crypto, too | Opinion Gensler’s anti-crypto stance Within the crypto industry, however, Gensler has been famous for his harsh “Everything is a Security” stance. Gensler has had a contentious relationship with Congress and other U.S. regulators and criticized bills that would codify a clearer crypto regulatory framework. He’s repeatedly said that most cryptos other than Bitcoin ( BTC ) should qualify as securities, thereby falling under SEC jurisdiction. In Jan. 2022, Gensler said , “The fact is, most crypto tokens involve a group of entrepreneurs raising money from the public in anticipation of profits—the hallmark of an investment contract or a security under our jurisdiction.” at Penn Law Capital Markets Association Annual Conference. The result of such strict regulations has left projects working in the U.S. in legal limbo, which President Donald Trump is now rolling back.

Circuit in August 2023 ruled against the SEC, saying the agency’s refusal to allow Grayscale to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF was “arbitrary and capricious.” It was not until January 2024 — under this legal and political pressure — that the SEC approved them.

Crypto.com has announced it will remove USDT from its platform by January 31, 2025. This follows coinbase coinbase - support@coinbase.com Wallet Centralised Exchange decision to drop Tether last year. The future of its $138 billion USDT in the EU is uncertain, and the possibility of other regions delisting is spreading like fire, all because of the strict new rules under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations . Crypto analyst Jacob King broke the news, highlighting how this could impact stablecoins and crypto trading. BREAKING: Crypto com, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has just announced it will delist Tether (USDT) on January 31, 2025. — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) January 28, 2025 Nothing is going in the right direction for Tether and these regulatory problems can severely impact the stablecoins movement globally. Why is Tether Being Delisted? MiCA’s new rules make it tough for stablecoins to stay in the European market. One key requirement is that stablecoins must keep over 60% of their reserves in recognized banks and get an e-money license. Moreover, Tether hasn’t met these rules , leading major exchanges to remove it. USDT is the most-used stablecoin in the world, but its lack of transparency has always raised concerns. Unlike other stablecoins, Tether doesn’t provide frequent or detailed audits of its reserves. This has led to doubts about whether it holds enough assets to back all the USDT in circulation. What Happens Next? Tether’s removal could shake up the crypto market. USDT is a major player in trading, helping traders move funds quickly between crypto and fiat. Without it, liquidity—how easily assets can be bought or sold—could take a hit. To be on the safer side, some traders are already switching to fiat trading pairs, but this could create new problems. With fewer stablecoin options, trading might become less efficient, and prices could fluctuate more. USDC vs. Tether – Who Wins? USD Coin (USDC) could benefit from Tether’s struggles. USDC is seen as more trustworthy because it provides monthly audits and keeps its reserves in regulated banks. It also follows strict U.S. financial laws, making it a safer bet for exchanges looking to stay compliant with MiCA. If more exchanges follow Crypto.com and Coinbase, USDT could lose its dominance, and USDC might take its place as the go-to stablecoin in Europe. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinbase vs. SEC: Senator Cynthia Lummis Fights Back Against Regulatory Overreach , The Future of Stablecoins in Europe Stablecoin issuers will have to follow MiCA’s rules or risk being pushed out of the market. More exchanges may delist non-compliant stablecoins, leading to a shift toward regulated alternatives. For now, Tether remains the world’s top stablecoin, but its future in Europe looks uncertain. The next few months will be crucial in shaping the stablecoin market under these new regulations. Global Scenario In other news, Senator Elizabeth Warren is challenging Howard Lutnick, Trump’s Commerce Secretary nominee, over his firm’s ties to Tether. She’s demanding details on Cantor Fitzgerald’s investments and whether it ensured Tether complied with anti-money laundering laws. Warren argues that Tether’s links to illicit transactions pose a national security risk. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Storm has been charged with conspiracy to facilitate money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitter, and violating sanctions in relation to his work on the Tornado Cash protocol. “The government’s prosecution raises larger civil liberties concerns that could chill the future development of privacy-enhancing technologies more broadly,"" the EFF wrote in the brief. The EFF argues that Storm's prosecution threatens open-source innovation as the core issue in the case of holding developers responsible for how their tools are used, instead of prosecuting bad actors directly, could have a chilling effect on privacy-focused software development. ""Nearly all privacy and anonymity protective software tools are dual-use tools. Like a physical mask or paper cash, they provide needed, often critical protections for users, but can also be used by bad actors to help hide their crimes,"" the EFF wrote. In the prosecution of Storm, the government is relying on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which allows it to impose economic sanctions and restrict transactions during national emergencies. This application, the EFF argues, is inappropriate. “If the government believes it is appropriate to criminalize these technologies, it must seek relief from Congress and not rely on IEEPA and the other laws deployed in this prosecution, or, worse, attempt to bootstrap ancillary activities even further removed from any criminal acts into the ambit of these laws,” the EFF wrote. If Congress wants to regulate tools like Tornado Cash, the EFF argues, it has the authority to pass a law that clearly distinguishes legal from illegal use, but the prosecution in this case fails to provide that clarity.

Understanding its price movements is essential for many in the crypto world. TRON price data is valuable for traders, developers, analysts, and businesses. Accurate price data helps traders make better buying or selling decisions. Developers can use this data to build tools like trading bots, portfolio trackers, or crypto payment platforms. Analysts rely on price data to study market trends and gain insights into TRON’s performance. Businesses that deal with cryptocurrencies can benefit from using TRON price data to price goods, services, or transactions. In this blog, we’ll explore the top 10 solutions for accessing TRON price data, making it easier for everyone to stay informed and make smarter decisions. TRON Price APIs Overview TRON price APIs allow users to access accurate and up-to-date information about the value of TRON (TRX). These APIs act as bridges, connecting users with real-time price data, historical trends, and market statistics.

It now joins a growing list of corporate Bitcoin adopters. Meanwhile, Japan’s Metaplanet is raising $745 million to expand its Bitcoin holdings, and plans to accumulate 10,000 BTC by late 2025 and 21,000 BTC by 2026. In the US, Arizona lawmakers advanced the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which will allow government entities to allocate up to 10% of their capital towards Bitcoin. Nuvve to Invest in Bitcoin Nuvve, the Nasdaq-listed clean energy electric vehicle charging technology firm, announced plans to allocate a portion of its treasury into Bitcoin (BTC). It will set aside up to 30% of its excess cash reserves to buy Bitcoin. The company stated in a press release on Jan. 28 that its move to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet is part of a strategy to diversify its holdings and offer Bitcoin as a payment option for customers and suppliers. Gregory Poilasne, founder and CEO of Nuvve, pointed out that accepting Bitcoin will expand payment choices while also reducing transaction friction that is associated with traditional digital payment methods. By integrating Bitcoin into its treasury strategy, Nuvve joins a growing list of publicly traded companies that turned to the cryptocurrency to boost financial stability and share value, especially as Bitcoin has surged 150% over the past year. After the announcement, shares of Nuvve (NVVE) saw a brief increase, and closed at $2.81 with a 1.81% gain on Jan. 28. It is still down from a daily high of over $4. After hours, the stock continued its modest upward movement by climbing another 1.42% to $2.85. However, the company’s stock is still in a long-term decline, down 10% in value so far this month. Nuvve share price (Source: Google Finance ) Financially, Nuvve reported $1.92 million in revenue for the third quarter of 2024, which was a 29.3% decline from the previous quarter. Its latest financial filings show it holds $325,425 in cash, which, if 30% were allocated to Bitcoin at its current price of $101,836, would amount to just under one BTC. Bitcoin Treasuries data reveals that 62 publicly traded companies collectively hold 618,615 BTC, which is valued at over $62.6 billion. MicroStrategy is still the largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 471,107 BTC, while Tesla, the leading electric vehicle manufacturer, owns 9,720 BTC. Metaplanet Plans Another Massive Bitcoin Buy Metaplanet, a publicly traded company in Japan, also recently announced an ambitious plan to raise more than 116 billion yen (approximately $745 million) to expand its Bitcoin holdings. On Jan. 29, the company issued 21 million shares of 0% discount moving strike warrants to generate the necessary funds to buy additional Bitcoin. Metaplanet described this as the largest capital raise in Asian equity markets dedicated to Bitcoin acquisition. The company’s decision to increase its Bitcoin reserves is part of its strategy to hedge against the declining value of the yen and position itself as a leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption. This fundraising initiative is also the first phase of Metaplanet’s larger Bitcoin strategy, with a goal of buying 10,000 BTC by the fourth quarter of 2025. This investment is expected to exceed $1 billion at current market prices. By the end of 2026, the company plans to increase its holdings even more to 21,000 BTC, worth approximately $2.1 billion. (Source: Metaplanet ) Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet’s representative director and president, stated that the company is now recognized as “Tokyo’s preeminent Bitcoin company” and is taking advantage of its momentum to solidify its position in the market. Metaplanet first purchased Bitcoin on April 8 of 2024, and integrated it as a core treasury asset. Since adopting a Bitcoin standard, the company experienced exponential growth, and reported a 309% BTC yield in the fourth quarter of 2024, after a 41% yield in the third quarter. The firm also reported large unrealized gains from its Bitcoin holdings. Beyond its Bitcoin investments, Metaplanet has seen rapid expansion in other areas as well, including a surge in the number of shareholders, which is now over 50,000. Its share trading volume increased 430 times year-over-year. Arizona Lawmakers Advance Bill to Create a Bitcoin Reserve Arizona lawmakers took a big step toward integrating Bitcoin into the state’s financial strategy by advancing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB1025). The bill is co-sponsored by Senator Wendy Rogers and Representative Jeff Weninger, and passed the Arizona State Senate Finance Committee with a five-to-two vote on Jan. 27. It will now move to the Senate Rules Committee for further debate and amendments. If approved by the Senate, it will proceed to the House of Representatives. The bill proposes the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve that will be managed by the US Treasury, which would store government Bitcoin holdings and allow other public funds to deposit their digital assets in a secure, segregated account. It will also permit government entities and public funds to allocate up to 10% of their capital into Bitcoin and other digital assets. This shift could attract increased public interest, particularly among younger generations. In fact, recent reports show that up to 20% of Gen Z and Alpha are open to receiving pensions in cryptocurrency, while 78% have a lot more trust in alternative retirement savings over traditional pension funds. (Source: Bitget ) The move could set a precedent for other states also considering similar legislation. Blockchain expert Anndy Lian stated that Arizona’s initiative might encourage states like Texas and Pennsylvania, which have already explored Bitcoin adoption, to accelerate their own efforts. However, he also warned that incorporating Bitcoin into state reserves requires a lot of safeguards because of the cryptocurrency’s volatility. Overall, he pointed out the potential risks for taxpayers similar to those faced by crypto investors. The bill’s advancement happened at a time of growing discussions about a national Bitcoin reserve. Wyoming Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has been a very vocal advocate for the idea, and if the proposal gains federal approval, it could have huge effects on Bitcoin’s price. Adam Back , co-founder and CEO of Blockstream, suggested that a move like this could push Bitcoin’s value past the seven-figure mark in the current market cycle. He believes this will be due to the fact that investors have yet to fully price in the impact of a nationwide Bitcoin reserve. There are currently at least 13 Bitcoin reserve-related bills in progress across various states, including Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Kansas, New Hampshire, Wyoming, Ohio, Utah, and North Dakota. Support for these initiatives has grown a lot fueled by former President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policies and recent executive orders on digital assets. If the bill succeeds, it could lead to an influx of new institutional Bitcoin adopters that could give BTC’s price a very nice boost.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-29 05:41:43

The network’s decentralized exchange (DEX) recorded $400 million in swap volume in January, highlighting increased adoption, while Ripple’s push for an XRP-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) gains traction amid a more crypto-friendly US administration. Meanwhile, Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC could take a new turn, with Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty suggesting that a leadership change at the agency might lead to the withdrawal of enforcement actions against crypto firms. Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty Hints at Potential Dismissal of SEC Lawsuits Under New Leadership Stuart Alderoty, chief legal officer at Ripple Labs, has expressed optimism about the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States under the potential leadership of Paul Atkins as the next chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Speaking during an X Spaces discussion for XRP Community Day 2025, Alderoty revealed that the SEC under Atkins, once confirmed by the Senate, might withdraw civil suits against crypto firms that do not involve allegations of fraud. This development could mark a significant turning point for Ripple Labs, which has been embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC since 2020. Ripple’s clash with the SEC began in December 2020 when the regulatory body filed a lawsuit accusing the blockchain payments firm of using XRP as an unregistered security to raise funds. The case has dragged on for over four years, with both parties exchanging legal blows. In August 2024, a federal judge ruled Ripple liable for more than $125 million, leading to appeals from both the SEC and Ripple. The central argument in the case has revolved around whether XRP should be classified as a security, with broader implications for the classification of digital assets in the US. Alderoty criticized the SEC’s strategy of ”regulation by enforcement,” calling it an ineffective path for governing the crypto space. He suggested that Atkins, if confirmed as SEC chair, would prioritize a more collaborative approach, which might include withdrawing lawsuits focused primarily on registration issues. “Litigation, regulation by enforcement, is not the path that this country should be pursuing,” Alderoty stated. “I believe the new SEC understands that, and I remain cautiously optimistic that at some point during 2025, the case will be voluntarily withdrawn.” Alderoty’s optimism extends beyond Ripple’s specific case to the broader crypto industry. He pointed to the Trump administration’s actions in support of digital assets, including an executive order to establish a working group on digital asset regulation and the launch of an SEC crypto task force. Ripple’s leadership has been vocal about its positive outlook on the current administration’s approach to the crypto sector. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse echoed these sentiments, citing the administration’s pro-crypto stance as a factor in Ripple’s decision to expand its US-based operations. Following Trump’s reelection in 2024, Ripple announced that 75% of its new job openings would be located in the United States. Alderoty also highlighted the potential for meaningful legislation with the support of a Republican-controlled Congress. Ripple’s contributions to the political action committee Fairshake, totaling $45 million, may have helped elect lawmakers sympathetic to the crypto industry. According to Alderoty, a crypto market structure bill could be passed before the end of 2025, creating a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets. “I think we’ve got a pro-crypto Congress driven by a pro-crypto president,” Alderoty said. “I think we can see [legislation] happening certainly before the end of 2025.” Ripple’s ties to the Trump administration extend beyond policy alignment. Both Alderoty and Garlinghouse have maintained a close relationship with the president. The pair dined with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in January 2025 and attended his inauguration events in Washington, D.C., as official guests. Ripple has also been a significant financial supporter of Trump’s political efforts, contributing $5 million worth of XRP to the presidential inaugural fund and Alderoty personally donating more than $300,000 to committees backing Trump’s campaign. These connections could provide Ripple with additional influence in shaping the regulatory landscape under the new SEC leadership. However, uncertainty remains regarding whether Paul Atkins will secure Senate confirmation as the next SEC chair. While Trump’s nomination of Atkins aligns with his administration’s crypto-friendly stance, the process faces potential political challenges. What’s Next for Ripple and the Crypto Industry? Ripple’s CLO hinted that the road to resolving its legal battle with the SEC may not be immediate, even with potential changes in leadership. “The SEC is still a bureaucracy,” Alderoty noted, emphasizing the time required to implement policy shifts. For Ripple and the broader crypto industry, the possibility of the SEC dropping enforcement cases marks a glimmer of hope. Should Atkins prioritize a less adversarial approach to regulation, it could open the door for greater innovation and growth in the US crypto sector. At the same time, the outcome of Ripple’s appeals and the future of its lawsuit with the SEC will remain critical for defining how digital assets are treated under US securities laws. Ripple’s leadership appears confident that the ongoing legal challenges will ultimately strengthen the company’s position. As the SEC transitions under new leadership, the case against Ripple could become a defining moment for crypto regulation in the United States. XRP Ledger's Decentralized Exchange Records $400M in January, Ripple CEO Celebrates Milestones In related news, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has highlighted significant progress for the XRP Ledger ecosystem, reporting that its native decentralized exchange (DEX) clocked $400 million in swap volume in January 2025. This milestone, averaging approximately $17 million in daily volume, suggests growing momentum for the blockchain network and its expanding suite of financial products. Speaking during XRP Community Day on Jan. 28, Garlinghouse noted that the DEX has facilitated over $1 billion in cryptocurrency swaps since its launch in 2024. Its rapid growth is among several reasons “why 2024 will certainly stand out as one of the most monumental years for Ripple,” he stated. The rise of XRP Ledger’s DEX is just one of the achievements Ripple celebrated entering 2025. Garlinghouse emphasized that the company is seeing early but promising traction for its US dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD , launched in 2024. The stablecoin aims to provide a bridge for fiat-to-digital transactions and increase XRP Ledger’s appeal as a financial ecosystem. Additionally, Ripple has been making waves in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) space. Several filings for XRP-based ETFs, including proposals from asset management giants Bitwise and WisdomTree, signal institutional interest in the XRP ecosystem. According to Garlinghouse, investment bank JPMorgan estimates these XRP ETFs could bring upward of $8 billion in inflows, further boosting the ecosystem’s liquidity and market presence. Garlinghouse attributed much of Ripple’s recent success to a favorable political climate under US President Trump’s administration. Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election has reinvigorated optimism in the cryptocurrency industry, particularly for XRP, which has seen its price skyrocket by over 500% since the election on Nov. 5. “Trump winning the election… whatever you think about his personal politics, for crypto, it is certainly profound,” Garlinghouse said during the discussion. He added that the previous administration’s “unlawful war on crypto” now feels like a thing of the past, with regulatory clarity and industry-friendly policies providing a tailwind for XRP’s growth. Trump’s administration has promised to make the US the “world’s crypto capital” and has already begun appointing crypto-friendly leaders to head key financial regulatory agencies, including the SEC. In 2024, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, setting a precedent that many investors believe will pave the way for XRP-based ETFs in 2025. Prediction market Polymarket currently places the odds of a US XRP ETF approval at around 73%. Ripple’s Expanding Ecosystem: From DEX to Stablecoin and ETFs Ripple Labs, the developer behind XRP Ledger, has worked to position its blockchain network as a scalable, enterprise-friendly alternative to Ethereum. While XRP Ledger historically lacked third-party smart contract capabilities, it has innovated in other areas. The introduction of its decentralized exchange and automated market maker (AMM) tools demonstrate its focus on financial applications and liquidity solutions. The recent success of XRP Ledger’s DEX, combined with the launch of RLUSD, reflects Ripple’s ambition to create a robust ecosystem catering to both retail and institutional users. The proposed XRP ETFs, if approved, could mark a turning point in bringing more traditional investors into the fold. As Ripple moves into 2025, the company’s leadership appears confident about the future. With Trump in office, Garlinghouse predicts continued regulatory improvements and opportunities for growth in the cryptocurrency industry. He highlighted the administration’s focus on building a strong foundation for digital asset markets, noting that the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs is just the beginning. Despite its successes, Ripple faces challenges, including the uncertain timeline for regulatory approvals. While optimism remains high, the SEC has yet to greenlight XRP-based ETFs, leaving investors to anticipate potential announcements later in 2025.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|WALLET|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-29 06:00:00

It will be followed by Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference at 19:30 UTC. The Fed's ongoing target range for interest rates is 4.25% to 4.5%, which has declined by 100 basis points since September. The December meeting saw a 25 basis point rate cut, but the accompanying press conference and forecasts signaled slower rate cuts for 2025, sending risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC), lower. However, Wednesday's meeting is largely being seen as a non-event for markets, including cryptocurrencies, as policymakers are expected to hold rates steady while maintaining the hawkish forward guidance from December. ""We doubt this week's FOMC meeting will be a major market mover as the unchanged rate decision has been well communicated in advance back in December. The minutes revealed participants have already made some preliminary assumptions on Trump's policies, but given the considerable uncertainty, we doubt Powell will feel comfortable providing markets with any strong guidance,"" Danske Bank said in a note to clients Tuesday. That said, Powell will likely face questions on the following key issues, and his responses could move markets. Deportation of illegal immigrants President Donald Trump is already making good on his campaign promises to eject illegal immigrants from the U.S., with deportation flights rolling out over the weekend. Per estimates, total deportations could range from one million to 10 million . Analysts anticipate that substantial deportations will bolster labor market strength and contribute to inflation. If Powell shares a similar perspective, it could dampen expectations for rate cuts, potentially leading to a decline in risk assets. ""The disappearance of up to 1 million potential workers from the U.S. labor force would be no small thing. Given the strength of Friday's (December) payrolls report, a tightening in the U.S. labor supply would add further pressure to a jobs market that is already showing signs of tightening and has an unemployment rate close to the full-employment level,"" Rabobank's Senior Macro Strategist Benjamin Picton said in a note to clients early this month. ""That is inflationary in and of itself, and that is before we consider the additional impacts of tax cuts and tariffs,"" Picton added. U.S. debt ceiling The U.S. hit its self-imposed debt ceiling of $36 trillion last week, leading to the Treasury starting extraordinary measures to keep the government functioning. One of the measures involves running down the government's checking account at the Fed called the Treasury General Account (TGA). The TGA spending usually eases liquidity conditions in the economy and markets, spurring risk-taking. That might counter the effects of the Fed's ongoing quantitive tightening (balance sheet normalization process). Powell might get questions on the same and may look to avoid sounding dovish while the TGA spend adds liquidity to the system, thus capping the upside in risk assets for now. Rent inflation Leading indicators point to a moderation in shelter inflation, which has an outsized influence on the consumer price index. ""The Labor Department's ""all tenant rent"" index, which leads shelter inflation in the CPI, rose at a much slower pace last quarter. It was up 3.2% over the four quarters ended Q4 (vs. 3.9% in Q3 and 5.5% one year ago). It's very close to the 3.1% average between 2017-19,"" Wall Street Journal's Chief Economic Correspondent Nick Timaros said on X last week. Risk assets could surge if Powell acknowledges the disinflationary trend in the leading indicators of shelter inflation.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Federal Reserve,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-29 07:04:53

Trump’s meme coins spark debate, while Lightchain AI’s $12.3m presale cements its position as a utility-driven contender. Table of Contents Trump meme coins and their potential impact Lightchain AI’s utility-driven appeal Shift toward utility The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with Donald Trump and Melania Trump’s meme coins. These meme coins have sparked conversations about their potential influence on the broader crypto ecosystem. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI, a utility-driven blockchain project, continues to attract significant investor interest. Currently in its presale phase at $0.005625 per token and having raised $12.3 million, Lightchain AI is proving to be a strong contender in the market. Let’s examine how these developments align and impact the crypto landscape. Trump meme coins and their potential impact Earlier this month, the new US President, Donald Trump, showed off the TRUMP meme coin , which saw a fast rise in worth, hitting a market cap of close to $6 billion right after it launched. This move was then met with First Lady Melania Trump’s launch of her own digital coin, MELANIA, which also saw big market moves. These changes have brought up talks about the right and wrong sides and possible mixed loyalties, as Trump-linked groups own much of both coins. It’s also important to note that both TRUMP and MELANIA have bottomed since their launch, causing the crypto community to be disheartened. Critics show worry about market tricks and the ups and downs that come with meme coins, which might cause big money losses for clueless investors. Also, the high amount of coin ownership brings up questions about the control of political leaders in the crypto world and how outside groups can get these assets, thus affecting national safety and money steadiness.

39642291,https://coinpedia.org/?p=411778,1738134458,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,XRP News Today: Trump Administration’s Crypto-Friendly Policies Boost XRP Market Sentiment,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/trump-administrations-crypto-friendly-policies-boost-xrp-market-sentiment/,"The post XRP News Today: Trump Administration’s Crypto-Friendly Policies Boost XRP Market Sentiment appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Recent developments in U.S. cryptocurrency policy have notably influenced Ripple’s XRP, which remains a major player in the crypto market despite over $100 million in legal expenses from its SEC battle. Meanwhile, PlutoChain , a rising blockchain platform bringing AI and smart contracts to Bitcoin, is drawing attention from whales with its innovative approach. Here’s a closer look at what’s propelling these two projects forward. Ripple Rides Regulatory Wave – What Trump’s Administration Means for XRP Donald Trump’s administration has introduced crypto-friendly policies, boosting optimism for Ripple (XRP). With pro-crypto Paul Atkins as SEC Chair and a mandate to overhaul digital asset frameworks, regulatory clarity could drive growth for XRP and other cryptocurrencies. Ripple’s utility in cross-border payments positions it for significant gains as institutional interest and liquidity grow under favorable policies. However, critics have raised concerns over Trump’s involvement in ventures like the $TRUMP token, citing ethical risks. While the administration’s stance signals a promising future for digital currencies, observers caution against blurring the lines between politics and markets. PlutoChain Aims to Transform Bitcoin with a Hybrid Layer-2 Solution Transforming Bitcoin has long been a focus for blockchain innovators, and PlutoChain ($PLUTO) shows the potential to contribute to this vision. By enabling Ethereum-style functionality on Bitcoin’s secure network, PlutoChain wants to introduce a new dimension to the blockchain’s utility. Its hybrid Layer-2 technology could address Bitcoin’s inherent limitations, offering an average block time of just 2 seconds (compared to Bitcoin’s 10-minute one) while slashing costs and improving scalability – issues that have long hindered the king of digital assets. PlutoChain’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility could bridge the worlds of Bitcoin and Ethereum, possibly merging Ethereum’s developer-friendly infrastructure with Bitcoin’s unparalleled security. This fusion might create fertile ground for decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFT markets directly on Bitcoin – paving the way for the underdeveloped Bitcoin DeFi market to gain traction. The governance system could be another interesting feature, as it gives users direct control over network direction. Paired with its audited security from SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi, this project has all the elements of a safe and reliable platform. Scalability isn’t just theoretical – PlutoChain’s testnet processes over 43,200 daily transactions, showcasing real-world readiness. Furthermore, it could unlock immense potential: Bitcoin’s current DeFi activity sits at just 0.13% of its market cap compared to Ethereum’s 10%. PlutoChain’s innovations could begin to close that gap. By enabling a new chapter of dApps and advanced functionality, PlutoChain doesn’t just plan to enhance Bitcoin – it could reframe it as a dynamic platform for modern blockchain applications. Final Words Ripple’s XRP is experiencing a wave of optimism as the Trump administration’s crypto-friendly policies foster a pro-innovation climate. XRP’s utility in cross-border payments could gain momentum. Meanwhile, PlutoChain could redefine Bitcoin’s future. Its hybrid Layer-2 solution plans to enhance Bitcoin with Ethereum-style functionality, potentially enabling smart contracts and dApps. By bridging Bitcoin and Ethereum through EVM compatibility, this project could address scalability and possibly unlock Bitcoin’s untapped potential, hinting at a transformative era for the blockchain ecosystem. ——— This article is purely informational and should not be interpreted as financial advice.

As a primary benchmark for tech companies, the Nasdaq 100 highlights top performers through their Year-to-Date returns. As of Jan. 29, 2025, Constellation Energy Corp is out in front with a 22.93% YTD gain, followed by MicroStrategy Inc with a rise of 20.13%.

The objective is to purchase additional Bitcoin ( BTC ) and collect annual returns from 6% to 10% on their BTC investments during the 2025 to 2027 timeline. In the last six months, MSTR’s price has increased by 108.01%, showing a positive market sentiment for MSTR. MSTR’s performance (August 2024 – January 2025) reflects significant volatility, with sharp gains in late 2024. Sourced from TradingView by crypto.news Now, analysts predict that MSTR could see another 20% jump in its price. On Jan. 27, MicroStrategy bought $1.1 billion worth of BTC, bringing the firm’s total BTC holding to 471,107. As per MSTR’s Bitcoin Treasury report , the company has $48.23 billion worth of BTC.

On Dec. 31, when MSTR’s price fell by $300, analyst Martin Shkreli criticized Saylor, saying MicroStrategy heavily relies on debt and equity issuance to buy more BTC, hence exposing shareholders to risks of diluting value. Additionally, the Wall Street Journal reported on Jan. 24 that MicroStrategy could face an unquantified tax hit arising from a new corporate alternative minimum tax, which could hit unrealized the firm’s gains on BTC. Should this tax go into effect, the company would have to pay federal income taxes on the increase in value of its BTC assets. This could result in MicroStrategy being forced to liquidate a portion of its BTC holding in order to pay taxes– an effect which can be felt on its stocks.

Nuvve, a public Californian company focused on connecting electric vehicles to the grid, said its board has approved holding Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a primary treasury asset. In a Jan. 28 press release , the San Diego-headquartered company revealed it would invest up to 30% of its excess cash, based on its estimated six-month operating expenses, into BTC. How much Bitcoin it actually buys will depend on market conditions and its business needs. The move isn’t just about holding Bitcoin. Nuvve also wants to accept BTC as payment for customers and suppliers “as part of its core mission to promote grid electrification through innovation,” the press release reads. “BTC acceptance will promote more payment options for customers and suppliers with potentially less transactional friction inherent to digital currencies.” Nuvve CEO Gregory Poilasne You might also like: Survey reveals over 50% of Americans sell gold or stocks to buy Bitcoin.

With the U.S. DOGE Service now under its wing, the department aims to modernize government functions and drive massive cost reductions across the board. Interestingly, this new change has already benefited the US government within just a week of Trump passing an executive order. According to The Kobeissi Letter , DOGE has reportedly saved the U.S. government $1 billion per day since the new administration took office. If this trend continues, it could reduce the national deficit by $365 billion by January 2026—equivalent to a 20% cut in the FY2024 deficit of $1.8 trillion. For context, the U.S. spent around $850 billion on defense in 2024, meaning DOGE’s savings could cover nearly 43% of that budget. Plus, with U.S. interest payments on debt reaching $882 billion last year, a $365 billion deficit reduction could slash interest costs by over $12 billion annually. DOGE is saving the Federal Government approx. $1 billion/day, mostly from stopping the hiring of people into unnecessary positions, deletion of DEI and stopping improper payments to foreign organizations, all consistent with the President’s Executive Orders. A good start,… — Department of Government Efficiency (@DOGE) January 29, 2025 DOGE pulled off this historic financial feat, with three key moves: freezing non-essential hires, eliminating DEI programs, and cracking down on improper payments abroad. Also by halting unnecessary hires, trimming bureaucratic excess, and ensuring taxpayer dollars don’t vanish into foreign black holes, DOGE claims it’s setting a new standard in fiscal discipline. Hence, if sustained, this could mean approximately $365 billion saved annually—redirected to infrastructure, healthcare, or national security. Could DOGE Impact Interest Rates? The Kobeissi Letter highlights that for DOGE to cut deficit spending by 50%, it must increase daily savings to $2.5 billion. Lower deficit spending could naturally bring down bond yields, reducing interest costs and creating a positive economic cycle. Moreover, rising inflation and deficit spending concerns have pushed the 10-year Treasury yield up by 100 basis points since rate cuts began. If DOGE’s deficit reduction leads to lower government borrowing, yields could stabilize, potentially saving U.S. consumers trillions in interest over the next decade. However, completely eliminating the FY2024 deficit would require cutting $5 billion per day—five times the current rate. The last time the U.S. achieved a budget surplus was in 1998 under Bill Clinton. If successful, Trump and Elon Musk’s DOGE initiative could mark the second such achievement since 1969. While the numbers sound promising, whether DOGE can truly reshape the U.S. economy remains to be seen. Crypto Reaction With the latest development, the market is cheering how DOGE an underdog crypto coin is making waves in the US economy.

On Jan. 29, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart highlighted that Cboe BZX has submitted fresh 19b-4 filings for spot Solana ETFs from Bitwise, VanEck , 21Shares , and Canary Capital, putting the proposals back in front of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for consideration.

It kicks off the SEC’s review process, where regulators assess whether the proposal meets securities laws and aligns with investor protection standards. Approval would pave the way for Solana ETFs to trade on traditional stock exchanges. If the SEC rejects the proposal, exchanges aren’t out of options—they can tweak and resubmit their applications to address regulatory concerns. This back-and-forth can go on for multiple rounds, as seen in the case of Bitcoin ETFs before they finally secured approval. For Cboe BZX, this marks the second attempt at getting a Solana ETF through the SEC after its previous bid was rejected late last year. At the time, insider sources claimed the commission had put new crypto ETF applications on hold until Donald Trump officially took office. You might also like: Solana ETF approval by July 2025? Polymarket odds spike The latest filings arrive as the regulatory landscape shifts under the Trump administration, which has signaled a more pro-crypto stance. With SEC Acting Chair Mark Uyeda , known for his industry-friendly approach, overseeing the agency, expectations for crypto ETF approvals are rising. Analysts believe Solana ETFs stand a better chance under the new leadership, though it remains to be seen how quickly the SEC will move on pending applications. Issuers have also sought to expand their suite of crypto products with filings for spot XRP , Litecoin, and Dogecoin ETFs. Biwise, for instance, submitted its S-1 filing for an ETF tracking Dogecoin earlier today. Currently, Polymarket bettors put the odds of a Solana ETF approval by Jul. 31 at 57%, but Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has previously speculated that Litecoin could be next in line. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have drawn in billions, proving that demand for crypto investment products is alive and well. The floodgates opened when the SEC finally greenlit Bitcoin ETFs , with Ethereum quickly following suit. Now, with Solana and other altcoins lining up for their turn, the big question is whether regulators will embrace more crypto-backed products—or keep them waiting at the door.

Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $102,584.12, down by 0.27% over the past 24 hours, though it still shows a 2.77% increase over the last week. Ethereum (ETH) has dropped to $3,141.78. Cardano (ADA) has fallen to $0.9424, showing a 1.13% drop in the past 24 hours, but it remains up by 5.47% over the past seven days. XRP is also down slightly, trading at $3.11, down 0.03% over 24 hours. Cardano Price Analysis As of now, ADA is holding above the 50% retracement level, which has acted as significant support around $0.83. On the resistance side, analyst Josh of Crypto World said that Cardano is facing the “golden pocket” Fibonacci area, sitting between $1.13 and $1.23, which has been a major hurdle. The cryptocurrency is essentially trading sideways between these levels, fluctuating between $0.83 and $1.20, as it struggles to break out in either direction. Despite the sideways price action, the overall trend remains bullish, with ADA continuing to form higher lows and higher highs on the weekly chart. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For January 29 , For a big move higher, Cardano needs to break through the golden pocket resistance. If this happens, the next target would be around $1.70 to $1.76, aligning with the next Fibonacci resistance zone. However, expect continued resistance in the $1.13 to $1.23 range if the price makes its way back there. As always, it’s important to keep an eye on Bitcoin’s price action , as it tends to influence the broader crypto market. Any major movements in Bitcoin could have a ripple effect on ADA and other cryptocurrencies. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The proximity to midnight reflects the scale of escalating global threats. The clock is a unique timepiece created 78 years ago by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists as a symbol to gauge how close humanity is to destroying the world. Over the past 78 years, the clock’s time has changed according to how close scientists believe the human race has gotten to total destruction. In some years, they adjust the time, and in others, they don’t. The Bulletin’s Science and Security Board consults with its Board of Sponsors to adjust the Doomsday Clock every year. The board was first established by Albert Einstein in December 1948, with J. Robert Oppenheimer as its first chair. It currently includes nine Nobel laureates, many of whom are in physics, physiology, or medicine. The Doomsday Clock is inching closer to midnight For the two years prior, the Bulletin set the clock at 90 seconds to midnight. This was mainly due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the potential of a nuclear arms race, the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza, and the climate crisis. The clock’s main purpose is not to definitively measure existential threats but rather to trigger discussions about difficult scientific topics such as climate change, according to the Bulletin. Daniel Holz, the Bulletin’s science and security board chair and professor in the department of physics, astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago, in a news briefing Tuesday, said that the clock was set closer to midnight because there is now “sufficient, positive progress on the global challenges we face, including nuclear risk, climate change, biological threats and advances in disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence.” “The countries that possess nuclear weapons are increasing the size and role of their arsenals, investing hundreds of billions of dollars in weapons that can destroy civilization many times over,” he added. Progress in the development of disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and in space has also far outpaced regulation in those areas, Holz pointed out. As far as Holz is concerned, these dangers are exacerbated by a potent threat multiplier — “the spread of misinformation, disinformation and conspiracy theories that degrade the communication ecosystem and increasingly blur the line between truth and falsehood.” Artificial intelligence now affects the Doomsday Clock Many factors influence the doomsday clock, but the latest and perhaps most influential is the threat of AI. AI has evolved into an analog of an arms race as countries scramble to dominate the field. This has led to the start of an AI Cold War— geopolitical tensions between the United States and China focused on the competition for dominance in artificial intelligence technology. The AI Cold War goes back to 2018, when China announced its AI Development Plan aimed at global leadership by 2030. Since then, the US has hit China with waves of sanctions and bans to limit the Asian nation’s access to recent and high-performing GPUs. That fight took on a different dimension with the release of DeepSeek, China’s alternative to all the language models the US has shipped. DeepSeek has stolen the spotlight for performing on par with leading AI models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT while costing only $6 million to train, a fraction of the over $100 million OpenAI spends on similar models. The app’s success has raised national security concerns in the US, with many worried about data privacy and the potential for Chinese influence through AI technology. If the clock ever strikes midnight Stakeholders expect the latest development will only supercharge the AI Cold War as the US tries to reclaim its lead. The potential fallout from an unhinged pursuit of AI dominance is why the Doomsday Clock is now 89 seconds to midnight. Scientists hope the Doomsday Clock will once again start discussions that lead to peaceful resolutions. Midnight represents the moment at which people will have made the Earth uninhabitable. According to Bulletin president and CEO Rachel Bronson, the clock has never reached midnight, and she hopes it never will. “When the clock is at midnight, that means there’s been some sort of nuclear exchange or catastrophic climate change that’s wiped out humanity,” she said. “We never really want to get there, and we won’t know it when we do.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Are You Making These Web3 Resume Mistakes? - Find Out Here",AI|DeepSeek|OpenAI|University of Chicago,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-29 07:27:21

Launched in 2024, NEIRO quickly became a standout in the meme coin landscape, leveraging its vibrant community and unique utility features to gain traction. A Bit of History NEIRO’s presale started at a modest $0.000005. Early adopters watched their investments skyrocket as the token hit its all-time high of $0.09 within months, yielding returns of over 1,700x. It’s no wonder NEIRO investors are still basking in their success. Where NEIRO Stands Today As of now, NEIRO trades at approximately $0.0309, reflecting the enduring appeal of the token. With a capped supply of 420 billion tokens, NEIRO has carved out a loyal community that believes in its long-term potential.

Why BTFD Coin Could Deliver Even Bigger Than NEIRO The crypto world thrives on momentum, innovation, and community. BTFD Coin embodies all three.

A Tale of Two Coins NEIRO: Early adopters struck gold, but opportunities for massive ROI are limited as the token matures. BTFD: Still in its presale, BTFD offers unmatched entry points with the potential for explosive growth. Community Power Both coins owe their success to strong community backing, but BTFD’s referral program takes engagement to the next level, incentivizing not just participation but active promotion. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Your Second Chance They say lightning doesn’t strike the same place twice, but in crypto, it often does—if you know where to look. NEIRO was the goldmine of 2024, but the spotlight now shines on BTFD Coin .

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As meme coins like TRUMP and DOGE struggle to maintain their dominance, 1Fuel, with its real-world use cases and growing adoption, stands out as a strong contender. Table of Contents TRUMP fails to hold up price action DOGE’s rally hope crashes Use cases to drive 1Fuel’s growth Conclusion With no inherent value, meme coin tokens in the market are gradually fading out and losing control. TRUMP and DOGE, which both had a leading reign in the market, are caught in this market downturn as the market shifts towards utility tokens with long-term value, such as 1Fuel. 1Fuel’s real-world use cases are shielded from the bearish sentiment in the market, as more buyers step in, a clear testament to its total token sales of $1.55 million. Analysts believe 1Fuel’s use cases, particularly in the crypto market with adoption on the rise, would play a major role in analysts’ projected 5,000% rally. TRUMP fails to hold up price action TRUMP has failed to get the goods well off the market, as the sentiment across multiple indicators shows its current bearish downturn could intensify soon. At the time of writing, CoinMarketCap reports TRUMP to have dropped by a total of 38.46% in the past week, bringing its current price to $26.37. A study of the Binance TRUMP/USDT chart shows the asset has declined past its listing price of $27.25, after it rallied to $77.24, reaching an all-time high. The possibility of a TRUMP rally remains slim, as no clear patterns are forming on the chart to hint at a possible market reversal. Should this continue, the asset would continue on its downward path. DOGE ‘s rally hope crashes DOGE investors have lost hope for a market bounce-back following the recent crash in the market. According to CoinMarketCap, DOGE has dropped 7.13% in the past 24 hours, an extension of its 9.23% market decline in the past week. A study of the 1-day chart in TradingView shows that this decline has been facilitated by DOGE losing the support level of the accumulation channel in which it trades. This month-long accumulation channel, technically called the symmetrical triangle, began formation on 23 November 2024 and was expected to catalyze upward price movement, but it has failed. Memecoins, like DOGE and TRUMP, have turned out not to be the best cryptocurrency investment for investors this season compared to 1Fuel, with a 5,000% potential on the horizon. Use cases to drive 1Fuel’s growth The hype and interest in 1Fuel have been due to the cryptocurrency wallet that’s currently in development. This cryptocurrency wallet is expected to launch with several market features that are unique, and their combination together makes it distinct. Actions such as cross-chain transactions of tokens would be completed within seconds with just a single click. Other features include temporary wallets for private token transactions or other business-specific purposes, privacy mixers to protect trade and maintain anonymity, and a cold storage option to better safeguard assets against hacks, among others. Analysts believe these are use cases that would lead to 1Fuel’s use and its wallet’s growth and adoption as well. With these activities going on, the price of 1Fuel will likely see a significant move to the upside.

Is Bitcoin doomed? No, really? If you are not familiar with Jim Cramer yet, you probably don’t know why his investment bets are talked about massively on the web but are hardly taken seriously. Long story short, some of Cramer’s predictions were 180 degrees from what happened. His reputation as the man whose market forecasts are fully opposite to what comes after is outstanding and meme-rich. On Jan. 27, 2025, answering the TV viewer’s call, Cramer said, “If you wanna own Bitcoin, own Bitcoin. I own Bitcoin, you should own Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a great thing to add.” The crypto community expresses disturbance, as Cramer’s praise for Bitcoin may suggest that Bitcoin is on the brink of collapse. On the other hand, Cramer’s distaste for MSTR gives MicroStrategy bulls reasons for optimism as if Cramer is wrong again, MSTR is about to moon. Table of Contents Who is Jim Cramer? Inverse Jim Cramer ETF Do people really believe that Cramer is always saying the opposite of what is about to come? Who is Jim Cramer? Jim Cramer is a TV personality with a background in hedge investment. Cramer hosts the Mad Money segment on CNBC and writes for TheStreet.com, which he also co-founded. He is famously expressive as a host and regularly gives out turbo-confident stock picks (on TV, on X, and elsewhere). As mentioned above, he was often bullish on weak investments and sceptical towards those about to show their strength. If you need a clear example of Jim as a lousy market forecaster, we can recall what he said one year before his latest statement, in which he urges people to buy Bitcoin. In January 2024 he said that Bitcoin is “topping out.” One year later, the Bitcoin value has doubled. Read more: Jim Cramer switches stances, now says Bitcoin is topping out People who follow the Bitcoin price trends know that predicting the BTC crash within 18 months after the halving is pure madness. It takes all the historical data to ignore to say that Bitcoin is going to leave soon, months before halving. However, Cramer did it and made people think his bets were random once again. What’s more funny is that days before the “topping out” prediction, he claimed that “Bitcoin is here to stay.” A true legend. Legend pic.twitter.com/sYRWBKhXuL — Inverse Cramer (@CramerTracker) May 25, 2023 Other notable bloopers include the urge to invest in Silicon Valley Bank weeks before its collapse, the Nvidia wrongs saga (see the tweet above), and calls to dump Netflix (in 2012) and Hewlett Packard (in 2012) months before these stocks doubled. Inverse Jim Cramer ETF No wonder Cramer soon deserved an “inverse indicator” fame, meaning that you should listen to Cramer and act straight opposite to what he says. If Jim is bullish on some stock, sell it! If he considers some asset irrelevant, it’s time to buy! Rather, this attitude was a joke, but the X account named Inverse Cramer, posting the Cramer picks-related tweets, gained over 320k followers. To make things more mind-blowing, in 2022, Tuttle Capital Management released the notorious Inverse Jim Cramer ETF comprised of stocks Jim was sceptical about! The ETF has been updating quickly as Cramer delivered more and more stock picks, sometimes flipping his sentiment towards some of the investments. That was crazy. The Inverse Jim Cramer ETF was closed about a year after its launch, outliving the Long Cramer Tracker ETF, though, an ETF that genuinely followed Cramer’s advice. According to Tuttle, the “inverse Jim” was closed because updating the contents of this ETF was really hard, while the assets under management value was pretty low at around $2 million. Do people really believe that Cramer is always saying the opposite of what is about to come? Jokes aside, Cramer is a seasoned professional with a degree from Harvard and a Goldman Sachs background. It is rather the format of Mad Money that makes him look strange and funny because he has to pick too many stocks every week and comment on the stocks requested by the people who call CNBC to ask Cramer’s opinion. Like many professionals, Cramer can be wrong, and that’s alright. One of the proofs of Cramer’s decency is the fact that the Inverse Jim Cramer ETF did pretty badly. It existed for too little time to judge, but during the lifetime of this ETF, its result was actually negative. At the end of its existence, it was 15% down against the 25% S&P 500 gain for the same period. As always i welcome people betting against me. I have done this for 42 years. Those who know me know that you would have been betting against Apple at 5, Google since inception, Meta at $18, Amazon at ten, Nvidia at $25 and AMD at $5. i welcome all comers.. — Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) October 7, 2022 It explains well why the crypto community meets Cramer’s praise for Bitcoin with an easy heart, posting memes about the soon Bitcoin crash without taking this probability at face value.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin is trying hard to hold its momentum above $100K. This surge in value is partly attributed to the broader market response to Donald Trump’s election. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential of holding above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $102,516 Market Cap $1,238,914,422,643 Trading Volume $22,318,495,561 Circulating Supply 19,719,062 All-time High $108,268, December 17, 2024 All-time Low $0.04865, Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $104,888 24-hour low $104,112 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $102,516 Price Prediction $ 112,463 (19.91%) Fear & Greed Index 66 (Greed) Sentiment Neutral Volatility 3.39% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $ 95,668 200-Day SMA $ 71,732 14-Day RSI 44.14 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : BTC price analysis struggles around $103K. Resistance for BTC is at $103,583. Support for BTC/USD is at $98,197. The BTC price analysis for 29 January confirms that the BTC price aims for a hold below $103K level. However, bears are aiming for an immediate rebound. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price struggles to hold above resistance Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that BTC faces selling pressure as it aims for a move above $103K. In recent hours, the price of BTC faced multiple rejections and is struggling below that resistance channel. The 24-hour volume has surged to $1.97 billion, raising interest in trading today. BTC is trading at $102,516, dropping by over 0.8% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin shows volatility The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level but trades above the buying region at 54, hinting that a bullish pressure is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. Bulls are maintaining buying confidence as the BTC price aims for a retest of resistance. Bitcoin aims for immediate correction The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.6, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line and the indicator aims for a positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $103,583, it will fuel a bullish rally to $107,543. BTC/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $98,197, beginning a bearish trend to $94,949. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin makes it a good investment option. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is Bitcoin down today? Despite Trump signing multiple executive orders favoring crypto, the market failed to gain much momentum. This resulted in a steep decline in the BTC price chart. Will BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, forming a new ATH. The price is currently aiming to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 Million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC SoSoValue data shows Bitcoin ETFs netted $5.32 million on Jan. 1, led by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund with $37 million in inflows. FBTC’s total assets stand at $18.9 billion, edging closer to the $20 billion mark. Bitcoin price prediction January 2025 December was a bullish month for Bitcoin, characterized by significant upswings. Will BTC price establish a new ATH in January 2025? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to surge toward $100,000 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $108,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation of around $91K. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction January 2025 $91,000 $100,000 $108,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Bitcoin spot ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $95,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF demand might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETFs approval. Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum price of $160,000, with a minimum price of $95,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, the future market potential for Bitcoin entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation and investor sentiment in long-term holding. We expect Bitcoin price to create a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC is trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-29 07:39:56

While the revelation from the Chinese startup has been a major hiccup for US stocks in the near term, President Donald Trump said it will only prove to be a tailwind for the AI space at large. His recent comment bodes well not just for the AI stocks but other platforms committed to leveraging artificial intelligence as well – and that includes the up-and-coming iDEGEN . Could DeepSeek be a tailwind for iDEGEN? Global artificial intelligence stocks tanked in an initial response to DeepSeek as its latest model questions if high-end chips and advanced resources are required to build and operate AI. However, the US President dubbed it a “wake-up” call for the US based tech companies and urged their executives to focus on innovation in order to stay competitive in this fast-growing market. What that means is: capital is perhaps going to continue to pour into AI projects in pursuit of building even more powerful models and expanding use cases. After all, Statista forecasts this market to grow at a compound annualised rate of more than 27% through the end of this decade. So, it’s a given that the AI market is still in its early innings only. That makes investing in iDEGEN today an exciting proposition since some of that capital could very well find its way to this artificial intelligence enabled platform. If you’d like to know more about iDEGEN and explore the opportunity of investing in its native crypto token, click here to visit the project website now. Should you invest in iDEGEN in 2025? iDEGEN is an AI meme coin that’s turned quite a few heads in recent weeks. Its ongoing presale has already raised more than $18 million, suggesting the investment community is super interested in this crypto project that simultaneously offers exposure to artificial intelligence as well. iDEGEN relies on AI to learn from what the community is posting and commenting on “X” – the social media website that Elon Musk bought for $44 billion in 2022. Following the presale, this meme coin will list on a crypto exchange, potentially attracting a lot more investors to eventually command a higher price tag. All in all, iDEGEN may be worth investing this year since it could benefit as the US President Donald Trump continues to deliver on his promise of making America the leader in emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies.

Dennis Porter , co-founder and CEO of Satoshi Action Fund, noted on X that Utah is the second U.S. state to advance such a bill past committee approval. On Jan. 28, the Utah House Economic Development Committee passed HB 230, the Blockchain and Digital Innovation Amendments, with an 8-1 vote. Introduced by Representative Jordan Teuscher on Jan. 21, the bill would authorize the state treasurer to allocate up to 5% of select public funds into “qualifying digital assets”, including cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization exceeding $500 billion and certain approved stablecoins. A revised version of the bill, known as the second substitute, was updated on Jan. 28 to include provisions regarding crypto mining zoning restrictions. The measure now moves to the full House, where it must secure majority approval before advancing to the Senate. If passed, both chambers will send it to the governor for approval or veto. Utah advances legislation to allow state investment in cryptocurrencies According to Bitcoin Reserve Monitor, several U.S. states have introduced legislation allowing local treasuries to invest in cryptocurrencies. “While Utah is the 11th state to introduce similar legislation, we will be the first to pass it,” Teuscher posted on X on Jan. 21. Under Utah’s bill, the state’s digital assets would be required to be held through secure custody solutions, qualified custodians, or exchange-traded products. In addition to that, the bill also establishes the Treasurer of the State as the custodian of digital assets and allows the state to stake and lend crypto assets subject to certain conditions. Furthermore, the legislation prohibits state and local governments from regulating or restricting the use of cryptocurrency to pay for lawful goods and services. Upon receiving the governor’s approval, the law will become effective on May 7, 2024. Spencer Cox has shown some pro-crypto stance in the past, having signed a bill creating a Blockchain and Digital Innovation Task Force in 2022. South Dakota joins growing state-led push for a Bitcoin reserve Nations worldwide are increasingly considering adopting a strategic Bitcoin reserve, driven in part by U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. In recent months, multiple U.S. states have introduced and passed Bitcoin-related legislation. A few hours ago, South Dakota joined the movement, unveiling its own Bitcoin proposal. In a recent post on X, South Dakota State Representative Logan Manhart expressed his intent to introduce a strategic Bitcoin reserve, calling it a rare opportunity for the state to take a proactive approach. He said he was proud to introduce a bill in the South Dakota House that would create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. He noted that now is one of the few chances the government has to be proactive. These developments highlight a growing trend among U.S. states, with at least 12 states having already proposed or passed Bitcoin-related legislation. These include Utah, South Dakota, Florida, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, Massachusetts, and Arizona.

While retaining his characteristic bluntness, Hayes lays out two scenarios when to buy Bitcoin. Buy Bitcoin If This Happens Hayes’ essay begins by recounting a sudden shift in sentiment that caught him off guard. Comparing financial analysis to backcountry skiing on a dormant volcano, Hayes recalls how the mere hint of avalanche danger once forced him to stop and reassess. He expresses a similarly uneasy feeling about current monetary conditions, an intuition he says he last felt in late 2021, right before the crypto markets collapsed from their record highs. “Subtle movements between central bank balance sheet levels, the rate of banking credit expansion, the relationship between the US 10-yr treasury/stocks/Bitcoin prices, and the insane TRUMP memecoin price action produced a pit in my stomach,” he writes, emphasizing that these signals collectively remind him of the market’s precarious situation prior to the 2022 and 2023 downturns. He clarifies that he does not believe the broader bull cycle is finished, but he anticipates that Bitcoin could drop to somewhere around the $70,000 to $75,000 range before rallying sharply to reach $250,000 by year’s end. Related Reading: DeepSeek Predicts Bitcoin Bull Run Peak At $500,000 – Here’s When He describes this range as plausible given that equity markets and treasury markets appear, in his words, deeply entangled in a “filthy fiat” environment still grappling with the vestiges of inflation and rising interest rates. Hayes points out that Maelstrom, his investment firm, remains net long while simultaneously raising its holdings in the USDe stablecoins to buy back Bitcoin if price falls below $75,000. In his view, scaling back risk in the short term allows him to preserve capital that can later be deployed when a genuine market liquidation occurs. He identifies a 30% correction from current levels as a distinct possibility, while also acknowledging that the bullish momentum could continue. “if Bitcoin trades through $110,000 on strong volume with an expanding perp open interest, then I’ll throw in the towel and buy back risk higher,” he writes on his second scenario. In attempting to decipher why a temporary pullback might happen, Hayes asserts that major central banks—the Federal Reserve in the United States, the People’s Bank of China, and the Bank of Japan—are either curbing money creation or, in some cases, outright raising the price of money by permitting yields to rise. He believes that these shifts could choke off speculative capital that has elevated both stocks and cryptocurrencies in recent months. His discussion of the US focuses on two interlocked perspectives: that ten-year treasury yields could rise to a zone between 5% and 6%, and that the Federal Reserve, while hostile to Donald Trump’s administration, will not hesitate to reinitiate printing if it becomes essential to preserve American financial stability. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finally Turns $100K Into Support – Ready To Rally Higher? However, he believes that at some point, the financial system will need an intervention—most likely an exemption to the Supplemental Leverage Ratio (SLR) or a new wave of quantitative easing. He contends that the reluctance or slowness of the Fed to take these steps increases the probability of a near-term bond market sell-off, which could weigh on equities, and by correlation, Bitcoin. His political analysis homes in on the lingering enmity between Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, as well as the Fed’s willingness to forestall a crisis during the Biden presidency. He cites statements from former Fed governor William Dudley and references Powell’s press conference remarks that suggested the Fed might alter its approach based on Trump’s policies. Hayes describes these tensions as a backdrop for a scenario in which Trump might allow a mini-financial crisis to unfold, forcing the Fed’s hand. Under such stress, the Fed would have little choice but to prevent a broader meltdown, and monetary expansion could then follow. He suggests that it would be politically expedient for the Trump administration to permit yields to surge to crisis levels if it meant that the Fed would be compelled to pivot into the large-scale money printing that many in crypto circles expect. China, Hayes remarks, had seemed poised to join the liquidity party with an explicit reflation program until a sudden U-turn in January, when the PBOC halted its bond-buying program and allowed the yuan to stabilize in a stronger position. He attributes this policy change to internal political pressures or possibly strategic maneuvering for future negotiations with Trump. Hayes also acknowledges that some readers might find the correlation between Bitcoin and traditional risk assets perplexing, given the long-term argument that Bitcoin is a unique store of value. Yet he points to charts showing a rising 30-day correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100. In the short term, he says, the leading cryptocurrency remains sensitive to changes in fiat liquidity, even if the coin ultimately trades on an uncorrelated basis over extended time horizons. He thus portrays Bitcoin as a leading indicator: if bond yields spike and equity markets tumble, Bitcoin could begin its dive before tech stocks follow. Hayes thinks that once authorities unleash renewed monetary stimulus to quell volatility, Bitcoin would be the first to bottom out and rebound. He admits that predicting exact outcomes is impossible and that any investor must play perceived probabilities rather than certainties. His decision to hedge is derived from the concept of expected value. If he believes there is a substantial chance of a 30% pullback versus a smaller probability that Bitcoin will continue higher before he decides to buy back in at a 10% premium, reducing exposure still yields a better risk-reward ratio. “Trading isn’t about being right or wrong,” he emphasizes, “but about trading perceived probabilities and maximizing expected value.” He also underscores that this protective stance allows him to wait for the kind of dramatic liquidation move in altcoins that often accompanies a short-term Bitcoin collapse, a scenario he calls “Armageddon” in the so-called “shitcoin space.” In such circumstances, he wants ample funds available to pick up fundamentally sound tokens at severely depressed prices. At press time, BTC traded at $102,530.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 533,100 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is in week 14 of its price discovery phase – a bull market stage that began when Bitcoin eclipsed its previous cycle’s all-time high late last year. According to the trader, historical data suggests that BTC may be a couple of weeks away from starting its next leg up. “In Week 14 of the 2017 cycle, Bitcoin was recovering from its first Price Discovery Correction only to make new highs in Week 16. In Week 14 of the 2021 cycle, Bitcoin was still just bottoming on its first Price Discovery Correction only to make new highs in Week 16. It’s Week 14 right now.” Rekt Capital notes that traders who refuse to unload their BTC stack amid the correction will likely be rewarded in the coming weeks. “Based on this data, here is how to approach these upcoming weeks in Price Discovery when it comes to Bitcoin: Weeks 14-15 = Patiently HODL (hold on for dear life) Weeks 16+ = Optimistic On Confirmation Of The 2nd Price Discovery Uptrend.” The trader also highlights that he thinks the Bitcoin bull market has a long way to go. “It is still relatively early on in the BTC Parabolic Phase of this cycle. Historically, this phase has lasted on average ~300 days. Bitcoin is on Day 82 of its Parabolic Phase.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $101,163.

This marks a sharp rise from last Monday’s $12.4 million, showcasing the growing enthusiasm among investors. The surge in interest coincides with Solana’s (SOL) recent network congestion, driven by heightened activity following the launch of Trump-themed meme coins. Despite these challenges, the outlook for SOL remains optimistic, with market data suggesting it could hit $400 by February. Key factors driving this bullish sentiment include increased network activity, the rising popularity of meme coins, upcoming Solana ETFs, and reports of an altcoin reserve fund associated with Donald Trump, aimed at supporting US-based cryptocurrencies like Solana and Ripple (XRP) . As the first-ever Layer-2 scaling solution for Solana, Solaxy is also poised to benefit from the growing adoption of the network. With a presale price of just $0.001616, SOLX offers early investors an opportunity to participate in an up-and-coming project poised to redefine Solana’s scalability. Solana’s path to $400 and beyond Solana recently hit a record high of $293, fueled by demand for meme coins like Official Trump (TRUMP) and Official Melania (MELANIA) . These tokens generated billions in trading volume during their launch despite causing temporary network congestion. Investors are confident in SOL, as demonstrated by large OTC deals.

She has filed an amicus curiae brief in the case Coinbase vs SEC at the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, opposing what she calls an unlawful power grab. Lummis criticizes the SEC’s aggressive tactics under Chair Gary Gensler, accusing the agency of secretly redefining laws like the Howey Test. This test determines whether an asset qualifies as an investment contract, but the SEC has been applying it in ways that Congress never intended. According to Lummis, this approach forces digital asset exchanges to comply with regulations that have never been properly debated or approved by lawmakers. She argues that only Congress has the constitutional authority to define whether digital assets should be treated as securities or commodities. The SEC, she warns, is overstepping its role by stretching nearly 100-year-old laws to fit new technologies. This could have severe consequences for the digital asset industry, potentially slowing innovation and creating legal uncertainty. Lummis believes the SEC’s tactics undermine the fundamental separation of powers. She points out that even Gensler himself admitted in 2021 that Congress—not the SEC—should establish the rules for digital assets. Despite this, the SEC has continued to expand its influence, using outdated legal interpretations to regulate an industry that operates in a completely different technological landscape. If the court sides with Coinbase, the decision could provide much-needed clarity on the SEC’s regulatory limits . Lummis warns that without intervention, the SEC’s unchecked power could stifle growth in the industry and make it difficult for businesses to navigate the unclear legal landscape. Coinbase recently secured a partial victory in its battle with the SEC. The US Court of Appeals ruled that the SEC had not provided a strong enough explanation for denying Coinbase’s request for clear regulatory guidelines. This ruling could influence the ongoing case and force the SEC to clarify its position. With multiple lawsuits challenging the SEC’s authority, the outcome of this case could have far-reaching implications. Lummis hopes her intervention will help establish clear legal boundaries and protect innovation in the digital asset sector.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-29 08:08:23

A deep dive into the L1 blockchain,https://crypto.news/what-is-sui-how-does-it-work/,"Boasting a 1300% increase in its price, the SUI token is one of the most talked about crypto assets of 2024. Sui ( SUI ) is a layer-1 blockchain that aims to onboard the next billion users in Web3. The blockchain claims to be a ‘Scalable infrastructure that’s fast, secure, and affordable’ Table of Contents What is Sui? History and Background How does SUI work? Price History of SUI In this article, we’ll learn what is SUI, the history of the SUI blockchain, how it works, and the price history of the SUI token. What is Sui? The Sui (SUI) blockchain is a platform designed to emphasize scalability for its decentralized applications (dApps) and shorten the time it takes for smart contracts to execute. SUI offers several architectural ideas to boost its speed and scalability without compromising the blockchain’s security, setting it apart from other blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Polkadot. These consist of the Move smart contract programming language, parallel transaction processing, and the Sui consensus motor. Validators can stake the SUI cryptocurrency, the platform’s native cryptocurrency, to verify transactions using Sui’s delegated proof of stake (dPoS) network. Additionally, SUI connects the platform by serving as a means of trade, executing bespoke programs, and rewarding users who contribute to its advancement. Now that we know what is SUI used for, let’s discuss its history and background. You might also like: Sui resumes strong uptrend, soars by over 1,300% from lowest level History and Background In August 2022, Sui debuted its incentive-based testnet, and its mainnet became active on May 3, 2023. Mysten Labs , which is headed by a number of former top officials from Meta’s now-defunct Novi digital wallet initiative, is developing the blockchain. In September 2022, Mysten Labs secured $300 million in a Series B fundraising round to create the blockchain. Well-known venture investors including Circle, Binance Labs , Lightspeed Venture Partners, a16z, and NCSoft support the business. The Sui Foundation, on the other hand, is a stand-alone entity that aids the community and its initiatives. Its goal is to accelerate the worldwide adoption of the Sui blockchain in order to enroll the next billion people in Web3. How does SUI work? SUI has a distinct consensus and transaction processing technique than other blockchains. Conventional blockchain validators add transactions to the blockchain in a sequential manner, which limits the blockchain’s scalability and makes it difficult to accelerate the incremental additions known as vertical scaling. SUI eliminates the need for every transaction to be verified by every node in the network since many transactions are inherently unrelated to one another. Rather than confirming the full chain, it merely looks at the pertinent piece of data. Furthermore, it uses an object-centric paradigm, which centers the chain data storage around things rather than accounts, to do this effectively. Instead of needing to arrange every transaction as in the conventional blockchain paradigm, SUI nodes can validate uncorrelated transaction flows independently and separately because of this innovative kind of data storage. The whole transaction broadcasting and validation process starts with a sender broadcasting the transaction to all validators. Following this, validators verify the transaction for validity, analyze the stake of the validators, and send their weighted votes based on the stake. After gathering a Byzantine-resistant majority, the sender broadcasts the outcome to validators in the form of a certificate. SUI is likely able to achieve transaction rates of more than 100,000 transactions per second as a result. Price History of SUI The SUI cryptocurrency registered its all-time low on Oct. 19, 2023, at $0.3643, and since then the token has experienced an increase of 1000%, registering an all-time high of $5.35 on Jan 06, 2025. At the time of writing, the SUI token is trading at $3.76, with a market cap of $11.32 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $921.68 million. SUI token Weekly chart | Source: Tradingview Looking at the chart of the SUI token we can see a formation of higher highs and higher lows which is a sign of a bullish continuation. For long-term buyers, it may be a good time to wait for the 0.5 and 0.618 fibs, also known as the golden fib zone, as it is also correlated with a major support zone of the SUI token. It should be noted that this price analysis can be wrong as the crypto market is also heavily dependent on fundamental factors and you should do research before investing in this token.

MystenLabs, a business started by Evan Cheng, Adeniyi Abiodun, Sam Blackshear, George Danezis, and Kostas Chalkias, is responsible for developing Sui. In addition to the now-defunct Facebook wallet program Novi, the founders comprised a group of executives and architects that spearheaded the creation of the Diem blockchain and stablecoin payment system. Is SUI secure? The SUI blockchain does claim to be secure with a variety of security features including fault tolerance, native object ownership, Sui Guardians, third-party audits, security issue reporting form, and the use of Move programming language, all of which adds to the security of this layer-1 blockchain. Is SUI legal/legit? Yes, the SUI token is legal and legitimate in any country where cryptocurrencies are allowed. To avoid any legal hassles in the future, it is advisable to do your research before investing in this token or any crypto asset as per your country of residence. What makes SUI unique? SUI claims to offer high scalability, an object-centric data storage model, and parallel transaction processing. It also claims to have the ability to process over 100,000 transactions per second which makes it one of the fastest blockchains on which many decentralized applications can be built and operated seamlessly.

Around this bearish call, Trump’s Bitcoin Strategy picking pace with 13 US states planning to create a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve out of them Arizona and Utah are leading the race. In the meanwhile Bitcoin is riding above the $100K mark with a slight decline today it is currently trading at $102,684. Utah’s House Economic Development Committee has passed a bill allowing the state to invest in cryptocurrencies. The bill, HB 230, passed with an 8-1 vote on January 28 and now heads to the full House for a vote. If approved by both the House and Senate, it will be sent to Governor Spencer Cox, who is known for his pro-crypto stance. Key Details of the Bill Dennis Porter, CEO & Co-Founder, SatoshiActFund announced on X that the Utah House Committee had approved the “Blockchain and Digital Innovation Bill,” which includes a provision for adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Porter highlighted that the support for the bill was “overwhelming,” signaling strong backing for crypto adoption at the state level. Thrilled to join with @Dennis_Porter_ to announce HB230 which will allow the state to invest in digital assets.

Utah continues to lead the nation in blockchain and digital innovation! https://t.co/mBTt12UaQw — Jordan Teuscher (@jordanteuscher) January 21, 2025 The bill, introduced by Representative Jordan Teuscher, gives Utah’s treasurer the authority to invest up to 5% of certain public funds into “qualifying digital assets.” These assets include major cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of over $500 billion and approved stablecoins. The bill also allows the state to engage in crypto staking and lending under specific conditions. The bill mandates that the state’s digital assets be held securely through qualified custodians, exchange-traded products, or secure custody solutions. Plus, it prohibits state and local governments from restricting the acceptance of cryptocurrencies for legal goods and services. This ensures that crypto can be used for transactions within Utah. Crypto Initiatives Gaining Momentum Utah is one of several states exploring the use of public funds for crypto investments. Twelve other states, including neighboring Arizona and Wyoming, have introduced similar bills. Utah’s bill is poised to be the first to pass out of committee, and if it becomes law, it will take effect on May 7. Growing Support for State Crypto Investments Governor Spencer Cox’s previous support for blockchain initiatives, such as signing a bill to create a Blockchain and Digital Innovation Task Force in 2022, suggests that the bill will likely receive his approval. Meanwhile, other states, like South Dakota, are also exploring similar measures, with Representative Logan Manhart planning to introduce a bill for a state Bitcoin stockpile.

The analysis believes that there will be a potential shift in Bitcoin’s dynamics as institutional funds flow into the space. According to Matrixport’s chart report, Bitcoin’s 30-day realized volatility has averaged 58% over the past five years. Historically, this volatility has increased during bull and bear markets, such as the 2020/2021 bull run and the 2022 bear market. However, recent trends show an unusual decline in volatility even as Bitcoin makes significant gains in 2023 and 2024. Related News: Renowned Founder Says ""The US Will Definitely Buy Bitcoin"", Counts 5 Reasons The report suggests that Bitcoin spot ETFs play a crucial role in reducing volatility. By introducing Wall Street investors to BTC, these ETFs have increased institutional participation in the market. The presence of institutional investors, who tend to hold long-term positions, absorbs market fluctuations and provides a stabilizing effect on Bitcoin prices. “Low volatility allows institutional investors to take more risks,” the report said, adding that Bitcoin’s strong performance in recent years has further attracted Wall Street funds. Institutional buying has also reduced sharp declines in Bitcoin prices, creating a more stable market environment. This stability could encourage more inflows from traditional financial institutions, which could continue to reduce volatility and increase market predictability. *This is not investment advice.

The application, submitted on January 28, follows a previous move to register a Dogecoin ETF through a Delaware trust. This is the second filing for a Dogecoin ETF in recent weeks, coming after Rex Shares' application for multiple meme coin ETFs, including DOGE, Bonk ( BONK ), and Donald Trump’s TRUMP token. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart noted on X (formerly Twitter) that the filing was expected, as Bitwise had already registered the trust last week. However, what makes this filing unique is that it falls under the Securities Act of 1933 , ensuring a physically backed structure. This means that the ETF would hold actual Dogecoin, unlike funds filed under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which do not necessarily require direct ownership of assets. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, emphasized the importance of this distinction, explaining that Rex Shares’ filing was under the 1940 Act, making it structurally different from Bitwise’s physically backed proposal. In the filing, Bitwise has named Coinbase Custody as the custodian for the Dogecoin ETF. However, key details such as the proposed fee, ticker symbol, and listing exchange have not yet been disclosed in the S-1 form. Following the announcement, optimism surrounding the approval of a Dogecoin ETF surged. On the prediction platform Polymarket, betting odds jumped to a record 56% in favor of approval before settling at 55%. Bitwise’s move aligns with the growing trend of cryptocurrency ETF applications. The company has already launched spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs and has filed for Solana ( SOL ) and XRP (XRP) ETFs. Meanwhile, its broader plan to introduce the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, which aims to track the ten largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, is still under SEC review.

The strategy is designed to establish Metaplanet as one of the world's largest corporate holders of bitcoin, the company said. It holds over $180 million worth of asset as of Wednesday, data shows . The so-termed ""21 Million Plan” — a likely nod to bitcoin’s total supply — involves issuing 21 million shares via moving strike warrants to raise approximately 116.65 billion yen (or nearly $740 million at current exchange rates), marking one of the largest equity capital raises for bitcoin in Asia. This plan aims to protect shareholder value by setting the exercise price at 100% of the previous day's closing price, avoiding the dilution often seen with traditional warrants. Metaplanet targets an expected 35% BTC Yield each quarter. It achieved a 309.82% BTC Yield for Q4 2024 following a 41.7% BTC Yield in Q3 2024 — a move that proves its acquisition strategy was on the right path, per the release . “BTC Yield is the foundation of our strategy and the ultimate measure of our success,” said Dylan LeClair, Director of Bitcoin Strategy at Metaplanet. “We don’t measure performance in fiat currencies like the yen or the dollar—our benchmark is Bitcoin itself.” “Our mission is to maximize bitcoin per share for our shareholders. Bitcoin is not just an asset; it’s the exit strategy. We’re here to accumulate and lead, not sell,” LeClair added.

In a recent post, Cronje explained that relentless pressure from US regulators drained his energy and forced him to leave the industry. According to Cronje, the SEC’s scrutiny started with simple inquiries about investors and profits but soon escalated into aggressive demands. Despite not being a US citizen and having no business in the country, he was targeted repeatedly. Each request led to more investigations, taking a toll on his time and resources until he ultimately decided to step away. Cronje stated that the SEC warned him against speaking publicly about this harassment, threatening further action if he did. The stress of ongoing regulatory pressure made it impossible for him to continue working on open-source projects, despite his passion for the crypto space. Even after his departure, Cronje never fully disengaged. He continued contributing discreetly to projects, unable to stay away from the industry he helped build. Now, with a change in SEC leadership in 2025, he feels safe enough to share his story. The resignation of Gary Gensler has brought a shift in regulatory attitude. Cronje believes the new SEC leadership is more open to crypto innovation, leading him to finally speak out about his experience. His revelations highlight the struggles faced by blockchain developers under previous regulatory policies. For years, the SEC took a hard stance against DeFi, pushing key figures like Cronje out of the industry. While some dismissed claims of widespread regulatory crackdowns, Cronje’s account confirms the pressure crypto developers faced. The crypto space has endured numerous challenges from regulators, but Cronje’s return signals that the industry remains resilient. His experience serves as a reminder of past struggles while raising hope for a more balanced regulatory approach moving forward.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-29 08:15:35

House Bill 230, the Blockchain and Digital Innovation Amendments, was approved by an 8-1 vote on January 28 and now advances to the full House for consideration. The proposed legislation , if passed, would permit the state treasurer to allocate up to 5% of certain public funds to “qualifying digital assets,” including cryptocurrencies with a market capitalisation exceeding $500 billion or state-approved stablecoins. This move comes amid a broader trend of US states embracing digital assets, with Utah positioning itself at the forefront of institutional crypto adoption. While 12 other states have introduced similar bills, Utah’s initiative could be the first to gain full legislative approval. Source: Bitcoin Reserve Monitor The bill has also introduced zoning restrictions for crypto mining operations, reflecting a growing push for regulatory clarity in the sector. If the measure clears the House and Senate, it will go to Governor Spencer Cox for final approval, with a potential implementation date of May 7. Utah leads state-level push for crypto investment Utah’s legislative push to integrate digital assets into public funds reflects the growing recognition of cryptocurrencies as an investment class. The bill outlines strict custody requirements, mandating that any crypto investments be held through secure custodians, exchange-traded products, or staking mechanisms. This framework is designed to mitigate risks and ensure transparency in asset management. The state’s proposed policy also extends beyond investment. The legislation seeks to prevent state and local governments from restricting the acceptance of crypto for legal goods and services. This provision could accelerate cryptocurrency adoption in Utah’s economy by allowing businesses and institutions to accept digital assets without regulatory barriers. The move is part of a broader national conversation on the role of digital currencies in mainstream financial systems, with state-level initiatives driving momentum in the absence of clear federal guidelines. The bill’s rapid progression suggests strong institutional interest in digital asset adoption. Representative Jordan Teuscher, who introduced the legislation on Jan. 21, has been vocal about positioning Utah as a leader in blockchain innovation. Teuscher highlighted on X (formerly Twitter) that while Utah is the 11th state to propose such legislation, it could be the first to successfully enact it. Jordan Teuscher @jordanteuscher · Follow Thrilled to join with @Dennis_Porter_ to announce HB230 which will allow the state to invest in digital assets.

Utah continues to lead the nation in blockchain and digital innovation! 6:41 pm · 21 Jan 2025 410 Reply Copy link Read 50 replies Crypto adoption gains momentum across US states Utah’s legislative efforts align with a growing trend among US states seeking to integrate digital assets into public finance. Neighboring states such as Arizona and Wyoming have introduced similar initiatives, while South Dakota Representative Logan Manhart recently proposed creating a state Bitcoin reserve. Manhart’s push for a proactive government approach to Bitcoin investment underscores the shifting perception of crypto as a speculative asset to a strategic financial tool. The rising interest in crypto investments at the state level comes amid ongoing regulatory debates. The absence of clear federal guidelines on digital assets has led individual states to develop their own policies, resulting in a patchwork of regulations across the country. Utah’s approach, which includes strict custody rules and investment limits, could serve as a model for other states looking to navigate the evolving digital asset landscape. Governor Spencer Cox’s stance on blockchain innovation will play a crucial role in determining the bill’s future. Cox has previously expressed support for digital assets, having signed legislation in 2022 to establish a Blockchain and Digital Innovation Task Force. If he signs HB 230 into law, Utah could set a precedent for state-level crypto adoption, potentially influencing future legislative efforts across the US.

Czech National Bank Governor Aleš Michl is making a bold move, one no other Western central bank has taken so far: he wants to put Bitcoin ( BTC ) in the country’s reserves. If approved, up to 5% of the Czech National Bank’s €140 billion in reserves could be allocated to Bitcoin. Michl plans to present his proposal to the CNB board on Jan. 30, telling the Financial Times’ Raphael Minder that Bitcoin “seems good” for the “diversification” of the bank’s assets. He acknowledged the cryptocurrency’s volatility but pointed to its rising investor interest, especially after BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in 2024. “Of course, if you compare my position with other bankers, then I’m the one entering the jungle, or the pioneer. I used to run an investment fund, so I’m a typical investment banker I would say, I like profitability.” Aleš Michl You might also like: Jim Cramer calls to buy Bitcoin: BTC dip soon? Michl admitted Bitcoin’s value could go to zero but also sees its potential as CNB’s data suggests that if 5% of its reserves had been in Bitcoin over the past decade, annual returns would have risen by 3.5% points — but volatility would have doubled. If the plan moves forward, CNB could become the first Western central bank known to hold Bitcoin, joining El Salvador, which holds 6,048 BTC worth about $619 million, per data from Bitcoin Treasuries. The United States, in the meantime, is also evaluating the feasibility of the so-called “national digital assets stockpile.” While President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order to create a working group focused on cryptocurrencies, the order does not suggest the U.S. government should prioritize holding Bitcoin in its reserves.

A Utah House of Representatives committee has passed a bill that would allow the state to invest a portion of public funds in cryptocurrencies, and the bill will now head to the upper house for a vote. At this point, Utah has become the second US state after Arizona to approve the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill, moving one step closer to federal approval. The important development was shared by Satoshi Act Fund co-founder Dennis Porter. Porter stated in his post on his X account that Utah approved the bill that paves the way for buying BTC. The bill, which passed the committee, will now be presented to the state legislature, where it will be approved by the governor as the final authority. Once the governor signs the bill, it will become law. At this point, it is anticipated that a final approval in Utah will pave the way for other US states to do the same. If the governor approves, Utah will soon have a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and will serve as a reference point for other US states. The bill was introduced by Utah Representative Jordan Teuscher on January 21.

Despite the company’s upcoming temporary suspension of ADA transactions, the asset’s price remains rather unaffected, with mixed analyst predictions on its next move. The Network Upgrade The world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange announced that it will temporarily halt the deposits and withdrawals of tokens on the Cardano (ADA) network on January 29. The effort aims to support its network upgrade and hard fork “to ensure the best user experience.” Token trading will not be impacted , and the company will carry out all technical requirements for users. “ Deposits and withdrawals for token(s) on the aforementioned network will be reopened once the upgraded network is deemed to be stable,” the exchange revealed. Binance also added that no further announcement on the matter will be posted . This means clients should take any information they come across on the Internet with a grain of salt. The development in question refers to the so-called Plomin hard fork , which is the second part of the Chang upgrade to Cardano. It is named in honor of the late Matthew Plomin, a notable contributor to the Cardano community, and marks a pivotal transition towards full decentralized governance under the Voltaire era. The hard fork introduces a system where ADA holders can actively participate in the network’s decision-making processes and vote directly on protocol updates. ADA Price Outlook The price of ADA has remained rather steady following Binance’s announcement, trading at approximately $0.94 (per CoinGecko’s data). In the past several weeks, the asset experienced severe turbulence, jumping above $1.15 prior to Donald Trump’s inauguration and plummeting below $0.90 during the crypto market correction witnessed at the start of the business week. ADA Price, Source: CoinGecko Many analysts believe ADA could enter a substantial rally in the near future , citing various technical patterns and historical performance. The X user That Martini Guy , for instance, told his over 650,000 followers on X that the altcoin season might be just around the corner. This might result in a price explosion to as high as $3 for ADA ( based on what happened in 2021 ). On the other hand, some made bearish forecasts. Ali Martinez suggested that the upcoming FOMC meeting, scheduled for today (January 29), could trigger enhanced volatility in the crypto market. In addition, he claimed that the TD Sequential indicator had flashed the sell signal on the hourly chart for ADA and other leading digital assets.

White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar David Sacks now claims there is “substantial evidence” that DeepSeek “distilled” knowledge from OpenAI’s models—a process he likened to intellectual property theft. Distillation is the process of training a smaller AI model using the outputs of a more advanced one, allowing it to replicate similar capabilities with fewer resources. Sacks’ comments came a day after Trump downplayed concerns over DeepSeek’s impact, calling it both a “positive” and a “wake-up call” for Silicon Valley, even as its rapid ascent sent markets into turmoil. The launch of DeepSeek’s R1 model triggered a massive sell-off in tech stocks, wiping over $1 trillion from the Nasdaq Composite Index. NVIDIA suffered the worst single-day loss in U.S. history, plunging by $600 billion, while Alphabet and Microsoft also took major hits. You might also like: Bitcoin remains a ‘safe harbor’ as DeepSeek concerns linger, says deVere CEO DeepSeek violated terms of service Speaking to Fox News on Tuesday, Sacks suggested that DeepSeek used responses from OpenAI’s models to train its own, though he did not cite the source of this evidence. “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this,” he said, adding that U.S. companies would likely take steps to prevent such practices. Separately, OpenAI has also raised concerns over DeepSeek’s methods, telling the Financial Times that it has found signs of “distillation” in R1’s development. While distillation is a common technique in AI development, OpenAI’s terms explicitly prohibit using its outputs to train competing models. A person familiar with the company’s stance noted that the issue isn’t just about knowledge transfer but whether DeepSeek extracted model outputs to build a direct rival. Another unnamed source added that OpenAI and its partner Microsoft had already taken action last autumn, investigating accounts believed to be linked to DeepSeek that were accessing OpenAI’s API. After finding signs of distillation in violation of its terms of service, OpenAI blocked these accounts, cutting off their access. DeepSeek’s rise was nothing short of explosive as it quickly rose to the top of the App Store charts, outpacing major U.S. competitors like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude. What made it even more disruptive was its ability to match the performance of OpenAI’s O1-mini while operating on a fraction of the resources. According to DeepSeek, its R1 model was developed at a cost of just $5.6 million. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the achievement, calling DeepSeek’s work “invigorating” and praising its ability to deliver strong results on a budget. deepseek's r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price. we will obviously deliver much better models and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases. — Sam Altman (@sama) January 28, 2025 Crypto market reacts The market reaction to the development wasn’t limited to tech stocks. Fear rippled through the crypto sector, hammering AI-focused cryptocurrencies the most. Bitcoin briefly dipped below $100,000, and total liquidations soared by more than 850% on Jan. 27, wiping out nearly $1 billion in leveraged positions as crypto traders, already on edge over macroeconomic uncertainty , saw the DeepSeek fallout as another sign of volatility. Yet many crypto industry proponents suggest DeepSeek’s success could be bullish , especially for AI projects, due to its potential to lower the costs of running AI-powered blockchain applications.

The initiative, tagged “SHIB to the Moon,” eliminates spot trading fees for a range of tokens within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Promotion Overview As per CoinW’s official announcement , users will be able to trade specific Shiba Inu ecosystem tokens, including SHIB, Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), Doge Killer (LEASH) , and Shiba Inu Treat (TREAT) , without incurring any spot trading fees. The promotion also extends to Dogecoin (DOGE), reflecting the exchange’s commitment to supporting established and emerging meme-based cryptocurrencies. The zero-fee trading campaign will run from February 3, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. (UTC) to February 10, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. (UTC). Eligible trading pairs include SHIB/USDT, BONE/USDT, LEASH/USDT, TREAT/USDT, and DOGE/USDT. CoinW clarified that the fee exemption applies exclusively to spot trading for these pairs and does not cover other trading strategies, such as grid trading. In addition, all transactions made during this campaign will contribute to the respective assets’ trading volume, making them eligible for any additional benefits tied to trading activity. Objective of the Initiative The primary goal of the “SHIB to the Moon” campaign is to encourage greater adoption and trading activity for Shiba Inu-related tokens and Dogecoin. By waiving fees, CoinW aims to provide traders with a cost-effective opportunity to engage with these assets, potentially increasing their trading volumes. This approach is expected to attract new and existing users to participate actively in the market. The promotional titled, “SHIB to the Moon” reflects the enthusiasm within the cryptocurrency community, where such phrases are often used to express optimism about an asset’s potential for significant growth. This campaign aligns with efforts to strengthen community engagement and broaden the appeal of the ecosystem . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Context Despite the buzz surrounding this initiative, the campaign initially coincided with broader market volatility. At the time, the featured tokens experienced a price decline, including SHIB, BONE, LEASH, TREAT, and DOGE. This downturn in the cryptocurrency market coincides with a broader sell-off in both crypto and stock markets, attributed to the increased investment in artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, the increasing popularity of China-based AI startup DeepSeek has shifted investor focus, leading to a reallocation of capital from traditional and digital assets to AI-related opportunities. This campaign represents an opportunity for traders to engage with the ecosystem’s tokens and Dogecoin without incurring additional costs. By offering free trading for a limited time, CoinW aims to drive interest in these assets and support the broader adoption of meme-based cryptocurrencies. However, traders should remain mindful of the current market dynamics and assess risks carefully when participating in this initiative. This campaign highlights CoinW’s continued efforts to foster activity within the cryptocurrency sector while addressing the challenges of market fluctuations.

In a recent post on X , BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said that Bitcoin ( BTC ) price stands poised for a massive correction to the $70,000 to $75,000 range. Furthermore, he suggested that this dip could trigger a “mini financial crisis” and result in a renewed wave of money printing.

This has sparked a range of speculations from analysts about how much further Bitcoin price may fall. Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Capital, downplayed concerns over the current market volatility , describing the drop as a “short-term shock.” Van de Poppe cautioned against reacting hastily to short-term market fluctuations and pointed out that Bitcoin has reached what he termed an “exciting entry zone.” However, he acknowledged that if Bitcoin fails to maintain this support, a drop to the range lows is likely.

Musk Buys Solana (MUSKSOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Buys Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Buys Solana by entering its contract address (CA) – HZgXdFhQK1KTn8wM6hfRPtyGuKskETTzWM31qAdXJVRV – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|DOGE|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-29 09:11:00

Besides, the need for an SOL ETF is intensifying with Cboe re-filing the ETF on behalf of VanEck. With this, the price, which is under the bearish influence, is expected to reverse the trend as soon as the network’s traffic is about to escalate. Below are some popular Solana-based tokens that could mark fresh highs in the coming days. Uniswap (UNI) Uniswap is the most popular decentralised trading protocol and facilitates automated trading of the DeFi tokens without any need for any third party. The native token, UNI, which is used as a governance token and pay fees, has been performing exceptionally well. The price has been maintaining a consolidated ascending trend followed by a huge breakout. Presently, the UNI price is trying to reverse the bearish trend and once validated, a 50% upswing could be imminent. As seen in the above chart, the UNI price has been trading within a rising parallel channel for over a couple of years. After testing the resistance and support, the price is trying hard to validate a rebound from the average levels as RSI has also displayed a bearish divergence. Moreover, the 50/200 day weekly MA is healing towards the very first bullish crossover or the Golden Cross, which is expected to offer more bullish momentum that may push the price beyond $20. Jupiter (JUP) Jupiter, the most advanced swap aggregation engine on Solana, has raised many eyebrows in recent times. With a huge influx of liquidity, the token possessed massive volatility, causing a ‘v-shaped’ recovery in the JUP prices. Currently, the bulls appear to have drained out of strength as the volume has dropped and the token is experiencing significant upward pressure. However, the token has attempted to surpass $1.25 a couple of times and hence another attempt could clear these levels. The JUP price is constantly trying to achieve the local resistance at $1.3 while the bears are restricting the levels at $1.25. The RSI remains incremental while the CMF has regained levels above ‘0’. These indicators suggest the market strength is increasing, which could further keep up the momentum of the rally. Therefore, the Jupiter price is believed to rise and achieve beyond the interim highs shortly. Raydium (RAY) The Raydium price broke out of the consolidation and remained elevated throughout 2024, displaying huge volatility as the volume remained above the average range. Moreover, the token broke out of the pattern in the first few days of the year and the rise of the memecoins over the Solana chain also benefitted the token to a large extent. Currently, the price is about to end the correction after a breakout, which could pave the way for a strong upswing. The above chart suggests the RAY price broke out of the ascending triangle and marked interim highs above $8 and above to end its correction too. The RSI is displaying a bullish divergence, while the OBV, which is a volume-based indicator, has also shown a similar move. This suggests a rise in the rally’s strength as the buyers are more active than sellers, which could push the prices higher back above $8. Other than these tokens, memecoins like dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk (BONK), etc and a few more are also expected to thrive as the Solana network is expected to gain traction in the coming days.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|UNI|RAY|JUP|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-29 09:11:29

This milestone comes after a comprehensive development and testing phase, alongside ecosystem growth that has led to ION building a community of 40 million users. It also lays the foundation for ION's upcoming social media platform and decentralized application (dApp) builder. “This is a testament to the strength and conviction of our community,” said Alexandru Iulian Florea, Founder and CEO of Ice Open Network. “We initially aimed for 100 validators at launch – to see that number double underscores the trust and enthusiasm surrounding ION. It’s a resounding vote of confidence in our vision to redefine the Internet through decentralization.” ION’s unique architecture allows it to scale horizontally as its network participants increase, with the capacity to accommodate billions of users without compromising their privacy and security, nor the chain’s ability to process millions of transactions per second. Combining efficiency with a human-first approach, the ION framework is designed to decentralize and secure the core elements of digital interaction – user identity, content storage and delivery, and social engagement. The result is a versatile dApp infrastructure designed to offer practical utility and support the transition of Internet users to blockchain technology. Following the mainnet launch is the arrival of Online+ – an integrated social media dApp showcasing the blockchain’s capabilities that serves both as a hub for ION’s community, and a blueprint for dApp developers wishing to build on ION’s framework. Ice Open Network’s flagship no-code, drag-and-drop dApp-building tool, which will allow anyone, regardless of technical expertise, to create decentralized applications on ION from scratch, is next in line and due for release in 2025. The ION blockchain mainnet rollout began in November 2024, and is accompanied by the deployment of the ION Bridge, which enables the migration of the network’s native ICE token from Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to the ION blockchain. Currently, the network’s 200 validators have staked over 15% of the 6.8 billion ICE in circulation – a percentage set to increase as Online+ goes live. About Ice Open Network Ice Open Network (ION) is the blueprint for a new Internet rooted in privacy, data ownership, and user autonomy. Built on a high-performance Layer-1 blockchain with a focus on digital sovereignty, it is designed to provide decentralized applications (dApps) with practical, user-focused utility at a significant scale. Founded in 2022, ION serves a dApp ecosystem of over 40 million users. It is engineered to process millions of transactions per second and scale horizontally and infinitely as its network participants increase. Combining this efficiency with a comprehensive dApp toolkit purpose-built for intuitive, privacy-preserving user experiences, ION is on a mission to onboard the world to a new, decentralized Internet.

39646168,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=125101,1738142151,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,How Do Crypto Exchanges Make Money?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/how-do-crypto-exchanges-make-money/,"The cryptocurrency market reached an incredible value of $2.7 trillion in 2024, showing just how popular it has become. At the heart of this ecosystem are cryptocurrency exchanges, which manage trillions of dollars in trades each year. The top platforms generate massive revenues and handle millions of transactions daily. Take Coinbase , for example. In 2021, it reported $1.4 billion in sales, competing with major financial institutions. Binance, the largest exchange by trading volume, processes over $15 billion worth of trades every day, earning billions in revenue each year. So, how do crypto exchanges generate such significant income? Here’s a detailed look at their revenue strategies. What Are Crypto Exchanges? People can purchase, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies on cryptocurrency exchanges . In the bitcoin ecosystem, these online markets serve as a fundamental conduit, offering a variety of financial services, price discovery, and much-needed liquidity. Millions of consumers are served by exchanges, and daily global trading volumes frequently surpass $100 billion, which supports rapid growth in digital assets. Types of Crypto Exchanges Crypto exchanges are divided into two main flavors, each with different user needs. Centralized Exchanges The CEXs like Binance , Coinbase, and Kraken are dominating the market. They work like old financial institutions of the fiat world. They are highly liquid and come with advanced tools and security. But here, one needs to trust the exchange for their fund and data safety. Decentralized Exchanges Uniswap and PancakeSwap , among other decentralized exchanges, represent blockchain-based systems. They allowed for direct, peer-to-peer trading, allowing better autonomy and privacy. Currently, DEXes appeal to users fond of their privacy; however, they cannot outdo CEX in terms of liquidity and usability. Main Sources of Revenue Crypto exchanges use various means for revenues. Let’s look closer at their main streams: 1. Trading Fees Trading fees are the cornerstone of exchange revenue. Each transaction has a small fee, typically between 0.1% and 0.5%, depending on the platform and transaction volume. Fee Models : Maker-Taker Model : Makers (who add liquidity) often pay lower fees than takers (who remove liquidity). Flat Fee Model : Some exchanges charge a standard fee for all trades. Examples : Binance charges a 0.1% fee, with discounts for using its native token (BNB). Coinbase applies a tiered fee structure ranging from 0.04% to 0.60%. Kraken charges makers 0.16% and takers 0.26%. Trading fees can generate billions during high trading volumes. For example, Binance earns 90% of its revenue from transaction fees. 2. Withdrawal and Deposit Fees Exchanges often charge fees for withdrawals and, in some cases, deposits. Withdrawal Fees : Users pay fixed fees to withdraw cryptocurrencies, covering blockchain network costs. For instance, Binance charges 0.0005 BTC per Bitcoin withdrawal. Deposit Fees : Fiat deposits via bank transfers may be free, but credit or debit card deposits often incur fees. Coinbase charges up to 3.99% for card deposits. These fees, though smaller than trading fees, add up due to the sheer volume of transactions. 3. Listing Fees Crypto projects pay exchanges to list their tokens , gaining visibility with millions of users. Listing fees vary widely: Smaller exchanges may charge $10,000. Major platforms like Binance reportedly charge up to $1 million. Some exchanges waive listing fees for high-potential projects, focusing instead on the trading volume these tokens generate. 4. Margin and Leverage Fees Margin and leverage trading allows users to borrow funds to amplify trades. Exchanges profit from: Interest on Borrowed Funds : Kraken charges 0.02% every four hours for borrowed funds. Leverage Fees : Platforms like Binance offer up to 20x leverage, earning additional fees. These services are lucrative, often contributing over 20% of an exchange’s revenue. Additional Revenue Streams Crypto exchanges diversify their revenue through supplementary services. These include staking, lending, and token sales. 1. Staking Services Exchanges enable users to stake cryptocurrencies to earn rewards. In return, exchanges take a percentage of staking rewards. For example: Coinbase charges a 25% fee on staking rewards. Popular stakable assets include Ethereum and Solana. Staking benefits exchanges by encouraging users to keep assets on the platform, boosting retention and creating a steady income stream. 2. Lending Services Exchanges like BlockFi pool user deposits and lend them out at higher interest rates. Users earn interest on their lent assets, while exchanges profit from the spread between borrowing and lending rates. 3. Token Launch Platforms Many exchanges host Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) for new crypto projects. They earn a percentage of the tokens sold, benefiting from increased trading volume post-launch. How Revenue Streams Compare Revenue Stream Example Platforms Fee Range Profitability Trading Fees Binance, Coinbase 0.1% – 0.5% Extremely high Withdrawal Fees Binance, Kraken Varies by asset Moderate to high Listing Fees Binance, OKX $10,000 – $1 million High for large exchanges Leverage Fees Binance, Kraken Varies by asset High during market volatility Staking Services Coinbase, Binance ~25% of rewards Steady, long-term income Lending Services BlockFi, Binance Interest-based Moderate, depending on demand Crypto exchanges make money through diverse revenue streams, with trading fees being the most significant. Additional services like staking, lending, and token listings provide supplementary income. These platforms play a vital role in the crypto economy, driving innovation while capitalizing on market demand. Understanding their revenue models highlights the potential and profitability of the growing cryptocurrency industry.",Learn|Crypto exchanges,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BNB|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-01-29 09:15:51

39646899,https://coinpaper.com/7193/solana-etf-applications-refiled-as-crypto-regulation-takes-a-new-turn,1738143675,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Solana ETF Applications Refiled as Crypto Regulation Takes a New Turn,https://coinpaper.com/7193/solana-etf-applications-refiled-as-crypto-regulation-takes-a-new-turn,"This move was made due to the shifting regulatory landscape under the new acting SEC leadership. JPMorgan estimates a Solana ETF could attract $3–$6 billion in its first year. Meanwhile, Tuttle Capital recently filed for 10 leveraged crypto ETFs, including exposure to Trump-linked tokens. Analysts believe this was done to test the SEC's stance on certain ETFs. Bitwise also filed for a Dogecoin ETF, adding to a growing list of meme coin investment products awaiting SEC review. Solana ETF Filings Resubmitted Cboe BZX Exchange took a big step in the push for a spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States by resubmitting filings on behalf of four asset managers. The exchange refiled 19b-4 applications for spot Solana ETFs from Bitwise , VanEck , 21Shares , and Canary Capital on Jan. 28. By doing this, the exchange reignited the approval process with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after initial applications were reportedly rejected last year. With Mark Uyeda now serving as the SEC’s acting chair, the regulatory landscape shifted toward a much more crypto-friendly stance, which boosted optimism around the potential for approval. The refiled applications set the stage for Solana to become the third cryptocurrency available through a spot ETF in the US after the launch of similar investment products for Bitcoin and Ethereum last year. This renewed push happened during a time when asset managers are trying to introduce ETFs for other cryptos, including XRP, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. Analysts suggest that issuers are testing the regulatory waters under a Trump-era SEC. However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes Litecoin will be the next likely candidate for approval. According to reports, applications for Litecoin ETFs are already under active review by the SEC. The market potential for a spot Solana ETF is substantial, and financial services firm JPMorgan estimates that an approved product could attract between $3 billion and $6 billion in net assets in its first year. Balchunas described this projection as a “reasonable guess,” due to the growing demand for regulated crypto investment vehicles. VanEck was the first to file for a Solana ETF on June 27 last year, followed by 21Shares on June 28 and Canary Capital in late October. Bitwise and Grayscale later joined the race by submitting applications after Donald Trump’s election victory in November. So far, the SEC overturned several crypto-related policies that were enacted under Gary Gensler’s leadership. One of the major reversals was the cancellation of a rule that required financial firms holding cryptocurrency to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets. The SEC also announced that it created a dedicated crypto task force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, to develop a framework for digital assets. These changes signal a more favorable outlook for cryptocurrency regulation, and could potentially pave the way for Solana’s inclusion in spot crypto ETF industry. Tuttle Capital Files for 10 Leveraged Crypto ETFs Tuttle Capital also seems to be testing the new SEC leadership after filing for 10 leveraged ETFs. Among the proposed ETFs are funds offering two times leveraged long positions on tokens linked to Donald Trump and his wife Melania. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed out the significance of Tuttle’s filings, and shared that beyond the Official Trump (TRUMP) and Melania Meme (MELANIA) tokens, the proposed ETFs also include exposure to a range of other cryptocurrencies that currently lack ETF representation. These include XRP, Solana, Litecoin, Chainlink, Cardano, Polkadot, BNP, and the meme coin Bonk. According to Seyffart, these filings are a clear attempt by issuers to test the regulatory limits of the SEC’s new leadership. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noticed just how unusual Tuttle’s filings are, particularly the push for highly leveraged ETFs before standard one-to-one products have even been approved for some of the underlying assets. Leveraged ETFs track their assets at a 2:1 ratio or higher, which amplifies both potential gains and risks. Balchunas explained that because these filings fall under the Investment Company Act of 1940, they could theoretically begin trading as soon as April unless the SEC intervenes. The SEC’s response to these filings will provide crucial insight into its approach to cryptocurrency ETFs. However, Balchunas pointed out that recent applications for Dogecoin and Trump-linked tokens have been withdrawn. Bitwise Files for Dogecoin ETF Bitwise officially filed with the SEC to list an ETF tracking the price of Dogecoin, making it the latest push for meme coin investment products. The proposed Bitwise Dogecoin ETF will directly hold DOGE and closely follow its price movements, according to the firm’s S-1 filing with the SEC on Jan. 28. This filing was made after a previous filing on Jan. 22 to register a Dogecoin trust in Delaware, which, according to James Seyffart, now makes the move official with the regulator. The filing happened in the middle of a wave of meme coin-related ETF applications in the US. Other asset managers including Osprey Funds, REX Shares, and Tuttle Capital are also seeking approval for funds that track or offer leveraged exposure to tokens like Dogecoin and TRUMP. For Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF to move forward, the S-1 filing must be accompanied by a 19b-4 submission, which will formally initiate the SEC’s review process. Dogecoin grew a lot since its launch in 2015, and amassed an impressive market capitalization of close to $49 billion. As a result, DOGE ranks as the eighth-largest cryptocurrency, and the largest meme coin overall. Bitwise has selected Coinbase Custody as the proposed custodian for the ETF, which matches with the choice of other issuers offering crypto-based exchange-traded products. The filing did not reveal any details about the ETF’s proposed fee, ticker, or the stock exchange it will be listed on if it gets approved. This latest filing is also part of Bitwise’s plans to expand its crypto ETF offerings beyond just its existing spot Bitcoin and Ether products. The firm also recently submitted applications to list ETFs tracking Solana and XRP to broaden its scope in the crypto investment space. In November, Bitwise filed to list the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund on NYSE Arca. This is a product that is designed to track ten of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, including Cardano, Uniswap, and Polkadot. Dogecoin’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Despite Bitwise’s push for regulatory approval, Dogecoin’s price saw a slight 0.86% drop over the past 24 hours of trading. As a result, DOGE was trading hands at $0.3316 at press time. DOGE was also down by more than 9% on its weekly time frame. Overall, most people expect that the outcome of the SEC’s review of the Dogecoin ETF will provide a more clear picture into the regulator’s new stance on meme coin-based investment products in the US.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|DOGE|SOL|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-29 09:41:15

What Time Will It Be Announced? Here Are the Expectations and Everything You Need to ...,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-first-fed-interest-rate-decision-of-2025-is-expected-in-bitcoin-today-what-time-will-it-be-announced-here-are-the-expectations-and-everything-you-need-to-know/,"While volatility has been effective in the Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency markets in recent days, today all eyes are on the FED's January interest rate decision. As is known, the FED made its first interest rate cut in September and made an aggressive start to the discount cycle with a 50 basis point cut decision. The FED also made a 25 basis point rate cut in November and December. After these interest rate cuts, dollar, gold, stock market and cryptocurrency investors closely follow the January decision, which is the first interest rate decision of 2025, while the questions of whether the FED will continue to cut interest rates and how much of a cut it will make continue to be important for investors. Related News: BREAKING: The Anticipated Moment Has Arrived! FED Announced Interest Rate Decision! Here is Bitcoin's First Reaction When Will the January FED Interest Rate Decision Be Announced? The FED will announce its January interest rate decision on January 29, 2025 at 22:00 Turkish time. Following the decision, FED Chairman Jerome Powell will make oral statements at 22:30. In Which Direction Are Expectations Focused? The general expectation for the FED interest rate decision, which is eagerly awaited by global markets, is that the FED will leave the policy rate unchanged in January. According to FED Watch, the probability of interest rates remaining unchanged in January is priced in at 99.5%. At this point, it is almost certain that the FED will keep interest rates constant this month, but it is estimated that it will reduce rates by 25 basis points in June. Analysts stated that the FED is expected to cut interest rates three times this year, and that the policy text and Powell's verbal guidance are expected to provide clues about future monetary policy. Analysts also added that despite recent statements from FED officials indicating that the fight against inflation will continue for a long time, expectations in the markets for an interest rate cut during the year are gaining strength. LHMeyer analysts argued that while the labor market appears to be stabilizing, that doesn't mean the Fed's monetary policy stance isn't having a negative impact on the economy. “We expect the policy rate to remain above 4% by mid-2025 and to be more clearly restrictive. We also expect tariffs to put upward pressure on prices, contributing to 2.5% inflation in 2025, but with a mild enough impact that it will not prevent the Fed from cutting rates,” the analysts said. Markets are likely to react moderately positively to the Fed's interest rate decision, said François Rimeu, senior market strategist at Crédit Mutuel Asset Management. “The focus of markets this week will likely remain on developments from the Trump administration, overshadowing the upcoming Federal Reserve and European Central Bank meetings where no major surprises are expected,” said Danske Bank analyst Kirstine Kundby-Nielsen. *This is not investment advice.

While seasoned favorites like Floki Inu and Peanut the Squirrel continue to dominate the meme coin market, a new contender has emerged— Arctic Pablo (APC). This fresh and innovative project promises something new for investors, with a unique presale approach that has already caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts. Arctic Pablo’s presale is breaking boundaries by incorporating adventurous narratives and offering early-stage investment rewards that are drawing significant interest. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo, Floki Inu, and Peanut the Squirrel, diving into what makes each of these projects worth watching. However, all eyes are on Arctic Pablo right now, and it’s quickly becoming one of the top meme coin presales to buy now for 2025. Let’s explore why it stands out in this crowded market. Arctic Pablo: An Adventure-Fueled Meme Coin With High Returns Arctic Pablo (APC) is a meme coin like no other. It’s built around the idea of adventure and exploration, with each phase of its presale tied to a different mythical location. From undiscovered ice caves to ancient, hidden cities, every stage in the presale tells a different story, keeping the narrative fresh and exciting. This unique theme doesn’t just add to the project’s charm; it also sparks curiosity and interest among investors, making Arctic Pablo one of the top meme coin presales to buy now . But the excitement doesn’t end with its theme. Arctic Pablo is offering several incentives that set it apart. Investors can stake their tokens during the presale and earn a rewarding 66% APY, providing passive income potential alongside their investment. For those who love to spread the word, Arctic Pablo’s referral program allows users to earn rewards by introducing the project to others. Add to this the chance to participate in community competitions to win APC tokens or even USD, and Arctic Pablo becomes an incredibly attractive opportunity. Investors are rushing in to take advantage of this project’s unique perks, all while the coin’s price remains incredibly low at just $0.000043. Don’t Miss Out: Arctic Pablo’s Presale at Glacier Grove Right now, Arctic Pablo is in the Glacier Grove phase of its presale, and the buzz is palpable. With over $550,000 raised so far, this project is moving quickly. The current price is a steal at $0.000043 per APC , but that won’t last for long. As the presale progresses, the price will rise, with the final presale price set at $0.0008 and the launch price expected to skyrocket to $0.008. This creates a massive opportunity for early investors, who could see an ROI potential of over 18,546% as the project reaches its final stages. Arctic Pablo’s presale approach is unlike any other. The project doesn’t follow traditional stages; instead, it takes investors on a journey to different “locations,” each with its own story and price increase. The excitement is growing as the Glacier Grove phase continues, following the rapid success of the El-Dorado stage, which was completed in under four days. Early supporters are seeing massive potential, and now is the time to get in before the price increases again. As the presale enters new locations, the value of APC tokens is expected to rise, so don’t miss the chance to secure tokens at this low entry price. Floki Inu: Real-World Utility Fuels Growth According to current technical indicators, FLOKI may face some minor downward pressure in the short term. However, if the price can break through the $0.000143 resistance level with a boost in trading volume, it could indicate a potential reversal towards the $0.000150 mark. On the other hand, if the price fails to maintain support at $0.000135, further declines could be on the horizon. Experts have differing views on FLOKI’s price movements. Some predict that over the next five days, FLOKI could reach a high of $0.00018 by January 27, 2025, marking a potential gain of about 28% from its current value. Others, despite forecasting some volatility throughout the year, anticipate that FLOKI will experience steady growth, with a projected price of around $0.000311 by December 2025. Peanut the Squirrel: A Unique Newcomer with Big Ambitions Peanut the Squirrel is making waves as a rising star in the meme coin universe. Recently, the project has expanded its focus, with several exciting new updates announced, including the integration of the coin into the NFT space. This new partnership will allow holders of Peanut the Squirrel to access exclusive rewards and perks, opening up new opportunities for those invested in the project. As the project gains momentum, its community continues to grow, and more investors are becoming intrigued by its potential. With its distinctive approach and exciting plans for the future, Peanut the Squirrel is quickly becoming a favorite in the meme coin market, earning a place among the top meme coin presales to buy now. Conclusion: Arctic Pablo Shines as the Best New Meme Coin to Buy Now As meme coins continue to capture the crypto world’s imagination, Arctic Pablo stands out as one of the top meme coin presales to buy now. With its innovative presale structure, high staking rewards, and referral incentives, it offers incredible potential for early investors. While Floki Inu and Peanut the Squirrel have their own merits, it’s Arctic Pablo’s exciting theme and massive ROI potential that set it apart from the rest. If you’re looking for an investment in the meme coin space, don’t miss out on Arctic Pablo’s presale. Get in early and be part of the adventure that’s about to take the crypto world by storm.

This means that there is no fundamental value behind these projects. Shiba Inu is the poster child of this trend with massive viral appeal. However, traders who were initially backing SHIB are now considering DTX Exchange , another viral altcoin that could be set to deliver up to 10,000% gains. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Recovers After Bearish Month January has been extremely bullish for Shiba Inu so far. We’ve seen a drop of over 14.4% in the past 30 days, with SHIB holders becoming incredibly skeptical of their meme investments. On the more short-term horizon, Shiba Inu is facing a volume drop of over 30% in the past 24 hours with daily trading volumes dropping to $351.2 Million. Experts have associated this volatility in Shiba Inu (SHIB) price with a shift in macro conditions in global financial markets. The release of Chinese AI model R1 has rattled the equities market and the resulting impacts are showing in the crypto space as well. Additionally, another key reason could be the broader shift away from speculative assets into projects with more fundamental features. Solana Back In the Spotlight With Surging Volumes The past month has been ideal for Solana as the Layer-1 blockchain has mounted an impressive recovery. After dropping below $200, Solana price is now back above $220. This recovery has been driven by the launch of the Trump token. The resulting fees and ecosystem impacts have catapulted SOL back into the spotlight. Additionally, another factor increasing demand for Solana is the recovery of memecoins. Projects like Dogwifhat and BONK are starting to recover after local slumps, signaling a comeback in Solana price this month. With a daily increase of 5.65%, SOL is currently trading at $236.12. With this current increase, traders are starting to cash this increase in Solana price. Viral platform DTX Exchange has been a key recipient of these inflows. DTX Exchange Enters Final Stage With $13,000,000 Milestone Viral platform DTX Exchange (DTX) has been at the center of attention in the crypto world after introducing a groundbreaking proposition. Traders can use the platform to trade stocks, cryptos, and forex assets under a single application. The secure platform has built a community of over 500,000 traders and is continuing to sell out through its final presale round. Instead of going the VC-backed route, DTX Exchange launched the presale to allow retail traders to become partners in the launch. Early backers have already enjoyed gains of over 600%, but experts think that the juggernaut is just getting started. At $0.16, tokens are rapidly selling out as traders rush to join the $100,000 USDT giveaway to celebrate the upcoming listing. However, over 42.2% of the tokens are sold already. This means that you should rush to join the presale for listing gains of up to 100x. Additionally, with the increase in Solana price, cascading effects could be felt on emerging platforms like DTX in the coming days.

Shiba Inu exemplifies this trend with its widespread popularity. However, traders who initially supported SHIB are now looking at DTX Exchange , another trendy altcoin that could potentially yield up to 10,000% returns. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Bounces Back After a Rough Month January has been quite promising for Shiba Inu so far. Despite a more than 14.4% decline over the past month, SHIB holders are questioning their meme-based investments. In the short term, Shiba Inu is experiencing a significant drop in trading volume, down by over 30% in the last day, with daily transactions falling to $351.2 million. Experts link this volatility in Shiba Inu's (SHIB) price to changes in macroeconomic conditions affecting global financial markets. The introduction of China's AI model R1 has unsettled the stock market, and these effects are also visible in the cryptocurrency sector. Furthermore, there is a noticeable shift from speculative ventures towards projects with more substantial foundations. Solana Gains Attention Again with Rising Volumes Solana has had a remarkable month as the Layer-1 blockchain stages a strong comeback. After dipping below $200, Solana's price has climbed back above $220. This recovery has been fueled by the launch of the Trump token, which has generated significant fees and positively impacted the Solana ecosystem, bringing SOL back into focus. Another driving factor for Solana's rising demand is the revival of memecoins. Projects like Dogwifhat and BONK are bouncing back from recent declines, indicating a resurgence in Solana's price this month. With a daily gain of 5.65%, SOL is currently valued at $236.12. With the current increase, traders are capitalizing on Solana's price surge. The viral platform DTX Exchange has been a major beneficiary of these inflows. DTX Exchange Reaches $13,000,000 Milestone as It Nears Completion The viral platform DTX Exchange (DTX) has captivated the crypto community with its innovative offer. The platform allows traders to handle stocks, cryptocurrencies, and forex assets all in one application. With a secure environment, it has attracted a community of over 500,000 traders and is close to selling out its final presale round. Instead of seeking venture capital funding, DTX Exchange opted for a presale that lets retail traders become partners in its launch. Early supporters have already seen returns exceeding 600%, but experts believe this is just the beginning for the platform. Priced at $0.16, tokens are selling quickly as traders aim to participate in the $100,000 USDT giveaway in anticipation of the upcoming listing. However, more than 42.2% of the tokens are already sold. This means you should act fast to participate in the presale and potentially see up to 100x returns upon listing.

Jeremy Hogan said that the case is still present on the actual appellate court website. It is unlikely for Acting Chair Mark Uyeda to dismiss the Ripple lawsuit in the absence of Chair Paul Atkins. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken down its lawsuit against the American fintech firm Ripple from its website. This move is stirring up a debate in the crypto community about the agency’s future plans. Some think this could mean a potential victory for the firm; others aren’t so sure. Jeremy Hogan, a partner at Hogan and Hogan law firm, was asked by a market participant about the missing lawsuit from the SEC website. Hogan first replied that the lawsuit could’ve been moved to a section for “cases on appeal” from the litigation section. But, he later corrected his statement, since the website doesn’t have a section for appeals. He added that the legal action is still present on the actual appellate court website with no new filings.

During the session, he discussed a range of topics, including the potential role of XRP in the future of the U.S. economy. Garlinghouse revealed that he had discussed with Donald Trump the idea of XRP becoming part of the U.S. Strategic Reserve. He also stressed the need for a diversified reserve, dismissing claims that he was trying to undermine Bitcoin. He explained, “The opportunities are so large, there will be many winners,” suggesting a basket of cryptocurrencies rather than just one. This view doesn’t sit well with Bitcoin maximalists, who believe Bitcoin should dominate. Amid the ongoing XRP vs. Bitcoin debate, entrepreneur Grant Cardone weighed in, saying comparing Bitcoin to XRP is like comparing Godzilla to a lap dog. He argued that XRP is a “binary bet” and would require federal inclusion, while Bitcoin, on the other hand, is an “asymmetric long-duration investment” that doesn’t need to be part of a federal reserve. Comparing BTC to XRP is like comparing Godzilla to a lap dog! XRP is a Binary bet, requiring Federal stockpile Inclusion! BTC: Asymmetric Long Duration Investment! Federal stockpile inclusion not required! Asymmetric and Binary, are not the same thing. Stop listening to… — Gary Cardone (@GaryCardone) January 29, 2025 In response to these views, pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan pointed out the contradiction in the argument. He wrote on X (Formerly Twitter), “Let me get this right.

However while Ethereum's price was not affected that much, the presale of this ERC-20 token saw a 500% rally. Read on to find out what is in store for Ethereum and why this AI ERC-20 token will outperform in 2025. Official Trump Coin (TRUMP): Hype or a Long-Term Investment? The recent launch of the Official Trump Coin (TRUMP) has sparked significant interest among traders. Launched amid a surge in politically-themed cryptocurrencies, Trump coin saw a meteoric rise to an all-time high of $75.35 before correcting to its current price of $29. Speculation and hype have fueled its initial growth, especially with Trump’s political influence, but questions remain about its long-term sustainability. With a market cap of almost $6 billion and high volatility, Trump coin is seen by many as a short-term speculative play rather than a solid long-term investment. While it has provided early adopters with impressive gains, seasoned investors are aware of its dependence on political events and media coverage. In contrast, this AI altcoin offers strong fundamentals, leveraging AI and blockchain to create a sustainable trading platform with real-world utility. Ethereum (ETH): A Stable Giant With Room to Grow Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently trading at $3,180, reflecting a modest 2% increase since yesterday. Despite its recent gains, Ethereum remains sluggish, seeing quite high volatility over the course of last year. Over the past month, Ethereum’s price has seen several fluctuations, struggling to remain above $3500. ETH is especially strong in serving as the tent pole of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts. Ethereum's reliable and decentralized infrastructure enabled the blooming of projects, including NFTs, DeFi protocols, and metaverse applications. The scalability concerns are addressed with its ongoing upgrades, such as Ethereum 2.0 indicates the scale of its dominance to grow even more. However, despite Ethereum's utility, adoption and the network’s ongoing upgrades, its large market capitalization of $385 billion limits its potential for rapid exponential growth. With new projects emerging like the ERC-20 AI altcoin, it is hard to choose Ethereum for short term gains. IntelMarkets (INTL): 500% Rally Is Just The Beginning IntelMarkets is a relatively new project that recently saw a 500% rally. INTL offers a feature packed platform that combines AI, DeFi and blockchain technology. Unlike speculative tokens such as $TRUMP, or well established cryptos such Ethereum, IntelMarkets holds untapped potential. INTL is purpose-built to transform the crypto trading market with its AI-powered trading ecosystem. Why IntelMarkets Stands Out AI-Powered Trading: IntelMarkets self-learning trading bots execute trades in real-time on assets in multiple asset classes. With this, users get an edge and maximize profits. Dual-Chain Architecture: INTL operates on both Ethereum and Solana blockchains, which offers scalability while promoting efficiency. Unmatched Leverage: INTL offers up to 1,000x leverage and multiple pairs for retail and institutional traders. Low Market Entry: IntelMarkets presents a low entry barrier as its current pricing in the 9th ICO stage is just $0.082. It has so far raised more than $7.7 million, and confidence in its vision remains high. INTL is tipped to see an 80x rally on Tier-1 exchanges, which could make it one of the most promising ERC-20 tokens to watch in 2025. Furthermore, this project is backed by a team of OpenAI and MIT engineers who have pioneered its cutting-edge tech. Conclusion While Trump Coin thrives on short-term hype and Ethereum offers reliability, IntelMarkets (INTL) offers unparalleled potential. With its AI-driven approach, low entry price, and expert endorsements, IntelMarkets has positioned itself as a leader in the next wave of DeFi projects.

Although Ethereum's value remained relatively stable, the presale of this ERC-20 token experienced a remarkable 500% increase. Continue reading to discover what's ahead for Ethereum and why this AI ERC-20 token is predicted to excel in 2025. Official Trump Coin (TRUMP): Temporary Hype or Lasting Investment? The introduction of the Official Trump Coin (TRUMP) has captured considerable attention from traders. Launched during a wave of politically-themed cryptocurrencies, Trump coin soared to an unprecedented high of $75.35 before settling at its present value of $29. Its initial rise was driven by speculation and excitement, particularly due to Trump’s political clout, yet doubts linger about its long-term viability. With a market cap nearing $6 billion and significant volatility, Trump coin is often viewed as a short-term speculative asset rather than a robust long-term investment. Despite substantial gains for early investors, experienced traders recognize its reliance on political developments and media buzz. In contrast, this AI altcoin is built on strong fundamentals, utilizing AI and blockchain to establish a sustainable trading ecosystem with genuine utility. Ethereum (ETH): A Reliable Giant With Potential for Expansion Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is currently valued at $3,180, marking a slight 2% uptick since yesterday. Even with these recent gains, Ethereum has been somewhat sluggish, experiencing high volatility over the past year. Throughout the last month, Ethereum’s price has oscillated, struggling to maintain a level above $3500. ETH excels as a cornerstone for decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts. Its dependable and decentralized framework has fostered an array of initiatives, including NFTs, DeFi protocols, and metaverse projects. The ongoing upgrades, like Ethereum 2.0, address scalability issues, suggesting further growth in its dominance. However, despite Ethereum's extensive utility and the network’s ongoing enhancements, its large market cap of $385 billion restricts its potential for rapid exponential growth. With emerging projects such as the ERC-20 AI altcoin, Ethereum may not be the best choice for short-term profits. IntelMarkets (INTL): 500% Surge Marks Just the Start IntelMarkets is a relatively new initiative that has recently experienced a 500% surge. INTL provides a comprehensive platform that integrates AI, DeFi, and blockchain technology. Unlike speculative tokens such as $TRUMP, or established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, IntelMarkets presents untapped potential. INTL is designed to revolutionize the crypto trading landscape with its AI-driven trading ecosystem. Why IntelMarkets Is Unique AI-Powered Trading: IntelMarkets deploys self-learning trading bots that execute trades in real-time across diverse asset classes. This gives users an advantage and maximizes their profits. Dual-Chain Architecture: INTL operates on both the Ethereum and Solana blockchains, offering scalability and enhancing efficiency. Unmatched Leverage: INTL provides up to 1,000x leverage and multiple pairs for both retail and institutional traders. Low Market Entry: IntelMarkets offers a low entry barrier, with its current pricing during the 9th ICO stage at just $0.082. It has already raised over $7.7 million, with continued confidence in its vision. INTL is projected to achieve an 80x surge on Tier-1 exchanges, potentially making it one of the most promising ERC-20 tokens to watch in 2025. Moreover, the project is backed by a team of OpenAI and MIT engineers who have pioneered its cutting-edge technology. Conclusion While Trump Coin thrives on short-term excitement and Ethereum offers stability, IntelMarkets (INTL) presents unparalleled potential. With its AI-driven strategy, affordable entry price, and expert endorsements, IntelMarkets positions itself as a frontrunner in the next wave of DeFi projects.

Ripple follows the Ethereum (ETH) trajectory and is expected to keep ascending. A pullback would be possible if Ethereum (ETH) gave way to bearish pressure. It is in recovery, and market sentiment is relatively positive around Ethereum and Ripple. The XRP price has shown resilience, and its investors have stayed calm in the face of market volatility. Most Ripple investors have held on to their tokens because the projected XRP price for 2025 is 400% of the current price. Another token predicted to give such massive returns this year is DTX, which is powered by the DTX Exchange , a hybrid trading platform. XRP Price to Surge Ahead Despite broader negative sentiments in the crypto market, Ripple is standing steady. This can be attributed to its fundamentals and its remittance-based use cases. There is an expectation of a Ripple ETF being approved, which could lead to bullish momentum for the XRP price. Currently, the XRP price is $3.12, and it could quickly rally to meet resistance at $3.55. There is a strong chance for a cross over to bullish dominance in Q1. Ripple has announced that it has obtained Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) in New York and Texas. The two key licenses will expand its reach and help more people use its remittance services. New York and Texas have high regulatory standards and a rigorous approval process. With more retail adoption of Ripple’s cross-border payment services in the US, the XRP price should reflect the same. The Ripple portfolio has more than 60 licenses worldwide, and its compliance-first payment solutions are gaining traction in a rapidly evolving payments landscape. The remittance-based XRP token is backed by an incredible real-world use case, which is why the XRP price is not always prey to speculation. Ethereum (ETH) Price Forecast Chinese AI startup DeepSeek went live on Friday, affecting the crypto markets greatly. ETH price was down 8%, but whales and derivatives traders remain positive and are buying the dip. Some analysts say the Ethereum (ETH) price could see a 25% decline if the selling activity continues. 120,000 ETH have been scooped up at the end of last week, meaning whales are buying it despite the price decline. Traders are not closing positions due to panic and are betting on a quick price recovery. If Ethereum sustains a high volume below $3,000, the price could decline by 25%, but if it finds support at $2,817, such a decline could be prevented. DTX Exchange to Surge Higher There is a growing emphasis on utility-driven crypto tokens, and DTX Exchange represents the future of such coins. DTX Exchange will address the inefficiencies in the current trading models where centralized and decentralized trade of assets exists independently. On DTX Exchange, users can trade fiat assets and crypto derivatives together. The DTX token is at the center of this revolutionary trading platform and is currently priced at $0.16. That is a 700% increase from its initial price of $0.02, and there it will be listed at $0.2. DTX is becoming a highly sought-after asset, and its presale has already gained $13M in funding; forecasts predict a 7,200% gain after launch as demand for its innovative hybrid trading solution will increase.

Ripple is mirroring Ethereum (ETH) and is forecasted to continue its upward trend. However, if Ethereum (ETH) succumbs to bearish forces, a pullback could occur. Ethereum is on the mend, and the overall market sentiment is fairly optimistic for both Ethereum and Ripple. XRP has demonstrated stability, with investors remaining composed despite market fluctuations. The majority of Ripple holders have kept their tokens, banking on a projected 400% increase in XRP's price by 2025. Another token expected to deliver significant returns this year is DTX, driven by the DTX Exchange , a hybrid trading platform. XRP Price Poised for Growth Ripple maintains its ground despite widespread negative sentiment in the crypto market. This stability is due to its strong fundamentals and remittance-focused applications. Anticipation of a Ripple ETF approval could trigger bullish momentum for XRP. Currently priced at $3.12, XRP might soon surge to encounter resistance at $3.55, with a solid possibility of shifting to bullish dominance in the first quarter. Ripple has announced securing Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) in New York and Texas. These crucial licenses will broaden its reach and facilitate wider use of its remittance services. Both states are known for their stringent regulatory standards and meticulous approval processes. As Ripple’s cross-border payment services gain more retail adoption in the US, the XRP price is expected to reflect this growth. With over 60 licenses globally, Ripple’s compliance-oriented payment solutions are gaining momentum in the swiftly changing payments industry. The remittance-focused XRP token is underpinned by a strong real-world application, which helps insulate its price from mere speculation. Ethereum (ETH) Price Outlook The launch of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek on Friday had a significant impact on the crypto markets. ETH saw an 8% drop, yet whales and derivatives traders remain optimistic, continuing to purchase during the dip. Analysts suggest that if the selling pressure persists, Ethereum (ETH) could face a 25% price drop. Last week concluded with the acquisition of 120,000 ETH, indicating that whales are still buying despite the price drop. Traders are refraining from closing positions out of fear and instead are wagering on a swift price rebound. If Ethereum maintains substantial volume below $3,000, a 25% price drop is possible, but finding support at $2,817 could prevent such a decline. DTX Exchange on the Rise The importance of utility-focused crypto tokens is growing, and DTX Exchange is at the forefront of this trend. DTX Exchange aims to resolve inefficiencies in existing trading models where centralized and decentralized asset trading operate separately. DTX Exchange allows users to trade fiat assets alongside crypto derivatives. Central to this groundbreaking trading platform is the DTX token, currently priced at $0.16, representing a 700% rise from its initial $0.02 price, with an expected listing at $0.2. DTX is becoming a highly desirable asset, having already raised $13M in its presale; projections indicate a 7,200% gain post-launch as demand for its innovative hybrid trading solution grows.

Since then, prices have dropped below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the run that started in August and touching highs about 48 cents in December before dropping back. A golden rule of technical analysis says that for a market to maintain its current trend, it must hold above that level. If it fails to do so, the trend is said to have ended. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is printing deeper bars below the zero line, another indication of strengthening bearish momentum. Five- and 10-day simple moving averages trend south, hinting at a bearish bias. Support is seen at around 26 cents, the low printed on Dec. 20 followed by 23.4 cents, which marks the 61.8% retracement of the August-December rally. DOGE would need to recover to the uptrend line from December lows to invalidate the bearish outlook.",Markets|Dogecoin|Markets|Technical Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|DOGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-29 10:00:49

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana trading volume surges, but Jupiter and DTX Exchange dominate weekly gainers. DTX’s viral presale, now in its final round, raises over $13m. Table of Contents Solana price struggles below key resistance Jupiter: Bullish momentum builds as traders eye new highs DTX Exchange: Final presale round draws massive attention Market outlook While Solana records an impressive surge in trading volume, this week’s real winners are Jupiter (JUP) and DTX Exchange (DTX), two tokens that are capturing investor interest with massive price movements and strong presale momentum. DTX Exchange, in particular, is making waves as it crosses the $13 million milestone in its final presale round, positioning itself as a key contender in the multi-asset trading space. With both tokens outperforming Solana’s weekly gains, all eyes are on these rising stars as they reshape the altcoin narrative. Solana price struggles below key resistance Solana’s price action remains under pressure after its recent peak of $285 on January 19. Following a 12% dip, the price now hovers around $238.41, testing support near $232. A break below this level could trigger further downside, with analysts eyeing $216.90 as a critical Fibonacci retracement zone. Despite the correction, Solana’s technical indicators suggest a potential reversal. The RSI on the 4-hour chart signals oversold conditions, and a break above the $270 resistance could reignite bullish momentum, possibly driving SOL back toward the $300 mark. Adding to the bullish outlook is the ongoing speculation surrounding a Solana ETF approval, which could serve as a major catalyst for price recovery. However, traders remain cautious, keeping an eye on key support levels amid the volatile market. Jupiter: Bullish momentum builds as traders eye new highs Jupiter has become one of the top-performing tokens this week, fueled by significant ecosystem developments and strategic moves. The platform recently announced a $50 million JUP buyback, a 3 billion token burn, and the acquisition of key Solana ecosystem players like Moonshot and SonarWatch. These moves have sparked a 25% price surge, propelling JUP toward the crucial $1.25 resistance level. A breakout above this level could pave the way for a rally toward its all-time high of $1.84. Technical indicators support the bullish outlook, with both the RSI and MACD signaling upward momentum. Analysts predict that if JUP clears its resistance zone, it could target a price of $2.13, representing a potential 75% gain from current levels.

Currently in its final presale round, DTX has raised over $13 million, with each token priced at $0.16. Analysts project a 440% gain upon listing, sparking a sense of excitement among investors eager to secure their share before the platform’s official launch. Unlike speculative assets, DTX stands out for its solid utility and long-term growth potential, positioning it as a formidable contender in the crypto space. Market outlook As Solana consolidates near key resistance levels, the market remains divided between speculative momentum and the rising appeal of utility-driven projects. Solana’s performance continues to influence overall market sentiment, but the spotlight is shifting toward altcoins like Jupiter and DTX Exchange, which are reshaping narratives through innovation and ecosystem development. With DTX in its final presale round, investors should keep a close eye on its upcoming launch, which could redefine expectations for utility-focused blockchain projects.

Experts Say This New DeFi Crypto Could Soar 50X Post-Launch,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/when-is-the-next-solana-sol-and-cardano-ada-pump-experts-say-this-new-defi-crypto-could-soar-50x-post-launch,"The crypto market plunged following a supposed black swan event: the launch of DeepSeek, an AI model similar to ChatGPT 4.0 but cheaper, faster and smarter. Further contributing to the decline is the uncertainty around the upcoming FOMC. However, Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) are gradually regaining traction and are set for a big leap. At the same time, DTX Exchange (DTX) , an up-and-coming cryptocurrency, is poised for an explosive debut. Its unique narrative—a blend of DeFi and TradFi—paints a bullish picture and sets the stage for massive growth. Tipped for a 50x upswing after Tier-1 exchange listings, it is a new DeFi project to watch—a promising wave not to miss. DTX Exchange (DTX): Primed for a Big Leap Post-Launch DTX Exchange (DTX) , an emerging cryptocurrency, is currently among the most sought-after tokens. The top ICO entered its final presale stage in the last few days, with its launch among the most anticipated in Q1. Surpassing $13.1 million in early funding, it might be the best presale to invest in this year. Moreover, unlike most utility tokens, DTX isn’t backed by venture capital firms holding the majority of the supply—no fear of dumping on retailers. Further, there will be no future token unlocks, which will dilute the value of tokens. Instead, the presale is democratized, currently in the eighth and final round at $0.16 per token. Given its huge growth prospects post-launch—a projected 50x jump in value—it is arguably the best new crypto to invest in. Beyond the gains and potential outperformance of top crypto coins like Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), it also boasts solid fundamentals. It will be the first crypto-native platform to offer stocks, ETFs, bonds and over 100,000 currency pairs, blending DeFi and TradFi and aiming to reshape the $10 billion global trading landscape. Solana (SOL): Bounce Anticipated Solana (SOL), a top 5 cryptocurrency, took a big hit earlier this week. It tumbled 5% on the weekly chart, changing hands above $230. Despite the initial scare, it has been gathering traction, with the coming days promising a bullish reversal. The Solana price trading above the 20-EMA ($231) and 20-SMA ($227) also hints at a bounce, putting it on the list of altcoins to watch. Karthick_78, a top analyst, expects SOL to hit $240 by the month's end. Meanwhile, GoldenAgeFin, another leading expert, has $900 as their Solana (SOL) price prediction for this bull run. However, considering previous rallies and SOL’s large market cap, it can only witness so much growth. This contributes to the rising interest in new altcoins like DTX Exchange (DTX). Cardano (ADA): Technical Indicators Suggest an Upswing Cardano (ADA) wasn’t spared by the bears either as it nosedived, trading alongside the broader crypto market. Despite this, key technical indicators like the 100-EMA and 100-SMA signal a possible upswing in the coming days. It trades below $1, with a breakout on the horizon. Moreover, Klenekcoinada, a top analyst, believes Cardano (ADA) will reach $12 this cycle. This bullish sentiment is echoed by CryptoNabs, another analyst on X, having a conservative target of $5 to $7 for ADA. With a big leap expected soon, ADA is among the best cryptos to invest in—its current low price makes it even more appealing. However, for a better ROI, DTX might offer a good shot at significant gains given its projected 50x rally. DTX Exchange (DTX): Can it Outperform Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA)? As a new and emerging cryptocurrency with plenty of room for growth, DTX Exchange (DTX) might be a better bet than Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). It has a small market cap and higher growth prospects than most top altcoins. Moreover, it stands at the crossroads between DeFi and TradFi, painting a bullish picture.

Adding to the market's volatility is the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming FOMC meeting. Despite these challenges, Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) are slowly bouncing back and are on the brink of a significant upward move. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange (DTX) , a promising new cryptocurrency, is set for a remarkable launch. Its compelling narrative, combining DeFi and TradFi, suggests a strong potential for growth. Experts forecast a 50x increase following listings on Tier-1 exchanges, making it a DeFi project worth keeping an eye on—a potential game-changer not to overlook. DTX Exchange (DTX): Positioned for Significant Growth After Launch DTX Exchange (DTX) , a rising star in the crypto world, is currently one of the most coveted tokens. Having reached the final stage of its ICO presale recently, its launch is eagerly awaited in Q1. With early funding exceeding $13.1 million, it’s likely the top presale investment opportunity of the year. Unlike many utility tokens, DTX isn’t dominated by venture capitalists holding the majority of the supply—eliminating concerns about potential sell-offs. Additionally, there will be no future token unlocks that could dilute its value. The presale is designed to be accessible to all, now in its eighth and last round, priced at $0.16 per token. Considering its significant growth potential after launch—with an anticipated 50x increase in value—DTX stands out as the best new crypto investment. Beyond potential gains and outperforming top cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), it has robust fundamentals. It aims to be the first crypto-native platform offering stocks, ETFs, bonds, and over 100,000 currency pairs, merging DeFi and TradFi, and is poised to transform the $10 billion global trading market. Solana (SOL): A Rebound on the Horizon Solana (SOL), a leading cryptocurrency, experienced a sharp decline earlier this week, dropping 5% in the weekly chart and trading above $230. Despite the initial jolt, it's gaining momentum, with experts predicting a bullish turnaround soon. Solana's current price, trading above the 20-EMA ($231) and 20-SMA ($227), signals a potential rebound, making it a key altcoin to watch. Karthick_78, a respected analyst, forecasts that SOL could reach $240 by the end of the month. Meanwhile, GoldenAgeFin, another prominent analyst, predicts Solana (SOL) could hit $900 during this bull run. However, due to its previous rallies and large market cap, its growth might be limited. This has led to increased interest in emerging altcoins like DTX Exchange (DTX). Cardano (ADA): Indicators Point to a Potential Rise Cardano (ADA) has not been immune to the market downturn, trading in line with the broader crypto sector. Despite this, crucial technical indicators like the 100-EMA and 100-SMA suggest a possible rise in the near future. It is trading below $1, with a breakout anticipated. Moreover, Klenekcoinada, a leading analyst, anticipates Cardano (ADA) reaching $12 in this cycle. This positive outlook is shared by CryptoNabs, another analyst on X, who has a more conservative target of $5 to $7 for ADA. With a significant rise expected soon, ADA is among the top cryptocurrencies to consider investing in—its currently low price makes it even more attractive. However, for those seeking higher returns, DTX could provide an opportunity for substantial gains, given its projected 50x increase. DTX Exchange (DTX): Can It Outshine Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA)?

In a Jan. 27 post on X (formerly Twitter), Garlinghouse argued that a U.S. digital asset reserve should represent the diversity of the crypto ecosystem. He warned that focusing on a single asset, such as Bitcoin, would miss the broader potential of the entire industry. “If a government digital asset reserve is created – I believe it should be representative of the industry, not just one token (whether it be BTC, XRP or anything else),” Garlinghouse writes. “Maximalism remains the enemy of crypto progress, and I’m very glad to see fewer and fewer folks ascribe to this outdated and misinformed thinking.” To continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io",,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|XRP,"{'name': 'The Defiant', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/101/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thedefiant,2025-01-29 10:05:58

The company’s decision was revealed in a press release on January 28, marking a notable move by a non-crypto corporation toward digital asset adoption. Nuvve, which specializes in providing electric vehicle (EV) charging stations capable of selling excess energy back to the grid, aims to diversify its treasury holdings while laying the groundwork for accepting Bitcoin as a payment option. Gregory Poilasne, Nuvve’s founder and CEO, emphasized the advantages of this strategy, stating, “BTC acceptance will promote more payment options for customers and suppliers with potentially less transactional friction inherent to digital currencies.” Aligning Finances with Market Trends The company views its Bitcoin purchase plan as a means to bolster its financial strategy and tap into the growing market appeal of digital currencies. If Nuvve were to execute this plan immediately, utilizing 30% of its current cash reserves of $325,425, the firm could acquire just under 1 BTC at its current trading price of $101,522. Nuvve joins a growing list of publicly traded companies, including business software giant MicroStrategy and automotive leader Tesla, that have integrated Bitcoin into their treasury management strategies. MicroStrategy holds 471,107 BTC , making it the largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, while Tesla maintains ownership of 9,720 BTC . Financial Outlook and Nuvve Share Performance Nuvve has faced massive financial hurdles in recent times. The firm’s revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.92 million, reflecting a 29.3% decline from the previous quarter. Its share price closed at $2.81 on January 28, marking a modest 1.81% gain for the day but still far below its all-time high of $8,000 in January 2021. Nuvve’s recent move to integrate Bitcoin into its treasury could potentially invigorate investor confidence, given the cryptocurrency’s 150% surge over the past year. Bitcoin Treasuries data highlights that 62 public companies currently hold a combined 618,615 BTC valued at over $62.6 billion.

The altcoins have retraced over the past 24 hours, with the likes of SOL, DOGE, LINK, and ADA charting the most substantial losses. BTC Awaits FOMC After the massive volatility endured last Monday, when BTC’s price went on several fluctuations that drove it to under $100,000 before it charted a new all-time high above $109,000, the asset calmed by the rest of the week and stood primarily around $104,000. The weekend was also quite uneventful, unlike the previous one. In fact, bitcoin increased slightly and tapped $105,000 by Sunday evening. However, Monday began on a highly negative note, with the bears propelling a substantial leg down that pushed the cryptocurrency under $100,000. Moreover, the asset kept crashing and slipped to a multi-day low of $97,800. After another unsuccessful recovery attempt, the bulls finally stepped up in the evening and pushed bitcoin back to over $100,000. Since then, the asset neared $104,000 yesterday but was stopped and driven to $100,000 once again. As of now, it remains above $102,000, but more volatility is expected today after the conclusion of the Fed’s first meeting for the year. Bitcoin’s market cap now stands above $2.020 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is north of 56% again on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Correct The altcoins charted some impressive gains yesterday, but the landscape is different today. Ethereum was stopped at $3,200 and now sits closer to $3,100 after a 2% daily decline. XRP is below $3.1 again after a minor daily correction. More painful declines come from the likes of DOGE, SOL, ADA, LINK, AVAX, XLM and others. In contrast, WIF has skyrocketed by 15% over the past 24 hours and sits above $1.3. Next in line in terms of daily gains are MOVE (12%) and TAO (11%). The total crypto market cap has lost over $50 billion in a day and is down to $3.6 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

However, new opportunities are emerging with the potential to deliver exponential growth in 2025. Among the latest contenders, OFFICIALMAGACOIN and Solana (SOL) are leading the charge, capturing the attention of both retail and institutional investors.

Ethereum Whales are Flocking to This Viral Presale with Huge Potential,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/is-this-new-crypto-coin-the-next-to-100x-ethereum-whales-are-flocking-to-this-viral-presale-with-huge-potential,"Ethereum’s recent underperformance has led many investors to shift their focus to Rollblock. Rollblock is a GameFi project that is redefining the $450 billion gambling industry. By leveraging blockchain technology, it aims to eliminate scams and fraud commonly associated with traditional gaming. The project’s innovative approach has already shown success. Analysts attribute RBLK’s impressive significant return to Rollblock’s growing popularity and effectiveness in solving long standing industry issues, giving the project a strong first mover advantage. Rollblock Hits Major Presale Milestone Rollblock focuses on making traditional gaming more secure and transparent with blockchain technology. The latest data shows that over $45 billion has been lost due to fraud and scams over the past few years with many casino providers being involved in unethical activities. Rollblock offers a solution with on-chain games. Every outcome a player achieves, good or bad – is encrypted and securely stored on Ethereum. As a result, the operator can’t tamper with that data, which means everything is immutable and encrypted on the blockchain. The platform itself showcases over 7000 different gaming options. These include classics like poker, innovative AI games as a new sports feature for bidding on live events. Over $1.75 million in wagers was placed in December and this number is expected to grow in January. One of Rollblock’s standout features is its use of cryptocurrency. The platform supports over 20 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum and USDT This allows for near-instant processing of deposits and withdrawals, eliminating the typical 30-minute wait players face with traditional platforms. This approach has made Rollblock extremely popular, with the number of new sign ups increasing by over 600% in December. The platform has also scored a major presale win, with over $9.6 million raised from 45,000 early investors. The GambleFi ecosystem is powered by RBLK, Rollblock’s native utility token, which itself represents an innovative investment. The token operates on a revenue-sharing model, allocating up to 30% of Rollblock’s revenue to boost its value. As part of this model up to 30% of Rollblock’s revenue is used to buy RBLK from the open market. 60% of these tokens are burned to create a deflationary effect while the remaining 40% is used for staking rewards. This token model has already proven to be a major success for investors. Rollblock has delivered consistent returns for early backers and is only in its tenth stage of the presale. Currently selling at $0.052, RBLK is on the list of Ethereum whales and major investors with analysts anticipating new highs before February. Ethereum Traders Eye $5,000 in 2025 Ethereum is trading at $3,147.67, down 2.50% from the previous 24 hours. ETH has been volatile, reaching $3,334.71 on January 23 before seeing a sharp retracement. It hovers near the 50-day EMA, signaling consolidation. Support levels at $3,000 and $2,899.73 are critical, while resistance at $3,429.97 could lead to $3,500 if breached. Analysis from Elliott Wave suggests a Wave II correction targeting $2,899.73, but a break above $3,429.97 would resume the uptrend for Ethereum. Analysts project a potential move beyond $5,000 in 2025 if bullish momentum persists. Can Rollblock Deliver Another 550% Surge? If Rollblock’s presale momentum continues to snowball, analysts believe the token could rally 100x by the end of 2025. This would position the token to outperform established projects like Ethereum and Solana, potentially pushing RBLK into the market's top 20 ranked cryptocurrencies.
