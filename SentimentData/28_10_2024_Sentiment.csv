Despite the projected growth, an Ethereum insider suggested that the cryptocurrency should address several key issues to ensure that it can continue to flourish. Related Reading: Whales Hit All-Time High Bitcoin Holdings At 670,000 ‚Äì What Does This Mean For BTC? Ethereum: Projected Price Upsurge Analyst B–∞sictr–∞dingtv stated that prices of Ethereum could skyrocket as there is a growing interest among investors to buy the digital asset, saying that a 60% price hike is highly likely to happen. Blockchain data analysis firm Santiment identified a spike in whale activity on the Ethereum network and recommended a potential purchasing spree. According to their recent update, whale activity reached a six-week high, with average holders accumulating Ethereum after the con‚Äôs recent price decline. üê≥ Ethereum‚Äôs whale activity spiked to a 6-week high as its price declined as low as $2.38K Friday. Historically, this is a sign of accumulation from high capital key stakeholders. Though not a guarantee this will have an immediate effect on prices bouncing, it is encouraging! pic.twitter.com/zcofdvszLF ‚Äî Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 26, 2024 Projections shown by market observers suggested that Ethereum prices could soar and hit the $4,000 mark with some analysts forecasting that it might even breach the $6,000 level. Ethereum price growth could be fueled by its growing appeal to whales as demonstrated in the six-week high whale activity wherein more than 6,400 new wallets were made by large investors. B–∞sictr–∞dingtv also agreed that Ethereum prices could reach the $4,000 level. However, he hinted that the possible bullish breakout would be invalidated if the ETH price dipped to $2,000, saying that this ‚Äúpric–µ zon–µ‚Äù is a key indicator that should be kept an eye on. Recalibrating Protocol For Growth Meanwhile, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said in a post that there are several issues that the cryptocurrency needs to address to thrive in the ever-evolving crypto space. Buterin explained that one of these issues is to simplify its protocol and ensure its continuous growth, saying that the coin‚Äôs protocol has become more complicated and it already undermines Ethereum‚Äôs integrity and security. He said that simplification of the protocol could help address the said issue. He explained that Ethereum has already implemented changes in the past, citing the removal of the SELFDESTRUCT opcode as an example. The SELFDESTRUCT opcode was known to complicate interactions among users and posed potential security risks. However, Buterin cautioned that the removal of such features must be conducted in a systematic approach so developers could see the impact of such action before implementing the changes. Related Reading: Against All Odds: Solana (SOL) Breaks Past $176 In 3-Month Push Solving The Storage Problem Another critical issue raised by Buterin is the storage problem being experienced by the cryptocurrency. Buterin said that Ethereum needs at least 1.1 terrabytes of storage to house its enormous historical data. He suggested the implementation of ‚Äúcryptographic proofs of the state‚Äù, adding that this solution will allow nodes to retain only a fragment of the histories. He added that this approach is the same as the torrent system wherein nodes only keep pieces of data that intersect from one node to another. At the time of writing, Ethereum is being traded –∞t $2,470, a 2.84% price dip in the last 24 hours. On the other hand, ETH‚Äôs tr–∞ding volum–µ went up by more than 30% to nearly $22 billion in only a single day.

TradingView‚Äôs recent data shows that MicroStrategy (MSTR) hit $235.89 in Thursday‚Äôs session. The stock‚Äôs price increased by more than 7% on October 25th. MicroStrategy‚Äôs price action last Thursday continued its 6-week rally and came ahead of its scheduled Q3 earnings report. Related Reading: Whales Hit All-Time High Bitcoin Holdings At 670,000 ‚Äì What Does This Mean For BTC? This week‚Äôs stock performance reflected the company‚Äôs consistent growth over the past few years. MicroStrategy has outperformed most of its peers in the S&P 500 index and even outpaced Microsoft‚Äôs growth since 1999. According to observers, MicroStrategy is bullish, with market analysts listing $245 as the stock‚Äôs next target. MicroStrategy Continues Its Bitcoin Focus MicroStrategy, a Virginia-based Bitcoin development company, is currently the world‚Äôs largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, with 252,222 BTC. With Bitcoin‚Äôs current price of $67,392, the company holds more than $17 billion in assets. MicroStrategy Stock Hits New Highs MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock (MSTR) has soared over 7% to a 25-year high of $236, with a current market cap of $47 billion, overtaking Microsoft in all-time stock gains.

However, in August 2020, the company changed its business model to focus on Bitcoin. The company has raised $4.25 billion from its equity offerings, the foundation for growing its Bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin Plan Has Its Costs, Too As part of its Bitcoin plan, it aims to buy BTC at every opportunity. For the most part, Saylor‚Äôs strategy was a hit. However, the business plan to focus on Bitcoin came at a cost, and Saylor earned a few detractors and critics along the way. For example, the company has expanded its convertible note offering to raise funds to buy more Bitcoin. However, the bulk of these notes do not mature until 2032. Some market observers also say that MicroStrategy is in a difficult situation, especially during market downturns. Since the company relies on Bitcoin, the company‚Äôs future is dependent on crypto‚Äôs extreme volatility. Although most criticisms are valid, Michael Saylor remains defiant and has since doubled its BTC investments.

Palmer and the other analysts now target $245 to address this sudden surge and bullish sentiment. Palmer adds that the company‚Äôs share price has increased by 1,600% in the last four years, and more gains are possible. It also helps that Michael Saylor has remained steadfast in his vision and passion for Bitcoin.

ETH traded as low as $2,379 and recently started an upside correction. There was a minor increase above the $2,420 level. The price traded above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,562 swing high to the $2,379 low. The bulls even pushed the price above the $2,500 resistance but struggled near $2,520. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a short-term rising channel forming with support at $2,480 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,520 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,562 swing high to the $2,379 low. The first major resistance is near the $2,550 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,600. A clear move above the $2,600 resistance might send the price toward the $2,650 resistance. An upside break above the $2,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,750 resistance zone. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,520 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,480 level. The first major support sits near the $2,420 zone. A clear move below the $2,420 support might push the price toward $2,380. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,320 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,250.

The price is now recovering higher and facing hurdles near the $590 resistance zone. BNB price started a downside correction from the $600 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $590 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $585 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $590 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Aims Fresh Increase After struggling above $605, BNB price saw a downside correction. The price dipped below the $590 and $585 support levels like Ethereum and Bitcoin. There was a move below the $580 and $575 levels. The price even dipped below $572 before the bulls appeared near $590. A low was formed at $565 and the price is now correcting losses. It climbed above the $575 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $598 swing high to the $565 low. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $585 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $590 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $590 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $598 swing high to the $565 low. The next resistance sits near the $598 level. A clear move above the $598 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $605. A close above the $605 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $620 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $632 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $590 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $585 level. The next major support is near the $582 level. The main support sits at $572. If there is a downside break below the $572 support, the price could drop toward the $565 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $550 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD ‚Äì The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone.
