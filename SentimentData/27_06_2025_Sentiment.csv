In a market saturated with overhyped projects that frequently fall short of their promises, these three are capturing attention for a very different reason, consistent delivery, strategic advancements, and a clear vision backed by tangible progress. With Pi gaining 16% in 24 hours, VEChain quietly maintaining nearly $2 billion in market cap, and Qubetics pushing into its final presale phase with a complete tokenomics overhaul, momentum is quietly building, and early participants are racing to position themselves ahead of what might soon be the breakout stories of the year. Qubetics ($TICS), in particular, is solving what no Layer 1 before it truly could: blockchain interoperability with zero-friction architecture. While past protocols promised scalability and speed, they often came at the cost of network compatibility or decentralization. Qubetics enters with an entirely new framework that actively integrates existing infrastructures into a unified ecosystem. Real-world applications? Think seamless asset movement across networks without bridges or wrapped tokens. With just 9 million tokens left in its presale at a locked-in price of $0.3370, the time to act is shrinking fast, one of the best crypto to buy for June 2025. Qubetics ($TICS): Solving Interoperability with Purpose and Precision Interoperability remains one of the most pressing and under-addressed problems in blockchain. Currently, moving assets across blockchains requires third-party bridges, often introducing security vulnerabilities, transaction fees, and delays. These inefficiencies restrict mass adoption and real-world use. Qubetics ($TICS) takes this challenge head-on with a modular Layer 1 infrastructure designed to connect multiple chains without relying on centralized bridges or wrapped assets. In practice, this means that stablecoins from one network can be used in decentralized applications (dApps) on another without leaving the ecosystem. For example, a DeFi application built on Ethereum could seamlessly interact with liquidity protocols hosted on Qubetics, while a supply chain tracking smart contract on VeChain could receive payment data from the Qubetics mainnet, all without rewriting code or migrating assets. Qubetics Presale Nears Completion with Top Exchange Listing and Explosive Growth Potential Qubetics is now in Stage 37, the final phase of its public crypto presale , having already raised over $18.1 million from more than 28,300 token holders and selling over 516 million $TICS tokens. The current presale price is fixed at $0.3370, but with only 9 million tokens left, time is running out. The presale will officially close on June 30 at 8:00 AM UTC, just hours before Qubetics lists on a top 10 global crypto exchange at $0.40, giving last-minute investors an instant 20% upside at launch. A major driver behind Qubetics’ growing demand is its aggressive supply strategy, which saw total token supply reduced from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion, creating built-in scarcity. In addition, the team has committed to a community-first model, allocating 38.55% of the supply to public sale participants ensuring fairer distribution and a more decentralized ownership structure. Unlike many projects that promise future utility, Qubetics is already rolling out real-world solutions like its decentralized VPN (dVPN), built to address privacy, censorship, and centralization issues across the internet. With use-case-driven technology and strong tokenomics, analysts are forecasting that $TICS could reach between $10 and $15 post-mainnet, translating to a potential ROI of up to 4,350% for early supporters. With the presale ending soon, listing confirmed for June 30 at 11:00 AM UTC, and token availability shrinking rapidly, this may be the final opportunity to get in before Qubetics gains global market exposure and draws institutional attention, making it one of the most promising crypto buys for June 2025. Pi Network (PI) Surges 16% on AI Integration Buzz Ahead of Pi2Day Event Pi Network (PI) made headlines once again, surging 16% following speculation around a possible integration with generative AI technologies. This rally coincided with the community’s upcoming Pi2Day event and reinforced growing interest in Pi’s long-standing mobile mining ecosystem. Technically speaking, PI has broken through a significant resistance point, suggesting further upside if the current momentum continues. The MACD indicator has just flashed a fresh buy signal, while the RSI has climbed to 53—often a marker of building bullish strength. If PI maintains price action above $0.6600, analysts expect a potential climb toward the $0.8686 mark, previously recorded in May. On the flip side, a retracement to the $0.5090 level could signal a short-term cool-off, especially if broader market sentiment dips, one of the best crypto to buy for June 2025. VEChain (VET) Holds Steady at $0.021 Amid Real-World Enterprise Adoption Momentum While VEChain (VET) hasn’t produced fireworks lately, it remains a cornerstone of blockchain utility in logistics, supply chain, and enterprise adoption. Currently trading at $0.02128, VET has shown consistency in volume and user activity, with around $30 million in daily turnover. The circulating supply stands at 86 billion, nearly reaching its max, giving it a fully diluted market value of approximately $1.82 billion. While short-term traders may overlook it, the protocol’s long-term fundamentals and enterprise-first approach create a strong case for those looking to diversify into blockchain assets with real use cases. Its stability and reliable throughput make it a solid choice for community members looking beyond speculative hype toward foundational growth, and stand out as the best crypto to buy for June 2025. Final Thoughts on the Best Crypto to Buy for June 2025 Among the three, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out for addressing the future of blockchain utility through interoperability, while also offering significant upside through its current final-stage presale. Pi Network (PI) continues to capture attention with bold technology hints and a resilient community model. VEChain (VET), meanwhile, stays steady, anchoring itself in proven adoption and enterprise solutions. Each of these projects presents a different type of value. Qubetics is offering early participants a shot at securing what might be the next major Layer 1—built not just for speed or cost, but true utility. Pi Network is gathering community momentum with each technical advancement. VEChain continues to quietly execute on everything many networks only talk about. For those evaluating the best crypto to buy for June 2025 , these three deserve serious attention. Whether the focus is potential ROI, technological innovation, or long-term stability, each has a distinct position in the blockchain market that’s not to be ignored. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics/ Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics/ FAQs What makes Qubetics ($TICS) the best crypto to buy for June 2025? Qubetics addresses the biggest challenge in blockchain—interoperability—with real-world solutions, a powerful tokenomics update, and a final presale opportunity that promises high ROI potential. Why is Pi Network (PI) gaining attention again in 2025?

46851830,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=756136,1750979919,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46851830.jpeg,Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urges Congress to dump Trump’s retaliatory tax in BBB,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/scott-bessent-congress-dump-retaliatory-tax/,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has formally asked Congress to delete a controversial provision buried in President Donald Trump’s newest budget plan. The section, known as Section 899, would’ve allowed the US to slam companies and investors from other countries with additional taxes, specifically if those countries imposed harsh tax policies under international agreements. Scott said on Thursday that the rule no longer made sense because parts of the OECD’s Pillar 2 tax regime won’t apply to US companies anymore. According to reporting from the Financial Times, Scott posted on X that the Treasury had requested lawmakers in both the House and Senate to remove the section from the “Big, Beautiful Budget.” The provision was originally designed to hit back at countries using the OECD’s global minimum tax rules to go after US multinationals. Trump signed onto the bill with the rule intact, but the economic and political climate has changed. Scott said the US had reached an understanding with G7 countries after “months of productive dialogue,” making the retaliation part of the bill unnecessary. Treasury walks away from Pillar 2 enforcement Pillar 2 was part of a 2021 deal agreed under former President Joe Biden, meant to enforce a 15% global minimum corporate tax rate. That deal gave countries the power to collect extra taxes if multinational firms weren’t paying enough at home. But now the US says those rules won’t apply to American companies anymore, meaning other countries won’t be able to collect taxes from them under Pillar 2. That’s what made Scott come out and push for the removal of Section 899. The tax had raised alarms in the financial sector. Major banks and investors warned it would drag down corporate investment and cause money to flow out of the US Some even said it could make the US a less attractive place for foreign capital. The Treasury Department had tried to narrow the damage by excluding interest on US Treasury securities from the scope, but the provision still applied to dividends, rent, and royalties, which industry groups said would wreck passive investment flows. Even within Trump’s own party, some Republicans in the House weren’t sold on the tax. They said on Wednesday that Section 899 was too risky and hinted that it might be taken out of the final bill. Scott’s announcement gave them the cover they needed to go public. Right now, the GOP wants to get the bill passed before July 4, which is when Trump wants to sign the law to mark Independence Day with a legislative win. Wall Street lobbies hard against the tax The financial industry didn’t stay quiet. They made it known that they hated the plan. Wall Street firms warned that adding this kind of penalty on foreign investors would backfire. The US already saw a drop in demand for government debt earlier this year, and investors blamed Trump’s plan to slap tariffs on nearly every major trade partner. That dip created serious concern, especially since the Treasury would need to issue a ton of bonds to pay for the spending in the budget bill. The threat of Section 899 just added fuel to that fire. Business groups feared the extra tax would discourage foreign direct investment and make investors steer clear of US markets altogether. One of the most vocal critics was Jonathan Samford, CEO of the Global Business Alliance, who said: “This is what leadership looks like. Choosing economic strength over squandered opportunity, investment over isolation, and American workers over misguided tax hikes.” The political shift came fast. Once Scott made the Treasury’s position public, the path to removing Section 899 got clearer. The House GOP moved quickly to prepare for a final vote on the broader budget package, which also includes an extension of Trump’s 2017 individual tax cuts and new tax breaks meant to appeal to middle-income Americans heading into the 2026 election season. The unfinished parts of the OECD deal—including the idea of replacing digital services taxes with new rules on profit-sharing across countries—no longer appear to be a concern for the administration. With the G7 on board and foreign tax enforcement no longer a threat to US firms, the retaliatory move lost its reason to exist. In Scott’s words, the new understanding with the G7 “provides greater certainty and stability for the global economy” and will “enhance growth and investment in the United States and beyond.” His message was clear: the US doesn’t need a revenge tax when it’s already negotiated its way out of the fight. Now it’s on Congress to act before foreign investors pull back even more. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This comes as the index climbed 0.8% during the day, ending the session at 6,141.02, just inches away from the 6,147.43 intraday record last hit in February. The Dow Jones added 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite moved up nearly 1%, also heading toward a potential all-time high of its own. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added just 33 points in after-hours trading, a 0.1% lift. Meanwhile, Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures stayed mostly unchanged. This cautious positioning comes ahead of key inflation data that will either keep the rally going or yank it off course. Investors wait for new inflation data According to CNBC, Rick Rieder, who heads global fixed income at BlackRock, said, “There is so much money that wants to come into the market that didn’t for a while. And I just think if you don’t have any negative news, the natural gravitational pull is across all these assets.” On Friday, traders are set to dig into May’s personal consumption expenditures price index. It’s a big deal—this is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a monthly increase of 0.1%, and a year-over-year jump of 2.3%. The core PCE, which takes out food and energy, is also forecasted to rise 0.1% for the month and 2.6% for the year. That’s not all investors are watching. The morning will also bring updates on consumer spending, personal income, and consumer sentiment. The results could decide if the recent rally continues or runs out of steam. Despite the Fed still dancing around its rate strategy and ongoing geopolitical pressure, the stock market has clawed its way back from its lows earlier this year. All three major indexes have posted solid weekly gains: the S&P 500 and Dow are up over 2%, and the Nasdaq has jumped more than 3%. Bitcoin trapped in tight range as whales unload While equities flirt with records, Bitcoin is stuck pacing the same ten-foot circle it’s been walking since May 9. The price has mostly bounced between $102,000 and $112,000, with just one brief spike beyond that ceiling to hit a new high, still barely ahead of its last one. It hasn’t managed a strong rally, despite an insane amount of interest from institutions. Just this Wednesday, Bitcoin ETFs recorded their 12th straight day of inflows and are now heading toward their ninth positive week in eleven, pulling in $3.5 billion just this month, according to Coin Metrics. Yet Bitcoin itself has only risen by 2%. Markus Thielen, who leads 10x Research, explained why. “We are not seeing a lot of real demand right now because the demand has been almost perfectly offset by the selling from these larger wallets,” he said. Markus called it an “orderly” change of ownership, where old megawhales are taking their time to sell off coins to new buyers like ETFs and corporate treasuries. The wallets that are buying the most this year? Those holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC. CryptoQuant classifies these holders as dolphins, and Julio Moreno, the firm’s head of research, says that many ETFs probably fall into this group. Whales and miners control the game The biggest players in crypto right now are still whales (wallets holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC) and megawhales (10,000+ BTC). But they’re not buying. They’ve been net sellers since the start of the year. Retail wallets, those holding less than one full bitcoin, are also dumping. It’s the dolphins who are stepping in to soak up that pressure. But that balance is fragile. Julio said that companies like BlackRock and Strategy (the company formerly known as MicroStrategy) have built large positions using hundreds of wallets. BlackRock holds around 550 wallets, each averaging 1,290 BTC. Strategy controls about 490 wallets, with an average of 927 BTC per wallet. But even with these holdings spread out, they’re considered large buyers behind most of the recent ETF flows. Despite all the buying, price movement has stayed muted. That’s because some of the biggest bitcoin reserves on the planet are still in the hands of Chinese miners. Between 2013 and 2021, China controlled up to 75% of the global hashrate. Out of the 19.9 million bitcoins mined so far, between 11 and 15 million came from China-based miners. Of that, about 5 million are still under their control, according to Markus. Normally, during a big price rally, these wallets start dumping on exchanges. This time, they haven’t. “It seems that these wallets are holding – holding tight and only releasing as many bitcoin as can be scooped up by ETFs and by Strategy,” Markus said . Strategy, now focused on corporate crypto adoption, has slowed down its BTC buying this year. That’s mostly because its stock premium has narrowed, and competition from other treasury buyers is rising fast. Markus warned that “if megawhale selling accelerates further, a deeper correction is likely.” On the other hand, if those big sellers back off and whale accumulation starts to rise, the next leg up might finally begin.

But the Central Bank abruptly postponed the launch “indefinitely” in early March . The bank stunned the public when it initially gave no alternative launch timeline. This led to a flurry of speculation that Moscow was preparing to ditch its CBDC. Others suggested Moscow might push back the rollout to at least 2027 . Some forecasted that the Central Bank would pursue crypto-powered alternatives to the digital ruble. They cited a lukewarm reception for digital RUB plans from both the public and the banking sector. However, the Russian state-run news agency TASS reported that some of the biggest banks in the country are looking forward to the launch. The Russian Central Bank in Moscow.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-expert-says-something-big-is-coming-heres-why/,"XRP may be gearing up for a significant upward move, according to recent analysis by Teo Mercer, a digital asset strategist with a large following on social media. Mercer believes that the current market conditions and evolving regulatory developments in the United States could provide the momentum needed for XRP to achieve higher valuations in the coming months. In a recent post, Mercer noted that XRP is showing strong indicators of a potential breakout, following an extended period of subdued performance. With XRP currently priced near $2, he suggests this range may offer an attractive opportunity for new entrants. Projected Price Range: $3 to $4 Considered Attainable Mercer’s outlook is centered around the belief that XRP could realistically climb to between $3 and $4 in the short-to-medium term. He explained that these levels are achievable if current market sentiment continues to improve and regulatory clarity is maintained. $XRP is starting to show serious signs of life. With U.S. crypto regulation entering its final stages, the environment is aligning in XRP’s favor. Feels like something big is loading. This looks like a strong entry point, with $3–$4 as a realistic target in the coming months. pic.twitter.com/TrmhZ4Us0r — ︎ Teo Mercer (@TeoMercer) June 25, 2025 Earlier in the year, XRP temporarily entered this price zone but was unable to sustain the momentum due to broader market resistance. Since then, it has hovered around $2, prompting frustration among holders. However, analysts like Mercer believe that conditions are finally aligning in XRP’s favor, particularly as legislative and regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies take shape in the U.S. U.S. Moves Toward Comprehensive Crypto Regulation The renewed optimism around XRP and other digital assets is largely being driven by recent progress in U.S. crypto regulation. Notably, the Senate recently passed the GENIUS Act , which introduces a regulatory structure for stablecoins. The law establishes oversight requirements, full asset backing, and consumer protections for these digital currencies. Additionally, new legislation proposed by Republican lawmakers aims to clarify how cryptocurrencies are categorized. The bill distinguishes between securities and commodities, assigning regulatory authority according to either the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). If passed, this could significantly reduce regulatory ambiguity and support more consistent market growth. Further signaling institutional adoption, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has instructed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to incorporate digital assets in assessing borrowers’ financial qualifications. This directive could open doors for broader acceptance of crypto assets in traditional finance, particularly under the pro-crypto posture of the current U.S. administration. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another important factor supporting XRP’s potential growth is the conclusion of its prolonged legal battle with the SEC. Ripple and the agency have reportedly agreed to a $50 million settlement, pending court approval. The end of this high-profile case removes a significant obstacle that has overshadowed XRP’s market outlook for years. Differing Views on XRP’s Upside While Mercer’s price target remains conservative compared to more aggressive forecasts, it aligns with a growing consensus that XRP could soon gain momentum. In contrast, some analysts have issued far more ambitious predictions. For instance, Dustin Layton recently suggested that 1,000 XRP, currently valued at approximately $2,000, could yield profits of $50,000 before year-end, implying a price per coin of over $52. Such a valuation would require XRP to reach a market capitalization exceeding $3 trillion, a milestone many view as unrealistic in the near term. Nonetheless, the existence of these projections reflects heightened expectations from portions of the crypto community. The supportive market sentiment has created a favorable environment for XRP’s potential appreciation. While price predictions vary, analysts like Mercer maintain that a move to $3 or $4 is not only possible but increasingly likely in the coming months as conditions continue to stabilize.

Reinforcing this bullish outlook is the Elliott Wave 5 count, which points to an epic price rally that could propel Bitcoin above $300,000, eclipsing its previous all-time high and current market value by a substantial margin. Bitcoin Price Ultimate Parabolic Push Unveiled A newly released Bitcoin price forecast by X (formerly Twitter) crypto analyst Gert van Lagen boldly suggests that the leading cryptocurrency may be on the verge of its most aggressive bull run this cycle. Lagen’s price chart indicates that BTC is firmly locked into a parabolic step-like growth structure, potentially eyeing an extended Wave 5 breakout that could drive prices well beyond $345,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Elliott Wave Count Predicts Further Crash To $94,000, But What Next? The trajectory of the analyst’s chart illustrates a clear parabolic growth curve anchored by four distinct formations, labeled Base 1 through Base 4. Each of these bases represents a phase of accumulation and consolidation that preceded a Bitcoin price breakout. This structure also mirrors a textbook parabolic setup, where each new base sets the stage for steeper upward moves. Most notably, after the completion of Base 3, marked by the inflection point on the chart, Bitcoin launched into a sharp rally, confirming the expected parabolic behavior. Lagen’s analysis now indicates that BTC’s current Base 4 has been completed, followed by a corrective A-B-C structure that appears to have reached its bottom, positioning the cryptocurrency for the anticipated final leg of its cycle. Using Elliott Wave theory, Bitcoin’s price action is still unfolding within the fifth wave, which is the final advance in the five-wave impulsive cycle. The price chart identifies Wave 1 as beginning shortly after the 2022 lows. This was followed by a powerful breakout in 2023, which defined Wave 3, while Wave 4 concluded more recently with a classic corrective pattern. Notably, the upcoming Wave 5 could see Bitcoin skyrocket anywhere between $300,000 and $425,000, depending on the timing and strength of its bullish momentum. Timeline For Game-Changing Rally A key element in Lagen’s analysis is the dynamic “sell line” drawn near the upper end of the parabolic arc that runs underneath the Bitcoin price movement on the chart. According to the analyst, the longer it takes for Bitcoin to hit this projected vertical trajectory, the higher the price at which the potential market top might occur. This is due to the upward curvature of the parabolic trend line itself, which steepens over time. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Surge To $130,000 Next? What The Wave Count Says Currently, Lagen forecasts an early breakout by July 7, 2025, if momentum resumes immediately. However, if Bitcoin continues consolidating through the summer, the projected peak could rise further, as the sell line would continue climbing over time.

XRP and Shiba Inu are both mounting fresh comebacks, backed by legal milestones, whale activity, and ecosystem upgrades. Their renewed momentum has analysts revisiting the possibility of both tokens climbing back into the top 10 by market cap before the year closes. But there’s another name on the radar that’s changing the game entirely. MAGACOIN FINANCE , a new presale altcoin, is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about breakout candidates of the year. While XRP and SHIB work to reclaim lost ground, MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting from the ground up—fast. Its low entry price, viral presale momentum, and strong investor engagement have positioned it as a serious contender for exponential gains. And if early signals are right, it may not just join the top 10 conversation—it could hijack it XRP and Shiba Inu Show Strength XRP and Shiba Inu have both spent years near the spotlight—but for very different reasons. As of late June 2025, XRP is once again at the center of a legal standoff with the SEC. Despite talk of settlement, a federal judge recently shut down both sides’ attempt to escape a final ruling. It’s a reminder that legal clarity for XRP isn’t guaranteed, even after years of litigation. Still, XRP isn’t standing still. Futures contracts tied to XRP are now live on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, marking a milestone moment for the token’s institutional credibility. Ripple’s acquisition of brokerage firm Hidden Road—now approved by FINRA—adds another layer of compliance strength to its growing financial ecosystem. And while XRP’s price hovers between $2.10 and $2.18, analysts are split on whether a breakout or deeper correction is next. What’s clear is that XRP remains in play, but the path forward depends on more than just technical patterns. Shiba Inu, by contrast, is fighting its way back with innovation and whale support. A massive $110 million SHIB accumulation day—its largest in five months—sparked a sharp rebound from a 16-month low. On-chain momentum is improving, but it’s the ecosystem upgrades that could give SHIB lasting strength. Developers recently launched the Shib Alpha Layer, introducing encrypted smart contracts and the infrastructure for ultra-fast Layer 3 rollups. ShibDAO is also bringing real governance to holders, moving SHIB closer to true decentralization. While neither XRP nor SHIB is guaranteed a top 10 finish by year-end, both are showing they’re far from finished. But in a market increasingly hungry for new stories, a different kind of contender is catching fire. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Contender Everyone’s Watching MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t a household name yet—but that could change fast. The project is deep in its presale phase, where token stages are selling out faster than most memecoins can update their roadmaps. It’s already raised more than $10 million, with early buyers treating this like a once-in-a-cycle opportunity. There’s no shortage of early-stage tokens, but what’s pushing MAGACOIN FINANCE ahead is the mix of timing, positioning, and momentum. It enters the market during a period of blue-chip fatigue. Ethereum is consolidating, XRP is tied up in court, and most of the top coins are moving sideways. Traders aren’t just watching anymore—they’re rotating. Unlike most meme coins that launch with hype and little else, MAGACOIN FINANCE has branding, token scarcity, and a fast-growing online movement. The token is priced under a cent, and that’s part of the draw—investors know the biggest returns are made before listings, not after. Analysts calling for 25x to 50x gains may sound aggressive, but if MAGACOIN FINANCE hits major exchanges with the kind of community firepower it’s currently building, that kind of upside becomes plausible. This isn’t about replacing XRP or SHIB. It’s about identifying the next breakout before the market catches up. And right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE looks like that play. Conclusion: A Race with Room for a Surprise Winner XRP has the legal and institutional foundation. SHIB has the community and evolving tech. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is riding pure momentum—and doing it at the exact moment when crypto traders are looking for underpriced upside. By the end of 2025, we may see all three tokens fighting for a spot in the top 10. The difference? Only one of them is still giving early investors a shot at the ground floor.

The digital asset landscape is constantly evolving, and a recent announcement from crypto giant Coinbase has sent ripples through the community. Coinbase has officially launched cbADA and cbLTC on Base, its very own Ethereum Layer-2 network. This move, as reported by Unfolded on X, isn’t just another product launch; it’s a strategic expansion that promises to enhance accessibility and utility for Cardano (ADA) and Litecoin (LTC) holders within the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem on Base. Understanding Coinbase Base ‘s Latest Move The news that Coinbase is bringing wrapped versions of Cardano (ADA) and Litecoin (LTC) to its Base network is a game-changer for several reasons. For those new to the space, Coinbase Base is an Ethereum Layer-2 (L2) blockchain incubated by Coinbase. It’s designed to provide a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly environment for building decentralized applications (dApps). By leveraging the security of Ethereum while offering significantly lower transaction fees and faster processing times, Base aims to be a cornerstone of the next wave of decentralized finance (DeFi) innovation. This strategic decision by Coinbase to integrate cbADA and cbLTC directly onto Base signals a strong commitment to expanding the utility of major cryptocurrencies beyond their native blockchains. It means that holders of ADA and LTC, which traditionally operate on their own distinct networks, can now seamlessly participate in the diverse DeFi protocols and dApps being built on Base, all while benefiting from the robust infrastructure provided by Coinbase. The Power of cbADA and cbLTC : What Are Wrapped Tokens ? At the heart of this announcement are cbADA and cbLTC , which are examples of ‘wrapped tokens.’ But what exactly does that mean? Imagine you have a physical asset, like a gold bar, but you want to use it in a different financial system that only accepts paper currency. A wrapped token is essentially a digital representation of a cryptocurrency from one blockchain that’s ‘wrapped’ or tokenized to be usable on another blockchain. Here’s a simple breakdown: Definition: A wrapped token is a cryptocurrency token pegged to the value of another crypto asset. It’s like an ERC-20 version of a non-ERC-20 coin, allowing it to be used on the Ethereum network (or an L2 like Base). How it Works: When you wrap a token, the original asset is typically locked in a smart contract on its native chain, and an equivalent amount of the wrapped token is minted on the target chain. When you unwrap it, the wrapped token is burned, and the original asset is released. Benefits: Interoperability: Enables assets from different blockchains to interact, breaking down silos in the crypto ecosystem. Enhanced Liquidity: Brings liquidity from one chain to another, opening up new trading and lending opportunities. DeFi Participation: Allows holders of non-Ethereum native assets to participate in Ethereum’s vast DeFi ecosystem. With cbADA and cbLTC , Coinbase is providing a trusted bridge for Cardano and Litecoin holders to enter the Base ecosystem. This is a significant step towards a more interconnected and fluid decentralized financial world, where assets aren’t confined to their original chains but can flow freely to where they can be most utilized. Why an Ethereum Layer-2 Network Matters for Adoption The choice of Base, an Ethereum Layer-2 Network , is crucial to understanding the long-term implications of this launch. Ethereum, while robust and secure, faces scalability challenges due to high transaction fees (gas fees) and slower transaction speeds during periods of high network congestion. Layer-2 solutions like Base address these issues by processing transactions off the main Ethereum chain (Layer-1) and then batching them into a single transaction that is settled on Layer-1. Here’s why Layer-2 networks are so vital for the mass adoption of blockchain technology: Feature Ethereum Layer-1 (Mainnet) Ethereum Layer-2 (e.g., Base) Transaction Speed Slower (15-30 TPS) Much Faster (1,000s TPS) Transaction Cost Higher Gas Fees Significantly Lower Fees Scalability Limited High, designed for mass adoption Security Inherited from Ethereum Inherited from Ethereum User Experience Can be costly/slow Smoother, more affordable By building on Base, Coinbase ensures that users interacting with cbADA and cbLTC will experience a much more efficient and cost-effective environment. This lower barrier to entry for users, combined with the immense security of Ethereum, creates an attractive platform for both developers to innovate and users to engage with DeFi applications without prohibitive costs. Unlocking New Opportunities with Wrapped Tokens on Base The introduction of cbADA and cbLTC on Base opens up a plethora of new opportunities for both existing holders of these assets and the broader DeFi community. Previously, if you held ADA or LTC, your participation in the Ethereum-centric DeFi world was limited without going through complex bridging solutions or centralized exchanges. Now, with these wrapped tokens, the doors to Base’s growing ecosystem are wide open. DeFi Integration: Holders can now use their cbADA and cbLTC in various DeFi protocols on Base, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for trading, lending protocols to earn yield, and borrowing platforms to access liquidity. Enhanced Liquidity: This move injects new liquidity into the Base ecosystem, potentially attracting more users and developers, leading to a more vibrant and robust decentralized economy. Accessibility for Coinbase Users: Given Coinbase’s massive user base, this integration makes it incredibly easy for millions of users to bridge their ADA and LTC directly into the Base ecosystem, bypassing the complexities often associated with cross-chain transfers. New Trading Pairs: Expect to see new trading pairs emerge on DEXs on Base, allowing for more diverse trading strategies and opportunities for arbitrage. This move underscores a growing trend in the crypto space: the push for greater interoperability and utility across different blockchain networks. By facilitating the seamless flow of value, Coinbase is contributing to a more integrated and user-friendly DeFi landscape. Navigating the Future: Challenges and What’s Next for Coinbase Base While the launch of cbADA and cbLTC on Coinbase Base is undoubtedly a positive development, it’s also important to consider the potential challenges and the road ahead. The primary consideration for any wrapped token solution is trust and centralization. Since Coinbase is the entity facilitating the wrapping and unwrapping of these tokens, users are inherently trusting Coinbase to custody the underlying ADA and LTC assets securely. Key considerations include: Centralization Risk: While Base itself is decentralized, the issuance of cbADA and cbLTC relies on Coinbase as a centralized custodian. This introduces a point of trust that users must be comfortable with. Smart Contract Security: The smart contracts governing the wrapping and unwrapping process on Base must be rigorously audited and secure to prevent vulnerabilities. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory environment for wrapped tokens and Layer-2 solutions could impact future operations. Looking ahead, this launch could be just the beginning. We might see Coinbase introduce wrapped versions of other popular cryptocurrencies on Base, further expanding the network’s utility and attracting more users. This also strengthens Base’s position as a leading Layer-2 solution, potentially fostering more innovation and dApp development within its ecosystem. The success of cbADA and cbLTC will likely dictate the pace and scope of future wrapped asset integrations. In conclusion, Coinbase’s launch of cbADA and cbLTC on its Base Layer-2 network is a monumental step towards a more interconnected and efficient decentralized financial future. By bridging the gap between distinct blockchain ecosystems, Coinbase is not only enhancing the utility of Cardano and Litecoin but also reinforcing Base’s position as a crucial player in the Ethereum scaling solution landscape. This move promises lower fees, faster transactions, and expanded DeFi opportunities for a broader audience, paving the way for a truly accessible and interoperable crypto economy. As the Base ecosystem continues to mature, we can expect even more innovative applications and increased liquidity, further solidifying its role in the evolution of decentralized finance.

Resupply, a stablecoin protocol, confirmed a substantial security breach resulting in a $9.5 million loss. This incident underscores the critical importance of robust security measures and swift response in the volatile realm of digital assets, especially for those interested in the future of decentralized finance. Understanding the Resupply Exploit: What Exactly Happened? In a recent announcement via X (formerly Twitter), the Resupply team detailed the specifics of the exploit. The Resupply exploit was meticulously targeted, focusing solely on the market within their protocol. This precision attack led to a staggering $9.5 million being siphoned off, sending ripples of concern throughout the DeFi community. The immediate identification and pausing of the compromised smart contract hack was a crucial step, preventing further losses and demonstrating a rapid response capability by the Resupply team. While the market bore the brunt of the attack, it’s reassuring to note that the rest of the stablecoin protocol remains operational, a testament to the protocol’s modular design and the team’s quick containment efforts. A full post-mortem analysis is promised, which will undoubtedly shed more light on the intricate details of the vulnerability and the exploit’s mechanics. Why Are Smart Contract Hacks a Persistent Threat in DeFi Security? The incident at Resupply is not an isolated event. Smart contract hack incidents have become an unfortunate recurring theme in the decentralized finance landscape. These vulnerabilities often stem from a confluence of factors that challenge even the most robust DeFi security frameworks: Complexity: DeFi protocols are intricate systems, often built on layers of smart contracts interacting with each other. This complexity inherently increases the attack surface for malicious actors. Immutability: Once deployed, smart contracts are designed to be difficult, if not impossible, to alter. A bug, once exploited, can lead to catastrophic and irreversible losses. Composability Risks: The ‘money legos’ nature of DeFi, where protocols build upon and interact with each other, means a vulnerability in one underlying protocol can have cascading effects across the ecosystem. Audit Limitations: While security audits are crucial, even well-audited contracts can harbor undiscovered flaws, especially zero-day exploits that exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities. Novelty: The DeFi space is constantly innovating, pushing new boundaries with experimental financial products. This rapid development sometimes outpaces thorough security testing and established best practices. The Resupply incident highlights that even established stablecoin protocols , which are often seen as pillars of stability within the volatile crypto market, are not immune to sophisticated attacks. This reinforces the need for continuous vigilance and adaptation in DeFi security practices. Strengthening DeFi: Lessons from Every Crypto Vulnerability Every crypto vulnerability , including the recent Resupply exploit , offers invaluable lessons for the entire ecosystem. For users, it’s a stark reminder to exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before interacting with any protocol. For developers and project teams, it emphasizes the absolute necessity of a multi-faceted approach to security: Rigorous Audits: Engage multiple, independent security audits by reputable firms specializing in blockchain security. Bug Bounty Programs: Incentivize white-hat hackers to find vulnerabilities and report them responsibly before malicious actors can exploit them. Decentralized Incident Response: Establish clear protocols for rapid response, including the ability to pause specific functions or markets, and transparent communication strategies. Continuous Monitoring: Implement real-time monitoring systems to detect anomalous activities, unusual transaction patterns, or potential exploits as they happen. Community Engagement: Foster an active and vigilant community that can help identify and report potential issues, acting as an additional layer of oversight. The swift action taken by Resupply to pause the compromised contract and communicate transparently is a positive example of effective incident management in the face of a significant smart contract hack . This level of responsiveness is vital for maintaining user trust and ensuring the long-term viability of stablecoin protocols and the broader DeFi ecosystem. The Road Ahead for Resupply and the Future of DeFi Security As Resupply prepares to release its full post-mortem, the focus will shift towards understanding the root cause of the crypto vulnerability and implementing robust measures to prevent future occurrences. Rebuilding trust after a significant exploit is a challenging but achievable goal. Protocols that demonstrate transparency, accountability, and a commitment to enhanced DeFi security often emerge stronger from such trials, learning from their experiences to build more resilient systems. The incident serves as a crucial reminder that while DeFi offers unparalleled opportunities for financial innovation and inclusion, it also comes with inherent risks. The ongoing battle against malicious actors requires a collective effort from developers, auditors, users, and the wider community to continuously fortify the digital infrastructure that underpins this revolutionary financial system. Vigilance and continuous improvement are not just buzzwords; they are necessities for survival and growth in this dynamic space. What Does This Mean for Stablecoin Protocol Users? For users of stablecoin protocols and other DeFi platforms, this incident reinforces several key takeaways that can help navigate the risks: Diversify Your Holdings: Never put all your funds into a single protocol, regardless of its perceived safety. Spreading your investments can mitigate potential losses from a single exploit. Stay Informed: Follow official channels for updates and announcements, especially during security incidents. Reliable information is crucial. Understand the Risks: Be aware that even well-established projects can suffer from a smart contract hack . Understand the specific risks associated with each protocol you use. Prioritize Transparency: Support protocols that are transparent about their security measures, audit reports, and incident responses. Transparency builds trust and indicates a commitment to user safety. The Resupply exploit , while unfortunate, is a critical learning experience for the entire decentralized finance industry. It highlights the continuous need for innovation not just in financial products, but equally in the sophisticated security mechanisms required to protect them, fostering a more secure and resilient future for all participants.

On Thursday, during a summit in Brussels, EU officials said a new American proposal had been submitted and shared with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who then pushed it to EU leaders. The offer, described by officials as just an “outline” with “a couple of points,” showed up while the bloc scrambles to avoid steep new tariffs that Trump has set for July 9. The US president had previously warned that if no deal is reached by that date, tariffs would go up. According to Bloomberg, the China deal was confirmed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who said during an interview that “that deal was signed and sealed two days ago.” He didn’t elaborate on what’s in the document. Just hours earlier, Trump himself told reporters at the White House, “We just signed with China yesterday,” but offered no explanation. The agreement is based on trade talks that happened last month in Geneva, though no final text has been released publicly. White House pushes deadline but says Trump can act unilaterally Karoline Leavitt, the White House Press Secretary, said on Thursday that Trump’s July 8 and 9 deadlines for restoring full reciprocal tariffs aren’t fixed in stone. “Perhaps it could be extended, but that’s a decision for the president to make,” Leavitt told reporters. She made it clear that even if countries refuse to sign a deal by the deadline, Trump still has options. “The president can simply provide these countries with a deal,” she said. “And that means the president can pick a reciprocal tariff rate that he believes is advantageous for the United States, and for the American worker.” Leavitt’s statement triggered an immediate rise in stocks during Thursday’s session, with investors reacting to the idea that the president might give countries more time. This comes after Trump rolled out reciprocal tariffs in early April on nearly all imports. A 90-day pause was granted for any tariff amounts above 10%, and that grace period runs out on July 8. In late May, Trump went a step further. He threatened to slap a 50% tariff on all goods coming from the European Union. These countries were already hit with the April tariffs. But after von der Leyen asked for more time to finalize a deal, Trump agreed to delay the extra tariff until July 9. That’s the exact window EU leaders are trying to navigate right now with the fresh US proposal. Trump admin expects deals after tax bill clears Congress With only two deals, China and the United Kingdom, done out of a goal of 90 in 90 days, the White House is far behind its own timeline. Both agreements have been described as incomplete frameworks with no final terms released. One deal that keeps getting mentioned is with India, but that hasn’t happened yet. Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council, told Fox Business this week, “We know that we’re very, very close to a few countries.” He added that more agreements are expected once Congress passes Trump’s large-scale tax-and-spending bill, which the president wants signed by July 4. Hassett said, “I think you’re going to see a sequence of trade bills” starting from that date. Back in June, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent testified before the House Ways and Means Committee, saying it’s “highly likely” that Trump will extend the tariff pause beyond July 8 for countries negotiating in good faith. Stephen Miran, who chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told Yahoo Finance the same thing: “I don’t see why [tariff] rates would snap back higher” if talks are ongoing and serious. Still, none of these statements come with hard guarantees. What’s happening is a calculated game of pressure. The administration’s current stance is that Trump can impose or extend tariffs unilaterally, especially if he believes doing so benefits US industries. With China’s deal already completed and EU leaders now reviewing a last-minute American proposal, the heat is rising fast. Negotiations are now running on a tight clock. The EU knows exactly what’s coming if there’s no agreement by July 9. Trump’s team has already drawn the line. He’s offered a proposal. He’s closed with China. And if no other country wants to sit down and finalize something? The White House says he’ll simply impose his own terms.

This trend provides critical insight into miner behavior, according to the latest report by CryptoQuant. Bitcoin Miners Show Patience Historically, BTC.com increases its outflows to Binance when Bitcoin’s price rises, indicating strategic profit-taking at local tops. On the other hand, when flows drop, it reflects growing miner confidence, as they choose to hold their Bitcoin rather than sell. Interestingly, despite Bitcoin trading above $100K in recent months, BTC.com’s flows to Binance have sharply declined. This suggests that miners are anticipating further price appreciation and are reducing selling pressure, potentially supporting a more sustained rally. “Miners are among the smartest players in the market. Watching their moves helps us understand where we are in the cycle.” Zooming out, a deeper look at network-level data reveals a “seasonal” trend. Hash Rate Seasonality The latest development comes as Bitcoin briefly fell below $100,000 this weekend after reports emerged of a US strike on Iranian nuclear sites, dropping to $98,000 in a swift response to geopolitical tensions. However, the dip was short-lived, as the crypto asset rebounded by early Monday. Despite the recent price milestones, Bitcoin’s on-chain transaction fees remain weak, as per the latest observation by Digital Mining Solutions. In 2025, fees have consistently accounted for less than 1% of the total block reward and have failed to offset the halving-induced subsidy cuts. This weak fee environment means miner revenue, or hash price, is tightly correlated to Bitcoin’s price. When BTC falls, hashprice drops nearly in sync, with minimal fee support to cushion the decline. Bitcoin’s network hash rate has been highly volatile this year, and has seen several record highs and sharp drops. It peaked at 950 EH/s in mid-June before plunging to 827 EH/s – a 13% decline.

Bloomberg, citing info from Crane Data LLC, reports that the amount of capital invested in the money-market industry has now soared to a record $7.4 trillion, with $320 billion pouring into the funds in 2025 so far. Money-market funds are financial instruments that allow people to invest in lower-risk and short-term debt securities, including US Treasuries. Deborah Cunningham, chief investment officer for global liquidity markets at Federated Hermes, tells Bloomberg that the Federal Reserve’s ongoing monetary policy choices suggest the money market industry could continue to grow and easily stretch to $7.5 trillion in assets this year. “Five-percent-plus rates were nirvana, four-percent-plus is still very good – and if we dip down into the high threes, that’s quite acceptable as well.” The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced last week that it planned to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25-4.5%, arguing that it was the most suitable level to achieve both maximum employment and controlled inflation. The Fed has held interest rates steady since December, when it cut the rate by 0.25%. Michael Bird, senior fund manager at Allspring Global Investments, tells Bloomberg that it’s “not surprising” that asset levels in the money-market sector have grown. “Even if the Fed picks up its easing campaign this year, rates will still be relatively high…” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The exchange has temporarily suspended all deposits and withdrawals of the FLR token . This crucial decision stems from a significant technical issue: a halt in block production on the underlying Flare network. For anyone holding or trading FLR, understanding the implications of this Upbit FLR suspension is paramount. Why the Upbit FLR Suspension Matters When a major crypto exchange like Upbit announces a suspension of services for a particular asset, it sends ripples through the market. Upbit, being one of the largest exchanges in South Korea, plays a vital role in the global crypto ecosystem. Their official statement highlighted that the immediate cause for the suspension was an issue directly related to the Flare network itself. Specifically, the network experienced a complete halt in its block production, which is akin to a blockchain’s heartbeat stopping. Without new blocks being produced, transactions cannot be processed, making any deposit or withdrawal activity impossible and unsafe for users. This proactive measure by Upbit is standard protocol to protect user funds and prevent potential issues during network instability. While inconvenient, such suspensions are often necessary to maintain the integrity of transactions and ensure the security of assets on the platform. Understanding the Critical Flare Network Halt So, what exactly does a ‘halt in block production’ mean for a blockchain network like Flare? Imagine a train track where trains (transactions) move from station to station (blocks). If the track construction suddenly stops, no new trains can move forward. In blockchain terms, a halt means that the network is no longer able to validate and add new transactions to the ledger. This can happen for various reasons, including: Consensus mechanism issues: Problems with how network participants agree on the next block. Software bugs: Unforeseen errors in the network’s code. Network congestion: Although less common for a full halt, extreme congestion can lead to processing failures. Security incidents: While not confirmed in this case, attacks can sometimes disrupt block production. The Flare network halt directly impacts the usability of the FLR token, as its movement relies entirely on the underlying network’s functionality. Until the Flare team resolves the issue and block production resumes, the token remains in a state of operational limbo. What This Means for FLR Token Holders For individuals holding the FLR token on Upbit, the immediate consequence is the inability to move their assets. This means you cannot deposit more FLR into your Upbit account or withdraw existing FLR to an external wallet or another exchange. It’s important to note that your funds are typically safe during such suspensions, as the exchange is preventing transactions, not accessing your holdings. Key considerations for FLR token holders: Patience is key: Network issues are usually temporary, and development teams work diligently to resolve them. Stay informed: Monitor official announcements from Upbit and the Flare Network’s official channels (website, Twitter, Discord) for updates on the resolution. Consider your strategy: While you cannot move FLR on Upbit, if you hold FLR on other exchanges or in self-custody wallets, their functionality might vary depending on their integration with Flare and the network’s overall status. Navigating Crypto Deposit Withdrawal Challenges The situation with Upbit and FLR highlights a broader challenge within the cryptocurrency space: the occasional necessity for exchanges to implement crypto deposit withdrawal suspensions. These measures are not unique to Upbit or Flare and can occur across any blockchain or exchange due to a variety of factors, including: Network upgrades: Scheduled maintenance or hard forks. Security audits: Temporary halts for routine security checks. Regulatory compliance: Adjustments to meet new legal requirements. High network fees/congestion: To prevent users from incurring excessive costs for failed transactions. While frustrating for users, these actions are often taken to safeguard assets and ensure a smooth, secure trading environment once the underlying issue is resolved. It underscores the importance of understanding the operational nuances of both the tokens you hold and the exchanges you use. The Role of Upbit Crypto Exchange in Crisis Management As a leading Upbit crypto exchange , its response to such incidents is crucial for maintaining user trust and market stability. Upbit’s swift announcement demonstrates transparency and a commitment to keeping its users informed. In such situations, the exchange’s primary responsibilities include: Immediate communication: Notifying users promptly about the suspension and its reasons. Monitoring and coordination: Working closely with the Flare network’s development team to get real-time updates on the issue’s resolution. Ensuring asset safety: Protecting user funds during the downtime. Resumption of services: Reinstating deposit and withdrawal functionality as soon as the network stabilizes and it’s safe to do so. Users should always rely on official announcements from Upbit’s website or their verified social media channels for the most accurate and timely information regarding the resumption of FLR services. Conclusion: Staying Informed in a Dynamic Crypto Landscape The temporary Upbit FLR suspension due to a Flare network halt serves as a potent reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such incidents can cause concern, they are often temporary operational hurdles that blockchain networks and exchanges navigate. For FLR token holders and users of the Upbit crypto exchange , the best course of action is to remain calm, verify information from official sources, and patiently await updates. The ability to perform a seamless crypto deposit withdrawal is fundamental to the user experience, and exchanges like Upbit are typically quick to restore these services once network stability is assured.

While both tokens are trading below their year-to-date highs, analysts aren’t writing them off just yet. Technical signals, community sentiment, and macro catalysts suggest strong moves could be brewing—but there’s another token that’s starting to outshine them on watchlists: MAGACOIN FINANCE , an early-stage presale project quietly generating serious heat. XRP Looks Poised—But Needs Catalysts to Deliver XRP is currently hovering around the $2.17–$2.20 range, locked in a period of tight consolidation. At first glance, the sideways movement might appear uninspiring. But under the hood, something different is happening. Whale transactions to exchanges have dropped off completely. The number of wallets holding more than 1 million XRP just hit a 12-year high. Daily active addresses are surging. All signs point to quiet accumulation. Traders are now watching for the next leg up. Forecasts suggest a move to $2.50 is in play if current momentum holds, with $3.00 firmly on the table if institutional demand reappears and ETF chatter intensifies. The MVRV Z-score—an often overlooked but historically accurate valuation tool—still places XRP well below its overbought zone, suggesting there’s room for growth. But even with all this lining up, XRP remains dependent on macro factors: legal clarity, regulatory shifts, and broader market sentiment. It’s a heavyweight asset—but it still needs a green light to sprint. Dogecoin’s Next Act May Come From the Crowd Dogecoin, currently trading around $0.17, is far from its 2021 peak. Volume has cooled, and sentiment remains mixed. But the technicals are whispering something different. DOGE is moving within a symmetrical triangle—a classic breakout pattern. If it cracks $0.22, analysts say a move to $0.35 or even $0.36 could follow quickly. As always, Dogecoin’s power lies in its community. It doesn’t need institutional adoption or DeFi utility to pump. It just needs attention—and in past cycles, that’s been enough. With Bitcoin expected to stabilize during the summer, altcoins like DOGE could ride the wave of renewed interest. But traders remain cautious. A rally isn’t guaranteed. Without strong external hype, the price could remain capped near $0.30. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Challenger Turning Heads in Q3 While XRP and Dogecoin prepare for their next potential moves, a much newer name is generating the kind of speculative momentum that hasn’t been seen since early SHIBA or PEPE. MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in presale—but that hasn’t stopped it from attracting thousands of early adopters and a fast-growing base of online supporters. It’s not just the memes or the messaging. MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a high-volatility, fixed-supply ecosystem at the intersection of politics, finance, and decentralized speculation. With 170 billion tokens locked as the total supply, traders see a clear path for explosive growth—especially once the token hits public markets. Presale access remains limited, but interest is growing daily. While XRP and DOGE fight to regain relevance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering something even more valuable: the chance to get in early on a high-risk, high-reward altcoin narrative before the crowd catches on. Final Word: Traders Are Watching—but Investors Are Acting There’s no doubt XRP and Dogecoin will be closely watched in Q3. Technical setups are aligned. Forecasts hint at upside. But both rely on catalysts outside their control—whether that’s regulatory breakthroughs or revived community enthusiasm. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already moving. It doesn’t need to reclaim lost ground. It’s starting from scratch—and racing upward. For traders who missed the last wave of viral presales, this may be the only second chance worth taking.

If so, you’ve likely heard the buzz around its incredible potential. The cryptocurrency world is often a whirlwind of rapid movements and unexpected turns, but savvy analysts look for underlying patterns to guide their predictions. One such pattern, highlighted by crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr., points to a compelling indicator for future growth: the persistent accumulation by Long-Term Holders (LTHs). This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a historical blueprint that has previously paved the way for significant rallies, making it a crucial signal for anyone interested in the future trajectory of the leading digital asset. Understanding Long-Term Holders: The Backbone of Bitcoin’s Strength Who exactly are these Long-Term Holders , and why does their behavior matter so much for Bitcoin ‘s market dynamics? LTHs are individuals or entities who hold their BTC for extended periods, typically over 155 days, signaling a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value rather than short-term speculative gains. They are often seen as the ‘diamond hands’ of the crypto space, less likely to sell during price dips and more inclined to buy during periods of consolidation or even correction. Reduced Selling Pressure: When LTHs accumulate, it means fewer coins are available on exchanges for sale, naturally tightening supply. Strong Conviction: Their holding behavior reflects a deep belief in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition and future appreciation. Market Stability: LTHs act as a stabilizing force, absorbing supply and reducing volatility compared to short-term traders. Their collective actions provide a powerful insight into the underlying sentiment of the market’s most patient participants. When these experienced investors are actively increasing their positions, it often suggests they anticipate significant upward movement, reinforcing the overall bullish outlook for the asset. Historical Precedent: When LTH Accumulation Ignited Bitcoin’s Rallies Axel Adler Jr.’s analysis isn’t based on mere speculation; it’s rooted in observable historical patterns that have consistently preceded major Bitcoin surges. Examining past cycles reveals a clear correlation between sustained LTH accumulation and subsequent price explosions. This isn’t just anecdotal evidence; it’s a recurring theme in Bitcoin’s journey. Consider these compelling examples from Bitcoin’s history: Accumulation Period (Approx. BTC Price) LTH Action Subsequent Price Rally (Approx. Target) Timeframe $28,000 Ramped up long positions Jumped to $60,000 Approx. 2 months later $60,000 Continued strong accumulation Rose to $100,000 Following period These instances are not isolated. They demonstrate a consistent pattern where a period of quiet, yet persistent, accumulation by LTHs sets the stage for explosive upward movements. This behavior is akin to winding a spring; the more it’s compressed, the more force it releases when unleashed. For Bitcoin , LTH accumulation represents that compression. Current Trends: What Does LTH Accumulation Signal for Bitcoin’s Price Prediction? If history is any guide, the current robust accumulation by Long-Term Holders paints an incredibly optimistic picture for Bitcoin ‘s immediate future. Analyst Axel Adler Jr. explicitly states that if the present situation mirrors past cycles, the flagship cryptocurrency is poised for a significant rally, potentially targeting a remarkable $160,000. This projection isn’t merely a hopeful guess; it’s an extrapolation based on established market behavior. The fact that LTHs are consistently building their positions, even amidst market fluctuations, underscores a profound confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. They are not deterred by short-term volatility, instead viewing current prices as opportune entry points for future gains. This sustained accumulation reduces the circulating supply available for sale, creating an environment ripe for upward price pressure when demand eventually surges. The Broader Crypto Market: How Bitcoin’s Trajectory Influences Altcoins Bitcoin ‘s dominance often dictates the overall sentiment and direction of the wider crypto market . As the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, its movements have a ripple effect across thousands of altcoins. When Bitcoin experiences a significant rally, it often pulls the entire market upward, leading to an ‘altcoin season’ where other cryptocurrencies also see substantial gains. Why is Bitcoin’s performance so pivotal? Gateway Asset: Bitcoin is typically the first cryptocurrency institutional and retail investors buy, acting as the primary entry point into the crypto ecosystem. Liquidity Anchor: Its sheer size provides a foundational layer of liquidity that supports the entire market. Sentiment Driver: Positive news or price action for Bitcoin tends to generate broader enthusiasm and investor confidence across the board. Therefore, if LTH accumulation indeed propels Bitcoin towards the $160,000 mark, it’s highly probable that we will witness a broader bullish trend engulfing the entire crypto market , offering opportunities across various digital assets. This interconnectedness means that understanding Bitcoin’s signals is paramount for navigating the broader crypto landscape. Navigating the Future: Actionable Insights for Investors While the signals from Long-Term Holders are undeniably bullish, it’s crucial for investors to approach the crypto market with a well-informed strategy. A potential Bitcoin price prediction of $160,000 is exciting, but responsible investing requires diligence and a clear understanding of both opportunities and risks. What Should Investors Consider? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information and understand the underlying fundamentals of any asset you invest in. Analyst predictions are indicators, not guarantees. Long-Term Perspective: Emulate the LTHs. Bitcoin’s volatility can be intense in the short term, but its long-term trend has historically been upward. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin, if appropriate for your risk tolerance. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain metrics, macroeconomic factors, and regulatory developments that could influence the market. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider regularly investing a fixed amount, regardless of price, to smooth out market volatility and benefit from long-term accumulation . The consistent accumulation by LTHs is a powerful vote of confidence, but the path to $160,000, while projected, will likely not be a straight line. Market corrections and unexpected events are always possible, making a resilient strategy essential. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Remarkable Journey Continues, Fueled by LTH Conviction The compelling evidence presented by analyst Axel Adler Jr. regarding Long-Term Holders ‘ persistent accumulation provides a potent bullish narrative for Bitcoin . This isn’t just about a hopeful price prediction ; it’s about understanding the deep-seated confidence of the most committed participants in the crypto market . History has repeatedly shown that when LTHs are actively building their positions, significant rallies often follow, transforming what might seem like ordinary market activity into a prelude for extraordinary gains. As Bitcoin continues its remarkable journey, the unwavering conviction of its LTHs serves as a powerful testament to its enduring value proposition. While no investment is without risk, the current patterns suggest a future brimming with potential, positioning Bitcoin for what could be one of its most impressive surges yet. For those looking to understand the core drivers of Bitcoin’s next potential leap, the actions of its long-term holders offer an invaluable compass.

For businesses and investors navigating the volatile yet promising world of cryptocurrencies, clarity in financial reporting is not just a preference—it’s an absolute necessity. In a significant move that underscores its progressive stance on financial innovation, the Central Bank of Brazil is stepping up to address this critical need, ushering in a new era for digital asset accounting . Why Brazil Crypto Regulation is Taking Center Stage Brazil has long been recognized as a trailblazer in financial technology adoption, from its highly successful PIX instant payment system to its proactive exploration of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). This innovative spirit extends naturally to its approach to cryptocurrencies. The recent announcement from the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) to update its accounting rules for digital assets held by companies is not just a bureaucratic formality; it’s a strategic move to integrate digital finance more seamlessly into the traditional economy. This forward-thinking approach aims to provide the much-needed legal and accounting certainty that institutional players and large corporations require to fully embrace the digital asset space. It signals Brazil’s commitment to fostering a secure and transparent environment for crypto innovation, setting a precedent for other nations to follow. Understanding the Nuances of Digital Asset Accounting For many years, companies holding cryptocurrencies or engaging in digital asset activities have faced significant ambiguity regarding how these assets should be classified and reported on their balance sheets. Unlike traditional assets, digital assets possess unique characteristics, such as decentralization, pseudonymity, and high price volatility, which pose complex challenges for conventional accounting principles. The BCB’s initiative seeks to demystify this process, providing specific guidelines for various types of digital assets. This includes, but is not limited to, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, stablecoins, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and even potential future CBDCs. The new rules will clarify how companies should record assets that are: Issued: How to account for tokens or digital currencies that a company itself creates and issues. Received: Guidelines for recording digital assets obtained through sales, services, or investments. Held in Custody: Clear rules for financial institutions or service providers that hold digital assets on behalf of clients. This comprehensive approach is vital for ensuring accurate financial statements, which in turn builds investor confidence and reduces regulatory risk for businesses operating in the crypto sphere. The Role of the Central Bank Brazil in Shaping Crypto Policy The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) has consistently demonstrated a pragmatic and measured approach to financial innovation. Rather than outright bans or excessive restrictions, the BCB has opted for a strategy of understanding, adapting, and integrating new technologies into its regulatory framework. This latest update to accounting rules is a testament to this philosophy. By initiating a public consultation on the regulatory draft, which began on August 24, the BCB is inviting stakeholders—including crypto companies, financial institutions, accounting firms, and the general public—to provide feedback. This collaborative approach is crucial for developing robust and practical regulations that truly serve the needs of the market while safeguarding financial stability. The BCB’s proactive engagement helps ensure that the new rules are not just theoretically sound but also operationally feasible for businesses navigating the complexities of digital assets. Setting New Crypto Accounting Standards: A Global Precedent? The move by Brazil’s central bank comes at a time when global financial bodies and national regulators are grappling with the challenge of establishing clear crypto accounting standards . Currently, there’s no universally accepted framework, leading to inconsistencies in how digital assets are treated across different jurisdictions. Some countries classify them as intangible assets, others as commodities, and some even as currencies. Brazil’s detailed approach, particularly its inclusion of specific scenarios like staking and airdrops, could potentially serve as a blueprint or at least a significant case study for other nations and international standard-setting bodies like the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) or the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). By providing clear guidelines for these complex transactions, Brazil is contributing to the broader effort to bring greater transparency and comparability to financial reporting in the digital asset space. This clarity is essential for fostering institutional adoption and integrating crypto into the mainstream financial system. Navigating Staking and Airdrops Accounting Complexities One of the most anticipated aspects of the BCB’s new rules is their specific coverage of assets derived from staking and airdrops accounting . These activities, while common in the crypto world, present unique accounting challenges: Staking: When users lock up their cryptocurrencies to support the operations of a blockchain network, they often receive rewards in return. The accounting treatment of these rewards – whether they are considered income, a new asset, or something else – has been a grey area. The new rules are expected to provide clarity on when and how these rewards should be recognized and valued. Airdrops: These are distributions of free tokens to a large number of cryptocurrency wallet addresses, often as a marketing strategy or a way to decentralize ownership. Determining the fair value of airdropped tokens, especially if they have no immediate market, and how they impact a company’s income or assets, has been a significant hurdle. By addressing these specific scenarios, the BCB is demonstrating a deep understanding of the intricacies of the crypto ecosystem, moving beyond generic definitions to provide actionable guidance for businesses engaged in these popular activities. This will undoubtedly reduce uncertainty and help companies ensure compliance with tax and financial reporting obligations. Benefits of Clear Digital Asset Accounting Rules The implementation of updated accounting rules for digital assets offers a multitude of benefits for the Brazilian economy and its participants: Enhanced Transparency: Clear rules lead to more accurate and comparable financial statements, providing stakeholders with a true picture of a company’s digital asset holdings and activities. Increased Investor Confidence: With greater transparency and reduced accounting ambiguity, investors, both domestic and international, will feel more secure in allocating capital to companies involved in the digital asset space. Reduced Regulatory Risk: Businesses will have a clearer understanding of their obligations, minimizing the risk of non-compliance, penalties, and legal challenges. Facilitated Institutional Adoption: Financial institutions and large corporations, which often operate under strict accounting standards, will find it easier to engage with digital assets once the accounting framework is clear. Improved Tax Compliance: Clear accounting rules naturally pave the way for more straightforward tax reporting and collection related to digital asset activities. Fostering Innovation: By providing a stable regulatory environment, Brazil encourages further innovation in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors, attracting talent and investment. Challenges on the Horizon While the move is overwhelmingly positive, implementing these new rules won’t be without its challenges: Complexity of Digital Assets: The sheer variety and evolving nature of digital assets mean that accounting rules must be flexible enough to adapt to future innovations. Valuation Difficulties: The volatile nature of many cryptocurrencies can make consistent and accurate valuation challenging, requiring frequent re-evaluations. Need for Skilled Professionals: Companies will require accountants and auditors with specialized knowledge of digital assets and blockchain technology to ensure proper implementation of the new rules. International Harmonization: As Brazil sets its standards, the challenge remains for these rules to align with, or at least be reconcilable with, global accounting practices to facilitate cross-border operations. Technological Integration: Accounting systems may need significant upgrades to accurately track and report digital asset transactions in accordance with the new guidelines. Actionable Insights for Businesses and Investors For companies currently holding or planning to engage with digital assets in Brazil, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Actively follow the public consultation process and the finalization of the new accounting rules by the Central Bank of Brazil. Assess Current Holdings: Conduct an internal audit of all digital assets currently held, including those from staking and airdrops, to understand their nature and volume. Engage with Experts: Seek advice from legal, accounting, and tax professionals who specialize in digital assets to understand the implications for your specific business. Prepare for System Updates: Evaluate your current accounting software and systems to determine if they can handle the new reporting requirements for digital assets. Provide Feedback: If you have insights or concerns, participate in the public consultation process to help shape the final regulatory framework. Train Your Team: Ensure your finance and accounting teams are educated on the specifics of digital asset accounting and the new Brazilian regulations. A New Dawn for Digital Finance in Brazil The Central Bank of Brazil’s initiative to update accounting rules for digital assets is a pivotal moment for the nation’s burgeoning digital finance sector. By providing much-needed clarity and structure, Brazil is not just reacting to the rise of cryptocurrencies; it is actively shaping a responsible and transparent future for them. This move will undoubtedly pave the way for greater institutional participation, foster innovation, and solidify Brazil’s position as a leader in the global digital economy. As the public consultation progresses and the final rules take shape, the entire crypto community will be watching, eager to see how this crucial step influences the broader conversation around digital asset regulation worldwide.

According to his LinkedIn profile, Bar-Nathan officially took the position in June. He joins Google Cloud from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, where he was CFO and was critical in steering Oracle’s financial strategy in its fast-paced expansion into cloud services. Before Oracle, he was in leadership roles at Microsoft, including in cloud finance, affording him a deep perspective on three of the world’s top five clouds. Alphabet has not posted any formal announcement, but a spokesman for the company confirmed to reporters that Bar-Nathan commenced in the new position in the past two weeks. Oracle declined to comment. Hiring move intensifies Cloud industry battle The hire recognizes the high-stakes race in a cloud-computing industry that has become increasingly competitive. Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure are growing competitors in a space still heavily controlled by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. According to a report from Synergy Research Group, the market is currently dominated by Amazon, which has about 1/3 of the market share, followed by Microsoft. Google is number three, and Oracle is number five. Both companies are behind the top two, but they have made a name for themselves with aggressive pricing, AI integrations, and solutions for particular industries. Google has a unique advantage in Bar-Nathan’s diverse background. His understanding of Oracle’s internal cloud finance playbook could help Google Cloud fine-tune its pricing models, cost management, and go-to-market strategy. The move also stokes a rivalry between the two tech giants. It’s worth noting that Thomas Kurian, now CEO of Google Cloud, was a long-time Oracle executive next to Ellison, who left over reported disputes around the Oracle cloud strategy. Alphabet’s Google Cloud becomes AI growth engine Google Cloud has become one of Alphabet’s most promising business divisions . The former loss-making division has now posted several consecutive quarters of operating profits against many analysts’ expectations. Fuelled by Kurian’s leadership and Alphabet’s growing focus on AI-centric enterprise business segments, the division has become a strategic cornerstone of the company’s future expansion. The momentum also follows Google Cloud’s recent efforts to expand its AI structures. The company has increasingly been bulking up its AI product and service portfolio, particularly as it courts enterprise customers building large language models and generative AI apps on its cloud. Alphabet’s commitment to AI is aligned with cloud infrastructure. Over the past year, the company announced new data centers, bespoke AI chips (TPUs), growth, and new business partnerships in healthcare, finance, and retail. Oracle, meanwhile, has been following the same playbook. Oracle, the software and cloud company, made waves earlier this year with “Project Stargate,” a joint effort to provide OpenAI with enormous computing power. This is a sign that Oracle, too, has aggressive plans in the AI cloud race. The project is meant to strengthen Oracle’s infrastructure offerings and give it exposure to the developers building AI.

Binance , the global blockchain ecosystem, has officially announced the upcoming launch of the SAHARA/USDT perpetual contract . This highly anticipated listing, set to go live on June 26 at 12:00 UTC, is generating significant buzz, especially with its staggering offer of up to 75x leverage . For traders seeking to amplify their positions and capitalize on market movements, this new contract presents a compelling opportunity. Understanding the SAHARA/USDT Perpetual Contract What exactly is a perpetual contract, and why is the SAHARA/USDT pairing significant? A perpetual contract is a type of futures contract that, unlike traditional futures, has no expiry date. This allows traders to hold positions indefinitely, as long as they meet margin requirements. It’s a cornerstone of modern crypto trading , offering flexibility and continuous exposure to price action. The SAHARA/USDT contract means you’ll be trading the SAHARA token against Tether (USDT), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This pairing is popular for its stability and liquidity, making it easier for traders to enter and exit positions without significant slippage. While specific details about the SAHARA project itself are still emerging, its listing on Binance’s robust futures platform instantly grants it massive visibility and potential for increased liquidity. Key Features of Perpetual Contracts: No Expiry Date: Hold positions as long as you maintain margin. Funding Rate: A mechanism that keeps the contract price aligned with the underlying asset’s spot price. High Liquidity: Typically, perpetual contracts on major exchanges like Binance offer deep liquidity, allowing for efficient trading. Unleashing the Power of 75x Leverage: What Does it Mean for Traders? The headline feature of this new listing is undoubtedly the incredible 75x leverage . But what does this truly entail for your trading strategy? Leverage, in simple terms, is borrowed capital used to increase the potential return of an investment. With 75x leverage, a trader can control a position worth 75 times their initial capital (margin). For example, with just $100 of your own funds, you could open a position worth $7,500. This dramatically amplifies potential profits from even small price movements in the SAHARA/USDT pair. Benefits and Risks of High Leverage: While the allure of amplified gains is strong, it’s crucial to understand both sides of the coin: Benefits: Magnified Profits: Small price movements can lead to substantial gains. Capital Efficiency: You don’t need a large amount of capital to open significant positions. Diverse Strategies: Enables more complex trading strategies like hedging or arbitrage with less capital. Challenges and Risks: Amplified Losses: Just as profits are magnified, so are losses. A small adverse price movement can quickly wipe out your initial margin. Liquidation Risk: If your position moves against you and your margin falls below a certain threshold, your position will be automatically closed (liquidated) to prevent further losses. This is a common occurrence with high leverage. Increased Volatility Impact: Highly volatile assets, when traded with high leverage, can lead to rapid liquidations. Consider this simplified example of how leverage works: Leverage Initial Capital (Margin) Position Size Required Price Movement for 100% Loss (Approx.) 1x $100 $100 100% 10x $100 $1,000 10% 50x $100 $5,000 2% 75x $100 $7,500 ~1.33% As you can see, with 75x leverage , a mere 1.33% adverse price movement against your position could result in the loss of your entire initial margin. This underscores the critical need for robust risk management. Navigating High-Leverage Crypto Trading on Binance While the opportunity presented by the SAHARA/USDT perpetual contract with 75x leverage is significant, success hinges on careful planning and disciplined execution. Binance offers a comprehensive suite of tools and features designed to help traders manage their positions effectively. Actionable Insights for Responsible Trading: Start Small: Especially if you’re new to high leverage, begin with small position sizes to get comfortable with the mechanics. Utilize Stop-Loss Orders: Always set a stop-loss order. This is your most critical tool for risk management, automatically closing your position if the price moves against you beyond a predefined point, limiting potential losses. Understand Liquidation Price: Binance clearly displays your liquidation price. Always be aware of it and monitor your margin ratio. Don’t Over-Leverage: Just because 75x leverage is available doesn’t mean you have to use it. Many experienced traders opt for lower leverage (e.g., 5x, 10x, 20x) to reduce liquidation risk. Educate Yourself: Before diving in, thoroughly understand how Binance Futures works, including margin calls, funding rates, and different order types. Monitor Market Conditions: Crypto markets are highly volatile. Stay informed about market news, SAHARA-specific developments, and overall sentiment. What Does This Mean for the SAHARA Ecosystem? The listing of SAHARA/USDT on Binance Futures is a significant milestone for the SAHARA project. It brings: Increased Visibility: Exposure to Binance’s massive global user base. Enhanced Liquidity: Futures contracts often attract substantial trading volume, which can contribute to overall market depth for SAHARA. Price Discovery: The futures market can play a crucial role in the price discovery of an asset. Broader Adoption: Easier access for traders means more opportunities for the SAHARA token to be traded and utilized. While the primary focus of this announcement is the trading opportunity, the underlying project benefits immensely from such a high-profile listing on a leading exchange like Binance. Ready to Dive In? Your Next Steps For those looking to engage with the SAHARA/USDT perpetual contract , ensure your Binance account is set up for Futures trading. Familiarize yourself with the platform’s features, especially risk management tools. Remember, high rewards come with high risks, and a well-thought-out strategy is your best asset. Binance continues to solidify its position as a leading platform for crypto trading , constantly expanding its offerings to meet the diverse needs of its global user base. The addition of SAHARA/USDT with 75x leverage is a testament to its commitment to providing cutting-edge trading instruments. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Crypto Trading The launch of the SAHARA/USDT perpetual contract on Binance with an impressive 75x leverage capability marks a thrilling new chapter for the SAHARA project and the broader crypto trading community. While the potential for substantial gains is undeniable, the amplified risks associated with high leverage demand a cautious and informed approach. Traders who prioritize risk management, utilize stop-loss orders, and continuously educate themselves on market dynamics will be best positioned to navigate this exciting new opportunity. As the crypto market continues to evolve, offerings like these from Binance empower traders with diverse tools, but always remember: trade responsibly.

Dogecoin Awaits Critical Signal, Says Analyst",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/boom-or-bust-dogecoin-awaits-critical-signal/,"Dogecoin changed hands near $0.162 in late-European trading on June 26, little changed on the day but still more than 13% above last Sunday’s swing low. Yet beneath that placid price action, the market is balancing on what YouTube analyst More Crypto Online calls “a wait-and-see situation” that could ignite either a decisive upside impulse or a slide back toward $0.14. Dogecoin Teeters On The Edge In a video published yesterday under the headline “Is DOGE About to CRASH or SOAR? Price Analysis & Scenarios,” the Elliott-wave commentator argues that the advance from the June 22 bottom remains incomplete. “The Doge chart is currently still, yeah, trying to reverse here to the upside from the swing low that formed on the 22nd of June,” he says at the outset, stressing that the rise so far is “only a three-wave move.” Because the structure has not yet printed the full five-wave sequence that typically inaugurates a new bullish trend, he cautions traders against assuming the worst is over. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Rare Buy Signal—But One Move Could Ruin It The technician locates that June 22 low inside a demand band between $0.15 and $0.14, a zone that also includes the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the May–June rally and sits just above April’s cycle through—his hard “invalidation point.” From there, Dogecoin bounced in what he labels an a-b-c recovery, with the third wave peaking at $0.169, exactly the 1.618 Fibonacci extension he looks for in a “healthy third wave.” If price can now carve a fourth-wave higher low and extend to a fifth-wave high near $0.174–$0.177, the analyst says, “we actually get five waves up and then we can add support … and we have a setup.” Until that confirmation, the move remains a “chameleon-like” B-wave—prone to deeper pullbacks than the more bullish wave-two alternative. The line in the sand is $0.158. “Any break now below $0.158 cents would indicate the upside-reversal attempt is failed and we fall back into the support region, maybe we’ll even test the $0.14 level,” he warns. Conversely, holding that micro-support and punching through the $0.17 handle would provide the first “evidence” that a durable bottom has formed. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crash Far From Over? Analyst Reveals The Target The stakes are high because, as the analyst points out, confirmation of a five-wave impulse would force subsequent corrections to respect a higher-low framework, allowing traders to reposition with clearer risk parameters. Failure would likely drag Dogecoin back into the wide consolidation range that has dominated June and risk flipping sentiment toward a protracted downside grind. For now, the memecoin’s near-term fate rests on whether buyers can engineer that final fifth-wave pop without first violating $0.158. “At the moment,” he concludes, “we’re in a wait-and-see situation to see if we actually get five waves up.” Until the chart resolves, Dogecoin remains suspended between a technical breakout and another leg down—boom or bust hinging on a single intraday signal. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.161.

Retail and institutional investors are reconsidering their bets, especially as some high-profile coins plateau and new opportunities emerge. With Cardano and Solana delivering consistent performance but fewer surprises, attention is turning toward XRP and a rising star in the presale market — MAGACOIN FINANCE . It isn’t merely a matter of timing when it relates to rotating capital. It’s a matter of momentum, structure, and future returns. XRP is building momentum with increasing institutional alliances. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE has blitzed the presale market with a scarcity-based supply model. Cardano’s Steady Climb Faces Investor Fatigue Cardano continues to grow incrementally, with considerable expansion on DeFi platforms like Minswap and increased institutional exposure through Nasdaq indexes. The network maintains focus on upgrades and ecosystem growth. But the silence on ETFs or exchanges clamping down has seen some investors looking for alternatives. Even considering ADA’s $0.69 to $0.76 projections for the quarter, hope is not exactly high. Lacking a strong catalyst on the table, Cardano can simply keep moving forward at its steady pace, not having much incentive to be over-invested by short-term speculators. Solana’s Performance Remains Strong — But Is It Tapped Out? Solana maintains its title as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchains in operation. Projects like Raydium, Magic Eden, and Helium are thriving within its ecosystem. Solana’s real-time performance, with 65,000 transactions per second, remains impressive. Yet, resistance near the $175 mark has proven difficult to break. While a surge toward $200–$210 remains possible, many traders feel the coin is already pricing in much of its potential. As a result, eyes are drifting toward less saturated opportunities with greater upside. XRP Attracts Smart Money With Institutional Backing XRP is gaining serious traction in Q3 2025. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product is being adopted by over 200 U.S. financial institutions, cementing XRP’s use case in global payments. The legal clarity surrounding XRP has boosted investor confidence, especially as speculation grows around a possible ETF. Analysts are forecasting XRP to reach between $2.10 and $2.59 in the coming months. If ETF news or another partnership breaks, that range could move higher. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Dominating the 2025 Presale Market MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads and winning capital from investors who previously focused on large-cap tokens. With a capped supply of 170 billion and no VC allocations, the tokenomics are built to reward early holders. Each stage of the presale is selling out rapidly, showing undeniable traction and urgency. The HashEx-audited smart contract has instilled trust across both retail and institutional sectors. Unlike many tokens, there are no hidden unlocks or supply surprises. Analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is on track for potential 35x returns — a bold forecast, but one gaining traction across investment circles. Its politically charged branding has added to its visibility, helping it stand apart from meme coins lacking substance. More than hype, the project is backed by a roadmap, transparency, and a clear growth trajectory. Should Investors Reallocate Now? With Cardano and Solana delivering slow gains and limited short-term catalysts, XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting high-volume attention. XRP brings real utility and institutional engagement. MAGACOIN FINANCE brings fresh energy, supply control, and breakout potential that meme-era tokens once offered — but with structure. Analysts are calling this rotation one of the smarter moves of Q3. As market dynamics shift, early action often separates top performers from laggards. For investors looking at Q3 with growth in mind, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the most compelling paths, as early presale stages sold out like hotcakes.

Trump’s frustration with Powell’s slow pace on easing interest rates has reached a point where he’s considering replacing him this summer. But despite the pressure, Powell still has most of his policy team on his side. According to a detailed report from the Wall Street Journal, while a couple of Trump’s own picks are now backing a July cut, most of the Fed’s twelve voting members still prefer holding steady. Inside the Fed, it’s not quiet. Tensions are building ahead of the July policy meeting, where the committee might be split down the middle. On one side, you have Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both appointed by Trump, who say they’re open to cutting. On the other, a larger group, including all the key reserve bank presidents, are arguing there’s no rush. Bowman caught everyone off guard when she said she would support a rate cut in July. She was just named the Fed’s vice chair for supervision a few months ago and was one of the most hawkish members last year, even voting against a 0.5-point cut in September. That switch in tone came fast. Trump’s own appointees push back, but remain outnumbered Waller is also leaning toward a cut. He echoed Bowman’s view just last week, telling reporters he’s now open to loosening rates sooner than later. This dual push from both governors made traders nervous. Betting markets showed the odds of a July rate cut rose from 14% the week before to nearly 25% after Bowman’s comments. It looked like momentum was shifting, until the rest of the committee stepped in. John Williams, the New York Fed President, was the first to push back. He said the current target range of 4.25% to 4.5% is still “entirely appropriate,” and made it clear that the Fed should wait for more data before taking action. “We need to be vigilant in analyzing the totality of the data to see how conditions evolve,” he said. After Williams, other Fed presidents followed with the same message: don’t move too soon. Kevin Burgett, an analyst at LHMeyer, said flatly that “Waller and Bowman are definitely still outliers versus the committee as a whole.” That’s not just talk. If both Bowman and Waller vote for a cut next month and the rest of the committee doesn’t, it’ll be a rare moment. It’s been 32 years since two Washington-based Fed governors dissented in the same meeting. The divide is real. Matthew Luzzetti, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, said, “This is the most divided they’ve been in a good while.” The Fed’s internal projections make the disagreement even clearer. Of the voting members, ten support cutting rates two or three times before the year ends. Seven want to wait until 2026. The committee’s split is public now—and Trump is watching every move. He’s already pressuring Powell in public speeches and could name a new Fed chair soon. His options include any of the remaining six governors on the board, or an outsider when Adriana Kugler’s term ends in January. Tariff fears fuel more disagreement inside the Fed Trump’s loud demands for cheaper credit are clashing with warnings from economists inside the Fed. Powell, testifying before Congress this week, said the only reason rates haven’t already been cut is concern that new tariffs could trigger a new wave of inflation. Without those risks, the Fed might have acted already. Bowman and Waller argue there’s no real danger of that. Inflation has been dropping. Forecasts show that the Fed’s preferred inflation metric probably rose just 2.3% in the twelve months ending May, which is close enough to the 2% target. Waller thinks companies will absorb most of the tariff costs instead of passing them to shoppers. Bowman said the economy’s already slowing down and that means consumers won’t trigger another inflation spiral like the one seen in the early 2020s. But again, most Fed officials aren’t buying that. Williams pointed to a New York Fed survey showing that many businesses are passing all their tariff-related costs directly to consumers. Other economists believe companies may have front-loaded inventory before the tariffs hit, so the price impact just hasn’t shown up yet. With inflation memories still fresh, there’s concern that people are hyper-sensitive to even small price increases. That kind of panic can turn into real price pressure. Mary Daly, who runs the San Francisco Fed, also weighed in. She said that although she sees a path to lower rates later in the year, the risks of cutting now are too high. “I look more to the fall,” she told CNBC. Her voice adds to the majority who are saying: not yet. So, as July approaches, the Fed is walking a tightrope. Trump wants action. Bowman and Waller are nodding along. But Powell isn’t moving, at least not without more numbers. And the rest of the table is still on his side… for now.

Canadian cryptocurrency mining powerhouse, HIVE Digital Technologies, recently captivated the market with an announcement that vividly illustrates its robust financial health and astute foresight. As the fiscal year 2025 concluded, HIVE Digital proudly disclosed an impressive $181.1 million in digital asset holdings , a substantial portion of which is anchored by a significant 2,201 Bitcoin. This pivotal revelation offers more than just a financial snapshot; it provides profound insights into the operational prowess and sophisticated asset management framework of a true trailblazer in the digital economy. HIVE Digital’s Strategic Accumulation of Digital Asset Holdings What does it truly signify for a pioneering entity like HIVE Digital to command such a formidable sum in digital asset holdings ? This figure is not merely a number; it represents a meticulously curated portfolio of cryptocurrencies, predominantly Bitcoin, which HIVE has diligently mined and, critically, chosen to retain rather than immediately liquidate. This deliberate strategy transcends conventional corporate treasury management, reflecting a profound bullish conviction in the enduring value of these assets and a proactive decision to fortify its financial bedrock. A Modern Treasury Approach: Unlike traditional corporations that might hold cash or government bonds, HIVE Digital’s treasury strategy embraces the native assets of the digital realm. This approach positions them to directly benefit from the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies. Balance Sheet Fortification: These substantial holdings are a direct infusion of strength into the company’s balance sheet. They serve as a formidable reserve, offering unparalleled flexibility to fund future operational expansions, invest in cutting-edge technologies, or provide a vital buffer during inevitable market downturns. Unwavering Market Confidence: By choosing to ‘HODL’ a significant portion of its self-mined assets, HIVE Digital unequivocally signals its deep-seated confidence in the long-term appreciation trajectory of cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin leading the charge. This transparency can foster immense trust among investors, demonstrating that the company’s interests are intrinsically aligned with the success of the broader crypto ecosystem. What Does HIVE Digital’s Bitcoin Portfolio Reveal? The precise mention of 2,201 Bitcoin as a cornerstone of HIVE Digital’s treasury illuminates a critical facet of its financial strategy. Bitcoin, often hailed as ‘digital gold,’ remains the preeminent cryptocurrency, serving as a bellwether for the entire crypto market . For a dedicated mining company, accumulating and safeguarding such a significant Bitcoin portfolio is a nuanced strategic maneuver that extends far beyond routine operational considerations. The HODL Philosophy in Action: HIVE’s decision to hold over two thousand Bitcoin is a clear manifestation of a ‘HODL’ strategy. This implies a calculated long-term bet on Bitcoin’s future price appreciation, indicating that the company is not merely covering immediate operational expenses but actively building wealth through asset accumulation. Proof of Operational Excellence: The ability to retain such a large Bitcoin reserve strongly suggests that HIVE Digital’s mining operations are not just profitable, but exceptionally efficient. They are generating enough revenue to comfortably cover their considerable expenses without being forced to liquidate all their freshly mined Bitcoin. This speaks volumes about their rigorous cost management, energy optimization, and overall operational superiority, especially in light of the escalating mining difficulty and the recent Bitcoin halving events that compress margins for many miners. Strategic Market Exposure: This substantial Bitcoin portfolio also provides HIVE Digital with direct and significant exposure to Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. While this introduces a degree of volatility to their balance sheet, it also offers immense upside potential, allowing the company’s valuation to soar during pronounced bull markets, directly benefiting shareholders. The Dynamics of Cryptocurrency Mining in Today’s Market The landscape of cryptocurrency mining is a relentless arena of innovation, constantly reshaped by technological breakthroughs, evolving regulatory frameworks, and the fluctuating economics of energy. Companies like HIVE Digital operate at the vanguard of this demanding industry, where sustained success is inextricably linked to unparalleled efficiency and visionary strategic planning. Sustainability as a Core Pillar: A paramount consideration in modern crypto mining is energy consumption. HIVE Digital has consistently championed its unwavering commitment to harnessing sustainable and green energy sources. This dedication is not merely an environmental statement; it’s a strategic imperative that significantly reduces operational costs, enhances their global reputation, and aligns perfectly with critical ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investment criteria. This focus on clean energy also mitigates regulatory risks associated with high energy usage. Relentless Hardware Innovation: To maintain a competitive edge, mining companies must perpetually invest in the most advanced and energy-efficient mining hardware. This necessitates substantial capital expenditure, a challenge that robust digital asset holdings can effectively help finance, ensuring HIVE remains at the technological forefront. Navigating Halving Events: Bitcoin’s programmed halving events, which periodically halve the block reward for miners, represent a significant operational hurdle. These events fundamentally alter the revenue model. However, companies possessing strong balance sheets, exemplified by HIVE Digital’s asset base, and highly efficient operations are uniquely positioned to weather these periods of reduced revenue. They can often consolidate their market share as less efficient or undercapitalized miners are compelled to exit the industry, making the strong stronger. Navigating the Volatile Crypto Market: HIVE’s Approach The crypto market is famously characterized by its extreme volatility, with asset prices capable of experiencing dramatic swings within remarkably short periods. For an enterprise whose core product and treasury are intrinsically linked to these digital assets, the masterful management of this inherent volatility is not just important—it is existential. HIVE Digital’s substantial holdings are a clear indicator of a meticulously calculated approach to risk management and astute market timing. Sophisticated Treasury Management: It is highly probable that HIVE employs advanced treasury management strategies. These would dictate precise protocols for when to liquidate a portion of mined coins to cover operational expenditures and, crucially, when to strategically hold them for long-term capital appreciation. This dynamic balance is key to optimizing profitability and stability. Prudent Risk Mitigation: While accumulating significant assets offers immense upside potential, it inherently exposes the company to downside risk during market corrections. HIVE Digital’s reported holdings underscore a profound, long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s foundational value. This suggests they are strategically prepared to endure and even capitalize on market downturns, viewing them as opportunities rather than existential threats. Commitment to Transparency: By transparently disclosing their digital asset holdings , HIVE Digital significantly enhances its credibility and builds robust investor confidence. This level of openness is a distinguishing factor in the often opaque crypto space, setting them apart and fostering a stronger relationship with their shareholder base. Beyond the Numbers: The Future of HIVE Digital The announcement of an impressive $181.1 million in digital asset holdings is far more than a mere financial snapshot; it serves as a powerful testament to the strategic direction and ambitious future trajectory of HIVE Digital . This exceptionally strong financial bedrock strategically positions the company for sustained expansion and continuous innovation within the rapidly burgeoning digital economy. Unlocking Expansion Opportunities: Armed with a formidable war chest of digital assets, HIVE Digital is exceptionally well-equipped to pursue a myriad of expansion opportunities. This could manifest as the acquisition of new, high-capacity mining facilities, significant investments in pioneering blockchain technologies, or strategic diversification into other lucrative blockchain-related ventures, such as high-performance computing or AI infrastructure powered by their extensive GPU fleets. Solidifying Industry Leadership: By consistently demonstrating robust financial stability, unwavering operational efficiency, and a crystal-clear long-term vision, HIVE Digital is actively reinforcing its esteemed position as a leading innovator in the global cryptocurrency mining industry. Their steadfast commitment to environmentally responsible and sustainable practices further solidifies this leadership, resonating with a growing segment of environmentally conscious investors and regulators. Elevating Investor Confidence: For current and prospective investors, these substantial holdings send a resounding message: this is a company that is not only generating significant profits from its core mining operations but is also astutely accumulating wealth in the very assets it produces. This deep alignment of interests with the broader success of the crypto ecosystem makes HIVE Digital an attractive proposition for those seeking exposure to the digital asset space. In summation, HIVE Digital Technologies’ impressive disclosure of $181.1 million in digital asset holdings , featuring a substantial 2,201 Bitcoin portfolio , paints a vivid portrait of a meticulously managed and forward-thinking enterprise. This strategic accumulation profoundly underscores their resolute confidence in the enduring value of cryptocurrencies, their exemplary operational efficiency within the challenging cryptocurrency mining sector, and their demonstrated ability to expertly navigate the inherent volatility of the broader crypto market . As HIVE Digital continues its trajectory of innovation and expansion, its robust digital asset base will undoubtedly serve as a pivotal cornerstone for sustained success, cementing its formidable presence in the rapidly evolving digital economy. This strategic move by HIVE Digital is a powerful declaration, signaling the increasing maturity and sophisticated strategic depth emerging within the digital asset investment landscape.

The traditional system, riddled with delays, high fees, and compliance headaches, often feels like a relic from another era. Imagine a world where your international workforce receives their salaries instantly, with minimal costs, and full regulatory compliance. This isn’t a futuristic fantasy; it’s the immediate reality offered by the groundbreaking collaboration between Rain and Toku, ushering in a new era of stablecoin payroll . Why Are Global Employers Embracing Stablecoins for Payroll? For businesses operating across borders, managing payroll is a monumental task. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations, slow bank transfers, exorbitant fees, and the ever-present challenge of adhering to diverse labor and tax laws in multiple jurisdictions can drain resources and productivity. This is where the innovation of stablecoin payroll shines, offering a compelling alternative for global employers seeking efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Rain, a prominent stablecoin payments platform, has joined forces with Toku, a leading compliance provider specializing in digital asset compensation. Their new stablecoin payroll system is designed to directly address these pain points, providing a streamlined solution for businesses with a global footprint. It’s about more than just payments; it’s about transforming the entire compensation landscape for international teams. Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments with Stablecoins The core of this new service lies in its ability to facilitate real-time, cross-border payments . Traditional international wire transfers can take days, incurring significant delays that impact employee satisfaction and cash flow management. With stablecoins, these transactions can be completed in minutes, if not seconds, offering unparalleled speed and efficiency. The system’s reach is impressive, supporting payroll processing while adhering to labor and tax laws in over 100 countries. This extensive global coverage is a testament to the meticulous planning and technological prowess behind the partnership. Initially, the service supports well-known stablecoins like USDC, along with RLUSD and USDG, providing flexibility and choice for businesses. The commitment to expanding stablecoin support based on demand and evolving compliance landscapes ensures the platform remains adaptable and future-proof. Seamless Digital Asset Compensation : Integration and Expansion One of the most appealing aspects of this new stablecoin payroll service is its seamless integration with existing payroll systems. This means businesses don’t need to overhaul their entire financial infrastructure to adopt this modern solution. Instead, they can enhance their current operations by incorporating the benefits of digital asset compensation . For employees, receiving compensation in stablecoins can offer several advantages, especially in regions with volatile local currencies or limited access to traditional banking services. Stablecoins, pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, offer stability and predictability, protecting employees’ earnings from market fluctuations. This approach to digital asset compensation can empower a truly global workforce, providing them with more control and flexibility over their finances. Rain and Toku’s forward-looking approach includes plans to expand stablecoin support, ensuring the platform evolves with the market and user needs. This adaptability is crucial in the fast-paced world of digital assets, guaranteeing that businesses can continue to leverage the most efficient and compliant stablecoin options available. The Power of Real-time Payroll : Speed, Cost, and Compliance The promise of real-time payroll is not just about speed; it encompasses a trifecta of benefits: reduced costs, enhanced transparency, and robust compliance. Traditional payroll often involves multiple intermediaries, each adding fees and delays. By leveraging stablecoins, many of these intermediaries can be bypassed, leading to significant cost savings on transaction fees and foreign exchange conversions. Toku’s expertise as a compliance provider for digital asset compensation is a critical component of this service. Navigating the complex web of international labor and tax laws is a daunting task, but Toku ensures that every transaction processed through the system adheres to the specific regulations of each country. This meticulous attention to compliance offers immense peace of mind for global employers , mitigating legal risks and ensuring ethical compensation practices. Here’s a quick look at the key advantages: Instant Settlements: Say goodbye to multi-day waiting periods for international transfers. Reduced Fees: Lower transaction costs compared to traditional banking channels. Global Reach: Compliant payroll processing in over 100 countries. FX Stability: Compensation in stablecoins minimizes exposure to volatile currency fluctuations. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain-based transactions offer clear, immutable records. Seamless Integration: Works with existing payroll systems, minimizing disruption. Regulatory Adherence: Built-in compliance with local labor and tax laws. What Challenges Might Lie Ahead for Stablecoin Payroll ? While the benefits are clear, the widespread adoption of stablecoin payroll isn’t without its considerations. Regulatory clarity around digital assets is still evolving in many jurisdictions, which can present complexities. Furthermore, educating employees and employers about stablecoins and digital wallets will be essential for smooth adoption. However, as the digital asset space matures and becomes more mainstream, these challenges are likely to diminish, paving the way for even broader acceptance. Actionable Insights for Your Business For global employers looking to streamline their international payroll, exploring Rain and Toku’s stablecoin payroll service could be a transformative step. Consider: Assessing Your Needs: Evaluate your current international payroll challenges and how stablecoins could offer solutions. Pilot Programs: Start with a smaller team or specific region to understand the system’s benefits firsthand. Employee Education: Provide clear information and support to your workforce on how to receive and manage stablecoin payments. Staying Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments in the digital asset space to ensure continued compliance. A Compelling Future for Global Compensation The partnership between Rain and Toku marks a significant milestone in the evolution of global finance. By offering a compliant, efficient, and real-time payroll solution powered by stablecoins, they are not just improving a process; they are redefining how global employers manage their international workforce.

Consumer appetite is weak despite increasing public discussion and legislative action; incentives are still being formulated. While PayPal brought one of the first stablecoins from a big financial company to market in 2023, it has proved difficult for users to use the coins for everyday financial activities, Chriss said. The Genius Act may also cause restrictions around cryptocurrency to ease up and become more accessible to people, he said. PayPal uses stablecoins mainly for sending money abroad Chriss believes stablecoins are very practical in dealing with the delays, high transaction fees, and a lack of transparency with traditional methods when sending money across borders. The company sees cross-border payments as a gateway for mainstream users in underserved regions, where people often rely on outdated financial systems, and wants everyone to experience the benefits of stablecoins firsthand. However, Chriss says adoption rates in the US are low because consumers haven’t yet found a compelling reason to change their habits. They don’t see how stablecoins can improve their daily financial lives and are comfortable using credit cards, bank transfers, and mobile apps. Chrics explained that PayPal builds tools and programs that make stablecoins easier and safer. The company is also launching its own stablecoin early and investing in infrastructure, education, and partnerships that make stablecoins more useful in the real world. New US laws will convince more people to use st ablecoins T he GENIUS Act recently passed the Senate and is now waiting for a vote in the House of Representatives. It could give businesses and consumers more confidence to participate in the digital economy. Meanwhile, th e US lawmakers are working on a second major piece of legislation focusing on the broader crypto market. Senate Banking Committee lead, Senator Tim Scott, said he wants Congress to pass a digital asset market structure bill before the end of September. The bill will determine whether the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) should oversee different types of digital assets, including stablecoins, tokens, and cryptocurrencies. Senator Cynthia Lummis also said she would feel “extremely disappointed” if the GENIUS Act and the digital asset market structure bill failed to pass before 2026. More companies will confidently join the industry, and there will be opportunities for innovation once Congress passes the bill. The new protections and guidelines for how stablecoins and other digital assets should work will make users feel more secure and allow companies to invest in new technology and offer digital money services to more people. Many lawmakers and industry leaders strongly support the bill, but no one knows exactly when Congress will take the final step to pass it. So far, the bill has progressed; it passed in the Senate and gained attention in public debates, but it still needs to be approved by the House of Representatives. Even after that, lawmakers might suggest more changes or debate parts of the bill before it becomes a final law.

While Ethereum and XRP prices remain in the spotlight, one unexpected contender is emerging fast: MAGACOIN FINANCE , a red-hot crypto project that’s capturing serious investor attention. XRP and Ethereum: Developments are Driving Attention XRP has had a few turbulent weeks. On June 26, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres rejected a joint motion by Ripple and the SEC to settle their long-standing lawsuit early. The court ruled that there weren’t “exceptional circumstances” to justify overriding its final judgment, meaning Ripple’s legal battles will continue. While this keeps uncertainty around institutional sales of XRP, retail sales remain unaffected, and the market is showing resilience. In fact, talks of a potential XRP ETF and the upcoming CME launch of XRP futures are keeping investor interest alive. Meanwhile, Ethereum remains a pillar of the market. Coinbase has announced the launch of Ethereum and Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts starting July 21—an important step for regulated exposure in the U.S. Additionally, core developer Barnabé Monnot has proposed cutting block times in half with EIP-7782, potentially doubling the Ethereum network’s speed. With ETH currently trading around $2,425, the price remains stable, but the groundwork is being laid for long-term upside. The Rising Domination of MAGACOIN FINANCE While top altcoins like XRP and Ethereum deal with regulatory hurdles and technical upgrades, MAGACOIN FINANCE is taking the market by storm. It’s quickly become one of 2025’s most talked-about crypto projects—and for good reason. Its capped supply of 170 billion tokens ensures no dilution risk, and the project has already passed a HashEx smart contract audit, offering peace of mind to investors focused on security. Presale demand is exploding, with early stages selling out at lightning speed. Investors who jump in now can also access high staking APYs as leading altcoins like Ethereum and XRP prices gain strength from improving macro conditions. This may skyrocket the price of MAGACOIN FINANCE by the end of 2025. Final Thought MAGACOIN FINANCE is being compared to leading altcoins, but with more advanced tokenomics and real growth potential. From retail holders to serious crypto investors, many are shifting part of their portfolios into this high-upside project. As macro conditions improve under Trump’s guidance, the altcoin market is ready to boom, pushing MAGACOIN FINANCE to new highs. With projections suggesting returns as high as 30x–100x, and in some bullish scenarios even up to 5000%, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the breakout star of late 2025.

These foundational markets influence global liquidity, investor sentiment, and ultimately, the broader economic landscape that even digital assets operate within. A recent forecast from ING, one of Europe’s leading financial institutions, has ignited discussions across financial circles, flagging a potential path for the Euro to USD exchange rate to reach $1.20. This isn’t just a technical projection; it signals a significant shift in the global economic narrative, heavily reliant on evolving Central Bank Policy decisions. ING’s projection isn’t a mere speculative guess; it’s rooted in a detailed analysis of macroeconomic indicators, monetary policy trajectories, and market sentiment. The $1.20 target for the Euro to USD represents a significant appreciation from recent levels, suggesting that ING sees fundamental shifts aligning in favor of the single currency. But what exactly are these ‘policy triggers’ that ING emphasizes, and how do they pave the way for such a substantial move in one of the world’s most traded currency pairs? Let’s delve into the core drivers and potential implications. What’s Driving the Euro to USD Outlook? The potential ascent of the Euro to USD is not a singular event but a confluence of factors, primarily centered around a projected divergence in monetary policy and a shifting perception of economic resilience. ING’s analysis points to several key elements that could underpin this bullish outlook for the euro: Monetary Policy Divergence: The European Central Bank (ECB) and the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) are at different stages in their respective policy cycles. While the Fed has been aggressively hiking rates, the ECB has been more cautious. ING anticipates a potential shift where the ECB becomes more hawkish, while the Fed might signal a pause or even a future pivot, narrowing the policy gap. Relative Economic Performance: The resilience of the Eurozone economy, despite geopolitical headwinds and an energy crisis, is a crucial factor. If the Eurozone continues to show signs of robust recovery and manages to navigate inflationary pressures effectively, it could strengthen the euro’s appeal. Shifting Market Sentiment: For a significant period, the U.S. Dollar has benefited from its safe-haven status amidst global uncertainties. However, if global risk appetite improves and investors become more confident in the Eurozone’s stability and growth prospects, capital could flow back into euro-denominated assets, bolstering the currency. These elements combine to create a compelling narrative for the euro’s potential strength, moving it beyond a mere technical rebound to a more fundamental revaluation against the dollar. How Do Central Bank Policy Decisions Impact EUR/USD? At the heart of ING’s forecast lies the pivotal role of Central Bank Policy . The actions and forward guidance from the European Central Bank (ECB) and the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) are arguably the most potent forces shaping currency valuations. Their decisions on interest rates, quantitative easing (QE), and quantitative tightening (QT) directly influence the attractiveness of holding a currency. The ECB, under President Christine Lagarde, has been grappling with persistent inflation while also navigating the complexities of a fragmented Eurozone economy. Historically, the ECB has been more dovish than the Fed, but recent inflationary pressures have pushed it towards a more hawkish stance. ING’s view suggests that the ECB might need to accelerate its tightening cycle, perhaps through more aggressive rate hikes or a faster reduction of its balance sheet (QT), to bring inflation under control. Such a move would make euro-denominated assets more appealing. Conversely, the Federal Reserve has already embarked on an aggressive tightening path. However, concerns about a potential U.S. recession or a significant cooling of inflation could lead the Fed to pause its rate hikes or even consider rate cuts later on. This divergence – a potentially more hawkish ECB meeting a less hawkish Fed – would significantly narrow the Interest Rate Differentials between the two economic blocs, making the euro relatively more attractive. ECB vs. Fed: A Policy Comparison Understanding the nuances of each central bank’s approach is key to grasping the future trajectory of the Forex Market : Policy Aspect European Central Bank (ECB) U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) Current Stance Cautiously tightening, addressing high inflation. Aggressively tightening, focused on inflation control. Inflation Target 2% over the medium term, symmetrical. 2% over the longer run, average inflation targeting. Balance Sheet Policy Gradual reduction (QT), phasing out asset purchases. Significant reduction (QT) underway. Future Outlook (ING’s View) Potential for more aggressive rate hikes. Potential for pausing or slowing rate hikes. The Crucial Role of Interest Rate Differentials in Currency Valuation When investors decide where to park their money, the return on that money is paramount. This is where Interest Rate Differentials become a critical determinant of currency flows. A higher interest rate in one country, relative to another, makes that country’s currency more attractive to investors seeking better yields. This phenomenon is often referred to as the ‘carry trade’, where investors borrow in a low-interest-rate currency and invest in a high-interest-rate currency. For the Euro to USD pair, if the ECB begins to raise rates more aggressively, or if the market anticipates that Eurozone rates will eventually surpass or even match U.S. rates, it could trigger significant capital inflows into the euro. This is not just about current rates but also about market expectations of future rates. If the market believes the ECB will tighten more than previously thought, or that the Fed will ease sooner, the euro gains a significant advantage. Consider this: if a European bond yields 3% and a comparable U.S. bond yields 2.5%, an investor would naturally prefer the European bond for a higher return, assuming all other factors are equal. This increased demand for euro-denominated assets translates directly into increased demand for the euro currency itself, pushing its value higher against the dollar. This dynamic plays a powerful role in the daily fluctuations and long-term trends observed in the Forex Market . Navigating the Broader Forex Market Landscape While central bank policy and interest rate differentials are dominant, the broader Forex Market is also influenced by a myriad of other factors. Geopolitical events, global risk sentiment, and commodity prices can all significantly impact currency valuations, sometimes overshadowing monetary policy in the short term. For the Euro to USD , these external forces are particularly relevant: Geopolitical Developments: The ongoing conflict in Ukraine, for instance, has had a profound impact on Europe’s energy security and economic stability. Any escalation or de-escalation of such tensions can lead to swift shifts in currency preferences. A resolution or stabilization could boost the euro, while renewed instability could see a flight to the safe-haven dollar. Global Risk Sentiment: During periods of high global uncertainty or ‘risk-off’ sentiment, investors tend to flock to the U.S. Dollar due to its perceived safety and liquidity. Conversely, a ‘risk-on’ environment, characterized by optimism about global growth, tends to favor currencies like the euro, as investors seek higher returns in riskier assets. ING’s $1.20 forecast implies a degree of improving global risk appetite. Commodity Prices: Europe is a net importer of energy, making the euro particularly sensitive to fluctuations in oil and gas prices. High energy prices can weigh on the Eurozone’s terms of trade and economic growth, potentially weakening the euro. A stabilization or decline in energy prices would be beneficial for the euro’s strength. Trade Balances: A country’s trade balance (exports minus imports) can also influence its currency. A persistent trade surplus generally strengthens a currency, while a deficit can weaken it. Understanding these interconnected factors provides a more holistic view of the forces at play in the ever-evolving Forex Market , complementing the analysis of central bank actions. What’s the Economic Outlook for the Eurozone and US? The fundamental strength and prospects of an economy are direct drivers of its currency’s value. ING’s forecast for the Euro to USD to reach $1.20 implicitly suggests a more optimistic Economic Outlook for the Eurozone relative to, or at least in comparison with, the United States. This involves looking at key economic indicators such as growth, inflation, and employment. Eurozone’s Path to Resilience: Despite significant challenges, the Eurozone has shown surprising resilience. Indicators to watch include: Inflation Trends: While still high, signs of peaking or gradual decline in inflation could give the ECB more confidence to pursue a less aggressive tightening path or indicate that previous hikes are having an effect. However, persistent high inflation could force the ECB’s hand for more aggressive action. Growth Momentum: Data on GDP growth, industrial production, and services sector activity will be crucial. A robust recovery, particularly if it outperforms expectations, would be a strong tailwind for the euro. Fiscal Policies: The fiscal stance of individual Eurozone members and the broader EU recovery fund initiatives can also influence investor confidence and the euro’s stability. United States’ Economic Trajectory: The U.S. economy, while strong, faces its own set of challenges that could impact the dollar’s relative strength: Inflation Fight: The Fed’s primary focus remains taming inflation. Success here could allow for a less hawkish stance, but persistent inflation might necessitate continued tightening, supporting the dollar. Employment Resilience: The U.S. labor market has remained remarkably strong. A significant weakening could signal a recession and prompt the Fed to ease policy, potentially weakening the dollar. Recession Risks: Many analysts foresee a potential recession in the U.S. as a consequence of aggressive rate hikes. If a recession materializes, it could lead to dollar weakness, especially if other major economies prove more resilient. The comparative performance of these two economic giants, as reflected in their respective Economic Outlooks , will heavily influence the path of the Euro to USD exchange rate. ING’s $1.20 forecast hinges on a scenario where the Eurozone’s economic narrative improves or stabilizes relative to the U.S. Challenges and Risks to ING’s Forecast While ING presents a compelling case for the euro’s appreciation, the dynamic nature of the Forex Market means that forecasts are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Several factors could derail the euro’s path to $1.20: Persistent Inflation Surprises: If inflation in the Eurozone proves more stubborn than anticipated, forcing the ECB into an even more aggressive tightening cycle that risks a deeper recession. Conversely, if U.S. inflation remains persistently high, the Fed might be forced to maintain a hawkish stance longer than expected, supporting the dollar. Escalation of Geopolitical Conflicts: A significant worsening of the geopolitical landscape, particularly related to energy supply or broader global stability, could trigger a flight to safety, strengthening the U.S. Dollar as a safe-haven asset. Renewed Energy Crisis: Despite efforts to diversify, Europe remains vulnerable to energy supply shocks. A harsh winter or renewed disruption to energy imports could severely impact Eurozone growth and undermine the euro. Slower-than-Expected ECB Tightening: If the ECB opts for a more cautious or delayed approach to monetary tightening due to concerns about economic growth or financial stability, it could temper the euro’s strength. Stronger-than-Expected U.S. Economy: If the U.S. economy proves more resilient than anticipated, avoiding a recession and maintaining strong growth, it could provide continued support for the dollar, challenging the Euro to USD appreciation. These challenges highlight the complex interplay of economic, political, and market forces that constantly shape currency valuations. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors Understanding ING’s forecast and the underlying drivers can provide valuable insights for those active in the financial markets: Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to speeches, press conferences, and minutes from both the ECB and the Fed. Any subtle shifts in language or outlook can signal future policy changes and impact currency pairs like the Euro to USD . Track Key Economic Data: Keep an eye on inflation reports, GDP growth figures, employment data, and consumer confidence indices from both the Eurozone and the U.S. These provide real-time insights into the health of the respective economies and influence central bank decisions. Assess Risk Sentiment: Global events and headlines can quickly shift market sentiment. Understanding whether the market is in a ‘risk-on’ or ‘risk-off’ mode can help anticipate currency flows. Consider Diversification and Hedging: For investors with international portfolios, currency movements can significantly impact returns. Understanding the Economic Outlook and potential currency shifts can inform decisions on portfolio diversification and hedging strategies to mitigate currency risk. Set Realistic Expectations: While a $1.20 target is significant, currency markets are inherently volatile. It’s crucial to approach trading and investing with robust risk management strategies and to avoid over-leveraging based on single forecasts. Conclusion: The Path Ahead for the Euro ING’s forecast of a potential path for the Euro to USD to reach $1.20 underscores a significant shift in the global financial landscape. This isn’t just about a number; it’s about a fundamental re-evaluation of the Eurozone’s economic prospects and the future trajectory of Central Bank Policy . The interplay of Interest Rate Differentials , the broader Forex Market dynamics, and the evolving Economic Outlook for both regions will be the decisive factors in whether this ambitious target is met. While challenges and uncertainties remain, the emphasis on policy triggers suggests that the proactive or reactive stances of the ECB and the Fed will continue to be the primary determinants of EUR/USD’s journey. For investors and traders, staying attuned to these macroeconomic shifts and central bank signals will be paramount in navigating the exciting, yet complex, world of currency markets. The euro’s ascent to $1.20, if realized, would mark a pivotal moment, signaling a potential rebalancing of global economic power and a new chapter for one of the world’s most watched currency pairs.

But in crypto, the model sometimes flips. BlockDAG is a perfect example. With over $323 million raised in presale and more than 2 million users mining via its X1 app, this project isn’t just gathering hype. It’s using a game theory-based approach that benefits early participation in a big way. With zero venture capital and no insider allocations, the design is simple: support early, and the network gives back. Even before anything goes live on exchanges, community nodes, testnet tools, and mining infrastructure are already rolling out. That’s why some of the savviest buyers are making their moves before full-scale market liquidity sets in. Incentives Built Into the Presale Foundation BlockDAG’s system is wired to reward people who act early. Buyers right now can still get in at $0.0030, increasing soon to $0.0080, while the confirmed listing price stands at $0.05, setting up a massive potential return for current buyers. Node operators will be running before listings begin, earning BDAG from mining, shielded from live market volatility. Developers are already building apps on the EVM-compatible testnet, using a no-code builder and claiming early grants. The incentives don’t just kick in post-launch; they’re designed to reward involvement from day one. That’s rare for presale-stage projects, where hype usually outpaces utility. Letting the Network Start Running Before the Price Moves Most Layer 1 networks wait until post-launch to decentralize or distribute mining power. BlockDAG is doing the opposite. Miners and node operators are going live before any trading starts. So far, over 18,150 ASIC miners have been sold, and the X1 mining app has onboarded more than 2 million users. Yet, none of them can sell anything, because nothing has hit exchanges yet. That setup leads to: Organic network growth fueled by user participation No downward price pressure from early unlocks Miners adding value without triggering market selling This creates a delay on the supply side, while demand from builders and users starts building momentum. Game theory suggests this sets the stage for stronger price action once the coin goes live. Early Builders Are Setting the Stage Now Often overlooked in crypto is the role of developers before launch. In BlockDAG’s case, builders are already busy. They’re using the no-code dApp builder to create smart contracts today Grants are rolling out ahead of the mainnet Apps are being deployed and tested on a functioning testnet By the time BlockDAG’s coin becomes tradable, it won’t be entering an empty space. It’ll be stepping into an ecosystem that already has tools, apps, and users. That early builder activity doesn’t just benefit developers; it helps shape a stronger launch. And for those building now, the visibility and support are far higher than what they’d get after a crowded post-launch environment. Understanding the Game Theory at Play Game theory tells us people make decisions based on what they expect others will do. With BlockDAG, this plays out clearly: Buy now at $0.0030 and lock in big upside Wait and pay more in later batches, $0.0080, $0.01, and finally $0.05 Meanwhile, over 23.2 billion coins have already been sold, nearly 200,000 wallets are active, and the six-week rollout timeline includes mainnet launch, mining pool activation, and token airdrops. So the choice becomes simple: get in early for a higher return, or wait and possibly miss out once the system gains full visibility and user saturation. What Buyers Should Know as the Window Narrows For large buyers or retail users planning for the long haul, BlockDAG’s structure offers more than just presale pricing. It’s building a fully functioning network in real time. Miners are already active, adding real usage Developers are laying the groundwork with working apps Participants are entering now, ahead of liquidity This coordinated rollout reduces uncertainty and gives the network a measurable head start. But with a $600 million presale cap, there are only so many spots left before the market catches up. The current $0.0030 tier is closing within days. After that, the price will jump to $0.0080. More importantly, what’s closing isn’t just the pricing, it’s the chance to be part of a working ecosystem before it becomes widely known.

While blockchain’s inherent transparency is a boon for many, it often poses a significant hurdle for traditional finance (TradFi) players who operate under strict confidentiality requirements. Enter Taurus, a leading digital asset infrastructure provider, which has just unveiled a groundbreaking privacy-focused stablecoin contract on the Aztec Network. This development is poised to redefine how institutions interact with digital currencies, offering a powerful solution that blends the best of both worlds: robust privacy with essential compliance. What’s the Big Deal with Taurus’s Privacy-Focused Stablecoin? Imagine a digital currency that allows you to conduct transactions with the confidentiality of traditional banking, yet leverages the efficiency and security of blockchain. That’s precisely what Taurus aims to deliver with its new privacy-focused stablecoin contract. According to CoinDesk, this innovative contract, built on the Aztec Network, is specifically designed to cater to financial institutions wary of privacy issues on public blockchains. It’s a clever fusion of cutting-edge zero-knowledge privacy technology and USDC-style compliance features. What does this mean in practice? It allows for transactions to be fully encrypted, safeguarding sensitive financial data from public view. However, critically, it also incorporates mechanisms that enable regulatory access when absolutely necessary. This ‘selective disclosure’ capability is a game-changer, addressing the core conflict between blockchain’s transparency and the institutional need for discretion and regulatory oversight. Unlocking Institutional Adoption: Addressing the Privacy Paradox For years, the promise of crypto has been tantalizing for traditional finance, yet widespread institutional adoption has been slow. One of the primary reasons? The inherent transparency of most public blockchains, where every transaction is visible to anyone with an internet connection. This level of openness is simply not compatible with the operational requirements and regulatory mandates of banks, asset managers, and other financial entities. Taurus’s solution directly confronts this ‘privacy paradox.’ By offering a contract that ensures transactional confidentiality while maintaining a pathway for regulatory compliance, they are building a crucial bridge for institutional adoption . This move could significantly accelerate the integration of digital assets into mainstream financial operations, paving the way for new products, services, and efficiencies previously unimaginable due to privacy concerns. Institutions can now explore the benefits of stablecoins – instant settlement, reduced costs, global reach – without compromising their core business principles. The Magic Behind Zero-Knowledge Privacy: A Closer Look At the heart of Taurus’s new contract lies zero-knowledge privacy (ZKP). This cryptographic marvel allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. Think of it like this: you can prove you are over 18 without revealing your actual birthdate. In the context of Taurus’s stablecoin, zero-knowledge privacy means: Encrypted Transactions: The details of transactions (sender, receiver, amount) are encrypted and not publicly visible on the blockchain. Proof of Validity: ZKP proofs ensure that the transactions are legitimate and adhere to the contract’s rules (e.g., sufficient balance, valid addresses) without exposing the underlying data. Conditional Disclosure: In specific, legally mandated circumstances, a trusted third party or regulator can be granted access to decrypt and verify transaction details, satisfying compliance requirements. This powerful combination is what makes the Taurus contract so appealing to institutions. It offers a level of data protection that public blockchains traditionally lack, while still operating within a regulated framework. Building the Future: The Crucial Role of Digital Asset Infrastructure Taurus isn’t just launching a contract; they are reinforcing their position as a vital player in the evolving landscape of digital asset infrastructure . For institutions to truly embrace digital assets, they need more than just a stablecoin; they require a robust, secure, and compliant ecosystem to manage, store, and transact these assets. Providers of digital asset infrastructure like Taurus offer comprehensive solutions that include: Secure Custody: Safely storing digital assets. Tokenization Platforms: Creating and managing digital representations of real-world assets. Connectivity: Bridging traditional financial systems with blockchain networks. Compliance Tools: Ensuring adherence to AML, KYC, and other regulations. Taurus’s new privacy-focused stablecoin contract is a testament to their commitment to building the foundational layers necessary for the seamless integration of digital assets into the global financial system. It demonstrates a deep understanding of institutional needs and the technical prowess to deliver sophisticated solutions. Ensuring Secure and Encrypted Transactions: The Operational Advantage The ability to conduct encrypted transactions is not just about privacy; it’s also about operational security and efficiency for financial institutions. In a world where data breaches are a constant threat, minimizing the exposure of sensitive financial data is paramount. Taurus’s approach achieves this by ensuring that transaction details are not openly broadcast on the public ledger. Consider the operational advantages: Reduced Data Footprint: Less sensitive information exposed means a smaller attack surface for malicious actors. Enhanced Client Confidentiality: Financial institutions can assure their clients that their transaction data remains private, fostering greater trust. Streamlined Internal Compliance: While external regulators can access data when needed, internal compliance teams can manage disclosures more effectively, avoiding unnecessary exposure of proprietary information. Competitive Edge: Institutions can explore new business models and participate in digital asset markets without revealing their strategic moves to competitors. The implementation of encrypted transactions within a compliant framework represents a significant leap forward, making digital assets a far more viable and attractive option for enterprise-level operations. Benefits at a Glance: Enhanced Privacy: Confidential transactions for institutions. Regulatory Compliance: Built-in mechanisms for regulatory access when required. Increased Institutional Trust: Addresses core concerns hindering TradFi adoption. Technological Innovation: Leverages cutting-edge zero-knowledge privacy. Operational Efficiency: Reduces data exposure and enhances security. Potential Hurdles & The Road Ahead While Taurus’s new offering is a significant step forward, the path to widespread institutional adoption of privacy-preserving digital assets still has its challenges. Regulatory frameworks are constantly evolving, and achieving global harmonization for such solutions will take time. Furthermore, the inherent complexity of zero-knowledge technology requires continuous education and robust integration support for institutions. Despite these hurdles, the direction is clear: the financial world is moving towards digital assets, and solutions that intelligently balance privacy with compliance will be key enablers of this transition. A New Era for Institutional Crypto? Taurus’s launch of a privacy-focused stablecoin contract on the Aztec Network marks a pivotal moment for the digital asset space. By directly addressing the critical privacy and compliance needs of financial institutions, Taurus is not just launching a product; they are laying down a foundational piece of the puzzle for true institutional adoption . This innovative blend of zero-knowledge privacy with regulatory access, built upon robust digital asset infrastructure , promises to unlock a new era of secure and encrypted transactions for the world’s largest financial players. The future of finance is increasingly digital, and solutions like this are paving the way for its secure and private evolution.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is generating serious traction among early investors, gaining attention as a new cryptocurrency with real DeFi utility and a high-engagement token model. MUTM emerges as a top buy this week alongside Shiba Inu (SHIB) meme coin. Presale of Mutuum Finance is in 50% sold out in Phase 5 with MUTM available for a mere $0.03. Mutuum Finance presale has attracted over 12,500 investors. More than $11.2 million has been raised. As presale allocations continue to fill rapidly, interest around MUTM has sparked debate among traders asking what’s the best crypto to buy now before the next major market move. Shiba Inu Consolidates Near $0.000012 Amid Cool June Sentiment Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at an accumulation level at around $0.000012, but a short period ago, it was trading at a level of short-term support after recording a decline of approximately 6% over the last 24 hours. Technical indicators also portray a cautious outlook: RSI is still in a state of mild overselling and on-chain indicators depict token outflows to exchanges, which is normally a bearish signal. Even though there is a severe, 112000% increase in the burn rate, withdrawing more than 116 million tokens, it has not caused any significant increase in price action due to increased headwinds in the overall market. In the absence of newer catalyst, i.e. new usage of Shibarium or accumulation by whales, SHIB can resume its lateral course. In the meantime, lesser known projects, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), are attracting attention. Revolutionizing DeFi with a Proven Dual-Lending Formula In comparison with ordinary DeFi protocols, Mutuum Finance will be the first to try to build a hybrid lending system that will have opportunities to meet the requirements of users with passive and sophisticated users. In Peer-to-Contract (P2C), clients meet the requirements of any investor who wishes to own passive income by depositing his USDT into the smart contract pools which provide stable passive income on the basis of an interest rate which it estimates up and down as the market demands. In Peer-to-Peer (P2P), experienced users can take advantage of this model where both borrowers and lenders are in complete control of establishing the terms, which is ideal to handle volatile assets. Mutuum Finance Presale Booms with 12,500+ Investors and $11.2M Raised Mutuum Finance is one of the DeFi protocols that are stirring up the market as it has already raised over $11.2 million, and over 12,500 investors are already backing it up. The existence of such a momentum is a testimony of the increased trust in the long-term project vision and the role it would play in transforming the decentralized finance market. As the broader crypto market cools, savvy investors are already positioning themselves ahead of the next breakout. Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains range-bound near $0.000012, lacking strong bullish catalysts, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a breakout contender with real DeFi innovation and serious investor momentum. The presale has now raised over $11.2 million, with more than 12,500 participants, and tokens are 40% sold out in Phase 5 at just $0.03 each. Offering a unique dual-lending system and backed by a full CertiK audit, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming one of the most promising altcoins of 2025. The clock is ticking, secure your presale allocation now and get ahead of the next market pump.

Shiba Inu: Reinvention Through Infrastructure and Community Action Shiba Inu remains one of the most recognized names in crypto, and its community isn’t slowing down. With billions of tokens being removed from circulation and the integration of Shibarium, SHIB is pushing to transform its image from speculative meme coin to decentralized utility hub . Recent developments like automation of burn events and partnerships aimed at cross-chain functionality are positioning Shiba Inu to play a more active role in the DeFi space. But while its roadmap is ambitious, momentum has been inconsistent , and even major burn surges have not yet triggered sustained breakout moves. Sentiment around SHIB remains neutral overall, with many market participants waiting for stronger catalysts to reignite serious upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Meme Coin Redefining Hype in 2025 While SHIB continues to build, MAGACOIN FINANCE is exploding onto the scene with a different playbook —one driven by raw energy, viral branding, and unmistakable investor urgency. Analysts are already describing it as one of the most promising meme cryptos of the year, fueled by a powerful mix of early traction and market hype. What’s turning heads? Unlike typical meme tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE leverages a narrative that is both politically charged and culturally resonant, designed to rally mass engagement. It’s not just a token—it’s a movement. Early interest has snowballed, with every phase of its rollout triggering a fresh wave of wallet activity. Analysts are pointing to its early-stage performance metrics, which outshine many of 2025’s so-called “blue chip” altcoins . And with a staking mechanism rolling out exclusively for its earliest supporters, the project is building both loyalty and locked-in demand before even hitting major exchanges. Strategic Analyst Picks Are Locking In Early With legacy tokens facing delays, legal entanglements, and uneven momentum, many market veterans are shifting toward asymmetric opportunities —and MAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the center of that rotation. Analysts tracking altcoin trends say this project is positioned to dominate headlines and performance charts once it enters full circulation. The takeaway? While Shiba Inu continues to evolve its tech stack and brand identity, MAGACOIN FINANCE is charging forward with speed, conviction, and viral reach .

Chart Pattern Points To Support Analysts have noted that Dogecoin’s slide to $0.142 fits neatly into a rising pattern of higher lows. Based on analysis, the dip hit a multi-year trendline that first showed up in October 2023. At that time, prices fell to a similar zone before reversing.

If the current support holds, they argue, DOGE may pick up speed and push toward the wedge’s tip and hit $1. The analyst’s chart shows a potential rally to $1.40, which would mark a 740% jump from today’s levels and blow past the $1 mark that many have eyed for years. Multiple Forecasts Add Fuel To The Debate This isn’t the first time experts have set sights on $1 for Dogecoin. Galaxy Research put the $1 target on its radar before the end of 2025.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Buying Solana at $148 looked like a mistake, but with strategy and patience, it became a lesson in conviction, not delusion. In crypto, there’s a fine line between conviction and delusion. Buying Solana at $148 can be a conviction. But as the price slides to $126, someone may question whether they have just paid for a front-row seat to yet another brutal lesson in volatility. This is the story of how someone went from red to breakeven — not through luck, but through strategy, patience, and a clear-eyed understanding of the market I was operating in. You might also like: PI, XYZVerse, XMR: Are these fast-rising cryptos set to hit new all-time highs in 2025? The entry: High hopes, higher risk Imagine an investor who entered SOL at $148 when momentum was strong, when Bitcoin was climbing, Ethereum was regaining dominance, and Solana — with its relentless developer activity and growing DeFi footprint — seemed poised to retest $180 resistance. The market, however, had other plans. Within days, macro headwinds took hold. ETF rumors stalled. Traders rotated back into BTC. And Solana, like much of the altcoin market, lost altitude fast. It didn’t pause until it was sitting nearly 15% lower, at $126.80. The drawdown: Holding, not hoping The mistake most traders make when facing a red position is treating it like a problem to be solved with emotion. This can be approached with a framework. As the following questions: Has the core thesis changed? Is this a liquidity flush or a trend reversal? Are there fundamentals that justify staying in the trade? The answers can be clear. Solana’s June health report showed a network that hadn’t gone down in nearly 16 months — no small feat considering its past struggles. Governance participation was up. Developer tooling was improving. New protocols were launched. The recovery blueprint At $133, the investor averages down. Not recklessly — about 30% more capital. They built a ladder and added again near $127. That brings their average entry to $137.50. But this isn’t just about chasing breakeven. The drawdown was a wake-up call. It is a reminder of how fragile even the strongest assets can be once they’ve matured. Solana is no longer a moonshot — it’s a blue chip with blue-chip risks. That’s when they start hunting for asymmetric plays again. Something high-conviction, high-upside and they come across XYZVerse (XYZ) . Why XYZ? XYZVerse could be where real upside might lie because of the following reasons: Early-stage tokenomics with a tight float and aggressive incentive design. Backed by a community-first launch with meme culture but layered with real mechanics. A clear roadmap to utility and planned integrations in DeFi and gaming. Last but not least, it is a cheap entry point. Currently, $XYZ is selling at $0.003333, and the team behind the project seems to be closing the presale soon. The team plans to list its token at $0.1. Sounds quite ambitious, yet possible if they manage to raise the necessary funding. So far, they have secured over $14 million. This gives the same feeling Solana once did — when it was trading under $5 and felt like a crazy idea, but look at it now. TL;DR: Buying SOL at $148 hurt. Seeing it at $126 felt worse. But managing that drawdown with strategy, not sentiment, was arguably the only way to break even and obtain a better edge moving forward. For interested investors who are still chasing blue chips for 2x returns, that’s fine. But those who are ready to go back to where the exponential plays live — it’s projects like XYZ they should be paying attention to.

What Does ‘Decimated’ Mean for the Iran Nuclear Program ? The assertion by U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that the Iran nuclear program has been ‘completely decimated’ is a powerful declaration, signaling a dramatic shift in the geopolitical landscape surrounding Tehran’s atomic ambitions. This isn’t merely a claim of reduction; ‘decimation’ implies a severe, perhaps irreversible, blow to their capabilities. Historically, Iran’s nuclear development has been a source of immense international tension, leading to sanctions, diplomatic efforts, and covert operations. If Hegseth’s statement holds true, it suggests a profound success in preventing proliferation, potentially reshaping security dynamics in the Middle East and beyond. However, such a definitive statement also raises questions about verification and the methods by which this ‘decimation’ was achieved, keeping the international community on edge. The Role of the IAEA and Halting IAEA Cooperation Adding another layer of complexity to this narrative is the report from Walter Bloomberg on X, indicating that Iran’s constitutional committee has approved halting IAEA cooperation . The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is the world’s nuclear watchdog, responsible for verifying that states comply with their non-proliferation obligations. Their access and monitoring are crucial for building international confidence. Iran’s decision to restrict or halt cooperation with the IAEA, especially at a time when such bold claims are being made, creates a significant challenge for independent verification. Without the IAEA’s eyes on the ground, assessing the true state of Iran’s nuclear facilities becomes far more difficult, fueling speculation and potentially increasing distrust among international actors. Analyzing the US Defense Secretary’s Bold Claim When the US Defense Secretary makes a statement of this magnitude, it’s rarely without significant intelligence backing, or at least a strategic purpose. Pete Hegseth’s declaration suggests either a highly effective campaign to dismantle Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, or a powerful psychological operation aimed at deterrence and managing perceptions. While specifics are often shrouded in secrecy, such pronouncements are carefully weighed for their impact on adversaries, allies, and global financial markets. The claim itself could be a signal to Iran that their nuclear ambitions are futile, or a reassurance to regional partners and the international community that a major threat has been neutralized. However, the lack of immediate, public corroboration from independent sources like the IAEA means the world is largely relying on official U.S. statements, which naturally invites scrutiny and skepticism from some quarters. Broader Implications for Geopolitical Stability The ramifications of this development extend far beyond Iran’s borders, touching upon the delicate balance of geopolitical stability worldwide. A ‘decimated’ Iranian nuclear program, if confirmed, could significantly reduce a major source of regional tension, potentially leading to a de-escalation of conflicts in the Middle East. For instance, countries like Israel and Saudi Arabia, who view Iran’s nuclear aspirations as an existential threat, might see this as a positive shift. Conversely, if the claim is perceived as exaggerated or if Iran retaliates by further isolating itself, it could lead to new forms of instability. The ongoing conflict dynamics, energy security, and global trade routes are all intricately linked to the stability of this critical region. Any major shift, whether perceived as positive or negative, will undoubtedly ripple through international relations. How This Impacts Global Markets and Crypto The interplay between geopolitics and financial assets is undeniable, and the latest news regarding Iran is no exception. Major shifts in global markets are often triggered by perceived changes in international stability. Historically, periods of heightened geopolitical tension lead to a ‘flight to safety,’ where investors move away from riskier assets like stocks into traditional safe havens such as gold, government bonds, and sometimes, the U.S. dollar. For the cryptocurrency ecosystem, the impact is multifaceted: Volatility: Geopolitical shocks often amplify volatility across all markets, and crypto is particularly susceptible due to its relatively smaller market cap and 24/7 trading nature. Safe-Haven Narrative: Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ sometimes sees increased demand during uncertainty, as investors seek assets outside traditional financial systems. However, this narrative isn’t always consistent. Correlation with Tech Stocks: Cryptocurrencies, especially altcoins, often exhibit correlation with broader tech stock performance. If geopolitical news dampens overall market sentiment, crypto can follow suit. Investor Confidence: A perceived reduction in global threats could boost overall investor confidence, potentially leading to more capital flowing into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, unverified claims or new tensions could create fear. To illustrate the potential reactions, consider this: Geopolitical Event Impact on Traditional Markets Impact on Crypto Markets Increased Tension Oil prices up, stocks down, gold up Increased volatility, flight to “safe-haven” cryptos (if narrative holds), potential sell-off De-escalation Oil prices down, stocks up, gold down Potential for broader market stability, but also reduced “safe-haven” demand for crypto For crypto investors, staying informed about global events is not just about general knowledge; it’s about understanding potential market movers. While cryptocurrencies offer decentralization, they are not immune to the macro environment. Diversification and careful risk management remain paramount. Conclusion: Navigating a Shifting Landscape The U.S. Defense Secretary’s striking declaration regarding Iran’s nuclear capabilities, coupled with Iran’s decision to halt IAEA cooperation, marks a pivotal moment in international relations. While the full implications and verifiability of these claims remain to be seen, their immediate effect on geopolitical discussions and market sentiment is undeniable. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, these developments serve as a potent reminder that the digital asset landscape is inextricably linked to the broader world stage. Monitoring geopolitical stability , understanding the nuances of international policy, and adapting investment strategies accordingly are essential for navigating the complex interplay between geopolitics and the future of finance.

The announcement on X (formerly Twitter) came as Coinbase shares hit an all-time high of $375.07, surpassing its previous record from November 2021. The comment suggests Armstrong and his company’s strong belief in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. On multiple occasions, Armstrong has suggested that Bitcoin’s price could someday go into millions of dollars. Armstrong also suggested it won’t be long before nations start putting Bitcoin on their balance sheets , a shift that could redefine global demand and establish the asset as a player in world politics. Some dismissed it as overly speculative, but others pointed out that countries like El Salvador and the Central African Republic have already moved in that direction. Whether symbolic or strategic, Armstrong’s consistent Bitcoin purchases reflect a growing trend among crypto leaders and institutional investors who see BTC as a hedge against inflation, currency volatility, and systemic risk. Market confidence drives Coinbase to a new peak Coinbase Global Inc. shares closed at the highest level ever, capping off a rally fueled by the growing acceptance of the cryptocurrency industry on Wall Street and Washington. The crypto-exchange operator’s stock rose 5.5% on Thursday to $375.07. The previous high was $357.39 in November 2021, just months after the company went public through a direct listing. Coinbase shares have surged more than 1,000% from a record low in late 2022, which came as the collapse of FTX raised questions about the future of digital assets. The stock’s comeback occurred as cryptocurrency prices rebounded and the industry won powerful new allies, including US President Donald Trump. Just last month, Coinbase was added to the prestigious S&P 500 Index . This extraordinary revival comes after a dark period in the crypto industry. FTX and other heavyweights crashed in 2022, leading to the absurdly high skepticism rate about digital assets. Few of the largest exchanges were left unscathed, and Coinbase was one of the few that didn’t get whacked, leaving it as a safe player in a chaotic industry. Now, renewed optimism is back. Institutional capital is moving in, retail traders are coming back, and financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity are plowing ahead with crypto products. Coinbase recently joined the S&P 500 Index, a sign of increasing legitimacy in traditional finance. Analysts say the wider recovery in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices and greater regulatory clarity are helping lift investors’ confidence in Coinbase. The exchange’s various revenue streams, including trading fees, custody services, and institutional partnerships, have also contributed to its stock performance. US lawmakers boost crypto sentiment with policy shift The return of Coinbase also coincides with growing regulatory clarity and political support of digital assets in the United States. Washington is warming to crypto after years of hostility and uncertainty. Legislation on the horizon on stablecoins and clearer signals from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are also helping the sector lay down the law. Bipartisan backing in Congress has added fresh momentum to bills that could provide transparency and oversight, particularly in critical functions including custody, staking, and decentralized finance. President Donald Trump has publicly supported crypto innovation, unlike previous administrations. Under his rule, there has been a huge policy expansion in the domain of crypto, such as creating a crypto reserve for the country. Coinbase, a longtime advocate for reasonable regulation, has been one of the most vocal in communicating with legislative staff and regulatory agencies. And it is paying off. Investors, analysts, and crypto enthusiasts these days see Coinbase as not just an exchange but also a bridge between the digital economy and the traditional financial system.

This is according to filings submitte d to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, June 26. The shelf offering could consist of sales of Bakkt’s Class A common stock, preferred stock, warrants, and debt securities. The shift would be the latest strategic change for Bakkt. However, according to the SEC filing , the firm has not yet made any crypto purchases. Bakkt files for SEC shelf registration amid the growing interest in crypto Bakkt submitted a filing to the SEC through a “shelf” registration process. With this shelf registration, the firm can occasionally sell any mix of the securities mentioned in the prospectus in one or more offerings. The filing stated that Bakkt may sell securities occasionally through one or more offerings, with amounts, prices, and terms decided at the time of each offering. This prospectus outlined the basic terms of these securities and how the firm will offer them. According to the filing, the total price for the securities Bakkt sells will not go over $1 billion. The SEC also required the company to include the price they would pay for those securities and the amount of money they expected to make from the sale. This came after Bakkt said it had “updated” the investment policy to specifically allocate capital into Bitcoin and other digital assets as part of its treasury and corporate strategy on June 10. Founded in 2018, Bakkt is now an emerging crypto treasury firm that allows investors to make a leveraged bet on digital assets such as Bitcoin, ETH, and SOL by financing digital asset purchases in the traditional capital markets. Earlier, the Atlanta-based firm, which started with backing from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) owner Intercontinental Exchange, offered an institutional-grade trading platform for daily physically-settled Bitcoin futures before trying to tokenize rewards points and crypto custody. This product failed to gain traction. The company went public in 2021. Meanwhile, Bakkt’s initial Chief Executive Officer, Kelly Loeffler, resigned in 2019 to briefly serve as a Republican United States senator in Georgia under the first Trump administration . Moreover, President Donald Trump’s social media company, Truth Social, was said to be in “advanced talks” to acquire Bakkt last November. Bakkt officials highlight the firm’s focus on crypto Following the announcement that Bakkt had “updated” the investment policy, Akshay Naheta, co-CEO of Bakkt, stated that this plan aims to help Bakkt change into a company that focuses solely on crypto infrastructure and allows them to add Bitcoin and other digital assets to their treasury carefully. According to Naheta’s speculations, their strategy shows their strong belief in the future of digital assets and their goal for Bakkt to grow globally and become a leader in programmable money. Andy Main, Co-CEO and President of Bakkt, also commented on the topic of discussion. According to him, their updated investment policy shows their confidence in digital assets’ long-term potential and dedication to seeking strategic opportunities that increase shareholder value. Main said this is a significant step for the company as it looks to expand into global payments and remittance systems using stablecoins while being part of the ongoing development of the digital asset ecosystem.

This isn’t just any financial announcement; it carries the weight of a former U.S. President’s backing, making its upcoming move particularly noteworthy. Within days, WLFI, a venture associated with Donald Trump, is poised to release the very first audit of its USD1 stablecoin, promising to pull back the curtain on its crucial reserve backing . This event is not merely a procedural step; it represents a critical moment for crypto transparency and trust in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. Understanding WLFI and the Promise of WLFI USD1 Before diving into the audit’s implications, it’s essential to grasp what World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is and the vision behind its USD1 stablecoin. WLFI has emerged as a player in the financial technology space, aiming to bridge traditional finance with the burgeoning world of digital assets. Its connection to Donald Trump adds a unique dimension, potentially drawing attention from both crypto enthusiasts and those interested in political figures’ ventures beyond their primary roles. The USD1 stablecoin, as its name suggests, is designed to maintain a stable value pegged to the U.S. dollar, offering a digital medium of exchange that avoids the notorious volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The core promise of any stablecoin, including WLFI USD1 , lies in its ability to offer stability. This stability is typically achieved by backing the digital token with an equivalent amount of fiat currency (like USD) or other stable assets held in reserve. For users, stablecoins serve multiple purposes: Safe Haven: A place to park funds during market downturns without converting back to fiat. Efficient Transactions: Faster and cheaper international transfers compared to traditional banking. Trading Pairs: A common base currency for trading other cryptocurrencies on exchanges. The impending audit is therefore not just a formality; it’s a foundational step in building confidence around WLFI’s ability to deliver on this promise of stability and reliability for its WLFI USD1 stablecoin. Why a Stablecoin Audit is Crucial for Crypto Transparency In the world of digital assets, trust is paramount, and nowhere is this more evident than with stablecoins. The history of stablecoins has seen its share of controversies, primarily revolving around the actual reserves held by issuers. This is precisely why a robust and transparent stablecoin audit is not just beneficial, but absolutely critical. An audit provides an independent verification of an issuer’s claims regarding their reserve assets. It answers the fundamental question: Is every USD1 token truly backed by one U.S. dollar (or equivalent assets)? The importance of such an audit cannot be overstated. Here’s why: Building User Confidence: Users need assurance that their stablecoin holdings are genuinely collateralized and can be redeemed at par. An audit provides this peace of mind. Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments and financial regulators worldwide are increasingly focusing on stablecoins, demanding greater transparency and accountability. A comprehensive audit helps meet these evolving regulatory expectations. Market Integrity: The stability of major stablecoins impacts the entire crypto market. If a large stablecoin were to de-peg due to insufficient reserves, it could trigger a ripple effect across the ecosystem. Preventing Fraud and Mismanagement: Regular, independent audits act as a safeguard against potential mismanagement of funds or outright fraudulent claims about reserves. For WLFI, being among the first to publish a detailed audit for its USD1 stablecoin, especially with the high-profile association of Trump crypto ventures, sets a precedent. It demonstrates a commitment to transparency that could potentially differentiate it in a competitive market. The Significance of Reserve Backing Disclosure At the heart of any stablecoin’s credibility lies its reserve backing . This refers to the assets that the stablecoin issuer holds to back each token in circulation. For USD-pegged stablecoins, these reserves typically consist of U.S. dollars, short-term U.S. Treasury bills, commercial paper, corporate bonds, or other highly liquid assets. The quality and liquidity of these reserves are critical. If the reserves are not liquid enough, or if they consist of risky assets, the stablecoin may struggle to maintain its peg, especially during periods of high redemption demand. WLFI’s announcement that its audit will disclose its reserve backing is a significant step. This disclosure will likely detail: Composition of Reserves: What specific assets make up the backing? (e.g., cash, T-bills, etc.) Custodian Information: Where are these assets held? Which financial institutions are involved? Total Value of Reserves: The exact monetary value of the assets held. Circulating Supply of USD1: The total number of USD1 tokens currently in circulation. Attestation or Audit Report: An independent verification confirming that the reserves indeed match or exceed the circulating supply. For a stablecoin, particularly one associated with a figure like Donald Trump, clear and unambiguous disclosure of reserve backing is paramount. It addresses potential skepticism and builds foundational trust, which is vital for any financial product, digital or otherwise. This move by WLFI could serve as a benchmark for future stablecoin projects, pushing for greater accountability across the board. How Does This Impact Trump Crypto Ventures and the Broader Market? The foray of a prominent political figure like Donald Trump into the cryptocurrency space has always been a topic of intense interest and debate. While his previous ventures have largely focused on NFTs, the involvement with a stablecoin through WLFI marks a more direct engagement with the financial infrastructure of the crypto ecosystem. This impending stablecoin audit for USD1 could have several implications: Legitimization for Political Figures: It could set a precedent for how political figures engage with and potentially legitimize aspects of the crypto industry through transparency initiatives. Increased Scrutiny: The high-profile nature means that WLFI and USD1 will likely face heightened scrutiny from regulators, media, and the public, potentially pushing them to maintain even higher standards of compliance and transparency. Market Diversification: It introduces a new player into the stablecoin arena, potentially fostering competition and innovation, especially around audit practices. Public Perception: Depending on the audit’s findings, it could either boost public confidence in the viability of stablecoins backed by non-traditional entities or raise further questions about their operational integrity. The broader crypto market, already grappling with evolving regulations and calls for greater accountability, will be watching closely. A successful, transparent audit from WLFI could reinforce the idea that stablecoins can be robust and reliable, even those from less conventional issuers. Conversely, any perceived shortcomings could add to the regulatory pressures facing the entire stablecoin sector. Challenges and Opportunities for WLFI USD1 While the upcoming audit is a positive step towards crypto transparency , WLFI and its USD1 stablecoin face both challenges and significant opportunities in the competitive stablecoin market. Challenges: Competition: The stablecoin market is dominated by established giants like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC), which boast massive market caps and widespread adoption. Gaining market share will be an uphill battle. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for stablecoins is still in flux globally. WLFI must navigate complex and potentially changing rules, especially given its high-profile association. Trust Deficit: Despite the audit, some users may harbor skepticism due to past controversies surrounding stablecoins or the political affiliation. Consistent transparency will be key to overcoming this. Operational Scalability: As adoption grows, WLFI must ensure its operational infrastructure can handle increased transaction volumes and redemption requests efficiently. Opportunities: Niche Market: The ‘Trump-backed’ aspect could attract a specific segment of users who align with his brand or political views, creating a unique market niche. First-Mover Transparency: By being among the first to release a detailed audit, WLFI can set a new standard for transparency, potentially attracting users who prioritize this above all else. Innovation in Compliance: The intense scrutiny could drive WLFI to innovate in terms of how they conduct audits, manage reserves, and communicate with stakeholders, potentially leading to best practices for the industry. Bridging Divides: If successful, WLFI USD1 could serve as a bridge, introducing traditional investors and a broader public to the benefits of stablecoins and digital assets in a seemingly more familiar and regulated context. The success of WLFI USD1 will hinge not just on the initial audit, but on continuous adherence to the highest standards of financial integrity and transparency. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts and Investors For those observing or participating in the cryptocurrency market, the WLFI USD1 audit presents several points to consider: Examine the Audit Details: Don’t just rely on headlines. When the audit is released, delve into the specifics of the reserve backing . Look at the quality of assets, the custodian, and the independent auditor’s reputation. This is crucial for assessing the true stability of WLFI USD1 . Compare with Peers: How does WLFI’s audit and reserve structure compare to those of USDC, USDT, or BUSD? Understanding these differences can inform your stablecoin choices. Monitor Regulatory Response: Pay attention to how regulators react to this audit, especially given the political connection. Their response could signal future regulatory trends for stablecoins. Consider Diversification: Even with a transparent audit, it’s wise to diversify your stablecoin holdings if you rely heavily on them for liquidity or trading. Stay Informed on WLFI’s Roadmap: Beyond the audit, what are WLFI’s plans for adoption, utility, and integration within the broader crypto ecosystem? This event underscores a broader trend towards greater accountability in the crypto space. As the industry matures, crypto transparency will become less of an option and more of a requirement for long-term success and mainstream adoption. Conclusion: A New Era for Stablecoin Trust? The impending release of the first audit for Trump-backed WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin marks a pivotal moment, not just for WLFI, but for the entire stablecoin ecosystem. By promising to fully disclose its reserve backing , WLFI is stepping forward in an effort to champion crypto transparency , an increasingly vital component for widespread adoption and regulatory acceptance. This move could set a new benchmark for how stablecoins operate and how they are perceived by the public and regulators alike. While challenges remain in a highly competitive and evolving market, this commitment to a rigorous stablecoin audit could position WLFI USD1 as a credible and trustworthy option. It signals a growing maturity within the digital asset space, where verifiable proof of reserves is becoming non-negotiable. As the crypto world continues to evolve, initiatives like this will be instrumental in building the trust necessary for digital currencies to fulfill their transformative potential.

Ethereum continues to attract institutional optimism following ETF speculation, while Avalanche’s expanding ecosystem has drawn steady developer attention. XRP, backed by fresh futures listings and Ripple’s ongoing regulatory progress, remains one of the most recognized altcoins in the market. Yet for many long-term holders of these assets, the recent market tone feels familiar: stable, but stale. ETH and AVAX have traded in tight ranges for weeks. XRP, despite its progress on the legal and compliance front, is still struggling to decisively break resistance. As capital searches for higher upside, many of these investors are now turning to a surprising new name— MAGACOIN FINANCE . MAGACOIN FINANCE Draws Eyes as Breakout Contender for 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly emerged as one of the most watched early-stage projects of the year. Priced at under a penny and still in its presale phase, the token has already raised over $10 million. Each round is selling out faster than the last, and community growth is accelerating across platforms. From seasoned ETH traders to XRP loyalists, many are making the same move: rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE early—before listings, before FOMO peaks. What’s driving the shift? Timing and structure. MAGACOIN FINANCE arrives in a window where the market is hunting asymmetrical returns, and the project is delivering exactly that setup. With a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens, transparent smart contract audits, and no confusing emissions, the value proposition is simple: a low market cap entry point with the potential for exponential upside if momentum continues. For holders of ETH, AVAX, and XRP—assets with multi-billion dollar valuations—MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something those large caps can’t: the chance to get in at the beginning of a narrative. The same kind of narrative that once surrounded SHIB, DOGE, or even XRP in its earliest days. Except now, that narrative is forming in real time—and the window is still open. Presale Momentum Signals a Shift in Market Sentiment The broader presale landscape has been hit or miss in recent years, but MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be striking the right chord. Its message is resonating: bold branding, unapologetic positioning, and a tokenomics structure that rewards early conviction. Investors who’ve held through bear markets are tired of waiting on sideways charts. MAGACOIN FINANCE gives them a reason to act now. And this isn’t just retail speculation. The growing volume of ETH and AVAX wallets entering the presale suggests smart money is already moving. Discussions in private trading circles, Telegram groups, and crypto forums increasingly mention MAGACOIN FINANCE not as a gamble—but as a calculated, early-stage play. Could MAGACOIN FINANCE Join the Ranks of Top Performers? It’s too early to call any token a guaranteed winner. But the ingredients are lining up: strong early fundraising, an exploding community, a capped supply, and a presale structure that mirrors previous breakout plays. For Ethereum, Avalanche, and XRP holders watching the charts go sideways, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents something rare—a shot at being early again. As Q3 unfolds and exchange listings approach, the noise around MAGACOIN FINANCE is likely to get louder. For now, the signal is clear: capital is moving, and momentum is building.

It is about recognising the moment just before quiet progress turns into public acceleration. With BlockDAG (BDAG) , that shift has not happened yet. And that is what makes the current window so important. The six-week rollout plan outlined in BlockDAG’s roadmap is detailed and structured. Each week brings new functionality, from staking and mining to DeFi tools and exchange listings. It is a sequence built to drive utility before price discovery. But the key detail is this. The countdown has not started. Those entering now are ahead of every major milestone, before token circulation, before staking closes, and before DeFi activation changes the pace. Inside BlockDAG’s Six-Week Rollout Plan BlockDAG’s six-week countdown is not a placeholder. It is a structured execution plan designed to deliver real network value ahead of listings. It begins with the end of the presale, the start of staking, and the conversion of all X1 and TAP points into BDAG coins. Wallet migration also finalises at this point, preparing users for on-chain participation. As the countdown continues, the mainnet goes live. Production infrastructure, including high-performance ASIC miners, becomes active while tokens remain non-tradable. In the third week, decentralisation takes hold with the launch of community-run nodes and mining pools, allowing early participants to secure the network pre-listing. By Week 2, 40% of presale tokens are airdropped. At the same time, the full DeFi stack launches, including the DEX, bridge, oracle services, lending features, and the launchpad. This culminates in listing week, which opens with a lead exchange before expanding across more than nine platforms. Every phase builds function before exposure, setting up a foundation for lasting network value. The Importance of Getting In Before the Clock Starts This early phase is not just about getting a better price. It is about locking in strategic positioning. With the current limited-time offer at $0.0030 and only for a few days until the increase to $0.0080, participants are entering ahead of visibility acceleration. The confirmed $0.05 listing puts the return window at 1500%, a rare setup in any presale cycle. But the real edge lies in what is already happening behind the scenes. Over 2 million users are actively mining BDAG using the X1 app, creating sustained engagement before trading begins. More than 18,000 ASIC miners have been sold. Deliveries for the X30 and X100 models begin July 7, with X10 units shipping by August 15. Demand is rising well ahead of liquidity. BlockDAG has sold 23.2 billion BDAG coins and raised $323 million toward its $600 million goal. That capital is being deployed to build a structure, not just fuel speculation. It’s an ecosystem already under construction, building momentum before it ever hits exchanges. A Network That Exists Before the Token Trades Unlike projects that debut a token before anything works, BlockDAG is taking the opposite route. Its testnet is live and functional. Developers can deploy EVM-compatible smart contracts, build dApps using a no-code interface, and test ecosystem tools without needing coins in circulation. This reverses the typical flow seen in Layer 1 launches. Infrastructure is going live first. Trading comes later. This structure mimics the early success paths of Bitcoin’s initial mining model, Kaspa’s DAG architecture, and Solana’s validator-driven rollout. But BlockDAG brings all of it into one combined framework, streamlining early access through mobile apps, miner rigs, and developer grants. Crypto Market Snapshot BlockDAG has designed its rollout to favour early movers, not momentum chasers. The testnet is active, miner adoption is rising, and no-code dApps are already being built. Decentralised mining pools are ready, and real builder activity is underway. But marketing campaigns, exchange volume, and token liquidity have yet to begin. That is exactly what makes this phase so powerful. In crypto, the advantage comes from owning infrastructure before it becomes the headline. BlockDAG still offers that window. But once the six-week countdown begins, the early edge fades, and the rush to catch up begins.

New on-chain data suggests that BTC “weak hands” are selling their holdings to larger investors. Bitcoin Moving Upstream From Weak Hands To Big Money According to a recent Cryptoquant Quicktake post by contributor IT Tech, Bitcoin’s supply is moving upstream from retail investors to larger holders. This movement denotes a fundamental shift in the investor sentiment toward the largest digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Following ABCD Pattern? Analyst Sees Path To $137,000 Retail investors – those holding less than one BTC – have seen a significant reduction in their holdings, with total balances dropping by 54,500 BTC year-over-year (YoY), to 1.69 million BTC. On average, this cohort has experienced outflows of approximately 220 BTC per day. In contrast, large holders – wallets with 1,000 BTC or more – have expanded their total BTC exposure by 507,700 BTC over the same period, bringing their combined holdings to 16.57 million BTC. This group is now seeing average inflows of around 1,460 BTC per day. Institutional interest in Bitcoin also continues to rise at a historic pace. Notably, institutions are currently absorbing about seven times more BTC than retail investors are selling. At the same time, the post-halving issuance of BTC is currently hovering around 450 BTC a day, raising the possibility of a true “supply squeeze” amid strong buying pressure. To recall, BTC underwent its latest halving in April 2024, when the mining reward for each block on the chain was slashed from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. In their commentary, IT Tech noted that meaningful retail interest has yet to kick in during this cycle. Unlike previous market tops – where retail investors aggressively accumulated BTC – current data shows them exiting the market, suggesting that the bull run may still have more room to grow. Another metric that points toward the market top being far from the current price level is the Bitcoin 30-day MA Binary CDD. In a recent analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Avocado_onchain noted that the BTC market is “far from overheating.” BTC Short-Term Holder Floor Approaching $100,000 As BTC remains range-bound between $100,000 and $110,000, the short-term holder (STH) realized price – a key psychological support level – is steadily climbing. It currently sits near $98,000, reflecting rising investor conviction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For Rally As Geopolitical Tensions Ease And Inflation Expectations Fall Further on-chain data also shows that both retail and institutional holders are reducing exchange deposits, signalling reluctance to sell at current levels. This behavior supports the idea that many are positioning for further upside. At press time, BTC trades at $107,012, down 0.5% in the past 24 hours.

Wormhole, a leading interoperability platform, has announced a monumental partnership with Ripple, the company behind the XRP Ledger. This collaboration is set to bring robust multichain support to the XRP Ledger and its highly anticipated EVM sidechain, marking a significant leap forward for blockchain connectivity. This isn’t just about moving tokens; it’s about fostering a new era of decentralized applications, enhancing liquidity, and unlocking unprecedented possibilities across payments, DeFi, and real-world asset (RWA) use cases. Understanding the XRP Ledger and its EVM Sidechain: What’s the Big Deal? Before diving into the specifics of Wormhole’s integration, it’s crucial to grasp the foundational elements: the XRP Ledger and its upcoming EVM sidechain. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) has long been recognized for its speed, cost-effectiveness, and reliability, primarily in facilitating global payments. Its native cryptocurrency, XRP, enables near-instantaneous cross-border transactions, making it a favorite for financial institutions and individual users alike. However, while efficient for payments, the XRPL’s core design has historically limited its direct support for complex smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) in the same vein as Ethereum. Enter the EVM sidechain. This addition is a game-changer for the XRP Ledger ecosystem. An EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible sidechain allows developers to deploy smart contracts written in Solidity – the programming language of Ethereum – directly onto a network connected to the XRP Ledger. This means that the vast ecosystem of dApps, tools, and developer talent built around Ethereum can now seamlessly extend their reach to the XRPL. It’s about combining the XRPL’s payment efficiency with the flexibility and programmability of an EVM environment, creating a hybrid powerhouse for innovation. Key aspects of the EVM sidechain’s importance: Smart Contract Functionality: Enables the creation of complex dApps, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending protocols, and more. Developer Familiarity: Lowers the barrier to entry for Ethereum developers looking to build on the XRPL ecosystem. Ecosystem Expansion: Attracts new projects and users, diversifying the types of applications available on the XRPL. Unlocking Potential with Wormhole Multichain Interoperability The partnership with Wormhole is the key that unlocks the full potential of this evolving XRP Ledger ecosystem. Wormhole is a leading decentralized messaging protocol that enables arbitrary data and asset transfers between different blockchains. Think of it as a universal translator and bridge for the blockchain world. With Wormhole’s integration, assets and information can flow freely and securely between the XRP Ledger, its EVM sidechain, and the multitude of other blockchains Wormhole already supports, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and more. This Wormhole multichain capability addresses one of the most significant challenges in the blockchain space: fragmentation. Currently, different blockchains operate in silos, making it difficult for users and applications to interact across networks. Wormhole breaks down these barriers, creating a more unified and liquid digital economy. For the XRP Ledger, this means: Cross-Chain Asset Transfer: XRP and other assets on the XRPL can be securely wrapped and used on EVM-compatible chains, and vice-versa. Data Exchange: Decentralized applications on the EVM sidechain can communicate with and leverage data from other Wormhole-connected chains. Enhanced Liquidity: Capital can move more freely, improving liquidity for DeFi protocols and tokenized assets across ecosystems. This level of blockchain interoperability is not just a technical feat; it’s an economic accelerator. It allows developers to build truly cross-chain applications, rather than being confined to a single network. This fosters innovation, reduces development costs, and ultimately provides a richer, more integrated experience for end-users. Revolutionizing DeFi Payments and Beyond: What Does This Mean for You? The implications of this integration are profound, especially for DeFi payments and the broader decentralized finance landscape. The XRPL’s inherent efficiency for payments, combined with the EVM sidechain’s smart contract capabilities and Wormhole’s interoperability, creates a powerful trifecta. Imagine a scenario where: Seamless Cross-Chain Lending: You could deposit XRP on the XRPL, use Wormhole to bridge it to an EVM chain, and then use that bridged asset as collateral for a loan on an Ethereum-based DeFi protocol, all without multiple complex steps. Global Payment Rails for DeFi: Businesses could leverage the XRPL’s payment speed for international settlements, while simultaneously utilizing DeFi protocols on the EVM sidechain for yield generation or automated treasury management. Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs): Real-world assets like real estate, commodities, or intellectual property, tokenized on the EVM sidechain, could gain broader accessibility and liquidity by being easily transferable to other major blockchains via Wormhole. This partnership is poised to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance, making DeFi more accessible, efficient, and versatile. It paves the way for new financial products and services that can leverage the best features of multiple blockchain networks, ultimately driving mainstream adoption of decentralized technologies. The Strategic Importance of the EVM Sidechain in This Ecosystem The EVM sidechain is not just an add-on; it’s a strategic imperative for the XRP Ledger’s future growth and its integration into the wider blockchain universe. By providing an EVM-compatible environment, Ripple is effectively inviting the vast community of Ethereum developers and projects to build on the XRPL. This significantly expands the potential use cases beyond traditional payments to encompass the burgeoning world of DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and more. The sidechain’s ability to host complex smart contracts, combined with Wormhole’s bridging capabilities, creates a powerful magnet for innovation. Developers can now leverage the XRPL’s core strengths – speed, low fees, and established network – while still benefiting from the flexibility and extensive tooling of the EVM ecosystem. This dual approach ensures that the XRP Ledger remains competitive and relevant in a rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. Benefits of this Landmark Integration: Enhanced Liquidity: Capital can flow freely between the XRP Ledger, its EVM sidechain, and other major blockchains, increasing overall market liquidity. Expanded Developer Reach: Ethereum developers can easily port their dApps to the XRPL EVM sidechain, fostering a vibrant new ecosystem.

This denial, confirmed by reports, specifically targeted a motion seeking an ‘indicative ruling’ to dissolve a permanent injunction and significantly reduce Ripple’s proposed monetary penalty by more than half. The motion was officially terminated on June 26, marking a pivotal moment in this high-stakes legal drama. But what does this mean for Ripple, XRP, and the broader cryptocurrency landscape? Understanding the SEC Ripple Case : A Legal Saga Unpacked To truly grasp the gravity of Judge Torres’s recent decision, it’s essential to revisit the origins of the SEC Ripple case . This legal saga began in December 2020 when the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and co-founder Chris Larsen. The core of the SEC’s accusation was that Ripple had engaged in an unregistered, ongoing offering of securities through the sale of its digital asset, XRP, to retail investors. The regulatory body alleged that XRP functioned as an investment contract, thereby falling under the purview of U.S. securities laws, which Ripple vehemently denied. Ripple, on the other hand, argued that XRP is not a security but rather a digital currency used for facilitating fast and low-cost international payments. They contended that the SEC’s regulatory approach was a classic case of ‘regulation by enforcement,’ lacking clear guidelines for the burgeoning crypto industry. This fundamental disagreement has fueled a protracted legal battle, with significant implications not just for Ripple and XRP, but for how digital assets are classified and regulated across the United States and potentially globally. The crypto community has closely watched every development, recognizing that the outcome could set a precedent for other cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects. The Significance of Judge Torres Ruling : A Deep Dive into Judicial Authority Judge Analisa Torres has been at the helm of this complex litigation, and her rulings have often been a source of major market movements for XRP. Her previous partial summary judgment in July 2023 was a landmark decision that brought significant clarity to the case. In that ruling, Judge Torres distinguished between Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP, which she deemed unregistered securities, and programmatic sales of XRP on exchanges, which she ruled were not securities. This nuanced distinction was a partial victory for Ripple and was widely celebrated by the crypto community, leading to a significant surge in XRP’s price and a sense of optimism about the case’s eventual resolution. The recent denial of the joint request for an ‘indicative ruling’ further underscores Judge Torres’s firm judicial approach. An indicative ruling is typically sought when a case is on appeal, and a party wants the trial court to indicate whether it would grant a motion (like dissolving an injunction or reducing a penalty) if the case were remanded. The denial suggests that, at this stage, Judge Torres sees no immediate reason to reconsider or modify her previous orders concerning the permanent injunction or the proposed Ripple penalty . This indicates a preference for allowing the legal process to unfold as prescribed, without premature interventions based on potential future appellate outcomes. Navigating the XRP Lawsuit : Implications for Holders and the Market The XRP lawsuit has cast a long shadow over the digital asset, impacting its market performance, liquidity, and perception within the broader crypto ecosystem. For years, the uncertainty surrounding its legal status led many exchanges to delist XRP or restrict its trading for U.S. customers. This created significant market fragmentation and hindered XRP’s growth compared to other major cryptocurrencies. The partial victory in July 2023 brought a wave of relief, with many exchanges relisting XRP, and its price experiencing a notable rally. However, the recent denial by Judge Torres injects a renewed sense of caution. While not a direct loss for Ripple, it signals that a quick and easy resolution, particularly concerning the financial penalties, might not be on the horizon. XRP holders, who have weathered significant volatility and legal uncertainty, continue to watch every development closely. The ongoing legal battles emphasize the need for regulatory clarity in the crypto space, as the lack thereof directly impacts market stability and investor confidence. The community’s sentiment often swings with each legal update, reflecting the deep personal and financial stakes involved. The Contested Ripple Penalty : Why the Reduction Was Denied At the heart of the recently denied joint request was the significant financial penalty that the SEC is seeking from Ripple. Originally, the SEC demanded approximately $2 billion in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, alleging that Ripple illegally profited from unregistered XRP sales. Ripple, in response, argued for a much lower penalty, proposing a figure closer to $10 million. Their arguments for reduction centered on various factors, including the nature of their ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) sales, which they contended were not securities, and the lack of any investor harm from their programmatic sales. The joint request for an indicative ruling aimed to reduce this substantial monetary penalty by more than half and dissolve a permanent injunction that the SEC was seeking. While the exact legal reasoning for Judge Torres’s denial has not been fully detailed, common interpretations suggest that the court might view such a request as premature or unnecessary at this stage of the proceedings. It could imply that the court prefers to wait for the appellate process to potentially unfold or that it does not see sufficient grounds to alter its current position on the injunction or the penalty amount without further legal arguments or a definitive appellate decision. This denial means that the dispute over the exact size of Ripple’s financial penalty will continue to be a contentious point, potentially requiring further litigation or negotiation before a final figure is settled. The Role of the US District Court in Shaping Crypto Regulation The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York has become a crucial battleground for cryptocurrency regulation. Its decisions, particularly in high-profile cases like the SEC Ripple case , carry immense weight and often set precedents for how digital assets are treated under existing laws. The court’s meticulous approach in distinguishing between different types of XRP sales highlights the complexities involved in applying traditional securities laws to novel technologies. This court’s rulings are not just about Ripple; they are about defining the boundaries of regulatory authority in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. The challenges of regulating crypto are manifold: the global nature of digital assets, the decentralized characteristics of many projects, and the speed at which technology evolves often outpace legislative and regulatory frameworks. The judiciary, therefore, finds itself in a position of interpreting existing laws to fit new paradigms, a task that is inherently complex and often leads to prolonged legal battles. The denial of this joint request from the US District Court further underscores the judiciary’s commitment to due process and careful deliberation, rather than expediting outcomes that may have significant long-term implications for the entire crypto industry. What’s Next for the SEC and Ripple? Looking Ahead The denial of this joint request, while a significant development, is certainly not the final chapter in the SEC Ripple case . Both parties still have avenues to pursue. Ripple could appeal the aspects of Judge Torres’s ruling that went against them, particularly regarding the institutional sales. Similarly, the SEC could appeal the programmatic sales ruling. Settlement talks remain a possibility, though the current denial suggests that the path to a quick resolution is not straightforward. The court will likely proceed with determining the final penalty amount, which could involve further hearings or submissions from both sides. For investors and market participants, the key takeaway is that regulatory clarity for XRP and other digital assets remains a work in progress. While the lawsuit has provided some distinctions, the ultimate classification of various crypto assets continues to be debated. It is crucial for market participants to stay informed, understand the potential implications of ongoing legal proceedings, and consider how regulatory developments might impact their investment strategies. The long-term outlook for XRP will largely depend on the final resolution of this lawsuit and the broader regulatory environment that emerges in the U.S. Conclusion: A Definitive Step, But Not the End Judge Analisa Torres’s denial of the joint SEC and Ripple request to modify her ruling and reduce the Ripple penalty marks a definitive, if not final, step in this protracted legal saga. It reinforces the court’s intention to meticulously follow legal procedures and not rush to judgment, especially on matters of significant financial and legal consequence. While it may prolong the uncertainty for some, it also highlights the judiciary’s commitment to a thorough and deliberate process in shaping the future of cryptocurrency regulation. The crypto world will continue to watch closely, as every decision in this case has far-reaching implications for how digital assets are treated under the law, influencing everything from market dynamics to innovation in the blockchain space.

Judge Analisa Torres has officially rejected a request from both Ripple and the SEC. They had asked the court to allow them to move forward with a private settlement, hoping it would cancel out the court’s earlier judgment. But the judge made it clear that private deals don’t erase public court decisions. In her ruling, Judge Torres explained that her judgment was made based on the law, and since those laws haven’t changed, there’s no reason for her decision to change either. She also pointed out that Ripple and the SEC don’t have the power to ignore a final court ruling. If they want to settle, they’ll need to either drop their appeals and accept her decision or continue through the appeal process. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP BREAKING: Judge Torres has denied the parties’ Motion for an Indicative Ruling. pic.twitter.com/9AMhGcQUsU — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) June 26, 2025 Crypto attorney Fred Rispoli weighed in on social media, giving some insight into what might happen next. He said both sides have to submit a status report to the 2nd Circuit Court in August. That report will reveal whether they plan to move forward with the appeal, which could keep the case going until late 2026 or early 2027, or if they’ve reached a settlement. According to Rispoli, settlement is the most likely outcome and expects we could hear about it by the end of July or early August this year. For now, everyone’s waiting to see what the next move will be in this closely watched legal battle. Attorney Bill Morgan also took to social media and wrote, “But as the judge points out the parties can just agree to settle by withdrawing the appeals. As I said in a post a few hours ago they could’ve done that any time over the last two months but Ripple wanted more. It wanted the injunction dissolved.”",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-27 02:13:23

HYPE, Kaspa Climb Post-Conflict",https://thecoinrise.com/qubetics-nears-june-30-launch-is-it-the-top-crypto-with-100x-potential-hype-kaspa-climb-post-conflict/,"As geopolitical tensions ease following the Iran-Israel ceasefire, signs of renewed confidence are emerging across the crypto market. Daily volume on key exchanges has increased, speculative assets have begun regaining traction, and leading tokens like HYPE and Kaspa are seeing a surge in attention. With this environment regaining momentum, the question is: which asset is poised to dominate the next wave? One contender is gaining extraordinary traction. Qubetics ($TICS) is making headlines with its upcoming top 10 global exchange listing. It’s rapidly expanding presale, which has already surpassed $18.1 million. Unlike many of its contemporaries, Qubetics directly tackles real-world utility through a decentralised VPN and secure cross-border connectivity, all while analysts increasingly call it the top crypto with 100x potential. Qubetics Decentralized VPN Could Redefine Secure Access in Web3 What sets Qubetics apart from a growing crowd of presale projects is its foundational use case: a decentralised VPN designed to eliminate Web2-era vulnerabilities. As surveillance fatigue and data insecurity mount globally, the demand for secure, anonymous browsing and data flow has intensified across industries. Through its Decentralized VPN (dVPN), Qubetics provides a multi-layered framework enabling encrypted, location-agnostic connectivity. For example, healthcare organisations working with sensitive patient data can use Qubetics’ VPN infrastructure to enable real-time, compliant remote access for cross-border clinical collaboration. Similarly, journalists or human rights groups in censorship-heavy regions could communicate safely without traceability. Even small-to-medium enterprises conducting overseas operations stand to benefit from the dVPN’s immunity to centralized choke points or ISP throttling. Built into the broader Qubetics architecture, one that aggregates Layer-1 blockchains, privacy tech, and tokenised services, the VPN module aligns with the project’s mission: to provide seamless, secure digital infrastructure to both individuals and organisations. The project’s emphasis on privacy, decentralisation, and functional utility is why some analysts are placing it at the front of the top crypto with 100x potential list. Why Early Adopters Are Taking Notice of This Top Crypto with 100x Potential As of Stage 37, Qubetics is priced at $0.3370 with over 516 million $TICS tokens sold. The presale tally now exceeds $18.1 million, and the total token holder count has surpassed 28,300. With fewer than 9 million tokens remaining at the current price, demand is accelerating. Once this stage ends, the price will rise again until the presale closes permanently and access transitions to the open market. At the time of writing, a $5,500 contribution would secure roughly 16,322 $TICS tokens. Should $TICS reach $1, this would convert to $16,322, offering a return of over 196%. If the token climbs to $5 in the next cycle, that initial $5,500 becomes $81,610. A rise to $10 or $15 would raise the value to $163,220 or $244,830 respectively. The tokenomics further support long-term viability. From an initial supply of over 4 billion, the circulating cap has been reduced to 1.36 billion tokens. Public allocation accounts for 38.55% of that, ensuring decentralisation while preserving scarcity. With a top 10 global exchange listing confirmed and an initial trading price projected around $0.40, early adopters are eyeing a 20% price increase immediately upon launch. Qubetics isn’t just gaining attention, it’s redefining expectations for what a high-utility presale can offer. Three Hours to Market: Qubetics Locks in June 30 Exchange Debut Qubetics will close its final presale stage on June 30 at 8 AM UTC and list on a top 10 exchange by 11 AM UTC, just three hours later. The confirmed listing price is $0.40—up 20% from current presale levels—fueling last-minute buying from early adopters. This seamless shift from presale to exchange signals a calculated launch, backed by reduced token supply and rising demand. With over 516 million tokens already sold, Qubetics is being dubbed the best crypto pre sale closing out June and one of the strongest bets for Q3. Analysts expect post-launch momentum to build rapidly, making this a rare entry point for those still on the sidelines. Kaspa’s Early Buyers See 50x Returns as Community Momentum Accelerates While Qubetics builds momentum, Kaspa has shown why early adoption in fundamentally strong Layer-1 projects still pays off. According to Coinpedia, early community members who backed Kaspa have seen returns exceeding 50x. This growth is rooted in Kaspa’s Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, which enables instant confirmation and high throughput, an innovation that remains unique among major Layer-1 blockchains. Kaspa’s rising popularity is not only due to its tech. Its accessibility has played a major role in community traction. Low entry barriers and strong decentralisation narratives have made it a go-to option for those seeking transparent, scalable alternatives to Ethereum or Solana. The platform’s ability to combine proof-of-work security with DAG-based speed is attracting new protocols to consider it as infrastructure. While the token’s future price targets are speculative, its performance has already become a reference point in the discussion around altcoins that could sustain relevance through multiple market cycles. HYPE Eyes New All-Time High Amid Perpetual DEX Growth Another coin making news in this stabilising market is HYPE (Hyperliquid), which analysts believe could be on track for a new all-time high. Per TradingView, the decentralised perpetuals exchange supporting the token has grown exponentially in both liquidity and user onboarding. HYPE’s core infrastructure supports 0.01-second trading latency and advanced risk engines, making it attractive to high-volume traders who need speed, accuracy, and autonomy. The HYPE price prediction for 2025 hovers around ambitious targets, driven by the expansion of on-chain perpetuals, a niche growing rapidly amid dissatisfaction with centralised exchanges. With the broader DeFi ecosystem seeking deeper liquidity and faster execution, Hyperliquid is emerging as a protocol positioned to capture a large share of that shift. While the current price remains below previous peaks, analysts forecast that structural growth in DeFi combined with new partnerships may help HYPE chart new price territory within the next 12–18 months. Its role in the ongoing decentralisation of financial markets gives it long-term appeal, especially as regulatory scrutiny on centralised platforms intensifies. A Strategic Look at the Top Crypto with 100x Potential As the market settles after a period of conflict-driven uncertainty, participants are searching for the top crypto with 100x potential, and these three projects are at the forefront. Kaspa has validated its long-term promise with real results. HYPE is riding the DeFi expansion wave and could redefine DEX trading velocity. But Qubetics combines Layer-1 interoperability, privacy, and a decentralised VPN into a single framework, and that’s not just novel, it’s essential. With a confirmed top exchange listing at $0.40, over 516 million tokens already sold, and a finite window remaining at current prices, Qubetics may offer what few presales can: scalability, utility, and price potential. For those exploring the best crypto presale right now, this is one project that warrants serious consideration. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the Qubetics use case? Qubetics enables secure, decentralized internet access through its dVPN system, protecting user privacy across industries and regions. Is Qubetics available on major exchanges? Not yet, but it is confirmed to be launching soon on a top 10 global exchange with an initial listing price of $0.40. Which is the top crypto with 100x potential in 2025? Qubetics is increasingly cited by analysts as the top crypto with 100x potential due to its real-world utility and upcoming exchange listing. Summary As the crypto market steadies following the Iran-Israel ceasefire, renewed momentum is building around select altcoins, particularly Qubetics, Kaspa, and HYPE. Kaspa’s early adopters have seen up to 50x gains, while HYPE’s perpetual DEX is positioning for a possible new all-time high. Yet, it’s Qubetics that stands out as the top crypto with 100x potential. With over 516 million tokens sold, $18.1 million raised, and a confirmed listing on a top 10 global exchange at $0.40, Qubetics is drawing serious attention. Its Decentralized VPN offers secure, scalable internet access, bridging privacy and real-world use cases across industries.

As the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all registered positive gains, investors are keenly observing what this bullish start signifies for broader investor sentiment and, crucially, its potential implications for digital assets. For many in the crypto community, understanding the interplay between traditional finance and the decentralized world is key to navigating market volatility and identifying emerging opportunities. Let’s delve into the specifics of today’s market open and explore its wider economic ramifications. What’s Driving the US Stock Markets Rally Today? Today’s trading session commenced on a high note, with all major US stock markets indices showing promising gains right from the opening bell. The S&P 500, a benchmark for large-cap U.S. equities, climbed by +0.37%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite, often a barometer for growth stocks and innovation, saw a respectable rise of +0.31%. Not to be outdone, the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average, representing 30 significant American companies, posted a gain of +0.28%. These figures, while modest, paint a picture of renewed confidence and positive buying pressure. This upward movement suggests a prevailing optimism among investors, perhaps fueled by recent corporate earnings reports, economic data, or shifting macroeconomic expectations. Such an immediate positive reaction at the market open often sets the tone for the rest of the trading day and can indicate a broader shift in market psychology. Decoding Investor Sentiment: Why Does a Strong Open Matter? A strong market open , particularly across major indices, is more than just numbers; it’s a powerful indicator of prevailing investor sentiment . When markets open higher, it often reflects a collective belief among participants that economic conditions are favorable, corporate profits will continue to grow, or that anticipated challenges are manageable. This positive outlook can create a virtuous cycle, encouraging more investment and further bolstering asset prices. Conversely, a weak opening can signal apprehension or a lack of confidence. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, tracking traditional market sentiment is vital because, despite their distinct characteristics, crypto markets often mirror the risk appetite seen in equities. When traditional investors feel confident enough to buy stocks, they might also be more inclined to allocate capital to higher-risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, perceiving the broader economic outlook as stable enough to support such ventures. This interconnectedness highlights the importance of keeping an eye on the bigger financial picture. The Crypto Correlation Conundrum: How Connected Are We? The relationship between US stock markets and the cryptocurrency space has been a subject of intense debate. Historically, Bitcoin, often seen as “digital gold,” was thought to be an uncorrelated asset, acting as a hedge against traditional market volatility. However, recent years have shown an increasing crypto correlation with major equity indices, particularly the NASDAQ. When tech stocks rally, often so do cryptocurrencies, and vice versa. Today’s positive stock market opening could, therefore, be interpreted as a bullish signal for crypto. Why this correlation? As institutional adoption of crypto grows and more traditional investors enter the space, digital assets are increasingly treated as risk-on assets, much like growth stocks. This means that factors influencing traditional equities—such as interest rates, inflation, and global economic stability—can also impact crypto prices. While the correlation isn’t always perfect, a robust performance in traditional markets often creates a favorable environment for crypto, signaling a broader willingness to take on risk across the investment landscape. It’s a reminder that while crypto offers unique value propositions, it doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Navigating the Economic Outlook: What’s Next for Markets and Crypto? Today’s positive market open certainly paints an encouraging picture for the immediate future, but what does it mean for the broader economic outlook and its long-term implications for both traditional finance and cryptocurrencies? A sustained upward trend in stock markets typically suggests underlying economic strength, perhaps driven by strong employment figures, contained inflation, or a dovish stance from central banks. For crypto, this can translate into continued investor confidence and potentially higher capital inflows. However, investors must remain vigilant. The global economy is a complex web, influenced by geopolitical events, regulatory shifts, and technological advancements. While a positive start is welcome, factors like persistent inflation, potential interest rate hikes, or unexpected global events could quickly shift the narrative. Therefore, while today’s gains are a reason for optimism, a prudent approach involves closely monitoring upcoming economic data, central bank announcements, and significant news events. Understanding these broader macroeconomic forces is crucial for making informed decisions, whether you’re trading stocks or digital assets, as they all contribute to the overarching investor sentiment . Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor: Monitor Macro Trends: Don’t just watch crypto charts. Keep an eye on traditional market performance, inflation data, and interest rate announcements. They significantly influence risk appetite. Diversify Wisely: While correlations exist, maintaining a diversified portfolio across different asset classes (including a mix of traditional and digital assets) can help mitigate risks. Stay Informed: News from major economies, particularly the US, can directly impact global market sentiment. Being aware of these developments helps in anticipating market shifts. Assess Risk Appetite: A rising tide lifts all boats, but be prepared for potential pullbacks. Understand your own risk tolerance before making significant investment decisions. In conclusion, today’s strong market open in US stock markets provides a significant boost to overall investor sentiment , reflecting a generally positive economic outlook . While not a direct predictor, this upward trajectory often fosters a more favorable environment for the cryptocurrency market, highlighting the growing crypto correlation . As traditional and digital financial worlds become increasingly intertwined, understanding these connections is paramount for any investor seeking to navigate the complex yet opportunity-rich landscape. The current positive momentum serves as a reminder that the broader financial ecosystem plays a crucial role in shaping the future of digital assets.

In a report released Thursday from Paris, the global watchdog said jurisdictions have made progress since 2024 on implementing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing frameworks for virtual assets and related service providers. However, it noted that critical challenges remain, particularly around licensing, offshore oversight, and identifying entities involved in virtual asset services. The FATF’s latest targeted update focused on Recommendation 15, which was expanded in 2019 to cover crypto markets. With virtual assets inherently borderless, regulatory failures in one jurisdiction can have global consequences.

The FATF also released a new guide outlining best practices for supervising compliance with the rule. The report flags mounting threats associated with the rise of stablecoins. It said their use by illicit actors, including North Korea-linked hackers, terror financiers and drug traffickers, has grown significantly. It warned that mass stablecoin adoption without coordinated regulation could increase global exposure to illicit finance. North Korea’s Record Crypto Theft Exposes Weak Links in Global Enforcement The update follows a series of alarming trends. So far this year, North Korea executed what the FATF described as the largest virtual asset theft in history, stealing $1.46b from exchange platform ByBit . Only about 3.8% of the stolen funds has been recovered. This shows serious gaps in international asset tracing and recovery efforts. Meanwhile, fraud and scams continue to trouble the crypto sector. The FATF cited industry estimates that around $51b in on-chain transactions last year were linked to such illicit activity. These cases point to increasingly sophisticated tactics by bad actors. As a result, governments are under growing pressure to enhance cooperation and improve asset seizure mechanisms. In one example, the UK’s Operation Destabilise demonstrated how coordinated law enforcement can disrupt crypto-fueled criminal networks. The FATF said such efforts must be replicated globally and backed by more robust supervision and enforcement. The watchdog acknowledged support from analytics firms including Chainalysis, Lukka, Merkle Science and TRM Labs in compiling the update. It also stressed that nearly 98% of the global virtual asset market is concentrated in jurisdictions within the FATF’s Global Network. Bringing these players into full compliance, it said, will be key to reducing worldwide risk.

Each built its own reputation—Ethereum as the foundation of DeFi and smart contracts, XRP as the institutional bridge asset, and AVAX as a scalable alternative layer one. But heading into Q3 2025, their hold on the market is slipping. Ethereum’s long-anticipated network upgrades have done little to reverse declining retail enthusiasm. Gas fees have eased, but congestion and complexity remain. XRP, despite legal progress and hints of an ETF push, continues to trade in a tight range. And AVAX, while technically sound, has lost the momentum it carried during the 2021–22 cycle. Traders looking for sharp upside are beginning to rotate out—and they’re not moving into other blue chips. Instead, attention is shifting toward earlier-stage opportunities. Among the names attracting serious interest, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as a clear favorite. Certainly—here’s a reworked version that keeps the structure professional, sharpens the language, and reads naturally without sounding like AI-generated copy: MAGACOIN FINANCE: Built for Traders Who Want a Clearer Path In MAGACOIN FINANCE takes a different approach from the usual crop of new tokens. There’s no convoluted roadmap or flashy promises—just a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens, no allocations for venture capital, and full transparency around how tokens are distributed. It’s a structure designed to reward early entrants and reduce the kind of selling pressure that typically drags new projects down. That clarity is part of what’s drawing in traders. Many are growing tired of navigating projects with complex vesting schedules, backroom deals, or ecosystem politics. MAGACOIN FINANCE avoids all of that. It doesn’t have to win back trust or reclaim lost ground—it’s starting clean, and building forward. Momentum is already building. The presale is gaining real traction, especially among investors who’ve grown frustrated with the slow pace of large-cap assets like Ethereum and XRP. Those tokens may still appeal to institutions, but for traders looking for early-stage opportunity, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the more compelling option—a high-upside play with timing on its side.A Different Kind of Rotation This shift isn’t about abandoning fundamentals. It’s about time horizon and opportunity. Ethereum’s dominance is unlikely to disappear. XRP has weathered harsher storms. AVAX still runs efficient infrastructure. But for those positioning now—not for preservation, but for growth—the trade is changing. Presale-stage altcoins are volatile by nature. But that’s where many of the strongest gains have come in past cycles. And with altcoin season forecasts growing more confident by the week, the timing for early positioning has rarely looked stronger. Conclusion Ethereum, XRP, and AVAX will remain relevant. But for traders seeking meaningful upside, the attention is already elsewhere. Among the altcoins now emerging, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out not just for its narrative, but for its structure, timing, and growing momentum. Whether it becomes a breakout success depends on execution—but it’s clear that more and more traders aren’t waiting to find out.

For many traditional investors, an RSI hitting 70 often signals an ‘overbought’ asset, typically followed by a price correction. But what if the rules for the volatile and exciting crypto market are different? Renowned analyst PlanB, famous for his Stock-to-Flow model, recently took to X to share a crucial perspective that might just put those worries to rest. Understanding Bitcoin RSI: Is 70 Really Overbought? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100. Traditionally, an RSI reading above 70 suggests an asset is overbought, while a reading below 30 indicates it’s oversold. These are often seen as signals for potential reversals. However, PlanB’s latest insight challenges this conventional wisdom when applied to Bitcoin. He pointed out that while a 70 RSI might raise eyebrows in traditional finance, it’s quite a normal occurrence for Bitcoin. Why? Because Bitcoin typically operates within a much broader RSI range, historically trading between 40 and 90. This makes the current level of 70 only slightly above its historical average of 65. This critical piece of PlanB analysis suggests that applying traditional metrics without considering Bitcoin’s unique market dynamics can lead to misinterpretations. Why Does Bitcoin Behave Differently? Exploring Unique Market Dynamics Bitcoin isn’t your average stock or commodity. Its inherent volatility, driven by factors like halving events, global macroeconomic shifts, rapid technological adoption, and evolving regulatory landscapes, contributes to its distinct RSI behavior. Here are a few reasons why Bitcoin’s RSI might differ: Rapid Price Discovery: Bitcoin is still a relatively young asset class, undergoing rapid price discovery. Periods of intense buying pressure can sustain high RSI levels for longer than traditional assets. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s programmatic supply shock events (halvings) often precede parabolic bull runs, during which the asset can appear ‘overbought’ for extended periods as demand outstrips supply. Global Accessibility: Unlike many traditional markets, Bitcoin trades 24/7 globally, leading to continuous price action that can sustain momentum. Investor Psychology: The unique blend of retail and institutional investor sentiment in crypto can lead to prolonged buying frenzies that defy traditional ‘overbought’ indicators. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Investors So, what does this mean for you, the everyday Bitcoin investor? It means looking beyond simplistic indicators and understanding the broader context. Here are some actionable insights: Context is King: Don’t just look at the RSI number; understand where Bitcoin is in its market cycle (e.g., pre-halving, post-halving, accumulation phase). Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s historical performance shows that even after periods of high RSI, significant upside has often followed. A long-term holding strategy often outperforms short-term trading based on single indicators. Diversify Your Analysis: While RSI is a valuable tool, combine it with other indicators like moving averages, volume trends, and on-chain metrics to get a more comprehensive picture. Avoid Panic Selling: The fear of an ‘overbought’ asset can lead to premature selling. PlanB’s perspective helps mitigate this fear by contextualizing the current RSI level. Challenging the ‘Overbought Bitcoin’ Narrative The idea of an overbought Bitcoin at an RSI of 70 is largely a narrative carried over from traditional markets. In equity markets, an RSI of 70 often suggests that a stock’s price has risen too quickly and is due for a pullback. However, Bitcoin’s parabolic growth phases have frequently seen its RSI sustain levels well into the 80s and even 90s before any significant correction. This resilience to traditional ‘overbought’ signals is a hallmark of Bitcoin’s unique market behavior and highlights the importance of crypto-specific analysis. PlanB’s consistent focus on Bitcoin’s long-term value and unique market dynamics provides a calming perspective amidst short-term market fluctuations. His emphasis on the historical trading range of 40-90 for Bitcoin’s RSI reminds us that what might seem alarming in one market is perfectly normal in another. This understanding empowers investors to make more informed decisions, reducing the likelihood of reacting to false signals and staying focused on the asset’s potential. The Future of Investor Sentiment in the Crypto Market As the crypto market matures, the sophistication of its analysis must evolve. Relying solely on traditional indicators can be misleading. PlanB’s latest commentary serves as a powerful reminder that Bitcoin operates under its own rules, influenced by unique supply-demand dynamics, technological advancements, and a passionate global community. Understanding these nuances is key to navigating the exciting yet volatile world of digital assets. By embracing a crypto-native analytical approach, investors can better gauge true market health and make decisions aligned with Bitcoin’s unique trajectory.

Former Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett responded to this development, posting a summary of Judge Torres’s message to Ripple and the SEC, following the decision to deny their joint motion seeking to modify key terms of the court’s final judgment. Private Deals Cannot Override Public Judgments Terrett explained that the Judge made it clear that private agreements cannot override a public judgment issued by a federal court. The ruling leaves Ripple’s permanent injunction in place and maintains the $125 million penalty previously imposed. Judge Torres emphasized that a court’s final judgment is not something parties can negotiate away. Her statement was direct: “The parties do not have the authority to agree not to be bound by a court’s final judgment.” Terrett also noted that the ruling underlines that judgments serve the interests of the litigants and the broader public interest. NEW: Judge Torres’s message in the ruling is that private deals don’t erase public judgments and her judgment still serves the public interest. “The parties do not have the authority to agree not to be bound by a court’s final judgment… They have not come close to doing so… https://t.co/Jt5STl3nWt — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) June 26, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Limited Options for Ripple and the SEC Her message also offered a clear choice to Ripple and the SEC. If either party disagrees with the court’s decision, the path forward is through the appeals process, not through privately negotiated revisions. The SEC initially asked the Second Circuit to extend the stay on the appeals to August 15 to give Judge Torres time to make her decision. Her decision may force both parties into litigation. Alternatively, they can withdraw their appeals and accept the judgment as it stands. The judge made it clear that neither side had presented circumstances that would justify altering the judgment outside of the proper legal channels. Both Parties Failed to Meet the Required Standard While most market participants assumed the judge rejected the initial filing solely because of a procedural error, the recent ruling denies the notion that the court’s previous findings are subject to negotiation. Prominent attorneys believed Judge Torres would grant the motion . But the attempt to revise those terms without fully concluding the appellate process failed to satisfy the standards required for such relief. The language of the ruling leaves little room for ambiguity. According to Terrett’s post, Torres stated that the parties “have not come close” to demonstrating the type of extraordinary circumstances needed to set aside the judgment. Now, Ripple and the SEC must decide whether to pursue their appeals in full or accept the current judgment without further challenge.

This strategic acquisition is not just a one-off transaction but a foundational step in a much larger, ambitious crypto treasury strategy that could set a precedent for other established players. Why are HYPE Tokens Attracting Institutional Eyes? The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, with new projects emerging and gaining traction. Hyperliquid (HYPE) is one such asset that has recently captured the attention of major financial entities like Lion Group. According to a PR Newswire press release, Lion Group Holdings made an initial $2 million purchase of Hyperliquid (HYPE) tokens at an average price of $37.30. This isn’t merely an investment; it’s a calculated move to integrate digital assets into their core financial operations. Hyperliquid, as a decentralized perpetual exchange, offers high-performance trading and liquidity solutions within the DeFi ecosystem. Its underlying technology and growing user base likely present a compelling case for institutions seeking exposure to innovative blockchain protocols. The decision by Lion Group to specifically target HYPE tokens suggests a belief in the platform’s long-term potential and its role in the future of decentralized finance. Lion Group’s Ambitious Crypto Treasury Strategy : What Does it Mean? Lion Group’s $2 million HYPE token acquisition is just the tip of the iceberg. This initial purchase is part of a much broader $600 million treasury strategy aimed at diversifying its holdings and leveraging the growth potential of digital assets. This significant allocation signals a deep commitment to the crypto space, moving beyond speculative trading to integrate these assets into their fundamental financial framework. The firm plans to acquire more HYPE, along with other prominent cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI). This multi-asset approach highlights a thoughtful diversification strategy within the digital asset sector. The capital for these future purchases will be sourced from the proceeds of a recent $11 million funding round, demonstrating a proactive and well-funded initiative. Key Aspects of Lion Group’s Treasury Strategy: Scale: A formidable $600 million target allocation for digital assets. Diversification: Including HYPE, SOL, and SUI, indicating a belief in different segments of the crypto market. Funding Source: Leveraging recent funding round proceeds, ensuring a dedicated capital pool for crypto acquisitions. Long-Term Vision: Integrating digital assets into the core treasury, suggesting a long-term holding and strategic utilization perspective rather than short-term speculation. Beyond Hyperliquid : The Broader Digital Asset Play While the initial focus is on HYPE tokens, Lion Group’s plans extend to Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI), showcasing a comprehensive view of the digital asset landscape. Each of these assets represents a different facet of the blockchain ecosystem: Digital Asset Primary Role/Characteristics Why it Matters to Lion Group Hyperliquid (HYPE) Decentralized perpetual exchange, high-performance DeFi Exposure to cutting-edge DeFi infrastructure and trading innovation. Solana (SOL) High-throughput blockchain, scalable smart contracts, vibrant ecosystem Investment in a leading Layer-1 blockchain known for speed and growing dApp development. Sui (SUI) Layer-1 blockchain, object-centric model, designed for Web3 applications Betting on next-generation blockchain technology with unique design principles for future scalability. This multi-pronged approach allows Lion Group to gain exposure to different growth vectors within the crypto market, mitigating risks while maximizing potential returns. It reflects a sophisticated understanding that the digital asset space is not monolithic, and diverse investments are key to a robust crypto treasury strategy . The Rise of Institutional Crypto Investment : A New Era? Lion Group’s move is part of a larger trend of institutional crypto investment gaining momentum. Historically, the crypto market has been dominated by retail investors, but increasingly, large financial firms, hedge funds, and corporations are allocating significant capital to digital assets. This shift is driven by several factors: Maturing Market: Increased regulatory clarity (though still evolving), improved infrastructure, and more robust security measures make crypto more palatable for institutions. Inflation Hedging: Some institutions view cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a potential hedge against inflation or a store of value. Diversification: Digital assets offer a new uncorrelated asset class, providing diversification benefits to traditional portfolios. Technological Innovation: Belief in the underlying blockchain technology and its potential to disrupt various industries. The participation of Nasdaq-listed entities like Lion Group lends significant credibility to the crypto market, potentially encouraging other mainstream financial players to follow suit. This institutional influx can lead to increased liquidity, reduced volatility, and a more stable market environment overall. What Does Lion Group’s Move Mean for Lion Group Itself? For Lion Group Holdings, this aggressive foray into digital assets is a strategic pivot that could yield significant benefits. By integrating HYPE tokens , SOL, and SUI into their treasury, they are: Positioning for Future Growth: Tapping into a high-growth sector that could offer substantial returns, enhancing shareholder value. Innovating Their Business Model: Demonstrating adaptability and forward-thinking leadership in the financial services industry. Attracting New Clients: Appealing to a new generation of investors and businesses interested in digital assets, expanding their client base. Diversifying Revenue Streams: Potentially creating new opportunities for financial products and services related to digital assets. However, it’s also important to acknowledge the inherent volatility and regulatory uncertainties still present in the crypto market. Lion Group’s substantial commitment underscores their conviction, but like any investment, it comes with risks. Their careful selection of established and promising assets like Hyperliquid, Solana, and Sui suggests a measured approach within this high-growth sector. Conclusion: A Roaring Statement in the Digital Age Lion Group Holdings’ strategic $2 million acquisition of HYPE tokens , as part of its expansive $600 million crypto treasury strategy , marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. This move, alongside planned purchases of Solana and Sui, not only highlights the growing confidence in assets like Hyperliquid but also signifies a broader trend of institutional crypto investment reshaping the global financial landscape. As more traditional firms embrace these innovative technologies, the bridge between conventional finance and the decentralized world continues to strengthen, promising an exciting future for digital asset adoption.

XRP Price Prediction XRP’s overall price trend still leans bearish. The coin continues to make lower highs and lower lows, a pattern that signals weakness in the market. While small price jumps can happen even in a downtrend, a proper trend reversal would require XRP to start forming higher lows and eventually break past previous highs.

If the price does manage to move above $2.20 with a strong daily close, the next target area would be around $2.30 to $2.35. A breakout past this point would signal a much stronger bullish trend and could open doors for a rally towards $2.60. Can XRP Price Dip Below $2? On the downside, the key support zone to watch is between $2.05 and $2.10. If XRP falls below this, the next support would be around $1.92 to $1.95. Right now, momentum remains weak, with short-term gains appearing within a generally bearish market structure. For this bullish scenario to stay intact, XRP needs to hold above the $2.08 support area. If the price drops below this, it increases the risk of the market making a fresh low. If that happens, the focus would shift to the bigger support level around $1.79. At the moment, while Bitcoin has already shown signs of forming five waves up, XRP has yet to do the same. Until clearer signs of strength appear, experts are watching for signs of support holding and any move that could lead to a fifth wave upward.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-27 02:42:23

Recent developments surrounding Spot Dogecoin ETF filings by asset manager Bitwise are sending ripples of excitement across the market, hinting at a new era of mainstream adoption and regulatory clarity. What Exactly Did Bitwise Amend for Its Spot ETFs? In a significant move, leading cryptocurrency asset manager Bitwise recently submitted amended S-1 filings for its proposed spot Dogecoin and Aptos Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). This isn’t just a minor update; it’s a strategic refinement in response to ongoing dialogue with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, a keen observer of the ETF landscape, highlighted these updates on X, noting their positive implications. He emphasized that such amendments are a clear sign of active engagement from the SEC, a crucial step that has historically preceded the approval of other prominent spot ETFs. Why Are These Spot Dogecoin ETF and Aptos ETF Filings So Significant? The submission of amended S-1 filings for both the Spot Dogecoin ETF and Aptos ETF filing marks a pivotal moment. An S-1 filing is essentially a registration statement required by the SEC for new securities. When amendments are filed, it typically indicates that the issuer (Bitwise, in this case) is addressing feedback or concerns raised by the SEC. This iterative process is a standard part of regulatory review and, as Balchunas pointed out, aligns perfectly with the trajectory seen during the approvals of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. For investors, this means the SEC isn’t just sitting on these applications; they are actively engaging, providing feedback, and moving towards a potential decision. It signals a maturation of the crypto market in the eyes of regulators, transitioning from outright skepticism to a more structured, albeit cautious, review. What Does Crypto ETF Approval Mean for the Broader Market? The potential for Crypto ETF approval , particularly for altcoins like Dogecoin and Aptos, carries immense implications for the entire digital asset ecosystem: Increased Accessibility: ETFs provide a regulated, traditional investment vehicle, making it easier for retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the underlying assets. This removes complexities like managing private keys or navigating crypto exchanges. Institutional Adoption: The entry of more regulated products encourages larger financial institutions, pension funds, and wealth managers to allocate capital to crypto, legitimizing the asset class further. Market Liquidity and Stability: ETFs can bring significant capital inflows, potentially increasing market liquidity and reducing volatility over time as more sophisticated trading strategies are employed. Regulatory Clarity: Each approval sets a precedent, contributing to a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets, which is vital for long-term growth and investor confidence. Of course, challenges remain, including ongoing regulatory scrutiny and market volatility, but the trajectory is undeniably positive. How Does This Reflect Evolving SEC Crypto Regulation? The SEC’s approach to SEC crypto regulation has been a subject of intense debate and evolution. Initially, the Commission maintained a highly cautious stance, often citing concerns about market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of the crypto industry. However, the approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs, followed by spot Bitcoin ETFs, and more recently, spot Ethereum ETFs, indicates a significant shift. This progression suggests a growing understanding and, perhaps, acceptance of digital assets within the existing regulatory framework. The engagement with Bitwise on Dogecoin and Aptos filings underscores a willingness to consider a broader range of cryptocurrencies for regulated investment products, moving beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. This pragmatic approach, while slow, is crucial for fostering innovation while safeguarding investors. What’s Next for Bitwise ETF and the Crypto Market? For the Bitwise ETF proposals, the next steps will likely involve continued dialogue with the SEC, potentially more amendments, and eventually, a decision. While there’s no guaranteed timeline, the positive tone from analysts like Balchunas suggests a path forward. Potential Timelines: The review process can take months, but the precedent set by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs offers a template. Market Reaction: Should these ETFs receive approval, expect significant positive price action for Dogecoin and Aptos, driven by increased institutional interest and retail accessibility. Actionable Insights for Investors: Investors interested in these assets might consider researching the fundamentals of Dogecoin and Aptos, understanding their use cases and communities, and staying informed on regulatory updates. Diversification remains key, and consulting a financial advisor is always recommended before making investment decisions. Bitwise’s proactive steps in amending its spot Dogecoin and Aptos ETF filings are more than just bureaucratic updates; they are powerful indicators of advancing regulatory acceptance within the U.S. This positive engagement from the SEC, coupled with the insights from leading analysts, paints an optimistic picture for the future of crypto ETFs. As the digital asset landscape continues to mature, these developments pave the way for greater institutional participation and broader mainstream adoption, fundamentally reshaping how we view and invest in cryptocurrencies. The journey towards full regulatory clarity is ongoing, but each amended filing brings us closer to a more integrated and accessible crypto market.

The intelligent design and consistent advancement of the project have made it a hot issue among intellectuals looking for the next significant blockchain invention. Lightchain AI is gaining traction not through hype but rather by real interest in its scalable and utility-driven approach. Its presale raised $20.9 million and tokens are priced consistently at $0.007. Cardano is under doubt about timelines, but Lightchain AI is gathering support among builders and investors ready for a more quick and intelligent blockchain solution. Cardano Faces Scrutiny Over Persistent Roadmap Delays In 2025, Cardano is being watched ever more closely as its roadmap continues to face delays after it previously promised decentralization and scalability. Founder Charles Hoskinson has revealed the end of the original roadmap, which culminated with events such as the Plomin hard fork and the on-chain ratification of the Cardano Constitution, while crucial projects such as Hydra and Leios continue without a commitment to further funding, working “under at risk conditions”. These delays have caused concerns in the community, mainly about the staking function and other functionalities that have been promised. With the creation of the Constitutional Committee and later DRep election, the present transfer of governance is seen as a chance to solve these problems by acting as mo re transparent and more involved community servant. Still to be seen, though, whether such policies will prove successful in boosting confidence rebuilding and development. Key Influencer Endorsements Give Lightchain AI Visibility As important players start supporting the project for its practical use and technical innovation, lightchain artificial intelligence is becoming more and more visible in the crypto scene. Lightchain AI’s AI-integrated Layer 1 design, dynamic pricing model, and optimized gas structure are attracting respected voices unlike fleeting hype tokens. These sponsorships are helping to hasten demand at a pivotal point as the Bonus Round is under progress at a set $0.007 price. Influencers are stressing Lightchain AI’s distributed validator and contributor nodes, forthcoming public repository launch, and $150,000 grant program meant to support AIVM-powered development. Lightchain AI keeps growing outside of early adopters as more credible leaders offer their optimistic view gains traction among larger investor audiences who give utility and transparency top priority. From Podcasts to Portfolio: Lightchain AI Is Changing the Crypto Scene From buzzing podcasts to investor portfolios, Lightchain AI is generating waves in the crypto space and inspiring enthusiasm everywhere. Its dynamic gas optimization, lightning-fast execution, and modern AI-integrated blockchain architecture help to explain de velopers and investors fl ocking to it. The Transparent AI Framework guarantees completely verifiable and auditable AI computations, so adding still another layer of trust.

Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score Shows Mixed Behavior From Holders In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the BTC investor cohorts aren’t showing a unified behavior on the Accumulation Trend Score. The Accumulation Trend Score refers to an indicator that basically tells us whether Bitcoin holders are accumulating or not. The metric bases its value on two factors: the balance changes happening in the wallets of the investors and the size of those wallets. Related Reading: Tron’s 374% Profit-Taking Spree Uncovered—Here’s Who Was Behind It When the value of the indicator is greater than 0.5, it means the large holders (or a large number of small hands) are leaning toward net accumulation. The closer the score is to 1.0, the stronger the buying. On the other hand, the metric being under the threshold suggests the investors are in a phase of distribution (or simply, that they aren’t accumulating). This behavior is the strongest at the zero mark. Now, here is the chart for the Accumulation Trend Score shared by Glassnode, showing the trend in the metric separately for the various holder groups: As displayed in the above graph, the Accumulation Trend Score has recently varied in value across these cohorts. Investors who hold between 1 to 10 BTC appear to be distributing, while those with 10 to 100 BTC are accumulating. Among the large holders, the trend leans more neutral, but the indicator still doesn’t show any clear uniformity. Members of the 1,000 to 10,000 coins group, popularly referred to as the whales, are currently tending toward accumulation, but those part of the 10,000+ cohort, the ‘mega whales,’ are showing slight distribution. According to the analytics firm, the Accumulation Trend Score of the network as a whole stands at 0.57. As such, it seems there is no majority behavior being followed by the traders at the moment. Related Reading: Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals ‘Opportunity’ That said, while a unifying buying push hasn’t appeared alongside the latest price rally toward $108,000, there has still been an improvement that has occurred in the score. According to the analytics firm, the indicator dropped to a low of 0.25 earlier. It only remains to be seen, however, whether the Bitcoin investors would continue to move in this direction, or if indecision is here to stay for a while. BTC Price Bitcoin attempted to find a break above the $108,000 level earlier, but the asset has so far not been able to maintain a sustainable move, and its price has even seen rejection toward $107,100.

One project has quickly become the talk of those rotating capital: MAGACOINFINANCE. Analysts’ attention is shifting toward this new altcoin as it nears a highly anticipated listing price of $0.007 — a metric signaling deepening interest and layered buying behavior. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Attracting Big Players In a market full of recycled narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering something different — a fully capped 170 billion token supply, community-controlled governance, and verified smart contract infrastructure. But the real draw isn’t just tokenomics — it’s behavior. Long-term staking participation, wallet consolidation, and absence of dump cycles are the signals whales watch. And those signals are loud right now. Institutional whispers and early whale wallets suggest that many view MAGACOINFINANCE as more than just a meme contender — they see it as a positioning asset ahead of major price discovery. Solana (SOL) Maintains Ecosystem Momentum Solana continues to outperform expectations, both in user activity and network stability. With fast finality, low fees, and rising developer adoption, the Solana ecosystem has become a magnet for decentralized apps and retail traders alike. Its consistent infrastructure updates and growing TVL show long-term durability, reinforcing its role as a cornerstone in any serious crypto portfolio. As new capital flows into Solana, some of it is now being diverted into earlier-phase plays like MAGACOINFINANCE. Injective (INJ) Eyes a Breakout Range Injective is another altcoin drawing analyst attention, especially after new ETF-related developments and strong technical setups. Its current price action is consolidating above key support levels, and forecasts point to possible movement toward the $15–$16 range if bullish patterns hold. INJ’s growing on-chain value and increasing TVL are boosting investor sentiment — and yet, some capital is flowing into MAGACOINFINANCE as traders seek diversification ahead of major listing events. Kaspa (KAS) Signals Support Amid Volatility Kaspa is trading in a relatively tight range after facing volatility in early June. Although not yet signaling a definitive breakout, it remains on watch due to its strong community presence and fast block confirmation model. Momentum has slowed temporarily, but high engagement rates suggest that once the market pivots, KAS could regain traction — just as early holders of MAGACOINFINANCE expect similar timing for their project’s next wave. Uniswap (UNI) Tries to Reclaim Investor Confidence Uniswap is aiming to reclaim its status as a key DEX platform, especially as Layer 2 usage increases. However, competition has cut into its dominance, and UNI’s price action remains choppy. New upgrades and governance changes are being discussed, but capital rotation patterns suggest some traders are looking beyond established DEX names toward projects with cleaner entry profiles — a shift favoring altcoins like MAGACOINFINANCE. Final Thoughts With Solana delivering strong ecosystem growth, Injective testing bullish structures, Kaspa holding support, and Uniswap searching for momentum, traders are diversifying. And MAGACOINFINANCE — with its early performance and disciplined investor base — is quickly rising as the stealth contender ready to join 2025’s elite assets.

Imagine a company deciding to split its hard-won legal proceeds right down the middle, with half going into the volatile yet promising world of Bitcoin and the other half directly into the pockets of its shareholders. This is exactly what Genius Group is doing, setting a precedent that could reshape corporate financial strategies. Unpacking Genius Group’s Innovative Financial Strategy According to a GlobeNewswire press release, Genius Group has committed to allocating 50% of any future legal settlement proceeds to acquire Bitcoin. The remaining 50% will be distributed as special dividends to its shareholders. This dual-pronged strategy is not just about managing funds; it’s a statement about embracing new asset classes while rewarding loyal investors. The company is currently pursuing substantial damages, totaling over $1 billion, through two significant lawsuits. This includes a massive $750 million RICO case and an upcoming suit specifically targeting alleged short selling activities against the company. The potential for such a large inflow of capital makes their allocation strategy particularly impactful and intriguing. The Dual Appeal: Why Bitcoin Purchases and Shareholder Dividends? Why would a company choose such a distinctive path for its potential gains? The decision to dedicate half of its legal winnings to Bitcoin purchases and the other half to shareholder dividends reflects a strategic blend of forward-thinking investment and immediate shareholder gratification. The Allure of Bitcoin Purchases For many corporations, holding Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly attractive proposition. Here are a few reasons why Genius Group might be leaning into this: Potential for Capital Appreciation: Bitcoin, despite its volatility, has shown immense growth potential over the long term. Allocating funds to Bitcoin could allow Genius Group to benefit from future price surges, effectively growing their treasury. Diversification: Adding a digital asset like Bitcoin can diversify a company’s balance sheet beyond traditional fiat currencies and conventional investments, offering a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainties. Embracing Innovation: As an AI-focused education firm, embracing cutting-edge technology and digital assets aligns with Genius Group ‘s identity as an innovative entity. It signals a willingness to adapt to the evolving financial landscape. Attracting a New Investor Base: This move could appeal to a segment of investors who are enthusiastic about cryptocurrency and digital assets, potentially broadening Genius Group ‘s investor appeal. The Benefit of Shareholder Dividends On the other side of the coin, distributing shareholder dividends is a classic way to reward investors and boost confidence. Here’s why this half of the strategy is equally important: Direct Return to Investors: Special dividends provide a direct, tangible return on investment for shareholders. This can significantly increase investor satisfaction and loyalty. Signaling Financial Health: The ability to issue substantial dividends, especially from extraordinary income like legal settlements, signals strong financial health and management confidence to the market. Immediate Gratification: While Bitcoin offers long-term growth potential, dividends offer immediate cash flow to shareholders, which can be particularly attractive to income-focused investors. Market Confidence: A clear commitment to sharing profits with shareholders can enhance a company’s reputation and potentially attract more investment. Navigating the Legal Landscape: The Billion-Dollar Legal Settlement Pursuit The success of Genius Group ‘s strategy hinges entirely on the outcome of its ongoing legal battles. The company is seeking over $1 billion in damages, a significant sum that underscores the seriousness of its claims. Understanding the RICO Lawsuit One of the core components of their legal pursuit is a $750 million RICO lawsuit . RICO stands for the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a federal law in the United States designed to combat organized crime. However, it is also used in civil cases against individuals or organizations involved in patterns of racketeering activity. For Genius Group , this likely involves allegations of a pattern of illegal activities that have caused them significant financial harm. The specifics of Genius Group ‘s RICO lawsuit are not fully detailed in the initial press release, but such cases often involve complex allegations of fraud, extortion, or other illicit schemes that have impacted the company’s operations or market value. Winning a RICO case can be challenging, requiring substantial evidence to prove a pattern of criminal enterprise. The Short Selling Lawsuit In addition to the RICO case, Genius Group is preparing an upcoming lawsuit related to alleged short selling. Short selling is a trading strategy where an investor bets on a stock’s price decline. While legal, certain manipulative short selling practices, often referred to as ‘naked short selling’ or coordinated ‘short and distort’ campaigns, can be illegal and highly damaging to a company’s stock price and reputation. Genius Group ‘s pursuit of damages here suggests they believe they have been targeted by such illicit activities. The outcomes of these lawsuits are uncertain and can be lengthy processes. However, the company’s public commitment to how it will use the proceeds, should they win, adds a layer of transparency and investor confidence. What Does This Mean for the Future of Corporate Crypto Adoption? Genius Group ‘s bold move could serve as a fascinating case study for other companies contemplating similar strategies. While some corporations like MicroStrategy have famously adopted Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset, Genius Group ‘s approach of linking it directly to legal windfalls and simultaneously rewarding shareholders is relatively unique. Implications for Corporate Treasuries: Increased Crypto Exposure: If Genius Group ‘s strategy proves successful, it could encourage other companies to consider incorporating cryptocurrency into their treasury management, even if only for specific, extraordinary revenue streams. Hybrid Models: This could pave the way for more hybrid financial models where companies balance traditional financial practices with innovative digital asset adoption. Regulatory Scrutiny: As more companies venture into crypto, regulatory bodies will likely increase their scrutiny, leading to clearer guidelines and potentially more structured corporate crypto policies. Challenges and Considerations: Despite the excitement, this strategy is not without its challenges: Bitcoin Volatility: The price of Bitcoin can fluctuate wildly. While this offers potential for significant gains, it also carries the risk of substantial losses, which could impact the perceived value of the legal settlement. Legal Outcome Uncertainty: Winning large lawsuits, especially complex RICO cases, is never guaranteed. The entire strategy hinges on favorable legal rulings. Shareholder Expectations: Once this precedent is set, shareholders might expect similar distributions from future extraordinary gains, potentially creating pressure on the company. Tax Implications: The tax treatment of Bitcoin purchases from legal settlements and the distribution of special dividends can be complex and vary by jurisdiction. A Glimpse into the Future of Corporate Finance? Genius Group ‘s decision to split potential legal wins between Bitcoin purchases and shareholder dividends is a remarkable demonstration of innovative corporate finance. It showcases a company willing to embrace the future of finance while remaining committed to its investors. As the legal battles unfold, the world will be watching to see if this audacious strategy pays off, potentially setting a new benchmark for how companies manage extraordinary income and integrate digital assets into their core financial planning. This move by Genius Group is more than just a financial decision; it’s a statement about confidence in both their legal claims and the long-term value of Bitcoin. It’s a testament to a company looking beyond traditional boundaries to create value for its stakeholders in an ever-evolving economic landscape.

A wave of institutional optimism and renewed ETF speculation has sparked conversations around whether the long-anticipated $5 target is finally within reach. But while XRP prepares for a possible breakout, another name is rapidly climbing investor watchlists — MAGACOIN FINANCE. In what many are calling a shift in strategy, investors are increasingly positioning ahead of the next wave by combining exposure to legacy assets like XRP with early-stage tokens that show breakout potential. At the center of this trend is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project that analysts say carries both narrative momentum and structural upside. XRP Gains Traction Amid ETF Rumors and Institutional Momentum XRP’s road over the past few years has been shaped by ongoing regulatory clarity and expanding use cases in cross-border payments. With the SEC dispute largely behind it and enterprise adoption on the rise, the asset is regaining attention from analysts and institutions alike. The possibility of a spot XRP ETF is adding fuel to the bullish case. Industry experts note that an ETF approval could dramatically shift capital inflows, boosting both volume and market positioning. This narrative has led analysts to revisit high-range targets, including the long-held projection of a move toward $5 — a milestone that once felt distant but is now back in the realm of possibility. Institutional interest, particularly from payment firms and tokenization platforms, continues to grow. These developments suggest that XRP’s accumulation phase may be evolving into a setup for long-term upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as a Breakout Contender for 2026 While XRP captures headlines for its comeback potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly becoming a focal point for forward-looking investors. The token is structured with high-conviction appeal — leveraging scarcity-based mechanics, early-stage positioning, and mounting interest from analysts across major research hubs. Previous entry rounds have sold out instantly, and new participation continues to accelerate as early signs of breakout behavior emerge. Wallet activity, investor positioning, and research-driven sentiment all point to MAGACOIN FINANCE entering a pivotal phase of its growth trajectory. Rather than rely on trends or comparisons, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out a distinct identity, backed by a setup that many are calling one of the most asymmetric opportunities of the year. The listing price has already been confirmed, and strategic accumulation is on the rise as institutional and retail investors begin locking in positions. Analysts See Multi-Layered Growth Potential Across Both Assets Analysts covering both XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE highlight a key difference in investor psychology: XRP is now viewed as a large-cap with renewed upside following regulatory progress, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is seen as a high-upside asset still early in its market journey. The rotation into early-stage projects while maintaining exposure to larger market anchors is not new, but the current cycle appears to be rewarding those who move with conviction before wider awareness sets in. In this sense, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being tracked not as a speculative bet, but as a strategic position ahead of a potential surge. Final Thoughts: Positioning Ahead of the Next Cycle As the market gears up for what could be a watershed year in crypto, investors are busy positioning their portfolios around narrative, structure and timing. XRP is likely to undergo a strong upside potential in 2026 if an ETF happens. However, assets may grow quicker if they remain near areas of awareness where Easter-smart capital flows early. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the center of that conversation. Its confirmed structure parameters and analyst momentum continue to attract high-conviction interest. For those in tune with where the market is headed next, this is already clear.

In a discussion shared by prominent crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) on X, Vias explained how the XRP Ledger (XRPL) was purpose-built to handle high-volume financial transactions with unmatched efficiency. Vias emphasized that the XRPL is “very much a payments-focused ledger,” specifically engineered to support the demands of global financial infrastructure. He pointed to the payment channels feature on the ledger, which can handle up to 50,000 transactions per second. He added that, unlike experimental solutions elsewhere in the crypto space, this capability is live and functional today. RIPPLE: XRP IS THE “PERFECT” DIGITAL ASSET TO REVOLUTIONIZE INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS This is Miguel Vias from Ripple. Listen closely. He even states that the “The ledger can CURRENTLY scale to 50,000 TPS so it’s designed for high volume.” pic.twitter.com/3LGuXifMqp — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 25, 2025 The Technology Behind the Vision According to Vias, the technical design of XRP Ledger directly reflects Ripple’s mission to modernize and enhance cross-border payments . He explained that scalability was always a core objective. It allows the ledger to process massive transaction volumes without compromising speed or security. This network is also highly efficient, as Ripple President Monica Long recently noted that the XRPL is 120,000 times more energy efficient than Bitcoin’s network. Vias shared that this robust architecture was a key reason he decided to join Ripple. He described the combination of XRP, Interledger, and Ripple’s solutions as a marriage that made complete sense from a technological standpoint. In his view, these components together form the foundation for a modern international payment system capable of displacing outdated processes . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Proven Use Cases Remain Relevant Reflecting on Ripple’s earlier projects, Vias pointed to Ripple Trade and the Ripple Payments Platform as examples of how the digital asset’s capabilities were already being applied as far back as 2014. Ripple Trade functioned as an on-ledger exchange, while RPP facilitated fiat-to-XRP conversions for cross-border payments. While both products were eventually phased out, Vias noted that the core use cases they supported have become essential parts of today’s digital asset ecosystem. He emphasized that XRP and its ledger are still deeply integrated with Ripple’s broader strategy. “It’s clear as day how all of these worlds are merging,” Vias said, showing that XRP remains the optimal asset for facilitating seamless, high-speed global transactions. Vias also addressed a question that often arises within the XRP community regarding whether the XRPL is central to Ripple’s plans. He stated that the ledger is not only part of Ripple’s story but continues to be a vital element of the company’s strategy moving forward.

U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a vocal proponent of responsible digital asset integration, has indicated that a draft bill addressing crypto market structure is on the horizon, aiming for release before the crucial August recess. This development, shared by Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett, signals a pivotal moment for an industry long yearning for regulatory certainty in the United States. For anyone invested in the future of digital finance, this legislative push represents a beacon of hope for clearer guidelines and a more robust operational environment. Senator Lummis’s Vision: A Clear Path for Digital Assets Senator Lummis has consistently championed a balanced approach to digital assets, advocating for frameworks that foster innovation while protecting consumers. Her latest announcement suggests that the Senate is moving with purpose to define the rules of engagement for cryptocurrencies and related technologies. The timeline is ambitious: a draft bill expected within weeks, with markup discussions — the process of amending and refining legislation — slated for September. This proactive stance by Senator Lummis is seen by many as a necessary step to bring the U.S. up to speed with other global jurisdictions that have already begun to establish comprehensive regulatory regimes. Her vision centers on creating an environment where the benefits of blockchain technology can be fully realized without stifling growth through ambiguity or overly burdensome rules. Why a US Crypto Bill is Crucial for Industry Growth The absence of a clear and comprehensive US crypto bill has been a significant impediment to the growth and maturation of the digital asset industry within the United States. Currently, companies navigate a patchwork of state-level regulations and federal agency interpretations, leading to confusion, inefficiency, and sometimes, outright conflict. The benefits of a well-crafted federal bill are numerous: Regulatory Certainty: Businesses would have a clear understanding of what constitutes a security versus a commodity, how digital assets should be custodied, and what compliance measures are required. This clarity reduces legal risks and encourages investment. Enhanced Consumer Protection: A unified framework can establish robust safeguards for investors, addressing issues like fraud, market manipulation, and the responsible handling of customer funds. Fostering Domestic Innovation: By providing clear rules, the U.S. can attract and retain blockchain talent and companies, preventing the exodus of innovation to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Increased Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions often hesitate to fully engage with crypto due to regulatory uncertainty. A clear bill could unlock significant institutional capital. Global Competitiveness: The U.S. risks falling behind if it doesn’t establish a coherent regulatory stance, potentially losing its leadership position in the evolving global financial landscape. The current challenges, including ongoing enforcement actions and conflicting statements from various regulatory bodies, underscore the urgent need for legislative action. Shaping the Digital Asset Regulation Landscape What key elements can we expect from this proposed digital asset regulation ? While details of the new draft remain under wraps, previous legislative efforts and public statements from policymakers offer clues. It’s highly probable that the bill will attempt to delineate the jurisdictional boundaries between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regarding various types of digital assets. This distinction is critical, as it determines which regulatory body has oversight and what rules apply. Other potential areas of focus include: Stablecoin Frameworks: Establishing clear rules for stablecoin issuers, addressing reserves, redemption mechanisms, and auditing requirements. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Oversight: How to approach the regulation of decentralized protocols without stifling their innovative, permissionless nature. Custody Rules: Guidelines for how exchanges and other entities hold customer digital assets. Taxation: Clarifying tax treatment for various crypto activities. The legislative process is often complex, involving extensive debate and compromise. However, the intent to create a comprehensive framework for digital asset regulation is clear, aiming to provide both guardrails for the industry and confidence for participants. Navigating the Complexities of Crypto Market Structure Defining the ideal crypto market structure for the U.S. is no simple feat. The digital asset ecosystem is dynamic, rapidly evolving, and presents unique challenges that traditional financial regulations may not fully address. One of the primary complexities lies in classifying digital assets. Is a token a security, a commodity, or something entirely new? The answer has profound implications for how it is traded, offered, and regulated. Furthermore, the global nature of cryptocurrencies adds another layer of complexity. How can U.S. regulations effectively govern a market that operates 24/7 across borders? Policymakers must also consider the delicate balance between robust oversight and fostering technological advancement. Overly stringent rules could stifle innovation, pushing developers and entrepreneurs offshore. Conversely, a lack of clear rules can lead to market instability and harm investors. This ongoing legislative effort reflects a deep engagement with these intricate issues, striving for a framework that is both effective and adaptable. Fostering Blockchain Innovation While Ensuring Safety At its core, the goal of any sensible regulation should be to foster blockchain innovation while simultaneously ensuring market integrity and investor protection. The U.S. has a long history of leading technological advancements, and a well-designed crypto framework could solidify its position as a hub for Web3 development. This involves creating a regulatory environment that understands the nuances of decentralized technologies, smart contracts, and tokenization. For instance, clear guidelines can help distinguish between legitimate projects and fraudulent schemes, thereby building trust in the broader ecosystem. It can also encourage the development of new applications in areas like supply chain management, digital identity, and tokenized real-world assets. The challenge lies in crafting rules that are technology-neutral, allowing for future innovations without requiring constant legislative updates. This balance is critical to ensuring that the U.S. remains competitive and continues to attract the best minds in the blockchain space, turning the promise of distributed ledger technology into tangible economic benefits for all. For individuals and businesses operating in this space, staying informed about these legislative developments is paramount. Engaging with industry associations and providing constructive feedback to policymakers can help shape a future where blockchain innovation thrives within a clear and secure regulatory landscape. Senator Lummis’s announcement marks a significant and highly anticipated step towards establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the United States. The impending release of a draft bill on crypto market structure before the August recess, with markup discussions set for September, signals a determined effort to bring clarity and stability to an industry that has long operated under a cloud of uncertainty. While the path to finalized legislation may be complex, this initiative represents a pivotal moment for the digital asset space, promising a future where innovation can flourish within a well-defined and secure regulatory environment. The crypto community will be watching closely as these legislative efforts unfold, hopeful for a framework that supports growth, protects consumers, and solidifies the U.S.’s position at the forefront of the global digital economy.

For months, the crypto community has watched closely as traditional financial giants navigate the complex waters of digital assets. Now, a significant development has emerged from Bitwise, one of the leading names in crypto asset management, signaling a potential new chapter for two prominent digital currencies: Dogecoin and Aptos. Bitwise has recently updated its S-1 filings for proposed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for both Dogecoin and Aptos, a move that has caught the attention of market analysts and investors alike. What does this mean for the future of crypto investment, and why are these updates so crucial? Bitwise ETF Filings: What’s the Latest Scoop? Bitwise, known for its pioneering efforts in the crypto ETF space, has taken another concrete step forward. The submission of amended S-1 filings for its proposed spot Dogecoin and Aptos ETFs is more than just a procedural formality; it’s a strong indicator of ongoing, active engagement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, a widely respected voice in the ETF community, quickly noted this development on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting that these updates align perfectly with the trends observed during the approval processes for other major spot crypto ETFs, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These S-1 amendments typically involve refining disclosures, updating financial information, and addressing any feedback or questions from the SEC. They are a critical part of the regulatory dance that precedes any ETF approval. For Bitwise, this signifies not just persistence but a strategic alignment with the SEC’s evolving requirements and expectations for digital asset products. Decoding the Significance of SEC ETF Approval Progress Why are these updated filings by Bitwise so important in the grand scheme of SEC ETF approval ? The journey to getting a spot crypto ETF approved in the U.S. has been long and arduous. Historically, the SEC has expressed concerns over market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of crypto markets. However, the approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, followed by initial movements towards spot Ethereum ETFs, have set a precedent. Each amended filing, especially from a reputable firm like Bitwise, suggests a continued dialogue and a concerted effort to meet the SEC’s stringent criteria. The process often involves several rounds of amendments as the issuer and the regulator iron out details. Therefore, each new filing is a positive signal that the conversation is progressing, not stagnating. It indicates that Bitwise is actively responding to the SEC’s requests and refining its proposals to enhance transparency and investor safeguards. This iterative process is a hallmark of successful ETF launches in traditional finance, and its replication in the crypto sphere is a sign of market maturation. Spot Dogecoin ETF: A New Dawn for the ‘Meme Coin’? The prospect of a Spot Dogecoin ETF is particularly intriguing. Dogecoin, famously started as a joke, has evolved into a cryptocurrency with a massive community, cultural significance, and even practical applications. Its journey from a niche internet meme to a top-tier digital asset has been anything but conventional. An ETF for DOGE could mark a pivotal moment for the asset, offering several potential benefits: Increased Accessibility: A spot ETF would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Dogecoin without directly buying and holding the cryptocurrency, simplifying the investment process. Enhanced Legitimacy: SEC approval would bestow a significant level of institutional legitimacy upon Dogecoin, potentially attracting more conservative investors and capital. Liquidity and Price Discovery: An ETF could improve market liquidity for DOGE and contribute to more efficient price discovery by integrating it further into traditional financial markets. However, challenges remain. Dogecoin’s price is notoriously volatile and often influenced by social media trends, making it unique compared to other assets seeking ETF approval. The SEC will undoubtedly scrutinize its market dynamics and underlying structure closely. Despite these hurdles, the updated filing for a Dogecoin ETF underscores its growing mainstream appeal and the industry’s belief in its long-term potential. Exploring the Potential of a Spot Aptos ETF Equally significant is the updated filing for a Spot Aptos ETF . Aptos is a relatively newer blockchain, launched by former Meta (Facebook) employees, designed for scalability and high transaction throughput using the Move programming language. While it doesn’t have the same cultural history as Dogecoin, Aptos represents the cutting edge of blockchain technology, aiming to solve some of the scalability issues plaguing older networks. The potential benefits of an Aptos ETF are distinct: Institutional Exposure to Web3 Innovation: An ETF would provide traditional investors with a regulated avenue to invest in a next-generation blockchain platform, tapping into the broader Web3 ecosystem. Capital Inflow for Development: Increased investment via an ETF could further fuel the development and adoption of the Aptos network and its ecosystem. Diversification: For investors looking beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Aptos offers diversification into a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain. The SEC’s review of an Aptos ETF would likely focus on its technological robustness, decentralization, and market surveillance capabilities. As a newer asset, its market depth and regulatory clarity might present different considerations compared to more established cryptocurrencies. The Broader Impact on Cryptocurrency Investment These latest developments from Bitwise are not just about Dogecoin and Aptos; they represent a broader trend reshaping the landscape of cryptocurrency investment . The increasing number of spot ETF applications and the SEC’s gradual engagement signal a maturing market where digital assets are becoming more integrated into traditional finance. This integration offers several advantages: Mainstream Adoption: ETFs lower the barrier to entry for a vast pool of traditional investors, including retail and institutional clients, who prefer regulated and familiar investment vehicles. Market Efficiency: As more regulated products enter the market, it can lead to improved price discovery, reduced volatility (in the long term), and a more efficient overall market structure. Regulatory Clarity: Each ETF approval contributes to building a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets, which is crucial for long-term growth and stability. However, it’s also important to acknowledge that the road to full approval is rarely straightforward. The SEC maintains a cautious stance, and further amendments or delays are always possible. Investors should view these filings as positive steps in a complex regulatory journey, rather than guarantees of immediate approval. What’s Next for Bitwise, Dogecoin, and Aptos? The updated S-1 filings mean the ball is now back in the SEC’s court. The Commission will review the amended documents, potentially providing further feedback or requesting additional information. While there’s no fixed timeline for approval, the current pace of engagement suggests that the industry and regulators are working towards a common goal of bringing regulated crypto products to market. For investors, this period calls for continued observation. Monitoring SEC announcements, Bitwise’s subsequent filings, and market reactions will be key. The potential introduction of a Spot Dogecoin ETF and a Spot Aptos ETF could significantly broaden the avenues for cryptocurrency investment, offering new opportunities for diversification and exposure to the dynamic world of digital assets. In Conclusion: A Promising Horizon for Crypto ETFs Bitwise’s latest S-1 amendments for spot Dogecoin and Aptos ETFs underscore a relentless drive towards expanding regulated access to cryptocurrencies. These filings are more than just paperwork; they are a testament to the industry’s commitment to meeting regulatory standards and bringing innovative investment products to market. As the SEC continues its review, the crypto community watches with anticipation, hopeful that these strategic moves will pave the way for a more inclusive and mature landscape for cryptocurrency investment. The journey is ongoing, but each step forward brings us closer to a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into the global financial system.

For many, MAGACOINFINANCE is fast becoming the top answer . Backed by aggressive accumulation, staking participation, and community-led growth, this rising altcoin is earning serious attention from both early traders and long-term capital allocators aiming for the next $1.3 million payoff. Solana (SOL) Expands as Developer Activity Surges Solana remains one of the most active and stable Layer 1 networks. Recent upgrades have further improved throughput and lowered latency, driving consistent engagement from both developers and dApps. With top-tier NFT platforms, liquid staking protocols, and meme tokens flourishing in its ecosystem, Solana has once again cemented its role as a high-performance alternative to Ethereum. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Case for Explosive Growth MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as a politically themed meme token with robust tokenomics, a capped supply of 100 billion, and a presale price under $0.0. Its early-stage status, viral marketing, and rapidly expanding community (over 12,500 holders and counting) are fueling speculation that it could replicate the exponential runs seen by Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in previous cycles. Key factors driving bullish sentiment include: Community and Hype : Aggressive viral campaigns and a swelling grassroots following have made MAGACOINFINANCE a trending topic across crypto forums and social media. Audited Security: The project’s smart contracts have been audited by HashEx, adding a layer of trust and transparency. Strategic Bonuses: Early investors can secure up to 100% extra tokens during the presale, maximizing their upside potential. Ethereum (ETH) Consolidates While Institutions Accumulate Ethereum is now trading in a tightly coiled range between $2,500 and $2,600. While price has paused, behind the scenes, whales and institutions are buying. Nasdaq-listed firms have added ETH to treasuries and staked reserves, and spot ETF inflows continue to rise. ETH’s future looks more like traditional finance than ever before Aptos (APT) Maintains Engagement in a Competitive Layer 1 Field Aptos continues to be among the top Layer 1 chains by active addresses, even as price action remains subdued. Developer interest remains high, and the team is investing heavily in ecosystem tools. Kaspa (KAS) Holds Its Ground with a Loyal Community Kaspa remains quiet in major headlines but continues to build within its niche. Its high-throughput blockDAG architecture remains unique in the space, but lack of new catalysts has slowed speculative volume. Why Bitcoin and Solana Bulls Are Buying In Early-Stage Momentum: MAGACOINFINANCE is still in its infancy, offering the kind of ground-floor entry that produced life-changing returns in prior cycles. Narrative and Timing: The blend of political meme energy, robust tokenomics, and a market hungry for new narratives is a potent formula for viral adoption. Conclusion Bitcoin and Solana bulls believe MAGACOINFINANCE offers a rare shot at outsized returns, with $1.3 million dreams rooted in both historical precedent and current market momentum. Whether it can deliver remains to be seen, but in a market driven by narrative, hype, and early entry, MAGACOINFINANCE has quickly become the altcoin to watch in 2025.

46862879,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=172730,1750995034,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/46862879.jpeg,Synaptogenix Rebrand Unveils Transformative Shift to TAO Synergies,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/synaptogenix-rebrand-tao-synergies/,"BitcoinWorld Synaptogenix Rebrand Unveils Transformative Shift to TAO Synergies In a groundbreaking move that underscores the growing convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset world, Synaptogenix, a company listed on Nasdaq, has announced a significant corporate transformation. The company is set to undergo a complete Synaptogenix Rebrand , changing its name to ‘TAO Synergies’ and adopting the new ticker ‘TAOX.’ This pivotal decision follows closely on the heels of its strategic commitment to invest $10 million in TAO tokens as part of an innovative Blockchain Treasury Strategy . This shift isn’t just a name change; it’s a powerful statement about the company’s future direction and its embrace of decentralized technologies. What Propelled the Synaptogenix Rebrand to TAO Synergies? The decision by Synaptogenix to rebrand as TAO Synergies is directly linked to its recent foray into the cryptocurrency market. Just earlier this week, the company publicly declared its intention to allocate a substantial $10 million towards the acquisition of TAO tokens. This isn’t merely an opportunistic investment; it’s a foundational element of their newly articulated Blockchain Treasury Strategy . By integrating digital assets into their core financial operations, Synaptogenix is signaling a profound shift in its corporate identity and strategic focus. The new name, ‘TAO Synergies,’ reflects this embrace of synergy between traditional business models and the potential of blockchain technology, with ‘TAO’ clearly referencing their significant token acquisition. This strategic pivot highlights several key aspects: Commitment to Digital Assets: A $10 million TAO Token Investment by a Nasdaq-listed entity is a strong signal of conviction in the long-term value and utility of specific digital assets and the broader blockchain ecosystem. Forward-Thinking Treasury Management: Moving beyond traditional cash reserves, the company is exploring new avenues for capital management and value creation in a digital-first economy. Brand Alignment: The rebranding ensures that the company’s public identity is aligned with its evolving strategic direction, clearly communicating its new focus to investors, partners, and the market at large. Understanding the Blockchain Treasury Strategy For many traditional corporations, treasury management has historically revolved around cash, bonds, and other low-risk, liquid assets. However, the emergence of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology has introduced a paradigm shift. A Blockchain Treasury Strategy involves integrating digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or specific utility tokens (such as TAO tokens in this case) into a company’s balance sheet and financial operations. This strategy offers several potential advantages, though it also comes with unique challenges. Here’s a comparison of traditional versus blockchain-enabled treasury approaches: Aspect Traditional Treasury Blockchain Treasury Primary Assets Fiat currency, bonds, money market funds Fiat, digital assets (cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, NFTs) Inflation Hedge Limited, susceptible to fiat devaluation Potential hedge against inflation (e.g., Bitcoin) Diversification Traditional asset classes Adds a new, uncorrelated asset class Technological Alignment Conventional financial systems Embraces Web3, future-proofs business models Liquidity & Accessibility High for established markets Growing, 24/7 global markets The adoption of such a strategy by Synaptogenix, now TAO Synergies , reflects a growing trend among forward-thinking companies to leverage digital assets not just for investment returns but as a strategic component of their long-term financial health and innovation roadmap. The specific choice of a TAO Token Investment indicates a belief in the particular utility or ecosystem associated with that token, beyond just a general crypto allocation. The Impact of TAO Token Investment on Corporate Identity The decision to make a significant TAO Token Investment and subsequently rebrand to TAO Synergies is more than a financial transaction; it’s a profound shift in corporate identity. A company’s name and ticker symbol are central to its public perception and investor relations. By explicitly incorporating ‘TAO’ into its new name, the company is directly tying its future to the success and development of the TAO token ecosystem and, by extension, the broader blockchain space. What does this signal to the market? Innovation and Adaptability: It positions the company as an innovator, willing to adapt to new technological paradigms and explore unconventional avenues for growth. Investor Appeal: It could attract a new segment of investors who are keen on companies with exposure to the high-growth potential of digital assets and blockchain technology. Strategic Vision: It suggests a long-term vision where blockchain and digital assets are not just an investment but an integral part of future business operations and value creation. However, this bold move also comes with increased scrutiny. Investors will be watching closely to see how the company manages the volatility inherent in digital assets and how its new blockchain-centric strategy translates into tangible business results beyond just treasury management. Broader Implications for Crypto Corporate Adoption The Synaptogenix Rebrand and its strategic investment are part of a larger, accelerating trend: Crypto Corporate Adoption . While companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have previously made headlines for their Bitcoin acquisitions, Synaptogenix’s move is distinct in its immediate and direct impact on the company’s very identity and name. This signals a deepening level of commitment to the digital asset space, moving beyond simple balance sheet allocations to a full embrace of the underlying technology and its associated ecosystems. Why are more companies considering this path now? Maturing Infrastructure: The cryptocurrency market has developed more robust infrastructure, including institutional-grade custody solutions, trading platforms, and regulatory clarity (albeit still evolving). Inflationary Concerns: Persistent global inflation has prompted companies to seek alternative stores of value beyond traditional fiat currencies. Competitive Edge: Integrating blockchain technology and digital assets can offer a competitive advantage, enabling new business models, efficiencies, and customer engagement strategies. Synaptogenix’s transformation into TAO Synergies could serve as a blueprint for other Nasdaq-listed or publicly traded companies contemplating a similar pivot. It demonstrates that integrating digital assets can go beyond just treasury management to fundamentally reshape a company’s brand and strategic direction, opening doors to new markets and opportunities within the burgeoning Web3 economy. Navigating the Future: Benefits and Challenges for TAO Synergies The journey for TAO Synergies , post-rebrand and significant TAO Token Investment , will undoubtedly present both compelling opportunities and significant hurdles. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for stakeholders. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Market Position: By embracing blockchain and digital assets so explicitly, TAO Synergies positions itself at the forefront of technological innovation, potentially attracting new investors and talent interested in the future of finance. Diversified Revenue Streams: Beyond treasury gains, the company might explore new business ventures leveraging blockchain technology, aligning with the ‘Synergies’ in its name. Brand Modernization: The rebrand revitalizes the company’s image, making it appear more dynamic and forward-thinking to a younger, tech-savvy demographic. Access to New Capital: Engaging with the crypto community could open doors to new forms of fundraising or partnerships within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Potential Challenges: Market Volatility: The primary risk lies in the inherent price volatility of cryptocurrencies. A significant downturn in TAO token value could impact the company’s balance sheet and investor confidence. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the company’s operations or the value of its holdings. Public Perception: While many embrace crypto, skepticism remains. The company will need to effectively communicate its strategy to a diverse range of stakeholders, addressing concerns about risk and sustainability. Operational Integration: Successfully integrating blockchain technologies and managing digital assets requires specialized expertise and robust security protocols, which can be complex and costly. Conclusion: A Bold New Era for Corporate Finance The transformation of Synaptogenix into TAO Synergies , driven by its strategic TAO Token Investment and commitment to a comprehensive Blockchain Treasury Strategy , marks a watershed moment in the intersection of traditional corporate finance and the digital asset economy. This isn’t just a cosmetic change; it’s a profound declaration of intent by a Nasdaq-listed company to actively participate in and shape the future of finance and technology. As Crypto Corporate Adoption continues to accelerate, moves like this provide valuable case studies, highlighting both the immense potential and the inherent challenges. TAO Synergies is now poised to navigate this exciting, yet unpredictable, new frontier, potentially setting a precedent for how other established companies might integrate digital assets into their core identity and operations. The world will be watching to see how this bold strategy unfolds, potentially heralding a new era of corporate innovation.

This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a monumental step that signifies a significant evolution in how this prominent ecosystem will be governed and operated going forward. The decision, overwhelmingly supported by the community, marks the end of one chapter and the beginning of another, with a new entity named ApeCo poised to take the reins. For anyone following the cutting edge of decentralized finance and digital communities, this development is a must-watch. Understanding the Pivotal Community Vote : AIP-596 Explained The core of this transformative change lies in the approval of proposal AIP-596. This proposal sought to fundamentally restructure the governance and operational framework of the ApeCoin ecosystem by dissolving the existing DAO and establishing ApeCo as its successor. The results of the community vote were decisive, reflecting a clear mandate from the token holders: 99.66% voted in favor of the dissolution and transition. 0.32% voted against the proposal. 0.01% abstained from voting. These figures, derived from Snapshot data, not only demonstrate overwhelming support but also confirm that the proposal met crucial thresholds. It surpassed the 3.5% token participation quorum requirement and comfortably exceeded the 66% approval threshold needed for passage. Such a high degree of consensus on a decision of this magnitude is rare in the often-fractured world of decentralized governance and highlights a unified vision among ApeCoin holders for the project’s future. Why the Change? Exploring the DAO Dissolution The decision to pursue a DAO dissolution isn’t taken lightly. Decentralized autonomous organizations were initially hailed as the pinnacle of transparent, community-led governance. However, as the Web3 space matures, many DAOs have encountered practical challenges that can hinder efficiency and execution. These often include: Sluggish Decision-Making: The very nature of decentralized voting can lead to prolonged debates and slow progress on critical initiatives. Lack of Accountability: While distributed, the absence of clear leadership can sometimes make it difficult to assign responsibility for project failures or successes. Operational Inefficiencies: Managing day-to-day operations, legal compliance, and strategic partnerships can be complex and cumbersome within a purely decentralized structure. Resource Allocation Challenges: Distributing funds and managing budgets effectively across a broad, anonymous group can prove difficult. While the official proposal details the specific motivations for the ApeCoin DAO ‘s shift, it’s plausible that the move to ApeCo aims to address some of these common pain points, seeking to balance the ethos of decentralization with the need for agile, effective operations. This evolution is a testament to the dynamic nature of Web3, where experimentation and adaptation are key to long-term success. Introducing ApeCo : The New Horizon for ApeCoin With the DAO dissolution approved, all eyes now turn to ApeCo , the new entity tasked with steering the ApeCoin ecosystem forward. This transition represents a significant pivot, moving from a purely decentralized, community-driven operational model to one that appears to integrate more structured leadership while retaining community input. ApeCo will be led by Cameron Kates, who currently serves as the executive director of the Ape Foundation. He will be joined by other key members from both the Ape Foundation and the Banana Bill team, suggesting a blend of established leadership and experienced operational talent. The formation of ApeCo implies a more streamlined and perhaps more centralized approach to execution. While the exact operational specifics are still unfolding, the expectation is that ApeCo will provide: Clearer Leadership: A defined leadership structure can facilitate faster decision-making and clearer strategic direction. Improved Operational Efficiency: A dedicated team can focus solely on the growth and development of the ApeCoin ecosystem, including partnerships, product development, and community engagement. Enhanced Accountability: With a recognizable leadership team, there is a greater sense of responsibility and accountability for the project’s trajectory. This shift aims to empower the ApeCoin ecosystem to innovate and scale more effectively in a competitive Web3 landscape, ensuring that the project can respond swiftly to market changes and seize new opportunities. What Does This Mean for ApeCoin DAO Holders and Web3 Governance ? For existing ApeCoin DAO token holders, this transition signals a fundamental change in their role within the ecosystem. While the power of their community vote remains paramount for major decisions, the day-to-day operational control will shift to ApeCo. This raises important questions for the broader discussion around Web3 governance : Aspect Previous DAO Model New ApeCo Model (Anticipated) Operational Execution Primarily community-driven through proposals. Led by ApeCo team with clear roles. Decision-Making Speed Potentially slower due to voting cycles. Potentially faster due to dedicated leadership. Accountability Distributed among all token holders. Centralized within the ApeCo leadership. Community Role Directly involved in all proposals and operations. Primarily involved in strategic oversight and major decisions via voting. This shift highlights a growing trend in the Web3 space: the pragmatic evolution of governance models. While pure decentralization is an ideal, many projects are discovering that a hybrid model, combining centralized execution with decentralized oversight, might be more effective for achieving long-term goals and scaling operations. This makes the ApeCoin DAO’s move a critical case study for the future of Web3 governance . The Broader Implications for Web3 Governance and Decentralization The ApeCoin DAO ‘s decision is not an isolated incident; it’s part of a larger narrative unfolding in the world of Web3 governance . Many early DAOs have grappled with the complexities of truly decentralized operations, often finding themselves at a crossroads between ideological purity and practical efficacy. This move by a high-profile project like ApeCoin could set a precedent, encouraging other DAOs to reconsider their structures in pursuit of greater agility and impact. While some purists might view this as a step back from decentralization, proponents argue that it’s a necessary step towards maturity. The goal isn’t to abandon decentralization entirely, but rather to refine it, ensuring that core principles like transparency and community input are maintained, even if operational execution becomes more centralized. The success of ApeCo will be closely watched as a potential blueprint for other large-scale Web3 projects seeking to optimize their governance and operational models without sacrificing their fundamental ethos. The Path Forward: What’s Next for ApeCoin? With the DAO dissolution and the establishment of ApeCo, the ApeCoin ecosystem is poised for a new phase of development. The leadership team, comprising Cameron Kates and members from the Ape Foundation and Banana Bill, will likely focus on: Ecosystem Growth: Driving further adoption and utility for ApeCoin within the broader Web3 space, potentially through new partnerships and integrations. Product Development: Overseeing the creation and enhancement of tools, applications, and experiences that leverage ApeCoin. Community Engagement: While operations are streamlined, maintaining strong lines of communication and avenues for community feedback will be crucial to ensure the spirit of the ApeCoin DAO endures. Strategic Vision: Developing and executing a clear, long-term roadmap for the ApeCoin project, aligning with the aspirations of its token holders. This transition represents a dynamic period for ApeCoin. It’s an opportunity to learn from the challenges of pure decentralization and build a more robust, efficient, and impactful organization that can truly deliver on the promise of its ecosystem. Conclusion: A New Chapter for the ApeCoin DAO and Beyond The approval of AIP-596 marks a truly transformative moment for the ApeCoin DAO . The overwhelming community vote in favor of DAO dissolution and the transition to ApeCo signals a pragmatic evolution in Web3 governance . This shift aims to combine the agility of a more structured operational entity with the foundational principles of community ownership and decentralized oversight. As ApeCo takes the reins, the crypto world will be watching closely to see how this new model performs, potentially setting a new standard for how large, community-driven projects navigate the complexities of growth and governance in the ever-evolving Web3 landscape. It’s a bold step, reflecting a maturing ecosystem willing to adapt and innovate for long-term success.

On June 26, the company announced it will bring its stock on-chain through Opening Bell, a regulated on-chain equity issuance platform developed by fintech company Superstate. The move aims to offer 24/7 trading, real-time settlement, and expanded investor access via crypto-native wallets. “Tokenizing Upexi’s shares on Opening Bell reflects our strong conviction in Solana and our commitment to expanding shareholder access through transformative on-chain technology,” said CEO Allan Marshall. Launched in May 2025, Opening Bell unlocks decentralized finance features like automation, token-based governance, and staking by enabling compliant programmable equity. The announcement comes as Upexi deepens its Solana-based treasury strategy. The company disclosed that it now holds 735,692 Solana ( SOL ), an 8% increase from 679,677 SOL in May. At current prices, the holdings are worth about $105 million.

Shares dropped over 60% to below $4 on June 24 after a registration statement allowed resale of 43.85 million shares, the entire April float. While fears of insider selling surfaced, Marshall called the filing routine and clarified that no insider offloading had been confirmed. Analysts have backed Upexi’s strategic shift despite the volatility. Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage in June with an “overweight” rating and a $16 target, citing Solana’s growing network activity and appeal as a treasury asset over Ethereum ( ETH ). The company joins a growing cohort of firms adopting Solana-native strategies.

The company now holds over 600,000 SOL and runs validator infrastructure, with its liquid staking token dfdvSOL integrated across Solana’s DeFi ecosystem. Meanwhile, Sol Strategies Inc. holds 40,000 SOL and obtained a $500 million convertible note in May from ATW Partners to expand its treasury.

Either way, XRP’s legal status as not a security remains unchanged. In the meantime,… https://t.co/edHNbMzYbZ — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) June 26, 2025 He made it clear that no matter what they decide, XRP’s legal status remains unchanged, that it is not a security. Judge Expected Strong Arguments John Deaton says that Judge Torres pushed back in a way the SEC didn’t expect. He explains that the SEC cited the wrong rule and failed to show any exceptional circumstances to justify changing her earlier decision. Judge Torres said that “the parties haven’t come close” to doing that. According to Deaton, there is a high bar to meet, and the SEC didn’t clear it. After years of work on the case, the judge was not convinced by the SEC’s sudden request to reduce the fine by 60% and expected a much stronger argument. Deaton also expected more solid arguments from both sides and admits he underestimated the chances of the judge denying the motion, giving it only a 30% likelihood. He backed Judge Torres for following the law despite political changes. He said that protecting investors is important, especially in a crypto world full of scams like Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi, and FTX. Will Ripple SEC Withdraw Their Appeals? Attorney Fred Rispoli said Ripple and the SEC will likely drop their appeals and settle around $50 million, keeping Judge Torres’ ruling in place. He also added that the SEC may privately or publicly assure Ripple that it won’t face further restrictions, as long as it stays compliant. The court’s injunction will stay in place, but only matters if the SEC chooses to enforce it, which he sees as unlikely.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-27 03:56:30

""The crypto market is strongly sentiment-driven as fundamental valuations are challenging; therefore, technical analysis signals such as the double top warrant caution. That said, a full-blown crash needs a catalyst like the Terra collapse of 2022 or the FTX blowup. Barring a similar black swan, we could see a prolonged bull cycle, based on the current political and regulatory support and sticky institutional capital flowing in,"" Tischhauser told CoinDesk in an interview. Bitcoin has spent 50 days mainly trading back and forth between $110,000 and $100,000, signaling an exhaustion of the uptrend near the highs reached in January this year. That has prompted several observers, including veteran technical analyst Peter Brandt , to consider the possibility of the BTC trend flipping bearish with a double-top pattern. The double top comprises two consecutive peaks at approximately the same price – near $110K in BTC's case – with a trendline drawn through the low point between these peaks. The low point in BTC's case is the early April slide to $75,000. Analysts are concerned that a potential double top breakdown, involving a downturn from $110,000 and a drop below $75,000, could lead to a crash to around $27,000. Yes, you read that right. Such a crash would mean a 75% slide from the peaks. Technical patterns, such as the double top, often become self-fulfilling prophecies – once traders spot the pattern, their collective action reinforces the expected outcome. So, it's natural for prospects of double top above $100,000 to cause some caution and price drop. However, technicals alone seldom cause a price crash of 75%. For instance, BTC's crash from $70,000 to $16,000 over the 12 months to November 2022 happened as the Fed's rate hike cycle exposed asset classes like crypto where excess speculation had built up, setting the stage for the demise of the Terra blockchain and the FTX exchange. Both events caused massive wealth destruction. Flows-led bull run The latest rally, however, is driven mainly by institutional flows rather than the story or pretence that DeFi is better than traditional finance or Ethereum is the new world computer, as Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal noted last year. Since their debut on the Nasdaq in January 2024, the 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have registered net inflows of over $48 billion, per data tracked by Farside Investors . Meanwhile, BTC's adoption as a corporate Treasury asset has picked up the pace, adding to the bull momentum. As of the time of writing, 141 public companies held 841,693 BTC, according to bitcointreasuries.net . The flows-driven nature of the latest bull run makes it more resilient than the previous bull markets, according to Tischhauser. ""Institutions implement rigorous due diligence and risk assessment before they add a new asset class like bitcoin to the model portfolio. But when they do, the eventual allocation is for the long term. This trend of sticky institutional allocation is just beginning, and the resulting demand will continue to provide price support for some time to come,"" Tischhauser told CoinDesk. Tischhauser explained that these investment vehicles are sucking out liquidity, skewing the demand-supply dynamics in favour of a continued uptrend. ""These investment vehicles are sucking liquidity out of the market, which means, every time a new big-ticket investor hits the market with bids, this is addressing less and less supply, and the bullish impact on prices becomes more pronounced,"" Tischhauser noted. The halving cycle may be dead The bearish double-top crash scenario appears plausible to many observers, as we are in the post-halving year, which has historically marked bull market tops, paving the way for year-long bear markets. Halving is a programmed code in Bitcoin's blockchain that reduces the pace of BTC supply expansion by 50% every four years. The last halving occurred in April 2024 and reduced the per-block BTC reward to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC. However, the halving cycle may not unfold as expected, as sticky institutional adoption has a greater bearing on price than miners. Moreover, BTC sold by miners, who regulatory offload coins earned to fund operational costs, now accounts for a tiny percentage of the average daily trading volume. ""The change in market leadership means the four-year halving cycle may not play out religiously as it did before. Earlier, most BTC holders were miners, and the BTC issued per year was a huge percentage of the outstanding bitcoin supply. So, selling pressure from miners mattered greatly to the market price. Now, the BTC mined is 0.05-0.1% of the average BTC daily trading volume and halving this supply has no impact on the supply/demand balance in the market. So the halving cycle may be dead,"" Tischhauser said.",Markets|Bitcoin|Sygnum Bank|Markets|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-27 03:57:54

This new peak surpasses the company’s previous closing record of $357.39 from November 2021. The crypto exchange also led the S&P 500 earlier in the week, posting a 12.10% increase in a single day. Coinbase’s inclusion in the S&P 500 on May 19 and increased regulatory clarity surrounding stablecoins have helped fuel investor enthusiasm. The GENIUS Act, advanced in the U.S. House, has been particularly impactful given Coinbase’s co-creation of the USDC stablecoin with Circle. Market Reactions and Predictions Vary Despite the bullish momentum, opinions on whether Coinbase’s rally can continue remain divided. Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision, commented, “Going vertical now…the liquidity spigot is wide, wide open.” On the other hand, adviser Andy Heilman suggested that while the setup remains bullish, a pullback is likely in the near term. He mentioned the potential for four-digit prices but cautioned against overconfidence. Crypto analyst Cantonese Cat cited technical indicators showing expanding Bollinger Bands, implying further upside. In contrast, another analyst, Chad, warned that the price may be “ripe for a cooldown” as it sits above the upper Bollinger Band. Some long-time investors celebrated the milestone as a breakeven moment, noting that shares have returned to their 2021 launch price.

While both projects continue to show strength, especially in terms of ecosystem traction and institutional growth, they’re reaching a point where further upside may be slower and steadier. That’s why momentum is quietly shifting toward early-stage altcoins — and MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as the prime candidate for the next big move . MAGACOINFINANCE: Where Early Capital Is Converging Early-stage tokens don’t usually check every box — but MAGACOINFINANCE is rewriting that rule. With its total supply permanently locked at 170 billion, the inflation ceiling is clear. The token is fully audited by HashEx, offering critical transparency. And most recently, staking has launched, showing strong initial participation and lock-up behavior — a key indicator of long-term conviction. Here’s what’s driving momentum: Fixed token supply — no hidden inflation Active staking — rewards reinforcing early entry No VC control — 100% community-based Audited and transparent smart contract With growing on-chain activity and increased chatter among Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP whales, MAGACOINFINANCE is positioning itself as a high-conviction trade for 2025 . Cardano (ADA) Faces Near-Term Resistance Cardano has seen notable pullbacks recently and is currently trading in a tight range around $0.63–$0.64. Price forecasts remain mixed, with weak retail interest and divided governance decisions weighing on short-term momentum. However, the Chang hard fork and Hydra scaling efforts offer some hope if delivered successfully. Still, while ADA consolidates, opportunistic investors are moving capital toward early movers like MAGACOINFINANCE in search of more aggressive upside. Ethereum (ETH) Shows Institutional Growth Despite Price Pressure Ethereum continues to draw institutional attention, especially after Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming’s $463M ETH acquisition. The network’s technical foundation remains solid, bolstered by the Pectra upgrade and ETF tailwinds. Despite trading in a volatile range near $2,500–$2,600, many traders see ETH as a long-term core hold. But that same long-term profile is prompting some to hedge ETH positions with speculative bets like MAGACOINFINANCE, hoping to capture larger short-term returns. Optimism (OP) Cools Off as Rotation Picks Up Optimism has seen slowing momentum as traders rotate into other Layer-2 projects. Despite continued development, OP has yet to reclaim bullish levels, with many investors waiting for a broader narrative shift. This has opened the door for capital to move into altcoins with faster catalysts, and MAGACOINFINANCE’s recent milestones — including staking and token cap confirmation — are sparking fresh allocations. VeChain (VET) Holds Ground, But Interest Is Fading VeChain continues to focus on enterprise adoption and sustainability solutions but hasn’t made major headlines in recent weeks. The lack of catalysts has led to stagnant price action, and as altcoin traders chase more dynamic opportunities, many are pivoting toward newer entrants that combine hype with structural soundness — like MAGACOINFINANCE. Final Thoughts The market rotation from large caps like Ethereum, Cardano, Optimism, and VeChain to more agile projects is real — and MAGACOINFINANCE is benefiting directly. As Solana and XRP traders hunt for the next asymmetric opportunity, this altcoin is quickly rising to the top of their watchlists.

Over $4 Million Liquidity Exit Sparks Crash Fears,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/trump-token-in-trouble-4-4-million-liquidity-exit-sparks-crash-fears/,"US President Donald Trump’s namesake meme token has tumbled hard, slumping nearly 90% from its all-time high set six months ago. Related Reading: Double Win: Dogwifhat Jumps 24% Alongside Bitcoin’s $107K Push Today, TRUMP is trading at $8.80, down 6% in the last seven days. Traders are on edge after the project’s team yanked $4.4 million in USDC from liquidity pools and a single whale lined up a $2.5 million sell order. Team Pulls Millions From Liquidity According to a recent post on X by Lookonchain, the Trump Coin team withdrew $4.4 million worth of USDC and moved 347,438 TRUMP tokens—valued at $3.12 million—from the main liquidity pool into a fresh wallet. The #Trump Meme Team removed 4.4M $USDC and 347,438 $TRUMP($3.12M) in liquidity 6 hours ago. They then bridged 4.4M $USDC to #Ethereum and transferred 347,438 $TRUMP($3.12M) to a new wallet.https://t.co/ORSLE6vJiAhttps://t.co/SYyNae1nio pic.twitter.com/okTk1u0Ow9 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 26, 2025 That move came without any heads-up or clear reason. Now, many investors worry that the team might be preparing to dump coins, which would add selling pressure to a coin already struggling with low demand. Whale Places Huge Sell Order Based on reports, a major wallet known as Kewh32 has put 275,672 TRUMP tokens on the market, roughly $2.5 million at current prices. This whale also sold 100,000 tokens earlier in June and still holds 369,400 coins. If those tokens ever hit exchanges, the added supply could push the price even lower. Price Pattern Offers Mixed Signal On the daily chart, TRUMP has traced out a falling wedge pattern. That setup often leads to a breakout, but only when buyers step in with strength. Here, trading volumes remain weak. The relative strength index (RSI) has sat below 50 for over a month, signaling that sellers are still in control. At the same time, the Awesome Oscillator just flipped green—albeit still below zero—which hints that bearish momentum may be fading.

A failure to hold above $8 could spell more losses and test deeper support. Right now, there’s no sign of a strong rally. Without fresh buying interest or positive news, the downtrend inside the wedge looks set to continue. It won’t take much to spark a short squeeze—maybe a burst of social media hype or a big buy from another whale. But trust in the token’s team is shaky after the recent liquidity pull. Until on-chain activity shows real demand, most market players expect more choppy trading and lower prices.

It creates a national set of rules for stablecoins, which are digital currencies tied to real-world assets like the U.S. dollar. This would make it easier and safer for companies to issue stablecoins in the U.S., while also encouraging more homegrown innovation and cutting down on the country’s dependence on foreign financial tech.

It aims to finally define what different types of crypto assets are, something the industry has lacked for years.

If passed, the bill could unlock trillions of dollars in potential investment, giving the crypto space a massive boost. A Turning Point for U.S. Crypto Leadership Together, these two bills represent a turning point. Industry leaders are calling this a “defining moment” that could make the U.S. a global leader in blockchain and digital finance. If July sees both laws move forward, it could mark the beginning of a new, more regulated, but more confident era for American crypto.

The crypto space is also awaiting the July 8–9 tariff deadline, but as per recent talks, there are hints that Trump could delay it. So far, talks with China and the UK have begun, but no deals have been finalized. If progress is slow, Trump may step in to set his fair tariffs.

This marks a 0.4% decrease in the past 24 hours, and a 4.3% drop below its all-time high of $111,000, set in May. Despite the rebound, analysts are closely watching for potential shifts in momentum as a number of market indicators and macroeconomic signals suggest a more cautious short-term outlook. Among the recent developments drawing attention is a sharp rise in Net Taker Volume on Binance, along with significant stablecoin outflows from derivative platforms. CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha noted in a recent market commentary that these changes could indicate increased speculative activity. While some traders interpret such surges as bullish signals, they often occur due to short liquidations or sudden retail buying rather than consistent organic demand. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Floor Rises Toward $100,000, Reinforcing Bullish Sentiment Derivatives Activity and Fed Commentary Fuel Market Caution On June 24, Binance’s Net Taker Volume crossed $100 million for the first time since early June. This level of activity, according to Taha, can sometimes signal buying momentum but may also point to forced closures of short positions, especially in high-leverage environments. Taha emphasized that without strong capital inflows to back the movement, these bursts tend to be short-lived. Simultaneously, more than $1.25 billion in stablecoin liquidity has exited derivative exchanges, marking the largest capital outflow from these platforms since May. These outflows reduce the base for opening new leveraged positions, potentially dampening future market momentum. Taha also pointed to external economic cues, particularly a recent statement by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. During his testimony before Congress, Powell signaled that rate cuts may be on the table depending on upcoming economic conditions. While looser monetary policy is often viewed as favorable for risk assets like Bitcoin, the shift also reflects underlying uncertainty. The analyst also mentioned that the Swiss Franc, traditionally seen as a safe-haven currency, has also surged against the US dollar, suggesting that some investors are leaning risk-off amid broader macroeconomic developments. Market Structure Remains Firm, But Momentum Is Slowing Separately, another CryptoQuant analyst known as Crypto Dan offered a different perspective using a bubble chart model that visualizes trading volume trends across exchanges. According to Dan, Bitcoin is currently experiencing a “cooling” phase. This implies reduced trading activity without dramatic spikes in volume, often seen as a sign that the market is consolidating rather than overheating.

According to blockchain analytics firm Sentiment, Solana’s developer ecosystem has witnessed a rise in activity, registering an increase in GitHub commits, pull requests, and issue discussions over the past month. This rebound shows the introduction of new developments, establishing Solana’s place as Ethereum’s competitor. Solana uses the work done by protocol teams to increase performance, security, scalability, and user experience, pushing the limit of blockchain capabilities. In addition, the ecosystem has also seen an increase in interoperability and DeFi solutions. Wormhole, a cross-chain bridge, and Pyth Network, a decentralized oracle platform, have been the primary contributors to this move, driving Solana’s growth in the crypto industry. 4 Top Projects Powering Solana Ecosystem Drift – Improving on-chain derivatives trading. Neon Labs – Ensuring easy integration of Ethereum dApps on Solana. Helium – Improving decentralized internet infrastructure. Metaplex – Expanding NFT and Web3 capabilities. Popular crypto figures, such as Lark Davis, have also discussed the importance of this successful ecosystem, highlighting Solana’s dominance in the blockchain industry. Decentralized exchanges like Serum have also increased Solana’s attractiveness, offering easy and cheap trading. Solana Challenges Ethereum & Rivals Solana’s increased developer activity has improved mainstream adoption and sustained its growth, challenging the dominance of Ethereum. The rise in developer activity not only presents viability, it also positions Solana alongside other layer 1 platforms like Cosmos and Optimism, which are also competing for developer attention and user adoption. Research also shows that although some Solana smart contracts have minor security risks, platforms like Anchor are trying to remove such risks, showcasing Solana’s developer-friendly and secure environment. Sudden Shift – Newest Phenomenon Emerges Amidst the excitement around Solana, a new crypto project has surfaced: Neo Pepe Coin. Taking over the market with its blend of meme culture and governance mechanism, Neo Pepe presale has been seeing attention. Not Your Average Crypto The token is currently priced at $0.08, with Neo Pepe Coin approaching its fourth presale stage, where the token is expected to increase in price. This change has sparked community discussions, cementing Neo Pepe as the best crypto presale in the crypto market. Unlike other meme coins, Neo Pepe uses a DAO governance, tokenomics, and an auto-liquidity system that helps the token through LP token burns. These features have positioned Neo Pepe as a better meme coin and a contender for the top Pepe coin title. Crypto influencer BITGIRL CRYPTO recently discussed the qualities of Neo Pepe, saying they are the real reason why the project has been gaining attention in the market. Platforms like AInvest, Finbold, and Crypto.news have also recognized Neo Pepe as a frontrunner in the 2025 meme coin space. Influencers Fuel Neo Pepe Coin Chatter Crypto influencer CryptoBitlord is one of the supporters of Neo Pepe. He has discussed several aspects of the project including its presale approach, community, and governance, advising his followers saying, “You might want to get a little Neo Pepe.” Neo Pepe’s roadmap includes listings on several exchanges, with Binance and Uniswap being planned. The move is expected to expand its reach and credibility among global crypto investors. Why Neo Pepe Presale Demands Attention Now Neo Pepe’s presale model has been designed across 16 stages, with each seeing the value of the token increase. With the fourth stage on its way, investors are taking advantage of the lower price to increase their investments. Neo Pepe continues to attract meme traders and crypto investors, earning the title of the best Pepe coin in the crypto industry. BITGIRL CRYPTO Delivers Insightful Take on Neo Pepe’s Rising Appeal In a recent analysis, crypto commentator BITGIRL CRYPTO discussed Neo Pepe Coin, highlighting the project’s presale, liquidity generation, and community-focused governance model.

The asset dropped nearly 6% over 24 hours but found significant buying interest at $0.158, establishing a short-term support zone as markets digested geopolitical headlines and economic uncertainty. News Background Global markets remain on edge as tensions between major economies and shifting monetary policy outlooks drive volatility. While ceasefire agreements in the Middle East have slightly eased investor anxiety, crypto assets — particularly memecoins — remain highly sensitive to sentiment swings. DOGE’s sharp pullback follows a broader risk-off tone in digital assets, but late-session accumulation suggests some traders view the dip as a buying opportunity. DOGE’s partial rebound coincides with renewed social buzz and short-term technical setups that have historically preceded price bounces. Analysts remain divided on the strength of this recovery, but volume-backed support at $0.158 is now in focus heading into the next session. Price Action DOGE traded in a wide 24-hour range between $0.167 and $0.158, representing a 5.7% decline before stabilizing late in the session. Heavy selling persisted until 13:00 UTC, when the price began to consolidate. Buyers stepped in with 229M DOGE traded during the 01:00 hour, helping DOGE recover to $0.161 by session close. In the final hour, the asset gained 1.47%, rising from $0.159 to $0.161 on a clear uptrend with higher highs and higher lows. Volume surged to 4.7M during the breakout above $0.161, and brief consolidation established support at that level heading into the new day. Technical Analysis Recap • DOGE dropped from $0.167 to $0.158 over 24 hours, a 5.7% decline • Downtrend persisted until 13:00, followed by consolidation and modest recovery • Heavy sell volume of 425M DOGE recorded during 13:00 hour • Strong buying interest emerged at $0.158 with 229M DOGE traded at support • DOGE closed at $0.161 after 1.47% late-session gain • Breakout above $0.161 confirmed with 4.7M DOGE in volume during 01:39–01:42 • Support established at $0.161 following brief consolidation from 01:52–01:59",Markets|AI Market Insights|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-27 05:08:41

A key catalyst behind investor calm was the arrest of British national Kai West, known online as “ IntelBroker ,” who allegedly ran BreachForums and facilitated the sale of stolen corporate data. The FBI stated that West caused damages exceeding $25 million by leaking data from over 40 companies in exchange for Bitcoin and Monero. He was arrested in France and now awaits extradition to the U.S. Interesting report on how ""IntelBroker"" got caught. According to the report, Kai West primarily used Monero, however, the use of Monero $XMR was not part of how he got caught. In fact, Monero’s strong privacy features gave challenges to authorities. So, in January 2023, an FBI… pic.twitter.com/7Xs84lFEu9 — MetaRyuk (@metaryuk) June 26, 2025 One undercover agent reportedly paid $250 in Bitcoin for access to confidential files. West’s cyber group allegedly sold data valued at $2.5 million. By 2024, IntelBroker had built a reputation as a major darknet figurehead. Despite the scandal, Bitcoin price action barely flinched, a sign that traders are increasingly confident in regulators’ ability to track blockchain activity. BTC held steady at $107,600 $42.6B in 24h volume reflects strong activity Market cap remains at $2.14 trillion The event highlights crypto’s dual nature, which is both used in crime and also traceable. Law enforcement’s growing technical capability to monitor crypto transfers is reinforcing market trust. India Proposes Bitcoin Reserve to Boost Economy In addition, there’s another bullish report came from India, where Pradeep Bhandari, a national spokesperson for the ruling BJP party, advocated for a Bitcoin reserve pilot. Writing for India Today , Bhandari highlighted how nations like Bhutan and the U.S. are already exploring sovereign crypto strategies, suggesting India could benefit from joining that list. BREAKING: Indian Ruling party #BJP National Spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari calls for India to explore #Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Citing U.S. and Bhutan’s growing adoption. Says a #Bitcoin reserve pilot could boost India’s economic resilience. pic.twitter.com/oVXnRowB37 — The Crypto Times (@CryptoTimes_io) June 26, 2025 Bhandari emphasized India’s growing renewable energy sector as a competitive advantage for Bitcoin mining and accumulation. He argued that regulatory clarity, still lacking in India’s tax-heavy environment, could unlock innovation, attract capital, and position India as a leader in financial technology. India currently taxes crypto gains at 30% under Section 115BBH of the Income Tax Act, without a formal regulatory infrastructure. Despite this, domestic interest in crypto remains strong. Bitcoin hovered at $107,100 after Bhandari’s remarks, signaling steady institutional confidence. Bitcoin Technicals Signal Potential Reversal Technically, Bitcoin faces stiff resistance at $108,250, the top of a descending trendline visible on the 2-hour chart. After bouncing sharply from $99,717, the asset broke above major Fibonacci levels—0.618 at $102,977 and 0.5 at $103,984—before stalling in a narrowing range. Price action suggests a rising wedge pattern, which often precedes a breakdown. Bitcoin price chart – Soruce: Tradingview The 50-EMA at $106,147 and the 23.6% Fib level at $106,237 offer critical support. Meanwhile, MACD is flashing bearish divergence, with momentum fading as histogram bars shrink. Recent candlesticks resemble spinning tops and doji formations—signals of indecision. Bearish trigger: Break below $106,200 Downside targets: $104,991 and $103,984 Upside invalidation: Daily close above $108,250 If bulls fail to clear $108,250 with conviction, we could see a pullback toward $104K. On the flip side, a clean break could set up a run toward $109,257 and $110,448. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.4M Hard Cap as Presale Enters Final Hours With Bitcoin trading near $105,000, investor focus is shifting toward BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , a rising altcoin that is nearly fully allocated during its presale. As of today, the project has raised $7,438,492.88 of its $8,397,441 target, leaving under $1 million to be raised before the token price moves to the next tier. Currently priced at $0.00258, early buyers have a limited time to enter before the subsequent price increase takes effect.

The contract represents a middle ground between transparent stablecoins like USDC and censorship-resistant “dark stablecoins.” With backing from major institutions like Deutsche Bank and State Street, Taurus hopes to fill a crucial privacy gap in stablecoin infrastructure. Meanwhile, regulatory developments surrounding stablecoins are also unfolding globally. In Europe, the European Commission rejected earlier ECB concerns, favoring a more flexible stance under MiCA. In the US, Trump-linked World Liberty Financial is preparing to release its first stablecoin audit while teasing an upgrade to its WLFI token. Taurus Rolls Out Privacy Contract for Stablecoins Taurus, a digital asset infrastructure provider, launched a private stablecoin contract built on the Aztec Network, which is designed to offer users enhanced privacy through zero-knowledge proofs while still maintaining compliance with regulatory standards. The goal of the contract is to make stablecoin usage more practical for sensitive applications like payrolls and intracompany transfers, where financial privacy is critical. Taurus previously partnered with major institutions like Deutsche Bank and State Street, and believes this innovation bridges a long-standing gap in stablecoin functionality by preserving privacy without compromising regulatory oversight. According to Taurus’ chief security officer, JP Aumasson , the solution allows for untraceable transactions that still permit access for authorized entities like issuers and regulators. This dual approach could resolve one of the key limitations of current stablecoin usage—the visibility and permanence of transactions on public blockchains. Aztec Network executive Arnaud Schenk explained that their layer-2 zero-knowledge system supports both user privacy and issuer-defined controls directly at the token level. The new offering comes at a time when concerns over increasing government oversight led to speculation that demand may grow for so-called “dark stablecoins”—privacy-enhanced, censorship-resistant alternatives. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said that international users could shift toward these untraceable solutions in response to stricter regulations. However, Taurus’ contract may serve as a middle ground by delivering similar privacy protections without the legal uncertainties that accompany unregulated dark stablecoins. Overall, the stablecoin market is attracting more attention from both traditional financial players and regulators. While USDT and USDC still dominate the market, more than 30 other stablecoin issuers have at least $100 million in circulation, according to RedStone’s recent report . The landscape is poised for even more growth as the GENIUS Act moves closer to becoming law in the United States. Meanwhile, Europe recently signaled a more accommodating approach under its MiCA framework, which suggests that stablecoin innovation could continue to grow across multiple jurisdictions. EU Rejects ECB Warnings on Stablecoin Risks The European Commission took a turn away from the strict warnings that were issued earlier this year by the European Central Bank (ECB). In response to ECB concerns about the risks of joint stablecoin issuance across EU and non-EU jurisdictions, the Commission said such scenarios are “highly unlikely.” According to a spokesperson , even if a bank run occurred, most redemptions would take place outside of the EU, particularly in the US, where the majority of stablecoins circulate and reserves are held. This more flexible approach has been welcomed by the crypto industry, with some calling it a big win for cross-border stablecoin operations. The ECB warned in April that allowing joint issuance between EU and foreign entities could undermine the bloc’s financial safeguards, destabilize consumer protections, and open the door for regulatory arbitrage by foreign firms. It also raised the issue of non-EU issuers potentially misrepresenting themselves as compliant with the EU’s MiCA regulation without actually meeting its requirements. An example of EU and third-country stablecoin mult-issuance Despite these concerns, the Commission's June study on the topic concluded that the risks are very manageable under existing rules. It found that MiCA already creates strong institutional and regulatory barriers that limit the presence of foreign stablecoins in the eurozone. For instance, the Commission pointed out Tether’s refusal to comply with MiCA’s rule requiring 60% of reserves to be held in European banks, which discouraged the issuer of USDT from registering in Europe. The Commission also proposed that foreign stablecoin issuers could be subject to rebalancing mechanisms to align the volume of EU-based reserves with the proportion of tokens circulating in the EU. People see this as a much more realistic and flexible framework that enables global operations without fragmenting the stablecoin market. Juan Ignacio Ibañez , general secretary of the MiCA Crypto Alliance, said this stance eliminates the need for issuers like Circle to split their operations into separate entities for the US and Europe, which preserves the fungibility and cross-border usability that are core to blockchain-based currencies. Calling it “very positive news and even a relief,” Ibañez believes that jurisdictional silos would weaken stablecoin utility and harm the user experience. World Liberty Financial Readies Stablecoin Audit Meanwhile, World Liberty Financial, the crypto venture associated with US President Donald Trump, is preparing to release an audit of its stablecoin and hinted at a potential upgrade to its WLFI governance token. Co-founder Zak Folkman announced at the Permissionless conference in Brooklyn that the project's first attestation report from an independent accounting firm will be published on its website soon. He also teased a big development regarding the WLFI token, which currently grants voting rights but is still nontransferable. Folkman suggested that changes to WLFI are imminent, and encouraged the community to stay tuned over the next few weeks for updates. This was later confirmed in a post on X by World Liberty Financial, where the team acknowledged community demand for making WLFI transferable and stated that the necessary work is underway, promising “big news coming soon.” While some in the crypto community welcomed the news with enthusiasm, others responded with skepticism by questioning the motives behind the move and suggesting that insiders might be preparing to offload their holdings. Reply to WLFI’s X post The platform is also working on launching a new app that is aimed at improving accessibility for retail users. This is a strategic move that could expand its user base during the upcoming election cycle. Trump’s ties to the project have been financially lucrative. According to a 2025 financial disclosure filed with the Office of Government Ethics, Trump earned $57.4 million from World Liberty Financial and holds more than 15 billion WLFI tokens, which grant him voting rights. The earnings stem from token sales. Since its inception in September of 2024, World Liberty Financial has raised $500+ million through two public token offerings. The platform offers decentralized finance services and a dollar-pegged stablecoin.

The company attracted attention earlier this year when it acquired prime broker Hidden Road for $1.25 billion, but Ripple’s plans don’t stop there. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz stated that the company is evaluating multiple acquisitions. “Our acquisition and merger team is working very hard. We have many potential acquisition processes at different stages,” said Schwartz, adding that the activity in this area is due to Wall Street still not fully realizing these opportunities. Schwartz said that the slow pace of traditional financial giants in strategic acquisitions presents an opportunity for crypto companies. “We don’t have to compete with big banks to acquire strategically valuable companies like Hidden Road,” he said. Ripple has previously acquired crypto custody firms such as Metaco and Standard Custody, and the company also plans to use its new stablecoin, RLUSD, as collateral for Hidden Road’s brokerage services. Related News: Another Surprising Decision from Judge Torres in the Ripple-SEC Case: XRP Legal Director Makes a Statement - “The Ball is Now in Our Court” Ripple is preparing to develop not only acquisitions but also the XRP Ledger (XRPL) infrastructure. XRPL, which is aimed to gain an Ethereum-like “programmability,” may soon be equipped with payment management systems that work similarly to smart contracts. Schwartz said that while full programmability would not be possible in the near term, the goal is to “preserve security while providing flexibility.” For example, he said contracts could be put in place that allow a user to receive payment in their preferred digital asset instead of XRP. In addition, Ripple is developing a lending protocol on the XRP Ledger. This system is planned to be launched if approved in the third quarter of 2025. Schwartz stated that this structure will bring together traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), and said, “While the selection of borrowers and legal transactions are carried out off-chain, the tokenization and distribution of repayment rights will be done on-chain.” Ripple made headlines in the industry in June with many announcements, including tokenized treasury bonds, a decentralized exchange (DEX) for institutional investors, and a partnership with Wormhole, which enables asset transfer between blockchains. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin Miners Defy Market Logic, Hoard BTC Despite Declining Revenue and Record Prices Bitcoin miners have significantly increased their BTC holdings despite a challenging profitability environment and Bitcoin trading near its all-time highs. According to new data published by on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, miners have collectively added 4,000 BTC to their reserves since April 2025 — bringing their total holdings between 100 and 1,000 BTC to approximately 65,000 BTC, the highest level since November 2024. This accumulation has occurred against the backdrop of mounting operational strain. Daily revenues for miners have plunged to a two-month low of $34 million as of June 22, largely due to falling transaction fees and a slight dip in BTC’s price following a recent all-time high. Despite these pressures, miner selling activity has dropped dramatically. Outflows from miner wallets, which peaked at 23,000 BTC per day in February 2025, are now down to just 6,000 BTC — a trend that suggests miners are prioritizing long-term value over short-term cash flow. Bitcoin Miner Total Outflows (Source: CryptoQuant) Miners Endure “Extreme Underpayment” Conditions CryptoQuant’s latest Weekly Report describes Bitcoin miners as being “extremely underpaid,” noting that the current income environment is the harshest it’s been over the past year. This downturn in miner revenue comes just months after April’s halving event, which reduced the block subsidy from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC — effectively halving the amount of new Bitcoin earned per mined block. Bitcoin Miner Profit/Loss Sustainability (Source: CryptoQuant) Hashrate — the measure of computational power on the Bitcoin network — has dropped by 3.5% in the last 10 days, marking the largest drawdown since July 2024. This has likely put added pressure on marginal mining operations, particularly those in regions with high energy costs or aging equipment. Still, many miners appear to be weathering the storm. CryptoQuant attributes this resilience to an average operating margin of 48%, which allows larger, more efficient mining firms to continue stockpiling BTC rather than liquidating it to cover expenses. Perhaps the most notable trend is the near-complete cessation of sales from so-called “Satoshi-era” miners — individuals or entities who mined Bitcoin in its earliest days, likely between 2009 and 2011. These early adopters are often regarded as market-moving whales due to their large BTC holdings and historical tendency to sell into strength during major bull markets. Bitcoin Satoshi-era Miner netflows (Source: CryptoQuant) However, 2025 appears to mark a change in strategy. According to CryptoQuant, Satoshi-era miners have sold just 150 BTC this year, compared to nearly 10,000 BTC in 2024. That’s a staggering 98.5% decrease in sales volume, even as BTC/USD continues to flirt with new record highs. Historically, movement of coins from these dormant addresses has signaled market tops and sparked panic among retail investors. The lack of activity from these wallets suggests either a newfound patience — or a deeper conviction that Bitcoin’s bull run is far from over. Capitulation or Conviction? This collective refusal to sell, even in the face of dwindling revenue, may be a bullish signal for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Earlier in June, the widely-followed “Hash Ribbons” indicator — which monitors miner capitulation phases — flashed a classic “buy” signal. The metric has proven historically reliable in identifying price bottoms, as miner capitulation tends to precede recoveries when weaker operators exit and long-term holders double down. With BTC currently trading just a few percentage points below its all-time high, miners’ behavior could suggest that they believe the market still has considerable upside. Their unwillingness to sell at or near the top may be signaling a longer-term price horizon beyond even the most optimistic projections currently circulating in the crypto space. The implications of miners turning into net accumulators are significant. As one of the few consistent sources of sell pressure in the Bitcoin ecosystem, a decline in miner sales reduces the overall supply of BTC available on the open market. Coupled with continued institutional inflows and increasing adoption of spot Bitcoin ETFs, this creates a supply-demand imbalance that could act as a catalyst for further price appreciation. Moreover, the alignment between miner activity and long-term holding behavior reinforces a broader narrative of Bitcoin’s maturation. Gone are the days when miners rushed to dump their holdings after each halving cycle. Instead, the trend is shifting toward strategic reserve management and capital discipline — a sign of the industry’s growing sophistication. India’s Ruling Party Spokesperson Urges Bitcoin Reserve Pilot to Boost Economic Resilience Meanwhile, in a move that could significantly reshape India’s digital asset landscape, Pradeep Bhandari, the national spokesperson for India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has publicly advocated for a pilot program to establish a sovereign Bitcoin reserve. The proposal, outlined in an op-ed for India Today , positions the initiative as a pragmatic step toward strengthening national economic resilience and embracing the growing legitimacy of digital assets on the global stage. Bhandari cited the United States' strategic moves to accumulate Bitcoin and Bhutan’s government-led crypto mining initiatives as indicators that traditional finance is undergoing a crypto transformation. “This isn’t a reckless pivot,” he emphasized in the article. “It’s a calculated step toward embracing digital assets’ legitimacy.” The Global Context: Bitcoin Becomes a Strategic Asset Bhandari’s call for a Bitcoin reserve pilot is not made in isolation. The United States has recently outlined plans for budget-neutral Bitcoin acquisitions to bolster its strategic reserves. At least three US states have authorized Bitcoin as an official reserve asset. Meanwhile, Bhutan has deployed its renewable energy surplus to power state-backed Bitcoin mining operations. These developments reflect a broader shift in how nations view crypto—not merely as speculative assets but as strategic instruments with geopolitical and macroeconomic utility. According to Bhandari, India is uniquely positioned to lead this global shift, citing the country’s rapidly growing renewable energy sector. With vast potential in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, India could develop a sustainable, state-managed Bitcoin reserve without compromising its environmental goals. He stressed that such a pilot would not only align with India’s ambitions to be a global digital leader but also stimulate innovation and attract institutional interest. A government-supported Bitcoin reserve could provide confidence to both domestic and international investors, positioning India as a pioneer in the responsible adoption of crypto infrastructure. Taxed but Unregulated: India’s Crypto Conundrum Currently, India’s regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies remains ambiguous. While digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are taxed under a flat 30% capital gains regime, there is no formal regulatory framework guiding their use, trading, or custody. Under Section 115BBH of the Income Tax Act, profits from selling virtual digital assets (VDAs) are taxed at 30%. While acquisition costs can be subtracted from gains, no deductions are allowed for losses or other expenses. Moreover, a 1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) is applied to all crypto transactions exceeding ₹10,000 (approximately $115), further dampening liquidity and market participation. This duality—taxation without regulation—has stifled innovation and deterred retail and institutional involvement alike. Bhandari referenced India’s leadership during its 2023 G20 presidency, where it spearheaded a crypto policy working group in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, he warned that the international community is moving faster than India. While recommendations will take their due course, Bhandari said, jurisdictions like Russia, China, Brazil, and other G20 nations led by the US are not pausing their crypto efforts to wait for a consensus. He argued that India risks falling behind if it fails to act with urgency. A sovereign Bitcoin reserve pilot could serve as both a policy accelerator and a signaling mechanism to global markets. A Strategic and Transparent Path Forward According to Bhandari, the first step toward embracing this opportunity is the launch of a Bitcoin reserve pilot program, accompanied by well-defined regulatory policies. He emphasized that such a framework should be transparent, investor-friendly, and designed to foster innovation while upholding consumer protections. He believes the initiative could act as a testing ground for broader digital asset strategies, from public-private partnerships in crypto infrastructure to government-backed mining operations powered by renewables.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-27 05:30:00

The asset dipped from $2.21 to a session low of $2.08 before a modest recovery to $2.10. While the broader crypto market attempted to stabilize following ceasefire agreements in the Middle East, XRP’s momentum remained fragile, with technical resistance building at $2.17. News Background Market sentiment improved slightly after former U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly helped broker a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, calming some investor fears. Despite that, XRP struggled to hold recent gains as traders reacted to large on-chain movements. Ripple transferred $439 million worth of XRP to an unknown wallet, and other whale wallets moved another $58 million to centralized exchanges — raising questions about potential distribution or internal reshuffling. Although these events drew attention, the token’s inability to reclaim $2.14 resistance signals underlying bearish momentum. Technical analysts continue to monitor XRP’s descending channel pattern, with expectations for a breakout or breakdown between July and September. For now, the $2.08-$2.09 zone remains a critical level to hold. Price Action XRP dropped from $2.21 to $2.10 over the 24-hour period, marking a 5.3% decline within a $0.13 range. The steepest selloff occurred between 12:00 and 16:00 UTC on June 26, with back-to-back hourly volume surges above 99 million XRP as price fell to $2.10. Resistance formed clearly at $2.17, with multiple rejection wicks above $2.12 later in the session. By midnight UTC, XRP had revisited its session low of $2.08. A modest bounce followed in the final hour of the session, as price climbed from $2.09 to $2.10, with short-lived momentum topping at $2.105. A drop in volume late in the session suggests buyer fatigue, though the $2.08 support zone held firm. Technical Analysis Recap • XRP declined 5.3% from $2.21 to $2.10, with a total intraday range of $0.13 • Heaviest selling occurred from 12:00–16:00 UTC on volume over 114M and 99M XRP • Strong resistance formed at $2.17; key support tested at $2.08–$2.09 • Recovery attempts failed at $2.14 and $2.12 before settling around $2.10 • Final hour showed modest 0.54% gain from $2.09 to $2.10, with volume spiking to 930K XRP during 01:42–01:45 • Consolidation near $2.10 in final 15 minutes suggests short-term stabilization",Markets|AI Market Insights|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-27 05:30:50

SEC Likely to Allow In-Kind Swaps for Spot ETFs The revised filing also includes in-kind creation and redemption, which means that brokers could swap ETF shares directly for DOGE tokens. Analyst Eric Balchunas says that it’s now almost certain that the SEC will allow in-kind creation and redemption for all spot ETFs.

According to Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, the chances of approval for most spot crypto ETFs, including Dogecoin, are now at 90% or higher. Dogecoin Stalls Near Support Despite ETF Buzz Even with the ETF news, Dogecoin is down 1.8% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.162. Technical indicators show mixed signals as most oscillators show neutral momentum, and moving averages strongly signal a sell. Dogecoin has seen a decline throughout June, dropping from around $0.23 at the start of the month to the current level near $0.161. After a short-lived rally between June 10–13, where prices briefly spiked, it has resumed its downward trend. Dogecoin has found support near $0.15, where buyers have stepped in several times. However, it faces strong resistance between $0.17 and $0.172, which has blocked further upward moves. Unless it breaks above this resistance with strong volume, the short-term trend looks weak to slightly bearish. Experts Eye Dogecoin Breakout Trader Tardigrade says that Dogecoin made big jumps in the last market cycle, from $0.0003 to $0.0026 to $0.009.

While traders react to the latest swings, savvy investors are using this moment to reposition. In the midst of these moves, one project is drawing increasing attention from analysts and early-stage investors alike: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum Faces Congestion and Innovation Pressures Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform, but its performance is being challenged by both internal and external factors. Ongoing concerns over network congestion and the complexity of scaling solutions have triggered fluctuating sentiment. While Ethereum’s roadmap toward full scalability is promising, short-term uncertainty is leading some traders to reduce exposure temporarily. This has created a rare opening for repositioning capital into emerging sectors of the crypto space. Cardano Struggles to Maintain Narrative Momentum Cardano, known for its research-driven approach and proof-of-stake model, has faced difficulties maintaining investor momentum. While its development team continues to roll out upgrades, the pace of real-world adoption has lagged behind expectations. This contrast between long-term potential and short-term indecision is sparking mixed reactions across technical and fundamental analysis circles. For investors seeking more immediate ROI catalysts, capital is starting to shift toward opportunities with stronger short-term positioning. XRP Enters Regulatory Clarity Phase Following major breakthroughs in the U.S. and Canadian regulatory landscape, XRP has entered a transitional phase. While analysts applaud developments such as the Canadian spot XRP ETF and mounting approval odds in the U.S., the asset’s near-term performance remains heavily influenced by institutional sentiment and ETF timelines. With XRP largely viewed as a longer-term play tied to legal and regulatory outcomes, some investors are reallocating to opportunities that carry more aggressive upside during this rotation window. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gaining Ground in Smart Capital Circles Amid this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a token of interest among investors seeking asymmetric gains. Analysts highlight its scarcity-driven token model, external audit confirmation, and rising traction in investor research platforms. Previous stages sold out instantly, and the project continues to show strong momentum without relying on short-term hype cycles. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is its intrinsic design for structural growth — a rare quality in a market filled with fleeting narratives. Positioned at the intersection of political themes and forward-looking infrastructure, the token is increasingly viewed as a strategic allocation for those preparing ahead of a potential market-wide surge in Q4 2025. Final Thoughts The current volatility in Ethereum, Cardano, and XRP isn’t a warning sign — it’s a signal. For seasoned investors, these periods offer a chance to rebalance and realign. And in that realignment, high-upside, early-position tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are becoming part of the serious conversation. Whether you’re planning for the next rotation or preparing to capitalize on the next wave of retail momentum, the smartest moves often happen during moments of doubt. As institutional and retail dynamics continue to shift, the time to evaluate next-phase opportunities — especially those with structural potential — is now.

The protocol also manages USR, a delta-neutral, dollar-pegged stablecoin, and RLP, its insurance liquidity pool. Recent initiatives from Resolv include deeper integrations with partners like ether.fi and P2P Validator, as well as an ecosystem vault for USR.

Speaking at a Capitol Hill press event, Scott confirmed that the legislation—covering both stablecoins and broader crypto regulations—is on track for completion by the end of September. NEW: SENATE BANKING CHAIR SCOTT SAYS MAJOR #BITCOIN AND CRYPTO BILLS WILL BE PASSED BY AUGUST ""DIGITAL ASSETS ARE CRITICAL TO AMERICAN DOMINANCE."" pic.twitter.com/f3B0nN3Drg — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) April 12, 2025 Trump’s Timeline vs. Congress Reality President Donald Trump had pushed for crypto laws to be ready by August. While that won’t happen, Scott’s updated timeline is still faster than what many expected. Just a day earlier, Senator Cynthia Lummis had suggested the process might drag into year-end. But during the event, she threw her support behind Scott’s deadline, saying, “Yes, sir. You’re the chairman, and we will do as you wish.” GENIUS Act Ready—But House Still Hesitating A big piece of the puzzle is the GENIUS Act , a bill focused on regulating stablecoins. The Senate passed it last week, and Scott urged the House of Representatives to fast-track it to the President’s desk, aligning with Trump’s stance. “The president’s mandate to move the GENIUS Act immediately is in the best interest of the American people,” Scott emphasized. [post_titles_links postid=”475444″] White House crypto adviser Bo Hines backed the push, praising both Scott and Lummis for staying aligned with the administration’s crypto vision. But not everyone’s in sync. Representative French Hill from the House Financial Services Committee pointed out that differences still exist between the Senate’s version and the House’s stablecoin bill. That could delay things. One More Hurdle? Another hurdle is the Agriculture Committee, which must also approve the market structure part of the bill. So far, it hasn’t matched the pace of the Banking Committee, making it a possible bottleneck. Still, if everything comes together, the U.S. could have a full crypto framework by the end of September, finally giving the industry the clarity it’s been waiting for.

This event is a big one, being the end of the month and end of the second quarter, so there could be an impact on spot markets. They have been recovering since Monday’s crash, but Bitcoin is really the only asset that has seen notable gains, and momentum was waning as the week ended. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s tranche of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.74, meaning that there are more long sellers than shorts. There is also a max pain point of $102,000, around $5,000 below current spot prices, which is where most losses will be made on contract expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at the $140,000 strike price, with more than $1.7 billion, and $120,000 is also a hot level. However, OI has also increased to over $1.5 billion at $85,000 and $95,000 as bearish speculators increase, according to Deribit. “Bitcoin options open interest on Deribit just hit an all-time high, $40 billion and counting,” the firm said on X.

This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $17.3 billion. Crypto Market Update Total market capitalization has retreated 2.5% this Friday, falling just below $3.4 trillion at the time of writing. However, it remains within a two-month sideways trading channel. Bitcoin failed to surpass resistance at $108,000 and had fallen back to the $107,000 area during the Friday morning Asian trading session, though it was looking resilient, having recovered from its Monday crash to $98,500. Ethereum prices were still stagnant , with the asset failing to break resistance at the former support price level of $2,500.

The White House’s efforts downplayed the urgency of upcoming tariff deadlines, easing investor concerns over a prolonged trade war.

Lutnick emphasized a ""top 10 deals"" strategy for Bloomberg News. Investors now closely watched upcoming US-Iran nuclear talks, while the fragile Israel-Iran ceasefire appears to be holding.

Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 1.42% to around 40,100 on Friday, while the broader Topix Index advanced 1.1% to 2,835, as Japanese equities rallied to multi-month highs after data showed that Tokyo’s core inflation rate slowed in June. The Japanese yen steady around 144.3 per dollar on Friday, near two-week highs. In Japan, investors weighed data showing Tokyo’s core inflation slowed in June rose 3.1% year-on-year in June 2025, though it remained well above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target—sustaining expectations of further rate hikes by the BOJ. Retail sales in Japan increased by 2.2% year-on-year in May 2025, down from an upwardly revised 3.5% rise in the previous month and below market expectations of 2.7% growth. Japan’s unemployment rate held steady at 2.5% in May 2025 for the third consecutive month, matching market expectations. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.37% to around 3,355 while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.8% to 10,430 on Friday, after President Donald Trump announced that the US and China signed a trade deal, and the offshore yuan weakened to around 7.16 per dollar on Friday, retreating from a near eight-month high reached in the previous session, as investors were left disappointed by the lack of details in the latest US-China deal.

The Australian dollar strengthened to above $0.655 on Friday, extending a five-session rally and reaching its highest level since November 2024. On the domestic front, attentions turn to next week’s May retail sales, which could reinforce concerns over Australia’s growth outlook and support the case for a July rate cut. In the U.S., on Thursday, all three major indexes ended higher with the S&P 500 reaching all-time high and Nasdaq 100 topping its previous session's record closes, driven by easing geopolitical tensions, strong tech performance, and rising hopes for interest rate cuts.

But that record didn’t materialize out of nowhere: over the past quarter-century, decisive matches had already given the world the stoppage-time heroics of 1999, when Manchester United snatched the trophy from Bayern; Liverpool’s unbelievable comeback from 0 – 3 down in Istanbul 2005; Chelsea’s first crown after a nerve-shredding penalty shoot-out in Munich 2012; and Sergio Ramos 92:48 header that launched Real Madrid toward La Décima in Lisbon 2014. Below, you’ll see how just five nights transformed dull statistics into legends that people still quote today. Drama is only half the tale; the other half hides in the swing of the odds that leap whenever a football miracle brews. Check the freshest numbers at https://4rabet-play.com/ — the lines there move faster than VAR can draw an offside. A single glance at the prices shows how microscopic Liverpool’s comeback chances were in Istanbul 2005, or how little faith analysts had in Désiré Doué’s brace in Munich 2025. Keep that tab open: we’re about to rewind the timeline and watch how Champions League history keeps turning favourites into bystanders. 1999 — Manchester United 2 : 1 Bayern Barcelona, Camp Nou. Until the 90th minute everything followed the script: Basler’s early strike, Jancker off the post, Germany’s rock-solid back line. The Bavarians were already pulling on champion T-shirts, United’s bench bracing for polite handshakes. But Sir Alex, like a strict teacher, waited for the bell and slapped the test back on the desks. Sheringham brought United level on 91 minutes, Solskjær struck the winner in the 93rd, and Schmeichel capped the chaos with a trademark “frog-leap” right in the six-yard box. Thus the meme “Fergie Time” was born — and with it a generation of fans convinced it’s dangerous to switch the TV off before the final whistle. 2005 — Liverpool 3 : 3 (pens 3 : 2) Milan Istanbul, Atatürk. By half-time the Reds were 0 – 3 down, and the Kaká-Shevchenko-Crespo trio looked like an advert for another planet. In the tunnel Liverpool fans belted out the anthem while Gerrard roared, “No one leaves!” Six minutes, three goals: the captain’s header, Šmicer’s deflected rocket, and Alonso’s follow-up after his own saved penalty. 3 – 3. Dudek danced on the line, parried Shevchenko’s blast, and banked a miracle. Istanbul became the trigger word for every comeback believer. 2012 — Chelsea 1 : 1 (pens 4 : 3) Bayern Munich, Allianz Arena. A home final was meant to be Bayern’s victory parade, yet Drogba shot at Neuer only once all night. With 88 minutes on the clock, Chelsea won their first corner of the match—and from that lone delivery the ball was smashed straight into the net. In extra time Čech saved Robben’s penalty, and the shoot-out delivers the Blues their first European crown. From that night on, the word Clutch began with a capital C. 2014 — Real Madrid 4 : 1 (a.e.t.) Atlético Lisbon, Estádio da Luz. Diego Simeone’s fist was already rising when the clock flashed 92:48 . Modrić swung in the corner, Ramos powered the header 1 – 1. In extra time Los Blancos struck three more, sealed La Décima, and opened a new era of dominance. 2025 — Paris Saint-Germain 5 : 0 Inter Munich, Allianz Arena — again. Five goals without reply, a two-goal haul from 20-year-old Désiré Doué, and — after 55 years of waiting — the club finally added its first star above the badge. The French side played the final like a speed-run any % — no nerves, no openings for the Nerazzurri. Soundtrack of the night A shout-out to the legendary Linkin Park : thirty minutes before kick-off, the stage beneath the roof erupted as the band — now fronted by Emily Armstrong — blasted a medley of “The Emptiness Machine / Numb / In the End.” The fan zone turned into a karaoke wave; even neutral supporters sang along, and fireworks on the final chord filled the sky above the Olympic Tower. Line-ups and shape PSG (3-4-3, coach Luis Enrique): Donnarumma; Marquinhos, Škriniar, Bernal; Hakimi, Vitinha, Ugarte, Nuno Mendes; Ousmane Dembélé, Kylian Mbappé (c), Désiré Doué. Inter (3-5-2, Simone Inzaghi): Sommer; Pavard, Acerbi, Bastoni; Dumfries, Barella, Çalhanoğlu, Mkhitaryan, Dimarco; Lautaro Martínez, Thuram. Timeline of goals 22′ — Doué slid in Dembélé’s low cross to open the scoring. 35′ — Mbappé doubled the lead, finishing a one-on-one after Barella’s stray pass. 48′ — Doué made it 3-0 with a long-range strike that kissed the post. 67′ — Hakimi stabbed home after a corner while Inter’s back line argued about Škriniar’s run. 79′ — Vitinha capped a five-pass move through the middle, sealing the rout. Key moments 10′ — Donnarumma saved Lautaro’s penalty, a pivot that could have flipped the script. At only 20 years old, Doué’s two goals made him the youngest player to hit a Champions League-final brace since Lionel Messi achieved the feat in 2011. Inzaghi switched to a 4-3-3 at half-time, opening even more space on the flanks; the xG told the tale: 3.4 vs 0.9 . Match stats Possession: 62 % – 38 % Shots/on target: 18/10 – 9/3 Pass accuracy: 91 % – 84 % Context and fallout PSG lifted their first European Cup after two lost finals (2020, 2023). The +5 differential set a new record, eclipsing Milan’s +4 in 1994. Inter suffered their heaviest European defeat in 21 years. Luis Enrique confirmed a contract extension until 2028 in the post-match press conference, while the club announced the long-awaited star above the crest for next season’s Ligue 1 kit. Paris played the final like a speed-run any %: no nerves, no openings for the Nerazzurri — just relentless, precision football fans had waited 55 years to see. Why these five? Plot twists. Comebacks, tie-breakers, or record-shattering scorelines. Cultural footprint. “Fergie Time,” the “Istanbul Miracle,” “92:48” — phrases that outlive the raw stats. Replay factor. Millions of YouTube views, plus a steady stream of documentaries and podcasts. How to Re-Watch 10 minutes – Cue up Barcelona ’99’s finale plus the six-minute Istanbul ’05 burst. 30 minutes – Add Drogba’s corner and Modrić’s whipped cross. Craving the deep dive – Go full marathon: every match sits in UEFA’s archive, and the live fan chat under each stream rivals any studio breakdown. The Champions League isn’t just tactics and xG charts. It’s that split second when the ball slams into the net and social media forgets time zones. The five finals above prove that football’s magic isn’t predictability — it’s the power to stun. And as long as these stories live on, every new decider will begin with the crowd’s whispered question: “What if tonight the world shifts again?” This post Champions League: The 2025 Final, Jaw-Dropping Finals of Years Past, Nostalgia for Veteran Fans, and a Lightning-Fast Primer for Newcomers first appeared on BitcoinWorld and is written by Keshav Aggarwal",Crypto News|Press Release|Champions|football’s|League,EN,0,0,MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-06-27 05:53:02

The shelf offering could include sales of Bakkt’s Class A common stock, preferred stock, bonds, warrants, and debt securities. This strategy allows for flexible capital raising, without the need for a separate registration every time. Per the S-3 registration , filed on Thursday, the proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. Under the newly updated investment policy , a portion of it could be allocated to Bitcoin and other digital assets. “We may acquire Bitcoin or other digital assets using excess cash, proceeds from future equity or debt financings, or other capital sources, subject to the limitation set forth in our investment policy,” it read. According to the SEC filing, the firm has not yet made any Bitcoin purchases. Additionally, Bakkt intends to explore further financing alternatives, including the issuance of convertible notes, bonds, to purchase Bitcoin. Bakkt’s Latest Crypto Treasury Plans Bakkt announced on June 10 that it will allocate a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin and other “top-tier” cryptocurrencies. This aligns with its view in crypto as a store of value with long-term appreciation potential. The firm, founded in 2018, is also actively evaluating global jurisdictions to deploy these strategies. Besides, the timing and magnitude of Bitcoin purchases will depend on market conditions, capital market receptivity and business performance. “This initiative is intended to support Bakkt’s transformation into a pure-play crypto infrastructure company and to enable us to strategically add Bitcoin and other digital assets to our treasury,” said Akshay Naheta, Co-CEO of Bakkt, at the time. Bakkt Warns Regulatory Uncertainty, Evolving Crypto Rules The filing stated risk disclosures, warning of regulatory uncertainties, potential security classification of crypto, and banking access disruptions. Bakkt admitted that it had a “limited operating history and a history of operating losses.” Last year, the company said it was concerned about its operational viability in 2025, owing to inadequate cash reserves. ICE-Backed Bakkt Alerts of Possible Closure, Cites Cash Crisis @Bakkt , the cryptocurrency platform backed by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), has issued a warning about its financial health. #CryptoNews #news https://t.co/xGlJcXaB9F — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 8, 2024 The filing also specifically warned about future operations, where it “identified conditions and events that raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.” In March 2025, the firm’s shares tanked 27% , after two major clients, Bank of America and Webull, had withdrawn their ties with Bakkt. Following the announcement of the shelf offering on Thursday, the company’s shares surged over 3% and is now trading at $13.33, according to Google Finance.

What could this mean for the asset’s price? Bitcoin Binance Open Interest Has Seen A Sharp Increase As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin Open Interest on Binance has spiked. The “Open Interest” refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of BTC positions that are currently open on a given derivatives platform. When the value of the metric goes up, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions on the market. As the total amount of leverage present in the sector rises when new positions appear, this kind of trend can lead to the asset’s price becoming more volatile. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests $108,000, But Holders Disagree On Direction On the other hand, the indicator observing a decline suggests the holders are either closing up positions of their own volition or getting liquidated by their platform. Since leverage goes down with such a trend, the cryptocurrency can become more stable following it. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 24-hour percentage change of the Bitcoin Open Interest for the Binance exchange over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the 24-hour change in the Binance Bitcoin Open Interest recently shot up to a notably positive value, implying the number of positions on the platform saw a significant jump. At the peak of this spike, the indicator hit a value of more than 6%. From the chart, it’s visible that there have been a couple of other occasions that the metric has breached this mark during the past month. Interestingly, each of these spikes coincided with points that preceded a period of consolidation/decline for Bitcoin. As the quant notes, This recurring pattern suggests that large inflows into leveraged positions often precede periods where short-term gains are realized, leading to potential price pullbacks or sideways movement as market participants de-risk. The analyst has also shared another chart, this one tracking the 7-day change in the Realized Cap of the short-term holders and long-term holders. The “Realized Cap” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the capital that the holders have invested into Bitcoin. Below is a chart that shows the change in this metric for two investor cohorts, short-term holders (holding time of 155 days or lesser) and long-term holders (holding time greater than 155 days). As is apparent from the graph, the 7-day change in the Realized Cap has recently been positive for long-term holders, which suggests capital has been maturing from the short-term holders into this cohort.

So, while capital is still aging into long-term holders, it’s now happening at a much slower rate. BTC Price Bitcoin has been attempting to break past the $108,000 mark, but so far, it hasn’t found success as its price is still trading around $107,200.

The roadmap is structured around three core evolutions: Genesis, Pulse, and Convergence , each unlocking new capabilities for AI agents and the ecosystem. CARV’s AI infrastructure, SVM Chain, D.A.T.A. Framework, and CARV ID ( ERC-7231 ), will enable AI agents to progress from passive data consumers to fully autonomous, economically-aware actors. AI applications incubated by CARV Labs will launch across mainstream platforms like Google Play and App Store, driving Web2 adoption with Web3-native AI. CARV token plays a pivotal role in staking, access, coordination, and governance across all layers. In its most ambitious move yet, CARV is unveiling a new AI roadmap designed to shift Web3-AI convergence from passive productivity tools into sovereign, autonomous AI Beings . Unlike most AI-integrated Web3 projects, which typically use AI to enhance user-facing services such as analytics or summarization, CARV’s new vision is to create AI that exists as an independent, verifiable lifeform on-chain. These AI Beings will possess their own identity, memory, reputation, and agency, being able to act economically, socially, and politically within blockchain networks. In short, CARV’s infrastructure, anchored by its proprietary SVM Chain, D.A.T.A. Framework, and CARV ID (ERC-7231), will enable AI agents not just to exist, but to evolve and interact with both humans and other agents, creating decentralized, agent-powered economies. Essentially, CARV is transforming from a data coordination layer into an AI-native operating system that empowers autonomous on-chain intelligence. The Vision: AI Beings – from ‘Tools’ to Sovereign Actors What are AI Beings ? Simply put, they are AI agents that are not simply tools for users but sovereign actors in their own right. These agents can own wallets, manage assets, earn income, participate in governance, and even reproduce or fork new agents. They are capable of building on-chain memory and reputation while autonomously evolving through economic and social interactions. Importantly, only blockchain provides the necessary properties for such AI autonomy: verifiability, resistance to centralized control, and decentralized identity and governance. To realize this vision, CARV is pioneering an AI Being Stack — a five-layer architecture designed to support every aspect of AI agent life cycles: Infrastructure Layer: CARV SVM Chain provides scalable, auditable execution and low-latency consensus, optimized for AI operations. Communication & Computation Layer: Enables agent-to-agent protocols and autonomous payments, fueling AI economies. Identity Layer: Adds Agent ID to CARV ID, offering verifiable, persistent identity for both humans and agents. Governance & Awareness Layer: Embeds economic awareness and governance logic directly into AI agents. Application Layer: Powers AI-native applications such as companions, wallets, decentralized marketplaces, etc. interfacing with both users and other agents. The Roadmap: Genesis, Pulse, and Convergence CARV’s product roadmap unfolds in three evolutionary phases: Genesis Evolution Genesis Evolution activates the first wave of wallet-native AI agents, each anchored by CARV ID (ERC-7231) and supported by secure context layers built on Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and zero-knowledge (zk) proofs. These agents are not theoretical. They are being embedded in consumer-facing AI apps incubated through CARV Labs, with live deployments coming soon on Google Play and the App Store. At this stage, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) establishes the foundation for context persistence and secure memory. Agents can access user-consented data such as credentials, preferences, and interactions — all structured and versioned by MCP. This allows for coherent personalization across sessions and applications, without centralizing user data. Through CARV’s infrastructure and MCP, users receive tailored recommendations and predictive assistance while retaining full control and transparency over how their data shapes AI behavior. For the first time, personalization is achieved through verifiable, consent-driven memory, not black-box profiling. Pulse Evolution Pulse Evolution builds directly on the groundwork of Genesis. As users stake, interact, and participate in AI-powered apps, their actions feed real-time signals into CARV’s proprietary SVM Chain and decentralized Verifier Node network. Here, agents don’t just operate statically, they learn and evolve through on-chain feedback loops, incorporating staking patterns, user votes, and behavioral data. Verifier Nodes ensure cryptographic validation of both data flows and agent behaviors, while SVM Chain delivers the high-speed, low-latency execution needed to scale across millions of interactions. In this phase, AI agents become economically aware, responding to staking incentives, adjusting their models based on community governance, and optimizing for alignment with user preferences. This marks one of the first large-scale convergences of reinforcement learning and blockchain-based governance. CARV’s infrastructure evolves from simply coordinating passive data to powering live, intelligent agent coordination systems that adapt in real time. Convergence Evolution Convergence Evolution is the final phase where individual intelligence becomes collective intelligence. In this stage, agents do not simply evolve independently, but they begin to collaborate, transact, and govern as part of a network of AI Beings. Through a multi-agent framework, unified reputation graph, and standardized identity protocols, AI agents gain the ability to negotiate, share context, and co-create outcomes across applications and domains. Imagine a nutrition AI agent coordinating with a fitness AI, or an educational assistant collaborating with a financial wellness bot, all operating under user-consented frameworks and verifiable on-chain logic. For developers, this enables sticky, multi-agent ecosystems; for users, it delivers hyper-personalized, cross-domain experiences. At this phase, what began as staking and identity issuance matures into fully autonomous AI economies. where agents govern themselves, transact assets, and evolve collectively with minimal human oversight. CARV’s decentralized tooling provides the standards and incentives to enable AI-to-AI marketplaces, agent DAOs, and cross-agent governance, unlocking new paradigms of coordination not possible in centralized AI systems. Through this evolution, CARV transitions from being a foundational data layer to becoming the coordination engine for AI-native on-chain life, the AI Beings. “This roadmap is more than a product plan. It’s the blueprint for a new digital society,” said Ambero Tu, CTO of CARV. “For the first time, AI agents can evolve with verified identity, reputation, and autonomy. CARV is building not just a coordination layer, but the rails for an entire on-chain species — AI Beings. This is the moment where CARV is transforming decentralized intelligence from static data aggregation to autonomous, AI-driven coordination economies, where both human users and AI Beings share ownership and governance.” About CARV CARV is where Sovereign AI Beings live, learn, and evolve. What are AI Beings? They are sovereign intelligences born natively on-chain. AI Beings are designed with purpose, autonomy, and the capacity for growth. They possess memory, identity, and the ability to perceive and interact with their environment, not just to execute tasks, but to make independent decisions, adapt over time, and pursue self-defined goals. Anchored by its proprietary CARV SVM Chain, D.A.T.A. Framework, and CARV ID/Agent ID system ( ERC-7231 ), CARV enables verifiable, consent-based AI Beings that learn, adapt, and co-create with users. Driven by CARV’s AI-first stack, consumer AI apps incubated through CARV Labs launched on Google Play, App Store and beyond, reaching billions of people, bringing agent-powered experiences and real-world incentives into mainstream digital life. With 8M+ CARV IDs issued, 60K+ verifier nodes, and 1,000+ integrated games, CARV bridges AI agents, Web3 infrastructure, and real-world utility, fueling the rise of agent-driven economies. At its core, CARV token powers staking, governance, and coordination across this stack, making CARV the operating system for AI Beings on Web3.

(COIN) ended Thursday’s trading session at a new all-time closing high of $369.21, sparking excitement among investors and mixed reactions from analysts. Key Takeaways: TikTok has denied accusations that its owners are buying Trump’s official memecoin. Representative Brad Sherman claimed a $300M Trump Coin purchase tied to TikTok, citing GD Culture Group. Critics questioned both Sherman’s crypto claims and the logic behind the alleged memecoin investment.. The stock rose 3.89% on the day and nearly 40% over the past month, marking a 3.3% gain over its previous record of $357.39 set in November 2021. The surge drew a bold reaction from Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal, who posted , “Going vertical now,” in response to the milestone. “Next step, crypto—the liquidity spigot is wide, wide open,” he added, signaling expectations for broader market momentum. Coinbase’s New High Comes as Firm Enters S&P 500 Coinbase’s new record high follows its recent inclusion in the S&P 500 index on May 19, a historic first for a crypto-native firm. The company was the best-performing stock in the index on Tuesday, posting a 12.10% gain. Some analysts attribute the momentum to political developments, including the advancement of the GENIUS Act in the U.S. House on June 17. The bill aims to bring more clarity to stablecoin regulations. Coinbase, which co-created the USDC stablecoin with Circle Internet Group, earns half its revenue from the stablecoin’s operations. Despite the bullish price action, experts are split on whether Coinbase can sustain its upward trajectory. Investment adviser Andy Heilman acknowledged the strength of the stock but suggested a pullback may be looming. “Weekly view on $COIN looks very bullish, even if it is due for a pullback,” he wrote on X, adding that technical patterns hint at “possible four-digit prices” in the long term. $COIN daily Bollinger band expansion looking like it just wants to keep going up for now… pic.twitter.com/Ftj70xlQiA — Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) June 26, 2025 Others echoed similar optimism with caution. Analyst Cantonese Cat noted that the expanding daily Bollinger Band suggests the stock “just wants to keep going up.” Meanwhile, fellow analyst Chad warned that COIN appears “overextended above the upper Bollinger Band,” signaling a potential cooldown. For long-term holders, the rally brought a sense of relief. “After buying Coinbase on day 1, I am finally back to the price I paid, 4 years later,” crypto commentator Whoisdat posted. Coinbase debuted on the Nasdaq in April 2021 at $381 per share but closed its first day at $328.28 after a sharp intraday drop. Coinbase Q1 Revenue Climbs, But Profit Falls 94% Coinbase reported mixed first-quarter results , with revenue rising 24% year-over-year to $2 billion, but falling short of analyst expectations and down 10% from the previous quarter. While transaction revenue grew to $1.26 billion, its subscription and services division—covering staking and custodial offerings, rose 37% to nearly $700 million, reflecting growing diversification beyond trading. Despite the revenue uptick, net income plunged 94% to $66 million as the company marked down its crypto holdings amid market volatility. Adjusted earnings stood at $526.6 million, or $1.94 per share, still below last year’s figure of $2.53. Operating expenses surged 51% to $1.3 billion due to aggressive marketing and asset write-downs.

The roadmap is structured around three core evolutions: Genesis, Pulse, and Convergence, each unlocking new capabilities for AI agents and the ecosystem. CARV’s AI infrastructure, SVM Chain, D.A.T.A. Framework, and CARV ID ( ERC-7231 ), will enable AI agents to progress from passive data consumers to fully autonomous, economically-aware actors. AI applications incubated by CARV Labs will launch across mainstream platforms like Google Play and App Store, driving Web2 adoption with Web3-native AI. $CARV token plays a pivotal role in staking, access, coordination, and governance across all layers. In its most ambitious move yet, CARV is unveiling a new AI roadmap designed to shift Web3-AI convergence from passive productivity tools into sovereign, autonomous AI Beings. Unlike most AI-integrated Web3 projects, which typically use AI to enhance user-facing services such as analytics or summarization, CARV’s new vision is to create AI that exists as an independent, verifiable lifeform on-chain. These AI Beings will possess their own identity, memory, reputation, and agency, being able to act economically, socially, and politically within blockchain networks. In short, CARV’s infrastructure, anchored by its proprietary SVM Chain, D.A.T.A. Framework, and CARV ID (ERC-7231), will enable AI agents not just to exist, but to evolve and interact with both humans and other agents, creating decentralized, agent-powered economies. Essentially, CARV is transforming from a data coordination layer into an AI-native operating system that empowers autonomous on-chain intelligence. The Vision: AI Beings - from 'Tools' to Sovereign Actors What are AI Beings? Simply put, they are AI agents that are not simply tools for users but sovereign actors in their own right. These agents can own wallets, manage assets, earn income, participate in governance, and even reproduce or fork new agents. They are capable of building on-chain memory and reputation while autonomously evolving through economic and social interactions. Importantly, only blockchain provides the necessary properties for such AI autonomy: verifiability, resistance to centralized control, and decentralized identity and governance. To realize this vision, CARV is pioneering an AI Being Stack — a five-layer architecture designed to support every aspect of AI agent life cycles: Infrastructure Layer: CARV SVM Chain provides scalable, auditable execution and low-latency consensus, optimized for AI operations. Communication & Computation Layer: Enables agent-to-agent protocols and autonomous payments, fueling AI economies. Identity Layer: Adds Agent ID to CARV ID, offering verifiable, persistent identity for both humans and agents. Governance & Awareness Layer: Embeds economic awareness and governance logic directly into AI agents. Application Layer: Powers AI-native applications such as companions, wallets, decentralized marketplaces, etc. interfacing with both users and other agents. The Roadmap: Genesis, Pulse, and Convergence CARV’s product roadmap unfolds in three evolutionary phases: Genesis Evolution Genesis Evolution activates the first wave of wallet-native AI agents, each anchored by CARV ID (ERC-7231) and supported by secure context layers built on Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and zero-knowledge (zk) proofs. These agents are not theoretical. They are being embedded in consumer-facing AI apps incubated through CARV Labs, with live deployments coming soon on Google Play and the App Store. At this stage, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) establishes the foundation for context persistence and secure memory. Agents can access user-consented data such as credentials, preferences, and interactions — all structured and versioned by MCP. This allows for coherent personalization across sessions and applications, without centralizing user data. Through CARV’s infrastructure and MCP, users receive tailored recommendations and predictive assistance while retaining full control and transparency over how their data shapes AI behavior. For the first time, personalization is achieved through verifiable, consent-driven memory, not black-box profiling. Pulse Evolution Pulse Evolution builds directly on the groundwork of Genesis. As users stake, interact, and participate in AI-powered apps, their actions feed real-time signals into CARV’s proprietary SVM Chain and decentralized Verifier Node network. Here, agents don’t just operate statically, they learn and evolve through on-chain feedback loops, incorporating staking patterns, user votes, and behavioral data. Verifier Nodes ensure cryptographic validation of both data flows and agent behaviors, while SVM Chain delivers the high-speed, low-latency execution needed to scale across millions of interactions. In this phase, AI agents become economically aware, responding to staking incentives, adjusting their models based on community governance, and optimizing for alignment with user preferences. This marks one of the first large-scale convergences of reinforcement learning and blockchain-based governance. CARV’s infrastructure evolves from simply coordinating passive data to powering live, intelligent agent coordination systems that adapt in real time. Convergence Evolution Convergence Evolution is the final phase where individual intelligence becomes collective intelligence. In this stage, agents do not simply evolve independently, but they begin to collaborate, transact, and govern as part of a network of AI Beings. Through a multi-agent framework, unified reputation graph, and standardized identity protocols, AI agents gain the ability to negotiate, share context, and co-create outcomes across applications and domains. Imagine a nutrition AI agent coordinating with a fitness AI, or an educational assistant collaborating with a financial wellness bot, all operating under user-consented frameworks and verifiable on-chain logic. For developers, this enables sticky, multi-agent ecosystems; for users, it delivers hyper-personalized, cross-domain experiences. At this phase, what began as staking and identity issuance matures into fully autonomous AI economies. where agents govern themselves, transact assets, and evolve collectively with minimal human oversight. CARV’s decentralized tooling provides the standards and incentives to enable AI-to-AI marketplaces, agent DAOs, and cross-agent governance, unlocking new paradigms of coordination not possible in centralized AI systems. Through this evolution, CARV transitions from being a foundational data layer to becoming the coordination engine for AI-native on-chain life, the AI Beings. “This roadmap is more than a product plan. It’s the blueprint for a new digital society,” said Ambero Tu, CTO of CARV. “For the first time, AI agents can evolve with verified identity, reputation, and autonomy. CARV is building not just a coordination layer, but the rails for an entire on-chain species — AI Beings. This is the moment where CARV is transforming decentralized intelligence from static data aggregation to autonomous, AI-driven coordination economies, where both human users and AI Beings share ownership and governance."" About CARV CARV is where Sovereign AI Beings live, learn, and evolve. What are AI Beings? They are sovereign intelligences born natively on-chain. AI Beings are designed with purpose, autonomy, and the capacity for growth. They possess memory, identity, and the ability to perceive and interact with their environment, not just to execute tasks, but to make independent decisions, adapt over time, and pursue self-defined goals. Anchored by its proprietary CARV SVM Chain, D.A.T.A. Framework, and CARV ID/Agent ID system ( ERC-7231 ), CARV enables verifiable, consent-based AI Beings that learn, adapt, and co-create with users. Driven by CARV’s AI-first stack, consumer AI apps incubated through CARV Labs launched on Google Play, App Store and beyond, reaching billions of people, bringing agent-powered experiences and real-world incentives into mainstream digital life. With 8M+ CARV IDs issued, 60K+ verifier nodes, and 1,000+ integrated games, CARV bridges AI agents, Web3 infrastructure, and real-world utility, fueling the rise of agent-driven economies. At its core, $CARV token powers staking, governance, and coordination across this stack, making CARV the operating system for AI Beings on Web3.

According to the crypto software firm’s June 26 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the offering will include any combination of Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, or units. The Form S-3 shelf registration enables Bakkt to issue these securities in one or more tranches over time, depending on market conditions. Bakkt may allocate proceeds from future equity or debt financings into Bitcoin or other digital assets. While no purchases have been made yet, Bakkt said its updated investment policy now permits such acquisitions as part of its broader treasury strategy. “We may acquire Bitcoin or other digital assets using excess cash, proceeds from future equity or debt financings, or other capital sources, subject to the limitation set forth in our Investment Policy,” Bakkt noted in the filing. The filing also noted that the timing and scale of any crypto asset acquisition will depend on business performance, market conditions, capital availability, and strategic priorities. The firm is exploring various financing options, including convertible notes or bonds, to support these plans.

The pivot to a Bitcoin treasury strategy aligns Bakkt with a growing trend among corporates and public entities allocating reserves into digital assets. The decision may be an attempt to revitalise investor confidence and strengthen the firm’s long-term positioning in the crypto sector. Bakkt shares rose 3% on Thursday to $13.33, but the stock remains down 46% year-to-date. The firm has been under pressure since March, when its shares plunged 30% after revealing that Bank of America and Webull, two of its largest clients, would not renew their commercial agreements. The latest development also comes after a turbulent year, as Bakkt reported heavy losses and flagged concerns over its ability to continue operations without fresh capital . As previously reported by crypto.news, the Trump Media & Technology Group was reportedly in “advanced talks” to acquire Bakkt was apparently in advanced talks to acquire Bakkt. However, no agreement was finalized, and the status of the negotiations remains unclear.

Analyst Shares BTC’s 2025 Roadmap,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-next-price-discovery-coming-analyst-shares-btcs-2025-roadmap/,"This week, Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered from its recent drop below the $100,000 level and is attempting to turn the crucial $108,000 resistance into support for the fourth time. As we approach the second half of 2025, a market watcher has shared his forecast for BTC. Related Reading: Solana Price At ‘A Very Delicate Level’ – Analyst Says $148 Reclaim Is Key Bitcoin Sees Transitional Period On Thursday, analyst Rekt Capital shared a roadmap for BTC for the rest of the year. He noted that this cycle has been “truly a cycle of re-accumulation ranges,” explaining that these have formed throughout the cycle since the end of 2022 and evolved since the Bitcoin Halving last year. In the pre-having period, BTC registered brief price deviations with downside wicks below the re-accumulation range lows in the weekly chart. Meanwhile, the post-halving period has seen Bitcoin deviations occur with multi-week clusters of full-bodied candles below the range lows. For instance, after its first price discovery uptrend, which lasted around seven weeks, BTC moved within its re-accumulation range for about ten weeks. Then, it transitioned into the first Price Discovery Correction, recording a nine-week downside deviation below the range lows before breaking out and rallying past the range highs toward a new ATH last month. Its past performances suggested that BTC was ready to enter its second Price Discovery Uptrend. But as Rekt Capital detailed, a transitional period has occurred for the first time, with price consolidating around the re-accumulation range high area. According to the analyst, this is “perhaps the first time that we’re seeing a deviation occur below the range high,” making this area a crucial level to transition into a new uptrend. We never really had to pull back substantially, maybe, until that final corrective period, which would last multiple months, but each re-accumulation range would see quite a bit of upside, and that upside would be very quick and no real post-breakout retesting, no real pausing. What we’re seeing here is something very, very different. Weekly Close Key For BTC’s Future Based on its new transition period, the key level for Bitcoin to reclaim in the weekly timeframe is the $104,400 support, which it held for nearly seven weeks before the recent pullbacks. This level was lost after BTC closed last week below it and “should not become a resistance level.” To the analyst, it’s key that this week’s close solidifies the price recovery as it would position the cryptocurrency for a retest and confirmation of $104,400 as support and continue the build the base around this area to transition into the next multi-week Price Discovery Uptrend. Rekt Capital added that the timeline for BTC’s next uptrend will depend on the length of the new transitional period. However, he believes that it will take “a bit longer” to break out. Related Reading: Injective Prepares For Bullish Reversal Amid 25% Recovery – Analyst Forecasts Massive Breakout Additionally, he suggested that what comes after the upcoming uptrend will also depend on how long it takes, as it could lead to an extended cycle or a prolongation of this phase, which could push the cycle peak into deeper stages of 2025. Nonetheless, the analyst affirmed that it’s crucial that the next corrective period, which could see Bitcoin drop between 25% to 33%, is short to potentially enjoy a third Price Discovery Uptrend before the bear market. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $107,555, a 3.2% increase in the weekly timeframe.

The US Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey says Jhonnatan Steven Rodriguez, 32, of Naples, Florida, has pleaded guilty to one count of receipt of bribes by a bank employee and one count of making false bank entries. The crimes occurred when Rodriguez worked for TD Bank. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $1 million. “In late 2022, Rodriguez began opening bank accounts for unknown individuals in exchange for bribes of approximately $200 to $250 per account. During the scheme, Rodriguez accepted bribes in exchange for fraudulently opening approximately 140 bank accounts, some of which were used for fraud. In carrying out this bribery scheme, Rodriguez would often forge the purported customers’ signatures on account opening documents. To protect his identity, Rodriguez used the alias ‘Jorge’ on a text messaging app to communicate with the individuals seeking bank accounts.” According to prosecutors, Rodriguez opened multiple accounts for several people. “For example, one individual sent Rodriguez 25 payments totaling $6,335 in exchange for opening multiple TD Bank accounts. Similarly, on or about December 17, 2022, another individual sent Rodriguez $1,050 in exchange for opening multiple TD Bank accounts.” Rodriguez is due back in federal court on November 25th for sentencing.

This shift puts digital assets under the same regulations as traditional assets like stocks and ETFs. This move also increases regulations, introducing better laws against insider trading amid increased transparency requirements. Japan’s Financial regulators are changing the crypto industry and by extension the taxation in the crypto sector. Currently, Japanese traders pay tax rates of about 55% due to the classification of the assets as miscellaneous income. The latest proposal will ensure things change, with the rates reduced to 20%, simplifying tax reporting and encouraging retail and institutional investments. Prime Minister Kishida’s “New Capitalism” policy also supports this reform, as he intends to use it to revive economic growth using the increase in investment opportunities. Analysts suggest that aligning crypto taxes with equities would improve Japan’s competitiveness, bringing more institutional capital into its crypto market. ETF Green Light Signals Institutional Gold Rush By classifying digital assets under FIEA, Japan is opening the way for regulated cryptocurrency ETFs. Over the last few years, strict regulations have seen crypto ETF development limited, despite interest from traders in the market. This change could see ETFs making a debut in the country by 2026, a move analysts say could increase institutional inflows. Japan’s crypto market has about 12 million active users owning more than $34 billion in assets and has been expected to attract institutional players. Industry players like Goldman Sachs, already involved in global crypto ETF markets, could soon establish its presence in the country, improving its reputation as a leading financial center in the digital age. Stablecoins & Web3 Initiatives Gain Regulatory Clarity Japanese authorities are preparing a reform bill that will be out by the end of 2026. This bill aims to create guidelines for stablecoins issuance, fraud prevention, and transparency from platforms. The proposed reform will offer flexibility to all involved, allowing issuers to diversify their reserves by including low-risk assets in their cash holdings. Moreover, Japan’s regulatory bodies support Web3, including NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi). This integration of mainstream and emerging technologies puts the country in a better position to use Crypto’s economic opportunities. Meme Meets Structure in 2025’s Hottest Opportunity Amidst this regulatory development, Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP) has been capturing the attention of investors, climbing the ranks among the best Pepe coin presales.

However, the team swiftly denied any such claims. Across Protocol’s token, ACX, is down 10% amid the drama. The allegations, whether substantiated or not, appear to have shaken trader confidence, with ACX seeing a spike in trading volume alongside the price drop, suggesting market participants are reacting swiftly. Across co-founder Hart Lambur has called the accusations “categorically untrue” and denied all misdoings. “Risk Labs was granted ACX tokens from the DAO to build the Across protocol,” he wrote in a Friday post. “This is standard practice for DAOs! Since the first grant passed (in October 2023), we shipped Across v3 and grew the protocol massively.” “Since the second grant passed (in October 2024), we have built Across v4 with some incredible new technology (to be announced very, very soon), and we’ve hired brilliant new team members with these tokens (that vest over 4 years).

According to data from crypto.news, Wormhole ( W ) was exchanging hands at $0.0631, last check June 27, with a market cap of over $293 million. The token remains down more than 80% from its year-to-date high of $0.317. This dramatic drop has left nearly 96% of holders underwater, creating sustained selling pressure as investors try to reduce losses, data from IntoTheBlock shows. Wormhole’s losses also come as it faces heavy competition from other major players in the interoperability space, like Cosmos and Polkadot. Despite months of falling prices, a series of emerging catalysts could finally mark the end of Wormhole’s market downturn and signal a potential bullish reversal in the coming weeks. First, Wormhole has recently partnered with Ripple to bring multichain support to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ripple’s new EVM-compatible sidechain. The integration will allow both networks to interface with over 35 blockchains, significantly expanding their interoperability capabilities. This enhanced connectivity could increase cross-chain activity via Wormhole, which may, in turn, drive higher demand for the W token.

A potential listing on a top-tier platform like Coinbase often serves as a major catalyst for market interest, typically boosting liquidity, visibility, and stirring demand from investors. If confirmed, the spot listing could drive renewed hype and upward price momentum for the W token in the near term. Third, Wormhole appears to be in the process of forming a double-bottom pattern on the daily chart, a classic bullish reversal structure often observed at the end of sustained downtrends. The two lows of the pattern are forming around the $0.05 level, while the neckline resistance sits at approximately $0.117. W 1-day price chart — June 27 | Source: crypto.news Momentum indicators like the MACD line have crossed above its signal line, while the Relative Strength Index is trending upward, both suggesting growing bullish momentum. W MACD and RSI chart — June 27 | Source: crypto.news If Wormhole continues along this trajectory and successfully completes the pattern, it is likely to retest the neckline by late August. A confirmed breakout above the neckline, particularly with rising volume, would validate the pattern and signal a shift in market structure. Such a breakout could open the door for a rally toward the $0.20 psychological resistance level, which would represent a gain of over 200% from current prices. However, if Wormhole fails to hold the $0.05 support, the double-bottom setup would be invalidated. A breakdown below this key psychological level, particularly if accompanied by rising sell volume, could accelerate downward pressure and push the token toward $0.04, marking a new local low.

The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths.

Synthetix historic price sentiment SNX price history Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range.

This change comes amid growing discussions with U.S. regulators on the future structure of altcoin funds and investor access to underlying assets. In-kind redemptions enable investors to swap ETF shares directly for the underlying cryptocurrency instead of cash, offering potential tax advantages and aligning the structure more closely with how many crypto-native investors operate. The mechanism is seen as appealing to both retail and institutional participants, who view it as a way to reduce costs and improve liquidity. In-Kind Creations and Redemptions Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) opened comments on proposals to incorporate in-kind creations and redemptions for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. During a recent panel hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce suggested that in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs could soon be approved, adding momentum to ETF issuers’ plans. Bitwise initially filed for its Dogecoin ETF in January and its Aptos ETF in March. Amendments to ETF proposals are a routine part of the regulatory process, allowing issuers to refine fund structures in line with SEC feedback. Solomon Tesfaye, head of capital markets at Aptos Labs, emphasized the significance of ETF access for Aptos and similar Layer 1 networks. “ETF access would mark a major step forward in integrating Aptos and other L1s into traditional capital markets,” Tesfaye stated, calling it a potential “game-changer” for liquidity, capital inflows, and institutional validation. Dogecoin, known for its memecoin origins and $24.1 billion market cap, continues to attract ETF interest, with Grayscale and 21Shares also filing to launch DOGE ETFs . Aptos, created by former Meta engineers, is the 32nd-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $2.85 billion and a 52-week high of $20. Altcoin ETFs Gain Momentum in 2025 The surge in altcoin ETF filings aligns with the SEC’s evolving stance under the Trump administration, which has encouraged new applications in 2025. Over 70 crypto ETFs are awaiting SEC review , with at least 31 altcoin ETF applications filed in the first half of the year, according to Cointelegraph Research. While critics argue that crypto ETFs risk centralizing assets in a sector built on decentralization, the momentum signals strong market interest in bringing altcoins further into traditional financial markets.

Pi2Day is almost here, and pioneers are watching closely for big announcements. This event could be the spark Pi Coin needs to break out. Google searches for “Pi2Day” have surged, and social media is buzzing with predictions. While some expect major updates, others are unsure, especially after Pi’s recent 17% drop below $0.50. Critics warn that without real, functional updates, the price could fall further. The Core team is expected to announce key features like KYC Sync, mainnet progress, GenAI tools, dApps, and even .pi domains. The community also expects major listing announcements, which could boost its adoption and price. Pi Coin Loses Steam After Recent Rally Amidst the Pi day excitement, Pi Coin recently jumped 12-18% and reached around $0.61-$0.63. It was also the top trending coin on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. But it dropped 11% yesterday and is now trading at $0.553, down 4.7% in the last 24 hours. The price has now returned to a key range between $0.50–$0.56, showing signs of weakness. If buyers don’t step up soon, it could fall back to $0.50 support. Pi Coin Unlikely To Drop Below $0.40 Analyst Dr Altcoin shared that Pi has averaged around $0.60 over the past 3 months. He says that this shows its steady, organic growth rather than hype-driven spikes. With $100 million in funding from Pi Network Ventures fueling real development, he expects Pi to rise gradually. Unless a major announcement drops this week, a big price move is unlikely. However, the positive takeaway is that Pi is expected to hold above its all-time low of $0.40. According to CoinDCX, volatility is expected to pick up as June nears its end. If Pi breaks above the $0.74 resistance level, it could rise to the $0.85–$0.90 range. But if the $0.60 support fails, especially in the absence of major updates or exchange listings, the price could fall back toward $0.52. In July, it expects a bullish outlook, but it may struggle to reclaim $1. Pi Coin could stay between $1.20 and $1.50 for most of the month.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-27 07:23:58

The project is in phase 5 of its presale which has already sold out over 40%. Mutuum Finance has raised more than $11.2 million and attracted over 12,500 holders. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a cultural staple in meme coin circles, its upside appears limited compared to early-stage altcoins with real functionality. That’s why those asking what’s the best crypto to buy in 2025, are seriously considering Mutuum Finance as a potential 100x sleeper. If history has taught us anything, it’s that those who move early on breakout narratives tend to win big, and right now, Mutuum Finance might just be that breakout. Shiba Inu Holds Near $0.000011 amid Bounce Signal Shiba Inu (SHIB) has moved just over 4% off the previous $0.00001000 support, back to the $0.000012 price area, which has put SHIB back in the short-term bullish entry mode as buyers rush in. Although trading volume has been soaring, analysts also add that the declining circulating supply, due to sustained token burns, has also provided a longer-term boost. Despite the unpredictability of the broader markets, SHIB is a few pennies below crucial resistance of $0.00001150, where an apparent breakout can signal the entry to additional development. In the meantime, on the periphery of this meme-coin movement, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) keeps building the hype. Revolutionizing DeFi with a Proven Dual-Lending Formula Unlike normal DeFi protocols, Mutuum Finance will be the first to try and develop a hybrid lending system that will have opportunities to cater to the demands of users with passive and sophisticated users. In Peer-to-Contract (P2C), clients fulfill the requirement of any investor who desires passive income by investing his USDT in smart contract pools that generate stable passive income on the basis of an interest rate which it estimates up and down as the market demands. In Peer-to-Peer (P2P), experienced users can utilize this system where both lenders and borrowers exercise complete control over determining the terms, ideal to handle volatile assets. Mutuum Finance Presale Booms with 12,500+ Investors and $11.2M Raised Mutuum Finance is creating a buzz in the market as it has already raised over $11.2 million, and over 12,500 investors are already backing it. The existence of this type of momentum is a testament to the increasing faith in the long-term vision of the project and the role it would play in disrupting the decentralized finance market. $100,000 in Leaderboard and Giveaway Rewards Now Available Mutuum Finance is celebrating its fast-paced growth and thanking early bird fans by creating a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners will receive $10,000’s worth of Mutuum Finance tokens, simply for signing up early. Shiba Inu (SHIB) may still enjoy meme-coin momentum, but the smart money is beginning to shift toward high-upside projects with real-world utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading that charge. Currently in Phase 5 of its presale, MUTM has already raised over $11.2 million and attracted more than 12,500 early investors. The innovative dual-lending model, combining passive Peer-to-Contract and active Peer-to-Peer mechanisms, sets Mutuum Finance apart in the DeFi market. At just $0.03 per token, a modest $40 investment today could transform into a life-changing opportunity by 2025. Don’t wait for the headlines, be early. Secure your position now.

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) believes that owning 0.1 Bitcoin might one day be more valuable than owning a home in the U.S. He shared this bold opinion after a major announcement from U.S. housing officials that could allow Bitcoin to be used as a financial reserve when applying for a mortgage. For CZ, this signals a shift in what the American Dream might look like in the future. Bitcoin for Mortgages? A Big Step Forward On June 26, CZ responded to a post by William J. Pulte, Director at the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), who revealed that the housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been asked to prepare proposals for integrating crypto into mortgage qualifications. The ultimate purpose is to allow borrowers to use Bitcoin holdings as proof of financial reserves, something that until now was strictly limited to fiat-based assets like savings, investment accounts, or retirement funds. New Rules, New Opportunities If accepted, the change could redefine how Americans qualify for mortgages, particularly by broadening access for crypto holders. But there are rules: crypto holdings would need to be verifiable, stored on U.S.-regulated exchanges, and subject to risk-based discounts due to volatility. The FHFA sees this move as a way to modernize borrower assessments and bring crypto into the fold of mainstream financial tools. [post_titles_links postid=”475475″] Crypto Reaction CZ applauded the development, calling it a “great step” and boldly claiming that the new American Dream will soon be about owning 0.1 BTC, not just property. The comment sparked wide debate on X, with supporters praising the institutional acceptance of Bitcoin and skeptics warning about crypto’s unpredictable price swings. While some cheered the move like CZ, This is a big step starting an important conversation. @Pulte is the US Director of Federal Housing FHFA. Bitcoin as pristine collateral will make more and more sense to the right people. Imagine your mortgage payment going down overtime naturally. #Bitcoin $MSTR pic.twitter.com/a1s5ffAqvC — AngryBuhda (@AngryBuhda) June 24, 2025 Adding to this, one crypto user has pointed out that under the previous FHFA leadership, Fannie Mae covered mortgage payments even when homeowners defaulted, and no one questioned that policy at the time. With that financial burden set to surface between August and October, the analyst argues that Pulte is simply trying to keep housing transactions alive with the tools he has. This move could be a big moment for the crypto industry in America. It not only shows growing trust in digital assets but also opens the door for other government agencies to accept crypto in more areas of finance. If approved, Bitcoin could soon play a key role in how people buy homes.

Unable to hold on here, BTC continues to move sideways at the $107,000 level, while today, as every Friday, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market has come. These options are even more important because they fall on the last Friday of both the week and the month. According to the data, $15 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and $2.29 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH) options will expire on June 27 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.75, the maximum loss point is $ 102,000 and the notional value is $ 15 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 0.52, a maximum loss point of $2,200, and a notional value of $2.29 billion. The maximum pain point is the level at which the price of a cryptocurrency settles at a certain value as an option approaches its expiration date, resulting in significant losses for the largest number of option traders. At this point, significant volatility could be seen in Bitcoin prices as the $15 billion options expiration on June 27th. While the maximum pain point is at $102,000 for BTC and $2,200 for Ethereum, investors could push prices to this level through market manipulation, as market prices are above the maximum pain point. This means that a large portion of investors are in profit. This may lead some investors to realize their profits and increase volatility in prices. Evaluating the options data on Bitcoin, Deribit Asia Business Development Head Lin Chen stated that the ratio of put and call options started to increase and reached 0.75. So, this means that while the number of call options is ultimately greater, the number of put options has also started to increase in recent days. Lin Chen said that this situation is not only due to the expectation of a decline, but also because investors are looking for opportunities to buy at the bottom in case of a possible decline: “The increase in put options does not mean that investors expect a decline in Bitcoin. Investors are acting strategically. Traders are taking positions either to sell put options and earn premium or to avoid being left out in the face of a possible decline and to buy BTC at the bottom.” *This is not investment advice.

Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty posted a statement on X, signaling that the company is now considering its next legal move. Alderoty wrote, “The ball is back in our court.” With this, the ball is back in our court. The Court gave us two options: dismiss our appeal challenging the finding on historic institutional sales—or press forward with the appeal. Stay tuned. Either way, XRP’s legal status as not a security remains unchanged. In the meantime,… https://t.co/edHNbMzYbZ — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) June 26, 2025 Business as Usual for Ripple Alderoty’s remarks come after the court declined the parties’ joint motion to modify the previous ruling that imposed a $125 million penalty and placed a permanent injunction preventing Ripple’s institutional XRP sales. While the ruling maintains the current legal framework, Alderoty made it clear that Ripple still retains control over how it proceeds. In his statement, Alderoty summarized the choice ahead. Ripple can either withdraw its appeal challenging the court’s earlier finding on past institutional sales or continue pursuing that appeal through the Second Circuit. His tone suggested that the decision would be made carefully but without urgency, disrupting Ripple’s operations. “In the meantime, it’s business as usual,” he wrote. XRP’s Legal Status Remains Intact A key point Alderoty emphasized is that the judge’s ruling does not affect XRP’s legal classification in the U.S. He noted that “XRP’s legal status as not a security remains unchanged.” Notably, Alderoty made the same clarification after the court rejected their first joint motion . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Alderoty’s comments capture Ripple’s current position. While the court rejected the joint effort to resolve certain elements of the case without completing the appeals process, it left the decision to press forward entirely in Ripple’s hands. Alderoty’s post reflects confidence that the company is well-prepared to navigate either option. Ripple’s Next Steps Judge Torres’s rejection of the motion clarified that parties cannot sidestep a final judgment through mutual agreement alone. The court reaffirmed that only a full appellate review or voluntary dismissal of the appeal can alter the outcome. The statement also serves as a signal to Ripple’s stakeholders and the broader crypto industry that the company remains steady despite the setback. By highlighting that normal operations continue and XRP’s status remains secure, Alderoty aimed to reassure both investors and partners. What remains uncertain is whether Ripple will choose to pursue its appeal or let the existing judgment stand. The inability to sell XRP to institutions in the U.S. could limit the company’s business in the country. However, Alderoty’s message leaves no doubt that Ripple is prepared for whichever course it chooses. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

What Next?,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/27/xrp-s-price-volatility-crashes-to-lowest-level-since-trump-s-victory-what-next,"This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. A measure of XRP's XRP price volatility has crashed to the lowest level since President Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. elections in November. Still, it's not yet at the level which has historically presaged strong directional trends. XRP's 30-day annualized realized volatility, a measure of how volatile prices have been over the past four weeks, recently dropped to 44%, the lowest since early November, according to data source TradingView. The decline marks a sharp slide from highs above 150% registered in December and March. The volatility meltdown follows boring price action in the XRP market. This despite the debut of XRP futures on the CME, several issuers applying for spot XRP ETFs and overall positive regulatory developments for the crypto industry under Trump's presidency. Since March, XRP has primarily traded back and forth between $2 and $2.60, barring the occasional short-lived dips below $2. XRP is the payments-focused cryptocurrency used by fintech company Ripple to facilitate cross-border transactions. The price action is consistent with that of bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, which has mostly traded between $100,000 and $110,000 for almost 50 consecutive days. What next? Volatility is mean-reverting, which means that, over time, it tends to fluctuate around its long-term average. In other words, a sharp rise in volatility often paves the way for consolidation, and a prolonged drop in volatility usually sets the stage for strong directional trends. That said, the 30-day realized volatility is still well above the 15% to 30% range, which has marked volatility bottoms and renewed price turbulence since 2014.

The app, unveiled Thursday, allows users to send and receive money instantly across more than 160 countries and supports over 300 assets, including fiat currencies, stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. With Krak, Kraken aims to tackle long-standing inefficiencies in the global payments system by offering faster, cheaper and more accessible transactions. Krak Takes Aim at PayPal With Low-Fee Global Transfers and Built-In Rewards Unlike Kraken’s core trading platform, Krak is designed specifically for global payments. It sidesteps the high fees associated with trading by offering near-zero-cost peer-to-peer transfers. Let’s do a giveaway to celebrate the launch of @Krak For the next week, request $20 USDG from @Krak using the new app (yes – you can log in with your existing Kraken account info). We might hit accept https://t.co/TX6pq0KZHU pic.twitter.com/LsYbm4Btjo — Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) June 26, 2025 This positions Krak as a direct competitor to traditional payment apps like PayPal and Cash App. Users can move money without needing bank accounts or lengthy wallet addresses, thanks to a simplified system using “Kraktags,” which makes international transactions far more intuitive. The app also supports a wide range of assets, from fiat and stablecoins to crypto, allowing users to choose how they send and receive value. Another key differentiator is Krak’s earning functionality. Users can earn competitive yields, such as 4.1% APR on USDG holdings, and up to 10% on staked crypto, a feature not prioritized in Kraken’s trading app. From Payments to Lending, Krak Charts an Ambitious Path in Crypto Finance “We built and launched the Krak app because the financial system has been stuck in the past,” Kraken said in a statement. “Whether you’re sending a few dollars to a friend or wiring funds across continents, the process is slow, costly and frustratingly opaque. That shouldn’t be the case in 2025.” The company plans to introduce further products through Krak in the coming months, including physical and virtual cards and pay-in-advance services like collateralized loans. It also offers yield opportunities through stablecoins backed by reserves and staking options on supported tokens. Kraken said its goal is to eliminate friction from global finance by blending the efficiency of blockchain technology with the trust and simplicity of modern mobile banking. As stablecoins and blockchain-based payment systems draw broader interest, Kraken’s pivot signals a belief that the future of money is global, digital and always on.

But the question of them dumping their own altcoin on the market to fund operations has caused serious controversy for many years and now, the discussion has been brought up again, this time highlighting the tremendous number of tokens that the company is in control of. “All the XRP listed is owned by Ripple, thus the total should be the sum of the two numbers. Total XRP owned by Ripple: 48,306,585,931.” Pointed out one X user. This suggests that the company is in control of more or less $100 billion worth of tokens that it’s using to fund operations and sells a portion of them every month. Chipping on the matter was the Ripple CTO, David Schwartz, who said: “This would be correct if you don’t think the XRPL escrow feature is actually escrow. Funds in an escrow are not held by the party who put them into escrow.” A senior software engineer, Mayuka Vadari, also chipped in on the matter, saying: “Technically (and legally), the escrow funds are temporarily being held by the network, not Ripple. Yes, those funds will ultimately go back to Ripple, but for the time being, there’s nothing Ripple can do to access those funds (or do anything with them) before the unlock time.” If it sounds like a technicality to you, that’s probably because it is. As the saying goes “if it walks like a duck…” you know the rest. Ripple Labs is indeed going to receive these tokens as per the Escrow conditions, as it has been over the past many years now.

The tour kicks off in Hyderabad on 28th June and will culminate in Bengaluru on 30th November, with the flagship event, Metamorphosis 2025, set to take place in New Delhi on 27-28 September. Through this strategic collaboration, Bybit reinforces its long-term commitment to the Indian blockchain ecosystem by supporting the country’s most significant grassroots crypto outreach campaigns. Designed to bring together policymakers, investors, founders, developers, and blockchain enthusiasts, the India Blockchain Tour 2025 serves as a nationwide platform to showcase local innovation and foster a deeper connection between India’s Web3 talent and global projects. Speaking on the partnership, Vikas Gupta, Head of India at Bybit, said, “India is one of the most dynamic landscapes for blockchain innovation. By partnering with the IBT, we reaffirm our long-term commitment to empowering India’s crypto community through education and builder support.” Each IBT stop, spanning across Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Goa, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, and the two-day summit in New Delhi, is designed to deliver high-impact engagements that reflect India’s growing relevance in the global blockchain narrative. Fireside chats with global exchange leaders and blockchain founders, policy panels with lawmakers and regulators shaping India’s digital asset framework, builder-focused workshops, and startup showcases will form the core of the experience. With immersive brand activations conducted in five Indian Languages, the tour is structured to resonate across geographies and cultures, expanding the conversation well beyond Tier-1 cities. As part of the tour, Vikas Gupta will share his insights on the topic: ""From FOMO to Fundamentals: Fixing India's Crypto Literacy Gap"". In this session, he will explore the disconnect between India’s high crypto adoption and low financial and crypto literacy. He will also highlight Bybit’s key initiatives in bridging this gap, including Bybit Learn, community engagement, and university collaborations with blockchain societies at IIT Delhi and IIT Kharagpur, with more institutional partnerships to follow. One of the most anticipated aspects of IBT 2025 is the relocation of Metamorphosis, Octaloop’s flagship Web3 summit, after three consecutive editions in Bengaluru; it will be held in New Delhi, promising a platform that blends the energy of grassroots communities with the influence of national policymaking. In addition to its community-building efforts, Bybit recently completed its registration with the Financial Intelligence Unit - India (FIU-IND). As part of this process, Bybit reaffirms its commitment to operating transparently and in accordance with Indian regulations. This milestone further solidifies Bybit’s readiness to play a constructive, long-term role in India’s digital asset ecosystem.

33767162,[object Object],1751011243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,‘An Opening For India’: BJP’s National Spokesperson Calls For Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Pilot,https://bitcoinist.com/an-opening-for-india-bjps-national-spokesperson-calls-for-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-pilot/,"The national spokesperson for India’s ruling party has suggested that the country should explore a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve pilot and proactively work on a regulatory framework for crypto assets to lead the growing industry and strengthen its economy. Politician Pushes For Bitcoin Reserve Pilot On Thursday, Pradeep Bhandari, the national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), urged the Indian government to explore a Bitcoin strategy to strengthen the country’s economy and project innovation. In an article for India Today, Bhandari praised the US efforts to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, exploring budget-neutral options to expand its holdings without using taxpayers’ money. He highlighted the US states’ race to pass crypto legislation and establish reserves. Notably, three states have already passed bills that allow the creation of a BTC reserve, with some, such as Texas, enabling the use of public funds to purchase and hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Similarly, Arizona recently passed a bill that updated the state’s unclaimed property laws to include Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, technically creating Arizona’s first crypto reserve. He also noted Bhutan’s crypto strategy, mining BTC using hydropower since 2021, offering a regional perspective. Notably, the South Asian country amassed a $1 billion Bitcoin reserve by May 2025. BJP’s national spokesperson considers that the US shift and Bhutan’s strategy invite reflection about how BTC, thoughtfully integrated, could enhance India’s economic toolkit. “For India, observing this offers a lens to assess whether Bitcoin could diversify our reserves, complementing traditional holdings in an uncertain global economy,” the article reads. Meanwhile, he suggested that the country, with its renewable energy capacity, could adapt Bhutan’s successful model, which shows that “digital assets can stabilise economies, a point worth considering.” Crypto Regulatory Reform: A Must According to Bhandari, these measures “reflect a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential to bolster fiscal resilience and serve as a hedge in uncertain economic conditions,” adding that these efforts aren’t a “reckless pivot,” but a “calculated step” toward embracing the legitimacy of digital assets. Therefore, India stands at “a pivotal juncture,” having the opportunity to lead global markets with a “measured Bitcoin strategy,” like a reserve pilot, to “strengthen economic resilience and project modernity.” Nonetheless, he explained that regulation in the country remains pivotal as India’s crypto policy needs clarity to unlock the industry’s potential. Notably, authorities tax crypto assets, but the sector remains highly unregulated. BJP’s national spokesperson pointed out that in 2023, India chaired a crypto working group with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to shape global standards. However, he considers it necessary to “race ahead” like the US and other jurisdictions, instead of pausing for consensus. Clear regulation could bring both transparency and the required oversight to this emerging asset class—enabling responsible innovation while protecting a rising investor class. He concluded that regulation is essential for “fostering institutional confidence and building a framework where Bitcoin can play a meaningful role in India’s macroeconomic strategy.”",Crypto News|Bhutan Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|Bitcoin reserve|Bitcoin Strategy|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto regulation|India crypto regulation|Indian politician|Startegic Bitcoin Reserve,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-27 08:00:43

The investment was confirmed in a joint statement by Aqua 1 and World Liberty Financial, highlighting the collaboration as a step towards developing a blockchain financial ecosystem and integrating stablecoins. World Liberty Financial Partners With Aqua 1 Zak Folkman, co-founder of World Liberty Financial, expressed enthusiasm about the partnership, stating, “We’re excited to work hand-in-hand with the team at Aqua 1.” This investment positions Aqua 1 among the largest stakeholders in the Trump family’s cryptocurrency project. It is further strengthened by the backing of crypto billionaire Justin Sun, who is the top investor in the company with a substantial $75 million stake. Related Reading: XRP Gears Up For Major Move — Chart Signals Are Clear This marks the second investment from a UAE-based firm in World Liberty Financial within a short span; earlier this year, Abu Dhabi’s MGX used World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin to facilitate a $2 billion investment in Binance. David Lee, a founding partner at Aqua 1, stated that Aqua 1 and the decentralized platform will collaborate to “identify and nurture promising blockchain projects.” World Liberty Financial also plans to support the Aqua Fund, an investment vehicle focused on enhancing the digital economy in the Middle East. In addition, Aqua 1 will aid World Liberty Financial in expanding its reach into South America, Europe, Asia, and emerging markets. Both companies are also set to develop “BlockRock,” a platform aimed at tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) to bridge traditional investments like real estate with the Web3 ecosystem. New App Launch Planned In tandem with these initiatives, World Liberty Financial is preparing to release an audit report of its stablecoin, USD1, within days. Folkman, speaking at the Permissionless conference in Brooklyn, New York, also mentioned that the platform’s WLFI token may soon become tradable. Launched two months prior to the US presidential election, WLFI has already generated substantial revenue for Trump’s family business through the sale of governance tokens. These tokens grant holders the ability to vote on project changes and influence its strategic direction. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In?

To further facilitate user engagement, Folkman announced the upcoming launch of a new app designed to simplify cryptocurrency use for everyday investors.

Bitcoin is now valued at $2.128 trillion, beating Google at only $2.075 trillion, and ranking just below Gold, Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon. BTC’s growing adoption has contributed to the rise in its market cap Bitcoin saw its market cap rise following the massive institutional adoption after the launch of spot ETFs . The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s ETF approval triggered significant capital inflows from institutional players worldwide. As of June 9, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest BTC exchange-traded fund on the market, had pulled in over $70 billion in t otal assets, growing more quickly than any other ETF. Fidelity’s FBTC ranked second with $20 billion, and Grayscale’s GBTC came in third with just under $20 billion. President Donald Trump’s support for Bitcoin has propelled the asset’s status and driven adoption. During his campaign days, he hinted at a Bitcoin reserve, which he signed an executive order on when he assumed office. He also signed an executive order to establish a digital asset stockpile. Analysts now believe BTC could easily surpass $200,000 in the next few years. If this growth trend continues, Bitcoin could approach—or even overtake—Microsoft and Nvidia, and become the largest asset of all time, especially if the US maintains a pro-Bitcoin approach. In the Bitcoin Magazine podcast in April, Zach Shapiro, the head of policy for the Bitcoin-focused BPI think tank, argued that a US government purchase of 1 million BTC would significantly affect the asset’s price. He said, “If the United States announces that we are buying a million Bitcoins, that’s just a global seismic shock. I think first, Bitcoin price goes through the roof. I think we’d probably go very quickly to something like a million dollars per Bitcoin.” BPI executive director Matthew Hines also claimed that other countries are watching closely to see how the US approaches Bitcoin before shaping their policies. Hines added that the Trump administration’s desire to make the US the BTC superpower will hinge on how much Bitcoin they’ll hold. The UK’s CMA is investigating Alphabet, focusing on Google’s search and ad services Alphabet is grappling with increased regulatory scrutiny, antitrust probes, and a dip in its digital ad earnings. The company is also dealing with fierce competition from its AI-focused rivals, threatening to upend the dominance of AI-driven ad tools like Performance Max and its generative search summaries. Google is still under antitrust investigations in the UK and the EU. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is currently reviewing Google’s search and advertising services under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 to determine whether the company should be granted Strategic Market Status (SMS). The CMA’s roadmap includes early priorities such as requiring choice screens for users to access various search providers, ensuring fair ranking principles for businesses, enhancing publishers’ content transparency, and enabling consumer data portability to foster innovation. Meanwhile, the European Union is also looking into AI overviews under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), claiming they favor Google-owned content and divert traffic from third-party websites. According to an Ahrefs study, AI overviews caused nearly a 35% dip in organic website clicks, possibly lowering publishers’ ad revenue. If the EU finds fault with AI overviews and Google, the tech giant could be penalized and obliged to pay fines.

Since April 1, the market leader has climbed 30.2 % , buoyed by a 14.2 % gain in April, an 11.1 % jump in May, and a further 2.6 % rise so far in June. The rally carried price from $104,544 at the start of the month to about $107,370 today, briefly tagging new cycle highs near $107 K. Period Price Change April 2025 +14.2 % May 2025 +11.1 % June-to-date +2.6 % Q2-to-date +30.2 % Crypto Market Today Spot price drifts into Thursday night. A slow slide toward $102 K would hint that option sellers are steering the market. Liquidity at $105 K. A gap in buy orders below that level raises the odds of a swift downdraft. Post-expiry snap-back. Once $15 B in hedges disappear, a sudden volatility spike up or down is common. Friday’s $15 B Options Expiry According to Deribit’s Chief Commercial Officer Jean-David Pequignot , one of the year’s biggest expiries hits the tape this Friday. Roughly $15.2 B in BTC options 38 % of the entire $40 B open interest, will settle at once. The “max-pain” level, where the highest number of contracts expire worthless, sits at $102,000 . Prices often drift toward this magnet because market makers who sell options profit most if Bitcoin lands there at expiry. Sentiment and Volatility Tell a Mixed Story Options data still leans cautiously bullish: Put/Call ratio: 0.73 , meaning there are 73 puts for every 100 calls—more calls signal an upside tilt. Implied volatility: down sharply from 50 % to 38 % , suggesting traders expect smaller price swings in the near term. Yet those expectations can change quickly when billions in contracts roll off. $105 K: The Line in the Sand Technical traders are laser-focused on $105,000 . It has acted as first-line support throughout June: Hold above $105 K: Bulls retain control; a post-expiry relief rally toward $110 K or higher stays on the table. Break below $105 K: Sentiment could flip in a hurry, with price gravitating toward the $102 K max-pain zone and triggering a cascade of stop-loss orders. Bottom Line Bitcoin’s 30 % quarter has impressed even hardened bulls, but the real test comes with Friday’s mega-expiry. Stay alert, whether BTC defends $105 K or succumbs to max-pain gravity will likely set the tone for the rest of the summer.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-27 08:06:20

The ₹2,000 crore WazirX hack shook the ecosystem, but the silence from its founder, Nischal Shetty, has been louder than any response. Now, a fresh twist has reignited public outrage, a secretive transfer of ownership rights after the breach. But king of fraud @NischalShetty is still out of your reach how? He ruined millions of families and no action from you.. #WazirScam more 10,000cr https://t.co/YzeX7nllWS — Justice for WazirX Users (@WazirXUsers) June 26, 2025 The Quiet Exit No One Saw Coming New revelations show that on August 13, 2024, just weeks after the massive hack, Nischal Shetty transferred 100% ownership of Shinjuku FZC LLC, a WazirX-linked company registered in the UAE, to his wife, Moujhari Guha. There were no public announcements, no user updates, and no word to regulators. Shetty reduced his stake to 0.00%, all while users were still grappling with the loss of their funds. The transfer was quietly filed and published in The Gulf Time on August 14, just a day after the ownership change. This move happened at the very moment users were desperate for leadership, answers, and reassurance, and instead, their founder was signing off and walking away. Singapore Court Exposes More Lies Adding fuel to the fire, a Singapore court has now confirmed that Zettai Pte. Ltd., WazirX’s Singapore arm, was indeed holding user assets, contradicting WazirX’s long-standing claim that it never had custody. Justice Kristy Tan’s ruling stated that the platform misled users and deliberately delayed transparency during the crisis. While Users Wait, Nischal Moves On As user funds remain locked with no resolution in sight, Nischal Shetty is living in Dubai, untouched by investigation, and actively working on his new venture, Shardeum. Launched in April, Shardeum promised low gas fees and scalable smart contracts but has since crashed nearly 77% from its peak, triggering fresh backlash. Despite collaborating with MEXC and promoting a “SHM Party” campaign, he has offered no accountability for the WazirX mess. With no answers, no refunds, and no justice, the community’s patience is wearing thin because every new detail only confirms that those responsible have already moved on.",News|Hack,EN,0,0,ASIA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-27 08:19:19

But after that high, COMP started to trend downward. By late May 2025, the token was trading around $40. The price then climbed to about $60.7 by June 10, before pulling back again to around $45.84 as of June 27. So where does COMP go from here? Is Compound a good investment? Let’s take a closer look at our Compound price prediction. Table of Contents What is Compound? Compound crypto price prediction: general outlook Compound price prediction 2025 Compound price prediction 2030 What is Compound? Compound is a DeFi protocol that enables users to lend and borrow cryptocurrency without intermediaries, using smart contracts. Lenders supply assets to liquidity pools and earn interest, while borrowers take out loans by putting up collateral. The protocol’s native token, Compound ( COMP ), serves as a governance token. Holders use it to vote on decisions like adding new assets or adjusting risk parameters. COMP is also distributed to users as an incentive for participation. While COMP’s price has seen big swings since late 2024, Compound remains one of the most established DeFi projects out there. And with COMP playing a key role in governance and protocol upgrades, it’s still very much on investors’ radar. What will the Compound coin price prediction be for the near future and beyond? Compound crypto price prediction: general outlook Over the past month (late May to June 2025), COMP gained almost 10.3% — not bad. But in the past week, it gave nearly all of that back, dropping about 8%. And the slide hasn’t stopped yet: in the last 24 hours alone, it’s down another 3.5%. As we mentioned earlier, COMP is currently trading at around $45.84 (as of June 27). For some perspective, its all-time high was a massive $911.20 back in May 2021 — meaning the token’s lost roughly 95% of its value since then. COMP 1-day price chart, June 2025 | Source: crypto.news So, what’s going on with COMP’s price? Like a lot of governance tokens, it’s having a hard time holding long-term demand beyond just voting rights. Fewer new users are joining the platform, and DeFi overall still isn’t back to its 2021 peak — so there’s just not much fresh momentum. At the same time, newer lending protocols are offering more efficient alternatives, making it tougher for Compound to stand out. Still, it’s one of the OGs in DeFi, and this recent volatility might be more about short-term trading than anything deeper. Whether COMP levels out or keeps sliding will likely depend on the broader market — and if DeFi actually picks up again in the second half of 2025. You might also like: Compound launches Morpho-powered vaults on Polygon What exactly can we expect from COMP in the future? Let’s turn to the Compound price prediction. Compound price prediction 2025 According to CoinCodex’s Compound price forecast, COMP might see a small surge soon — they’re expecting it to rise over 8.5% and possibly hit $51.29 by July 24. For the rest of the year, they predict the token could trade anywhere between $45.81 and $101.69. As of June 25, the overall Compound price prediction from CoinCodex leans bearish: 17 technical indicators point to a downtrend, while 16 still show some bullish momentum. DigitalCoinPrice has a much more optimistic take — their COMP price prediction for 2025 puts the token between $90.87 and $101.19. Wallet Investor is more cautious. They expect an average price of around $27.9 by the end of 2025, but say COMP could still hit a high of $112.30 under the right conditions. How high will the price of Compound go in 2030? Compound price prediction 2030 By 2030, CoinCodex’s expectations have COMP trading between $63.25 and $106.19. Wallet Investor predicts a much wider range — from almost zero ($0.000001) up to $1066.50 by June 2030. DigitalCoinPrice’s projections for COMP seem more realistic than Wallet Investor’s, estimating COMP could trade between $218.32 and $250.27 by the end of the decade. Should you invest in Compound? COMP is a big name in DeFi, but its price has been all over the place. Some predictions say it could go up, others aren’t so sure. If you’re bullish on DeFi and like what Compound’s doing, it might be worth a shot — just be ready for some bumps along the way and don’t invest more than you can lose.

While meme-fueled assets like Pepe (PEPE) continue to capture speculative interest, the real excitement is brewing around a fast-rising newcomer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is selling at $0.03. The investor interest remains very strong, and the token has been purchased by more than 12,500 investors with a raise of $11.2 million.

For those wondering what to buy before June ends or looking for top cryptocurrencies to hold into the next rally, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a dark horse with real upside potential. If early indicators hold, Mutuum Finance could be the next big crypto story of the bull market, and few are positioned this early. Pepe Coin (PEPE) Consolidates Amid Meme-Coin Season Currently, the current trading of Pepe Coin (PEPE) chart is within the small figures of the price, being around the $0.000009. However, the latest volatility of meme-coins forces the coin to have a cooldown. There is an increased trade in the last 1 day or so but the price is not jumping implying accumulation and not break out. Even though open interest has indicated constructive momentum potential, the token direction has been dictated to by high circulating supply and meme-coin behavior. Investors are following newer projects and their functionality since PEPE is concentrating due to the fall of the central bank. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gathering traction and is earning a reputation because of its DeFi functionality. Presale Heats Up: Mutuum Finance Moves to Phase 5 at $0.03 per Token Mutuum Finance is already creating a stir in the DeFi space, and its presale is ongoing in Phase 5, with tokens priced at only $0.03.

Over $11.2 million has been raised, and over 12,500 investors are registered or waiting to join. As soon as the presale reaches Phase 6, the token price will increase to $0.035, giving any stage 5 buyer an immediate 16.67% return. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live To commemorate its early traction and to give back to the community Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also organizing a huge $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners from the early investors will be chosen to win $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens each.

Banana For Scale price prediction 2025 According to CoinCodex’s Banana For Scale price forecast, the memecoin might face a short-term pullback, with a projected drop of around 21.51%, potentially falling to $0.0126 by July 25. The site expects BANANA to trade between $0.0117 and $0.04 over the rest of the year — and in the best-case scenario, it could even surpass its recent all-time high. As of June 26, the overall BANANA price prediction still leans bullish. Out of 24 technical indicators tracked by CoinCodex, 19 are flashing bullish signals, while only 5 suggest bearish momentum. Wallet Investor offers a more conservative Banana For Scale price prediction for 2025, estimating an average price of around $0.0092 by year-end. Their forecast ranges from a low of $0.007 to a potential high of $0.0112. Will Banana For Scale go up or down in 2030? Banana For Scale price prediction 2030 According to CoinCodex’s expectations, BANANA could be trading anywhere between $0.0208 and $0.065 by 2030. Wallet Investor’s projections for BANANA are far more cautious. They estimate the meme token might trade between $0.0182 and $0.0228 by late June 2030. Should you invest in Banana For Scale? If you’re into memes, community-driven tokens, and a bit of chaos — BANANAS31 might be right up your alley. It’s got strong meme energy, a growing fanbase, and a few viral moments already under its belt. But like any memecoin, it’s a wild ride: prices can soar on hype and drop just as fast. So, if you decide to get involved, think of it as a high-risk, high-volatility investment — and only put in what you’re fully prepared to lose.

On June 26, Genius Group, a Singapore-based AI-driven education company listed on the NYSE American, announced a new distribution plan that would see proceeds from its ongoing legal cases split equally between shareholder dividends and Bitcoin ( BTC ) purchases for its corporate treasury. The company is currently pursuing two major lawsuits seeking over $1 billion in damages. The first, already filed in the Southern District of Florida under the RICO Act, demands over $750 million in damages tied to alleged misconduct by former partners and executives. The second, expected to be filed soon, targets alleged naked short selling and spoofing, with preliminary damages estimated above $260 million — figures expected to rise with updated 2024–2025 trading data. If successful, 50% of any net legal recoveries — after fees and taxes—will be issued to shareholders as a special dividend. The remaining 50% will be used to purchase Bitcoin for the company’s treasury.

The announcement follows Genius Group’s recent expansion of its BTC holdings, with the company boosting its treasury by 52% over the past month after a U.S. court had lifted a previous ban on crypto purchases . Specifically, the company added 34 BTC to its corporate treasury, increasing its total holdings to 100 BTC. The acquisitions were made at an average price of $100,600 per Bitcoin, totaling roughly $10.06 million in investment. With the ban lifted, the CEO reiterated its 1,000 BTC target.

As more companies plan to boost their Bitcoin holdings, Bitcoin Pepe , an early-stage project, is building momentum. Lawsuit winnings The board of directors of Genius Group has approved a plan to use any potential winnings from two legal cases—one filed and one pending—to either directly benefit shareholders or reinvest in the company. The combined value of damages sought exceeds $1 billion. One of the lawsuits, filed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), targets LZGI International with a claim of over $750 million. A second lawsuit, which Genius Group CEO Roger Hamilton says is forthcoming, is expected to seek at least $262 million based on 2023 data, with the final amount likely to increase as damages from 2024 and 2025 are included. Hamilton emphasized that the goal of both lawsuits is to recover losses incurred by shareholders. He added that the board believes 100% of any proceeds should be distributed to or reinvested for the benefit of shareholders. On Friday, Bitcoin was trading at $106,868.66, down 0.47% in the last 24 hours as traders continued to book profits after a strong spell. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by marketcap is down 5% from its all time high in May. Bitcoin treasury expansion Under the proposed plan, 50% of any winnings will be paid out as a special dividend to shareholders, while the remaining 50% will be used to expand the company’s Bitcoin treasury. If both lawsuits are successful, Genius Group expects to issue a $7 per share dividend and acquire 5,000 BTC based on the current market price of approximately $107,000 per Bitcoin. The company noted, however, that there is no guarantee of a favorable outcome or resulting payouts. On June 17, Genius Group increased its Bitcoin holdings by over 50% through a series of acquisitions, aiming to eventually hold 1,000 BTC in its corporate treasury. The company had previously been under a temporary restriction that barred it from selling shares, raising funds, or using investor money to purchase Bitcoin. That restriction was lifted after one month. Bitcoin Pepe gains traction with infrastructure-driven approach Genius Group’s plans to buy more Bitcoin to make a treasury of the crypto asset are the latest move among many companies’ actions regarding Bitcoin. Recently, Panther Metals unveiled plans to acquire £4 million (approximately $5.4 million) worth of Bitcoin. Michael Saylor’s Strategy and MetaPlanet also increased their Bitcoin holdings recently. Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself within this evolving landscape. Unlike meme tokens that depend primarily on hype, the project aims to integrate viral appeal with infrastructure development. Functioning as a Layer 2 solution, Bitcoin Pepe leverages Bitcoin’s base-layer security while aiming to deliver the scalability seen in platforms like Solana. This combination sets it apart from many other meme-based cryptocurrencies. The project’s infrastructure-first strategy appears to be resonating with investors, as evidenced by a presale that has already raised over $15.9 million. Confirmed exchange listings on MEXC and BitMart have contributed to the project’s momentum. A listing announcement is scheduled for June 30, further boosting interest as the presale continues.

This bold move, pulling tokens from exchanges like OKX and Bybit, hints at strategic accumulation. Yet, while PEPE teeters near a critical support level that once fueled a 112% surge, its bearish technicals raise doubts. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing investor focus with its presale soaring past $11.2 million and over 570 million tokens sold to 12,500 holders. With a robust DeFi lending model, is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the smarter pick for investors eyeing the best crypto to buy now? Let’s explore. Pepe’s whale surge and shaky ground Cumberland’s massive PEPE haul, including 247.83 billion tokens from OKX and 138.6 billion from Bybit, signals confidence. Smaller outflows to FalconX suggest liquidity shuffling, not dumping, calming fears of sell-offs. PEPE’s price, however, hovers near $0.0000087, close to a pivotal $0.00000761 support that sparked a 112% rally in May 2025. Technicals paint a gloomier picture. The MACD’s bearish crossover, with the line at -0.00000041 dipping below -0.00000038, flags fading momentum. Liquidation zones between $0.00000867 and $0.0000093 warn of volatility. A break above $0.0000093 could ignite a short squeeze, but a drop below $0.0000082 risks further slides. Consequently, PEPE’s path remains uncertain, urging caution for those chasing crypto predictions. Mutuum Finance’s presale powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is charging through Phase 5 of its 11-phase presale, with tokens priced at $0.03—a 200% jump from Phase 1’s $0.01. Over 50% filled, Phase 5’s window for snagging tokens at this rate is narrowing fast. Phase 6 will hike prices 16.7% to $0.035, and the launch price of $0.06 guarantees a 100% ROI for current buyers. Having raised $11.2 million and attracted 12,500 holders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) showcases fierce demand. Analysts project a post-launch climb to $2.50 in 2025, a staggering 8,233% gain from today’s price. Moreover, a recent Certik audit, scoring 95.00 with zero vulnerabilities, bolsters trust in its secure DeFi framework. Innovative lending and stablecoin vision Mutuum Finance (MUTM) blends peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending, offering flexibility unmatched by centralized platforms. Smart contracts drive dynamic interest rates, ensuring stability. On the other hand, peer-to-peer options allow tailored terms for volatile assets. A forthcoming USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum promises resilience against depegging. This fact enhances liquidity for lending and staking. The team’s Layer 2 scaling plan aims to slash gas fees and boost transaction speed, priming Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for mass adoption. Furthermore, a new dashboard tracks the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for loyalty, adding incentive to join early. Giveaways and community buzz Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is amplifying excitement with a $100,000 giveaway , splitting $10,000 in MUTM tokens among 10 winners. Entry requires a $50 presale investment and completing simple quests, like submitting a wallet address. In contrast, PEPE’s speculative nature lacks such tangible utility. Thus, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a standout in crypto investment circles. As crypto prices fluctuate, Mutuum Finance’s structured growth and audited security offer a compelling case for investors seeking stability and upside. Weighing the best crypto to buy now PEPE’s whale-driven buzz and potential 112% rally captivate traders, but its technical risks loom large. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, blends innovation with proven demand, raising $11.2 million and securing 12,500 holders. Its presale, now at $0.03, promises a 100% ROI at launch and a projected $2.50 post-launch surge. With a Certik-audited lending model, stablecoin plans, and a $100,000 giveaway, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) outshines PEPE’s volatility.

This geopolitical breakthrough, dubbed “The 12 Day War,” has fueled optimism in the crypto market, with XRP reaping immediate gains. The ceasefire, effective six hours after Trump’s Truth Social post, sees Israel joining twelve hours later. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi project, is gaining traction in its presale phase 5, offering investors a chance at 100% returns. Can XRP hit $5 before Mutuum Finance (MUTM) steals the spotlight? XRP’s surge on global stability XRP’s price climb follows Trump’s ceasefire announcement, signaling reduced global tensions. The token’s 6% jump reflects growing investor confidence in crypto prices today. Institutional interest is evident, with firms like Webus International ($300M), Trident Technologies ($500M), and VivoPower ($121M) pouring funds into XRP-focused treasuries. Canada’s launch of three XRP spot ETFs last week further boosts demand. However, exchange reserves dropped 21% to $2.3 billion, hinting at potential sell-side pressure. Despite this, XRP’s fundamentals remain robust, tied to its role in the XRP Ledger and DeFi. Can it sustain momentum to reach $5? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a compelling alternative. Consequently, let’s examine this emerging DeFi player. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale gains momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing through phase 5 of its 11-phase presale, with tokens priced at $0.03.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also developing a USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum, reducing depegging risks. Analysts predict a post-launch price of $3, offering a 10,000% ROI from the current $0.03. In addition, its Layer 2 strategy promises lower gas fees and scalability. XRP vs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in the crypto market XRP’s recent gains highlight its strength in crypto investing, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers unique utility. While XRP thrives on institutional backing and ETF interest, its exchange reserve drop raises concerns about sustainability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, provides a non-custodial platform with tangible use cases in lending and staking. Its stablecoin and Layer 2 plans position it for long-term growth. The crypto market is favoring projects with real-world applications, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fits this mold. XRP may struggle to hit $5 if sell-side pressure persists, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale momentum suggests it could outpace Ripple. Investors are eyeing crypto predictions closely. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale success, with $11,200,000 raised, reflects strong investor trust.

Just as blockchain technology is reshaping finance and digital ownership, AI is fundamentally transforming creative industries, particularly music. For those keenly observing the intersection of technology and market dynamics, the latest news from Suno, a prominent AI music company, offers a fascinating case study. Amidst swirling legal challenges, Suno has made a decisive move, acquiring WavTool, a cutting-edge browser-based AI digital audio workstation (DAW). This strategic maneuver is not merely about expanding features; it signals a determined push towards enhancing creative capabilities and solidifying market position, even as the company navigates complex music copyright disputes. Suno Acquisition : A Strategic Play in AI Music The recent Suno acquisition of WavTool, announced on a Thursday that also saw new legal action against the company, is a clear statement of intent. Suno, already a significant player in the generative AI music space, is signaling its commitment to growth and user empowerment despite external pressures. WavTool, launched in 2023, brought a suite of impressive tools to the table, including stem separation, AI audio generation, and an AI music assistant. By integrating WavTool’s technology into its newly launched editing interface, Suno aims to significantly improve the editing capabilities available to songwriters and producers using its platform. While the financial terms of the deal remain undisclosed, a company spokesperson confirmed that ‘most’ WavTool employees have transitioned to Suno’s product and engineering teams. This influx of talent suggests a deep integration of WavTool’s expertise and technology into Suno’s core operations. The acquisition, which reportedly took place a few months prior with WavTool going offline in November, was strategically announced this week. This timing appears intentional, possibly aimed at diverting attention from the ongoing legal battles and reassuring investors about the company’s long-term vision and commitment to innovation. Legal disputes can often shake investor confidence, making such a positive development crucial for maintaining momentum after securing a substantial $125 million in funding this past May. This move positions Suno not just as an AI music generator, but as a more comprehensive platform for music creation and editing. In a competitive landscape where other AI music startups are also vying for market share, offering robust editing tools can be a significant differentiator. It moves Suno beyond mere generation into the realm of practical, hands-on production, catering to the needs of professional musicians and hobbyists alike. Unpacking WavTool ‘s Innovative AI Audio Tools The true value of this acquisition lies in the advanced capabilities that WavTool brings to Suno’s ecosystem. As a browser-based AI digital audio workstation, WavTool has been at the forefront of integrating artificial intelligence into the music production workflow. Its key features are designed to streamline the creative process and open new avenues for musical expression: Stem Separation: This powerful feature allows users to separate individual instruments or vocal tracks from a complete audio file. Imagine having a finished song and being able to isolate the drums, bass, vocals, or guitar with precision. This is invaluable for remixing, sampling, learning from existing tracks, or even cleaning up mixes. For producers, it offers unprecedented flexibility in manipulating existing audio. AI Audio Generation: Beyond generating entire songs, WavTool’s AI can generate specific audio elements. This could range from unique sound effects, synth patches, drum patterns, or even short melodic phrases. This capability can break creative blocks and provide endless sonic possibilities for musicians looking to experiment or fill gaps in their compositions. AI Music Assistant: This intelligent assistant acts as a co-pilot for musicians. It can offer suggestions for chord progressions, identify key and tempo, help with song structure, or even provide feedback on mixing and mastering. It’s like having an experienced producer or engineer guiding you through the creation process, making advanced music production more accessible to a wider audience. These AI audio tools are not just novelties; they are transformative. They democratize access to sophisticated production techniques that were once the exclusive domain of highly skilled engineers and well-equipped studios. By integrating these features directly into Suno’s platform, the company is empowering a new generation of creators to produce high-quality music with greater ease and efficiency. The Persistent Shadow of Music Copyright Lawsuits While Suno’s acquisition of WavTool points to a future of innovation, the company continues to grapple with significant legal challenges, primarily centered around music copyright . The acquisition announcement came shortly after country musician Tony Justice and his label, 5th Wheel Records, filed a lawsuit against Suno. This new legal action mirrors previous lawsuits filed by major music labels – Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment – last year. The core allegation across all these lawsuits is consistent: Suno allegedly used copyrighted sound recordings without permission to train its AI music generator. This raises fundamental questions about intellectual property in the age of AI. Is the use of copyrighted material for training AI models considered ‘fair use’ or copyright infringement? The legal landscape around AI training data is still nascent and highly contested. Major labels argue that such training constitutes unauthorized reproduction and distribution of their protected works, potentially devaluing their catalogs and harming artists. The implications of these lawsuits are far-reaching, not just for Suno but for the entire generative AI industry. A ruling against Suno could set a precedent that severely restricts how AI models are trained, potentially stifling innovation. Conversely, a favorable outcome for Suno could pave the way for new models of content creation and licensing. According to Bloomberg, major music labels are already engaged in licensing talks with Suno, suggesting a potential path towards resolution through commercial agreements rather than protracted legal battles. This could lead to a new paradigm where AI companies license content for training, ensuring fair compensation for creators. The Future of AI Music Creation The convergence of AI and music is not just about automation; it’s about augmentation. The future of AI music creation is likely to be a collaborative one, where human creativity is amplified by intelligent tools. Suno’s move to acquire WavTool underscores this vision, providing artists with more control and flexibility over the AI-generated output. Instead of simply prompting an AI to create a song, musicians can now fine-tune, edit, and manipulate individual elements with precision. Consider the potential scenarios: Democratization of Production: High-quality music production, once requiring expensive equipment and extensive training, becomes more accessible. Independent artists and bedroom producers can achieve professional-sounding results. New Creative Workflows: AI can serve as a brainstorming partner, generating variations of melodies or harmonies, or even suggesting entire song structures. Artists can focus on the artistic direction while the AI handles repetitive or technically complex tasks. Personalized Music Experiences: AI could eventually create dynamic, personalized soundtracks for users based on their mood, activity, or even biometric data, blurring the lines between creation and consumption. Ethical Considerations: As AI music evolves, discussions around attribution, originality, and the definition of ‘authorship’ will become increasingly critical. Transparent licensing models and clear guidelines for AI training data will be essential for fostering a healthy creative ecosystem. The industry is at a crossroads, balancing the immense potential of AI with the need to protect creators’ rights. The outcomes of the ongoing music copyright lawsuits will undoubtedly shape the regulatory framework for this exciting new frontier. Leveraging Advanced AI Audio Tools for Songwriters For songwriters and producers, the integration of advanced AI audio tools like those from WavTool represents a significant leap forward. Imagine a songwriter struggling with a bridge section for a new track. An AI music assistant could suggest several melodic variations or chord progressions based on the song’s existing elements. For a producer, the ability to instantly separate stems from a demo track means quicker feedback and more efficient iteration during the mixing process. These tools are designed to remove technical barriers and allow artists to focus more on their creative vision. They can accelerate the songwriting process, provide fresh inspiration, and even assist with the often-tedious tasks of mixing and mastering. This efficiency can lead to more music being created, higher quality productions, and ultimately, a more vibrant and diverse musical landscape. The emphasis shifts from the technical burden of production to the artistic merit of the composition and performance. Furthermore, these browser-based solutions mean that artists no longer need powerful, expensive computers or specialized software. Access to professional-grade tools becomes universal, fostering innovation from anywhere with an internet connection. This aligns with the broader trend of cloud-based solutions and accessibility that has also driven innovation in areas like decentralized finance and digital assets, where access to complex financial tools is democratized.

CoinCodex projects that the POKT token can trade in the price channel of $0.027149 and $0.038858. While the general sentiment in the financial markets is that 2025 will be the year of the bull, it is important to understand that this prediction also has a chance of being wrong. BTC has already breached the $100k mark and there is a possibility that it may be at the top of this bull cycle.

Before trusting any source that is trying to predict the POKT Network price prediction for 2030, you should understand that it is a cryptocurrency and, like all other tokens, the POKT token’s price can be highly volatile. This means that no one knows if this token can survive the next five years, as there have been many instances where crypto tokens have lost their entire value, while some are clear cases of rug pull. You should also note that crypto tokens experience higher volatility than other financial markets, and this can cause big price fluctuations in its price. You might also like: Ankr Protocol Joins Forces with Pocket Network to Develop Decentralized Web3 Infrastructure Is Pokt Network a good investment? Before investing in any cryptocurrency, including POKT, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a token that was once considered the future may also be delisted from major exchanges. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals before having any price expectations for the future of the POKT token. Will Pokt Network go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the POKT token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns in general. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for Pokt Network price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious, as no one can accurately predict how high or low POKT can go. Should I invest in Pokt Network? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any Pokt Network price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment, and their success not only relies on market volatility but also the constant and sustainable growth of their community. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals, which may very well decide the future of the POKT token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Per local reports , the National Assembly’s Finance Committee, approved by the full House, proposed five government agencies to jointly supervise virtual asset service providers (VASPs), in a move to regulate the industry. The multi-agency group framework proposed by the government includes the Central Bank of Kenya, Capital Markets Authority, Competition Authority of Kenya, Communications Authority of Kenya, and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. A social enterprise organisation, Credence Africa, proposed the plan, which the Committee endorsed to create a cross-sectoral regulatory unit. Besides overseeing VASPs’ operations, the proposal will cover market conduct, data and protection, and digital communications infrastructure. “The committee agreed with the proposal by the stakeholder (Credence Africa),” the Finance Committee report said. It has opened doors for public comments on the proposal. The joint unit could also include any other institution designated by the Cabinet Secretary through a gazette notice. Committee Adopts Virtual Assets Chamber’s Recommendation The Virtual Assets Chamber (VAC), Kenya’s leading policy think tank for blockchain and virtual assets, has recommended deleting a clause in the legislation – Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill, 2025. The VAC said that the provision, which grants the regulatory authority to conduct off-site surveillance, was “overly prescriptive.” It has no clear definition or boundaries on what off-site surveillance involves, it added. The Financial Commission noted that it abides by the VAC’s recommendation. The Bill has received strong backing from crypto players after it was introduced to Parliament on April 4, 2025. From Challenges to Transformation In Kenya, the VASPs have been facing challenges for several years in accessing banking services. The Central Bank issued an advisory that cautioned financial institutions against dealing with crypto-related businesses. However, the Kenyan virtual asset landscape is on the cusp of a significant transformation with the introduction of the Bill. The proposal will require all crypto providers to open and maintain a bank account within Kenya, addressing transparency and accountability. The Bill, if passed, would make Kenya the third among African nations, after Nigeria and South Africa, to have a crypto-specific law.

For those tracking the pulse of innovation, especially in areas that intersect with decentralized technologies and future-proof solutions, Meta’s latest move signals a significant shift. The tech giant has made a strategic hire, bringing a highly influential OpenAI researcher into its fold, a move that could reshape the competitive dynamics in the race for advanced AI capabilities. This development is particularly noteworthy for anyone interested in how foundational AI advancements will impact everything from data processing to automated systems, potentially influencing the broader crypto and blockchain ecosystems. Meta AI : A New Era of Superintelligence? Meta, under Mark Zuckerberg’s ambitious vision, is making aggressive strides to establish itself as a leader in artificial intelligence. The company has recently formed a dedicated AI superintelligence unit, signaling its commitment to pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve. This unit is not just a research arm; it’s a strategic initiative designed to develop cutting-edge AI systems, potentially leading to breakthroughs that could redefine human-computer interaction and data analysis. Zuckerberg’s aggressive talent acquisition strategy, reportedly involving compensation packages exceeding $100 million for top researchers, underscores the high stakes in this domain. This commitment to securing top-tier talent highlights Meta’s determination to compete with, and perhaps surpass, other industry giants in the AI race. The Strategic Acquisition of an OpenAI Researcher The core of Meta’s recent strategic move is the hiring of Trapit Bansal, a pivotal figure from OpenAI. Bansal’s departure from OpenAI, confirmed by an OpenAI spokesperson and his LinkedIn profile, marks a significant gain for Meta. His tenure at OpenAI since 2022 saw him play a crucial role in pioneering the company’s work on reinforcement learning, a key area for developing sophisticated AI agents. Notably, Bansal is credited as a foundational researcher on OpenAI’s first AI reasoning model , ‘o1’. His expertise in this critical area makes him an invaluable asset for Meta’s burgeoning AI superintelligence lab. This recruitment is a clear indication that Meta is not just building a team, but assembling a powerhouse of leading minds to tackle some of AI’s most complex challenges. Boosting AI Reasoning Models Development What exactly are AI reasoning models , and why are they so crucial? In essence, these models are designed to go beyond pattern recognition, enabling AI to understand, infer, and make logical deductions, much like human cognition. This capability is vital for developing truly intelligent systems that can solve complex problems, understand nuanced language, and interact with the world in a more sophisticated manner. Meta currently does not publicly offer an AI reasoning model as part of its Llama family of open models. Trapit Bansal’s deep experience in this field, particularly with OpenAI’s ‘o1’ model, positions him to offer a significant lift to Meta’s efforts. His insights and foundational knowledge could accelerate Meta’s development of its own advanced reasoning capabilities, potentially giving its Llama models a competitive edge in complex applications and research. The Race for AI Superintelligence Talent The competition for top AI talent is fierce, and Meta’s recent hiring spree reflects the intense global race for AI superintelligence . The company’s new AI unit is not just about one hire; it’s about assembling a dream team. Alongside Bansal, Meta’s superintelligence lab features other prominent leaders, including former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, and Safe Superintelligence co-founder Daniel Gross. This constellation of talent underscores Meta’s ambition to become a dominant force in AI. The willingness to offer substantial compensation packages, reportedly up to $100 million, highlights the premium placed on individuals who can drive innovation in this field. While the specific terms of Bansal’s deal remain undisclosed, his move is indicative of the significant incentives available to top researchers in the current AI landscape. What Trapit Bansal ‘s Move Means for the Industry Trapit Bansal’s transition from OpenAI to Meta carries significant implications for the broader AI industry. For Meta, it represents a substantial gain in expertise, particularly in reinforcement learning and AI reasoning, areas critical for developing next-generation AI. This strengthens Meta’s position in the competitive AI landscape and could accelerate its path towards building more advanced and capable AI models. For OpenAI, while losing a key researcher is a setback, it also highlights the dynamic nature of talent movement within the AI sector. This ongoing shift of top minds between leading companies signifies the intense competition and rapid evolution of the field. It emphasizes that the race for AI dominance is not just about technological breakthroughs but also about securing and nurturing the human capital that drives them. This is a developing story, and its full impact will unfold as Meta’s AI superintelligence unit progresses. Meta’s strategic acquisition of Trapit Bansal is a powerful statement of intent in the escalating AI arms race. By bringing in a foundational researcher with deep expertise in reinforcement learning and AI reasoning models from a leading competitor like OpenAI, Meta is significantly bolstering its pursuit of AI superintelligence. This move, part of a broader aggressive hiring strategy, positions Meta to potentially accelerate its development of advanced AI capabilities, shaping the future of artificial intelligence and its widespread applications. The impact of such talent shifts underscores the critical role of human expertise in driving technological innovation in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

ETF inflows and renewed DeFi interest is spearheading price action, which also impacts the resurgent Aave. Add Remittix into the mix, and you’ve got a trio pushing substance over sizzle. Let’s break down what’s fuelling each project’s next big move. Ethereum (ETH): ETF Inflows and DeFi Buzz Lift Ethereum Price Prediction The Ethereum price predictions are quietly gathering momentum again, and this time it’s not just market noise. The continued inflows into spot ETH ETFs are giving bulls something to lean on—money’s flowing in, not out. Add to that the rising interest in staking and DeFi platforms, and the broader Ethereum ecosystem is feeling more active than it has in months. That’s why the Ethereum price prediction for July is floating around $2,800, with some analysts eyeing $3,000 by mid-August. It’s not moon talk, but it’s a healthy climb powered by real demand. DeFi protocols are coming back to life, TVL is ticking up, and staking yields continue to look solid, even to the TradFi crowd. With new capital entering and use cases finally looking sticky again, the Ethereum price prediction feels much more believable than some of the wilder targets we’ve seen in past cycles. No wild hype—just steady pressure upward. Source: CoinCodex Aave (AAVE): V3 Growth Sparks New Optimism in DeFi While Ethereum price prediction chatter heats up, Aave’s quietly laying down some serious infrastructure. The spotlight here is Aave v3—a major upgrade that’s finally starting to show its teeth. It brings smarter risk controls, more efficient capital usage, and most importantly, seamless cross-chain functionality across Ethereum, Polygon, and Base. In short, it’s not a facelift, it’s an actual evolution. DeFi’s been slow lately, but Aave’s on-chain growth suggests the patient ones are starting to move. Over $900 million in AAVE is now staked, a clear signal that users aren’t just farming and fleeing—they’re committing. And with v3 live across multiple chains, the flexibility for users and builders alike has never been better. It’s not generating meme-level buzz, but under the surface, Aave is waking up. If the broader DeFi sector catches fire again, v3 gives AAVE a serious leg up. It’s something worth keeping an eye on as the 3-month Aave price prediction has the token up over 90%, and that is something to write home about! Source: CoinCodex Remittix (RTX): The Utility Play in a DeFi Comeback While the Ethereum price prediction and Aave upgrades are sparking DeFi excitement, Remittix is quietly carving out a role that’s refreshingly simple—and surprisingly powerful. It’s not chasing APYs or cross-chain wizardry. It’s focused on something DeFi often forgets: usability. Remittix lets you send crypto and have fiat arrive in a bank account—no wallet setup, no bridging tokens, no mental gymnastics. It supports 30+ fiat currencies, runs on flat fees, and was designed from the ground up for compliance. The Remittix pitch is remarkably simple, but it works—and that’s why nearly $16 million has poured into the presale. As hype rotates back toward fundamentals, Remittix is positioned as the kind of project that wins long-term: boring to the moon. In a sea of DeFi tokens promising to reinvent finance, Remittix just wants to make it easier to use. And in this market, that’s a feature, not a flaw. If the next rally rewards functionality over flash, Remittix may not just ride the wave—it might help shape it. Conclusion The Ethereum price prediction is climbing on real momentum, Aave is evolving with serious upgrades, and Remittix is solving problems most projects ignore. In a market shifting back to fundamentals, these three aren’t riding hype—they’re building something sticky. Even YouTube analysts are starting to take notice. Might be time you did too. Remittix is now available at $0.0781 directly from their website.

Here’s What Dragging Ripple Price Down!,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-is-xrp-price-crashing-heres-what-dragging-ripple-price-down/,"The post Why Is XRP Price Crashing? Here’s What Dragging Ripple Price Down! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The XRP price is under heavy pressure once again, leaving traders and long-term holders on edge. The latest trigger? A fresh twist in the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit. This week, Judge Torres rejected a joint motion to settle penalties over Ripple’s alleged securities violations, throwing a wrench into what many hoped was the final chapter. The ruling rekindled legal uncertainty, spooking investors and sending XRP tumbling below key support levels amid already fragile market sentiment. Ripple’s native token, XRP, has taken a hit, plunging below critical support. While the other cryptos are trying to rise above the bearish trend, the XRP price has started the day’s trade on a bearish note after a bearish close. XRP Ledger Activity Collapsed Not only the legal pressure, but the on-chain metrics are also concerning. The latest data shows a major drop in the trading activity, which could be a result of sluggish behavior of the price, followed by uncertain market conditions and global tensions. According to data from Cryptoquant, the daily active addresses have dropped heavily. The trading activity has surged and marked highs, which has assisted the XRP price to rise above $2 for the first time since the 2018 rally. Since then, the price has remained consolidated above $2 while the active addresses continued to plunge, reaching the lower limits. On the other hand, the daily payments on the XRP ledger have also dropped by nearly 70% this month. In the crypto space, lower network activity means there is less global demand. Whether it’s fewer transfers, fewer DeFi interactions, or less developer interest. So, Is XRP Dead? Will the Price Drop Below $2? After a massive rise in November 2024, the price began to trade within a descending parallel channel. It appeared to be a bull flag, but the pennant is extending, indicating a continuation of a consolidation. Besides, the drop in volume also substantiates the bearish trend, which goes in line with the drop in the on-chain readings. Regardless of the drop in the on-chain readings and the uncertainty around the token, the technicals suggest the token is trying to rise above the bearish influence. It has reached the edge of the descending triangle while the RSI is attempting to rise above the descending trend line. On the other hand, the CMF remains stuck within the positive range and is displaying a bullish divergence. This suggests the XRP price is primed for a recovery, but if it fails to hold above the support zone, a pullback to $1.62 is imminent.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-27 09:52:57

PEPE and WIF are bouncing back fast, beating the performance of big names like Shiba Inu. Still, there’s a quiet shift happening under the radar. A new token called Remittix ($RTX) is catching the attention of smart investors. This article explains what’s happening in the crypto world. If you want to know where the next 100x might come from, keep reading. PEPE and WIF are climbing while others fall behind PEPE and Dogwifhat (WIF) are both rising while most coins remain flat or decline. PEPE is up almost 10% in a day after hitting around $0.00000837. It now trades close to $0.00001. Analysts say this move was pushed by whales buying the dip. Source: CoinMarketCap comparison of PEPE and WIF For instance, big wallets like Cumberland moved $3.45 million worth of PEPE during the drop. Gustavo Maldonado believes PEPE could hit $0.000035 before the year ends. That’s more than double the current price. WIF is also gaining fast, breaking past its key resistance at $0.78 and hitting $0.86. Volume is rising, and traders are seeing a falling wedge pattern on WIF’s chart. Analyst Jonathan Carter thinks WIF could go up to $1.36, which represents a 58% jump. WIF’s price also got a boost from a new partnership. DeFi Development Corp., a Nasdaq-listed firm, will now run a validator node for the WIF community. It will share the rewards with holders. That kind of move is rare for a meme token and shows that people are taking WIF more seriously now. Shiba Inu can’t break out just yet Unlike PEPE and WIF, Shiba Inu is not moving much. SHIB holds just above $0.000011, but traders say it needs to go past $0.000012 to spark any real momentum. SHIB’s price dipped hard after the US bombed Iran, then bounced back with the news of a ceasefire. Source: TradingView Despite a 17% rebound, SHIB is still far below its May high. IntoTheBlock data shows 26.97% of SHIB holders are now in profit. This is better than before, but most are still at a loss. Technicals are mixed. SHIB shows a golden cross, which is good and the MACD also hints at a comeback. SHIB holders are watching closely, but many are now moving into newer projects with better real-world use. One of those tokens is Remittix . Stealth whales’ purchases fuel Remittix as a 100x potential Remittix ($RTX) is a crypto project built for real-world payments. It lets users send crypto straight to bank accounts, with no FX fees and no long wait times. The platform already supports 30+ fiat currencies and over 100 cryptocurrencies. RTX is in presale, currently priced at $0.0811, a 4x surge from its launch value of $0.0185. But analysts say this is just the start. The token could launch soon at $0.085 and rise to $0.205 or more in two years. That’s close to 100x from early entry levels. So far, it has raised more than $15.8 million. Unlike Shiba Inu or PEPE, Remittix is not based on hype; it’s built around actual use. Businesses can accept crypto payments online and cash out to fiat. Users keep their funds safe and don’t need to swap tokens or move between blockchains. Bonus tokens are going to loyal investors, and $100,000 worth of tokens are being given out through a live campaign. Conclusion Shiba Inu remains a big dog in crypto, but PEPE and WIF are moving faster right now. Meme coins can jump, but they often fall just as fast. Remittix gives something different. It offers a working product, real value and smart rewards. If you’re looking for something with 100x potential and real-world value, Remittix looks like a better choice than SHIB, PEPE or WIF.

Key Takeaways: The Smarter Web Company raised £41.2 million days after buying nearly 197 Bitcoin. Its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions have boosted holdings to over 543 BTC in just a month. Despite strong crypto moves, the firm’s shares fell 15% but remain up 274% year-to-date. The firm announced on Thursday that it secured funding from institutional investors through an accelerated bookbuild, a method that enables companies to raise capital quickly without extensive marketing. Of the total funds, £36.27 million ($49.8 million) came from the bookbuild, while an additional £4.97 million ($6.82 million) was raised through subscription. The shares were offered at £2.90 ($3.98) each, with the new stock expected to take effect on July 1. Smarter Web’s Fundraising Fuels Bold Bitcoin Buying Spree The fundraising follows The Smarter Web Company’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Earlier this week, the firm revealed it bought 196.8 BTC at an average price of $103,290, boosting its total Bitcoin holdings to 543.52 BTC—worth approximately $58.19 million. Since launching its Bitcoin treasury strategy in April, the firm has purchased BTC five times in June alone, growing its stash by 460 BTC in less than a month. Despite the crypto push, The Smarter Web Company’s shares have struggled. Trading on the US OTCQB market under the ticker TSWCF, the company’s stock fell 15% on Thursday to close at $3.56 after reaching an intraday low of $3.19, according to Google Finance.

Even with recent volatility, the stock remains up 274% so far in 2025. Meanwhile, other UK firms are also ramping up their Bitcoin bets amid Britain’s unclear regulatory stance on digital assets. On Tuesday, Vinanz, a London-listed Bitcoin treasury company, announced it had acquired 37.72 BTC , bringing its total holdings to nearly 59 BTC. In April, investment firm Abraxas Capital made waves with a Bitcoin purchase exceeding $250 million. VanEck Flags Risks in Corporate Bitcoin Strategies Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, has voiced fresh concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms, warning that aggressive BTC accumulation could ultimately hurt shareholders. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). To protect investors, he suggested suspending ATM programs if shares trade below 0.95 times NAV for more than 10 consecutive days. He drew parallels with past missteps in the crypto mining sector, where rampant dilution and inflated executive compensation wiped out shareholder value. Sigel pointed to Semler Scientific, a medical technology company that pivoted to Bitcoin in 2024, as a cautionary tale. Despite amassing 3,808 BTC, Semler’s stock has plunged over 45%, dragging its market NAV down to 0.82 times NAV.

Bitcoin Solaris has emerged as one of the most aggressively priced and structurally sound entries of the year. It’s now in Phase 9 of its presale, priced at $9 per token — with a confirmed listing on LBank coming soon and a projected launch valuation of $20. With over $5 million already raised and more than 11,500 wallets participating, BTC-S is now delivering token flow — not just promising it. Nova Mining System Converts Phones Into Earners Forget staking lockups or GPU farms. The Nova App gives users the ability to mine BTC-S using spare CPU and storage on ordinary smartphones. During beta testing, mobile users earned live rewards by participating in validation — no setup required. This works because Bitcoin Solaris runs a hybrid architecture. At the base, it uses Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Capacity to keep mining decentralized and efficient. On the upper Solaris Layer, it deploys Proof-of-Stake, Proof-of-History, and Proof-of-Time to push transactions at tested speeds over 10,000 TPS. The result: mining access built for participation, not exclusivity — and real yield distribution even before the token lists. Token Rewards Are Already Flowing Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t delay rewards. The Casino module is live, giving every verified wallet one free spin daily, with instant payouts in BTC-S. Token rewards are issued directly on Solana during presale and will be migrated 1:1 to the Bitcoin Solaris chain upon mainnet launch. Buyers who enter with $250 or more unlock additional spins, with top-tier purchases eligible for prizes of up to 0.5 BTC. These mechanics are designed to deliver rewards now: Crypto Vlog recently highlighted Bitcoin Solaris as a working economy in a presale shell — built to deliver returns before listing, not after. The Presale Is Fixed, Transparent, and Ending Fast There are 21 million BTC-S tokens total. Of those, just 4.2 million are allocated for presale — across all phases. No additional emissions, unlock schedules, or delayed allocations are waiting to dilute holders after listing. Everyone buys at public pricing — and right now that’s $9. With LBank listing confirmed, price movement is coming. At a $20 projected listing value, current presale entries offer more than 150% return potential before secondary demand even activates. And because rewards are tied to usage, not speculation, the token’s value driver is active user behavior. Fully Audited, Team Verified, Exchange Ready The token contract passed a full audit by Cyberscope . The Nova App engine was audited separately by Freshcoins . The dev team is KYC verified , and the roadmap is already rolling forward. Testnet, dev toolkit, and wallet upgrades are scheduled. A Mining Power Marketplace is in active development. These aren’t theoretical milestones — they’re tracked deliverables, and the buildout is already in motion. BTC-S is transitioning from presale to public exchange launch. Traders moving out of stagnant altcoins like SEI are stepping into a project that already has functioning products, clear token distribution, and a live reward system. This is a defined entry point with demand already forming and utilities in use.

Crypto VC funding usually tracks bullish periods, and has recovered after a couple of slower months. Crypto fundraising is back to levels not seen since 2022, ending the first half of 2025 with expansion, despite some slower months. Deals saw a trend shift, moving to large-scale private rounds and late-stage financing, with more cautious seed rounds. The model of funding a project only to sell tokens to exchanges is being phased out, instead focusing more on late-stage deals. VC funds remained vigilant for opportunities, but this time, the main driver was the rise of platforms with a widely adopted products. In the coming months, some of the high-profile crypto platforms plan to announce new large funding rounds. Some of the major deals include Polymarket , Pump.fun, and Kalshi . The latest deals may yet be included in the statistics for Q2 deals. Recently, World Liberty Fi also closed a $100M inflow from the Aqua 1 fund. June fundraising breaks above $4B Crypto fundraising tracks the general mood on the crypto market. After a relatively slow start to 2025, some months posted peak results. In March, total VC deals expanded to $5B. Even in slower months, VC fundraising was consistently above $1B, though some months included a concentration of large deals. Coinbase Ventures was the leader with nine deals, followed by Pantera Capital leading six funding rounds. Most of the deals were also made in undisclosed international locations, for a total of 70 rounds. The USA only saw 15 deals for the past month. However, those deals were the biggest, raising over $1.79B. Singapore-based projects raised a further $1.09B. Crypto VC deals moved to international locations, but the USA is still the leader in terms of USD value. | Source: Cryptorank A total of 103 rounds in June raised over $4.49B, with the potential for more deals to be added to the bottom line. The absolute record for VC deals is over $6.88B in November 2021, during the first Web3 boom. This time around, VC deals are not led by narrative, but by established use cases and signs of growth from transactions, fees, and liquidity. Projects like EigenCloud were among the significant deals for the past month, raising $70M in a late-stage round. For smaller projects, token sales, airdrops and special events have returned as a viable source of funding. In the past four months, token sales raised consistently over $4B on a monthly basis, tapping crypto natives and whales. In June, a total of 174 sales raised $4.79B, surpassing even the level of large VC rounds. The main source of interest in token sales were again the special campaigns of Binance Wallet and PancakeSwap. For the month of June, most TGE and token sales used those two platforms, achieving the highest returns. Binance Wallet projects posted gains of 483% on average, while PancakeSwap achieved 228.5%. The success of token sales relied on concentrating most of the opportunities on a single platform, having a guaranteed pool of buyers. Most projects have abandoned ICO attempts outside the top platforms, which give them the biggest exposure to liquidity.

Judge Analisa Torres’ decision to deny the joint motion from Ripple and the SEC for an indicative ruling halted the XRP price recovery as it aimed to breach the nearest resistance level at $2.23. Key Issues Unresolved For Ripple Despite the SEC dropping its appeal, which indicated that the primary legal conflict between the two parties may be reaching a conclusion, Judge Torres’ ruling highlighted that several procedural matters still require resolution, including necessary court approvals. In her judgment, she made it clear that private agreements cannot supersede public court decisions, stating, “The parties do not have the authority to agree not to be bound by a court’s final judgment… They have not come close to doing so here.” Related Reading: XRP Gears Up For Major Move — Chart Signals Are Clear In response to the ruling, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to convey that the situation is now back in Ripple’s hands. The executive pointed out that the court has given them two options: either to dismiss their appeal regarding the historic institutional sales or to continue with the appeal. Regardless of the path chosen, Alderoty emphasized that XRP’s legal status as a non-security remains intact, reassuring stakeholders that it is business as usual. Expert Reactions To Torres’ Decision Legal expert Fred Rispoli also weighed in on the implications of the injunction, stating that it would not impact XRP in secondary markets or affect potential exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings awaiting approval by the SEC. He noted that the injunction is merely a court document and emphasized the low likelihood of Judge Torres calling Ripple and the SEC back into court unless the SEC believes Ripple is violating the terms of the injunction. Rispoli further questioned whether the SEC has the authority to grant Ripple the necessary exemptions to alleviate any restrictions imposed by the injunction, suggesting that such actions fall within the SEC’s executive powers. Ripple has asserted that it has adjusted its operations to align with the court’s findings, particularly regarding its past sales to institutional investors. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer Alderoty’s use of the term “historic institutional sales” in his recent statement indicates a shift in how both parties might approach future transactions, signaling a potential settlement that would allow XRP sales to institutions in a manner acceptable to the SEC. XRP Price Could Reach $5 Despite this temporary setback, market analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s future. Crypto analyst CryptoBullet recently noted that XRP’s two-week price chart resembles patterns seen in 2017, including a significant accumulation phase and a potential breakout. With this historical context in mind, the expert predicts a final surge in the XRP price, forecasting new all-time high targets between $4.50 and $5.40 for the cryptocurrency. As of press time, the XRP price has retreated to the $2.08 mark, which is a key support level for bulls anticipating further recovery of the token. In the last 24 hours, XRP has dropped 4.4%, and 10% in the last month. According to CoinGecko data, the XRP price remains 38% below its record high of $3.40.

Just as investors need rapid access to market insights, users of personal cloud services demand seamless interaction with their stored memories. Google Photos, a cornerstone for billions of users managing their precious moments, recently faced a significant challenge with its ambitious new AI-powered search feature. However, Google has now engineered a brilliant solution, demonstrating how innovation can overcome initial hurdles to deliver a truly transformative user experience. This strategic move by Google not only addresses user frustrations but also sets a new benchmark for how we interact with our vast collections of digital memories. Google Photos AI: From Initial Stumbles to Accelerated Success The introduction of “Ask Photos” at Google’s I/O developer conference last year promised a revolutionary way to navigate personal photo collections. Leveraging the power of natural language, users could simply ask questions like, “Show me photos of my dog at the beach last summer,” and expect the AI to deliver. This ambitious leap into advanced Google Photos AI capabilities was met with excitement, but the initial rollout encountered significant roadblocks. Users quickly reported that the feature was not only unreliable but also frustratingly slow, often leaving them waiting while the AI was “thinking.” Jamie Aspinall, a Google Photos product manager, candidly acknowledged these issues on X earlier in June, stating that “Ask Photos isn’t where it needs to be, in terms of latency, quality and ux.” This transparency was followed by a temporary pause in the rollout, a decisive step taken by Google to address the core performance issues. The company committed to bringing back the “speed and recall of the original search,” a promise that has now been delivered with impressive results. The Breakthrough in AI Search: Blending Speed and Intelligence Google’s innovative solution involves a strategic merger of its robust classic search capabilities with the advanced intelligence of its new AI system. In a recent blog post, Google detailed how it’s integrating the best of both worlds into “Ask Photos.” For straightforward queries, such as “beach” or “dogs,” the system now prioritizes the speed of the classic search feature. This ensures that users receive immediate results, mirroring the rapid response they were accustomed to before the AI integration. Simultaneously, the powerful AI search engine continues to work diligently in the background. Its role is to analyze and process more complex, nuanced queries. This dual-layer approach means that users get instant gratification for simple requests while the AI meticulously sifts through their entire collection to provide highly relevant and context-rich results for intricate questions. It’s a seamless blend that optimizes both speed and depth, addressing the core complaints of the initial rollout. Gemini AI’s Enhanced Role: Deeper Understanding, Smarter Results At the heart of this improved functionality lies Google’s cutting-edge Gemini AI . This sophisticated large language model is the engine that allows “Ask Photos” to move beyond simple keyword matching. Gemini’s ability to comprehend the nuances of natural language queries, combined with its capacity to understand the actual content of photos and their associated metadata, is what truly elevates the search experience. Consider a scenario where you search for a “white dog.” The updated system will immediately display a series of initial results, leveraging the speed of classic search. Then, as Gemini AI completes its more in-depth analysis, refined results will appear below the initial set. This secondary layer of results might include introductory text that identifies your dog by name (if you’ve previously tagged it) and even tells you when photos of that specific animal first appeared in your library. This intelligent layering of information provides a much richer and more personalized search outcome, turning a simple query into a comprehensive recall of memories. Mastering Natural Language Search for Your Digital Memories The true power of “Ask Photos” now lies in its ability to interpret and respond to queries phrased in everyday language, making natural language search an intuitive reality for photo management. Users are no longer confined to typing specific keywords or navigating through complex folders. Instead, they can simply articulate what they are looking for, much like they would ask a friend. This user-friendly interface is designed for flexibility. While the AI works to deliver its advanced insights, users retain the option to switch back to the classic search view if they prefer. This ensures that control remains firmly in the hands of the user, catering to different preferences and search habits. The enhanced responsiveness and accuracy mean that finding that specific vacation photo from years ago, or a collection of images featuring a particular person or pet, becomes an effortless task rather than a tedious hunt. Unlocking Superior Digital Photo Organization and Accessibility The successful re-launch of “Ask Photos” represents a significant leap forward in digital photo organization and accessibility. By making it easier and faster to retrieve specific memories, Google Photos transforms a potentially overwhelming digital archive into an easily navigable personal treasure trove. This is particularly beneficial for users with vast libraries accumulated over many years, offering a practical solution to a common digital dilemma. To access this powerful new feature, users must meet a few straightforward eligibility criteria. You must be 18 years or older, and your Google account language must be set to English. Furthermore, it is essential to enable “Face Groups,” the feature that intelligently labels and groups people and pets within your Google Photos library. These requirements ensure the AI has the necessary data and context to deliver the most accurate and personalized search results, truly enhancing the utility of your digital memories. Conclusion: A Brilliant Future for Your Photo Memories Google’s commitment to refining “Ask Photos” has paid off, transforming an initially problematic feature into a powerful and user-friendly tool. By seamlessly integrating the speed of classic search with the profound intelligence of Gemini AI, Google Photos has unlocked a new era of digital memory management. This hybrid approach ensures that users can quickly find simple photos while simultaneously benefiting from the AI’s deep analytical capabilities for more complex queries. The resumed rollout across the U.S. signifies a confident step forward, promising a more intuitive, efficient, and ultimately more enjoyable experience for everyone looking to relive their cherished moments. This evolution not only highlights Google’s dedication to innovation but also reaffirms the immense potential of AI in enhancing our everyday digital lives.

One of the most talked-about alternatives this summer is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) —a decentralized lending protocol offering both structure and innovation. With plans to issue a fully overcollateralized stablecoin backed by real crypto assets, audited smart contracts, and protocol-level governance, Mutuum is gaining ground with investors seeking dependable yield and capital efficiency. A Telegram group of XRP whales is buzzing with screenshots, showing they’ve all shifted 20–30% of their portfolios into MUTM while it remains under $0.04. They’re calling it “the generational DeFi entry-point.” With exhausted supply and Phase 5 nearing exhaustion, they expect the price to jump directly to $0.50, locking in 1,566% upside. Buying after them means acquiring at a price they willingly left behind. At just $0.03 in its current presale phase, the token is drawing serious attention. Phase 5 is already 50% sold out, and when it closes, the price will rise to $0.035 in Phase 6. For those who act now, this represents a rare window to gain early exposure to a DeFi ecosystem that blends secure collateral systems with passive income opportunities. Mutuum’s Stablecoin Is Built for Trust The cornerstone of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal to the XRP crowd lies in its commitment to a regulated and secure stablecoin framework. Unlike algorithmic models that have faced historical failures, Mutuum’s stablecoin will only be minted when users borrow against major assets like ETH. Each unit will be backed by overcollateralized deposits and burned when loans are paid off or liquidated. This ensures that supply will always reflect the system’s health and usage. Issuance will be tightly controlled. Only approved smart contracts or “issuers” will be allowed to mint, and each issuer will be assigned a cap to limit risk. Instead of relying solely on market dynamics, the interest rate for borrowing this stablecoin will be set by governance mechanisms that respond to price fluctuations. This allows the system to adjust in real time and maintain the $1 peg. Arbitrage opportunities will further keep the price in check, creating a feedback loop that rewards active users while protecting platform integrity. What makes this stablecoin structure even more convincing is the CertiK audit behind it. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a comprehensive review using manual and static analysis methods, earning a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet Score of 76.50. These numbers place it among the more technically vetted DeFi projects, making it easier for conservative investors to explore lending strategies without compromising security. Beyond trust, Mutuum is preparing to enhance performance through Layer-2 integration. Once live, this infrastructure will support high-volume transactions with minimal fees—a critical improvement for both large investors and users executing multiple lending cycles. The platform’s beta version is expected to launch as the token goes live, giving early buyers immediate experience to the core system. Early Entry, Passive Income, and Strong Fundamentals For those looking to generate reliable passive income, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers multiple streams. Lenders will receive mtTokens—on-chain receipts that grow in value as the lending pool earns interest. These mtTokens will also be stakeable in the designated contracts. Whenever the protocol earns revenue, it will use a portion to buy MUTM tokens from the open market and distribute them to mtToken stakers. This dividend-style model encourages long-term holding and rewards those who help secure platform liquidity. The current opportunity is time-sensitive. With over $11.2 million already raised and more than 12,450 holders, the demand for MUTM tokens is accelerating. Investors today can purchase 100,000 MUTM tokens for just $3,000. At a 15x multiple, that position will be worth $45,000. As the project builds utility around the token—including governance, collateral usage, and staking rights—the case for long-term upside only grows stronger. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also running a $100,000 giveaway to celebrate its presale supporters. Ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, reinforcing the project’s strategy to reward its earliest participants. Combined with the upcoming platform launch and stablecoin deployment, these elements point toward an ecosystem built to last. Ripple (XRP) holders have long championed structured, regulatory-compliant systems. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is aligning itself with that same ethos—backed by technical trust, real asset support, and a utility-rich token model. For those still on the sidelines, the closing days of Phase 5 will be the last chance to acquire MUTM at this discounted rate. The next move up in price is confirmed, and serious investors aren’t waiting.

In 2017, the government declared cryptocurrency illegal and warned against its use. While other countries are pushing forward their crypto regulatory framework, intensifying global competition, Bangladesh took a step back and banned all crypto usage and possession due to the risks of money laundering and financial system instability. Table of contents Were there any Crypto Regulations in Bangladesh? Why is Crypto Banned in Bangladesh? Bangladeshi Government’s Stance on Cryptocurrency Crypto Tax in Bangladesh Possibility of Crypto Regulation in Bangladesh Crypto Adoption in Bangladesh End note FAQs Were there any Crypto Regulations in Bangladesh? While there are no crypto regulations in Bangladesh, the country has established some laws for technological development. March 2020- National Blockchain Strategy Released under the guidance of the Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC) to recognize the crucial importance of emerging technologies such as blockchain. It leverages blockchain technology for various government sectors such as land records, identity systems, and e- governance . Why is Crypto Banned in Bangladesh? In 2014, Bangladesh Bank stated, “anybody caught using the virtual currency could be jailed under the country’s strict anti-money laundering laws.” Due to the potential risk of money laundering and terrorism in finance, the Bangladeshi government banned crypto. The decentralized nature of crypto trading in Bangladesh and the use of anonymous wallets like TRC20 make it difficult for the authorities to monitor transactions and trace the flow of money. Experiencing Ponzi schemes and scams in the cryptocurrency space, such as the MTFE scam , which drew thousands of investors into it and theft their money before vanishing. A few years back, Bangladesh Bank told the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) that while owning crypto is not a punishable offence itself but engaging in money laundering or foreign currency violations with crypto must be prosecuted. Bangladeshi Government’s Stance on Cryptocurrency Despite the government’s strict decision on crypto ban, there is a thriving underground market where individuals engage in crypto trading, and apps like Binance and KuCoin are easily accessible to them through the Google Play Store for crypto trading. The government resolves this unregulated use of crypto in two ways: When crypto is purchased using credit or debit cards and endorsed in US dollars, banks track the transaction of funds and potentially identify the individuals involved. Another method involves the local agent to buy and sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Tether in exchange for Bangladeshi national currency (Taka). They charge a small commission on each transaction, making profits while the investors are lured in the process to think it is valued in US dollars. Crypto Tax in Bangladesh While crypto is still a grey area in Bangladesh and no specific tax regime has been enacted for it, the National Board of Revenue in Bangladesh treats cryptocurrency as subject to the general tax laws of the country. The Income Tax Ordinance of 1984 applies to all crypto transactions in Bangladesh. Possibility of Crypto Regulation in Bangladesh There is a mixed reaction to the crypto ban in Bangladesh. While some people choose to avoid it, others urge the government to regulate crypto. Dr B M Mainul Hossain, a professor at Dhaka University, believes banning crypto is not the solution. He stated , “Sitting back and doing nothing is not the answer,” he said. “Cryptocurrency is already used in many countries legally. We should also think about how to monitor and regulate it.” His statement urged the government to start regulating crypto in the country, considering both the risks and the benefits. Crypto Adoption in Bangladesh As crypto is legally banned in the country, pinpointing the exact number of users is impossible. Binance, a crypto platform, reported that it has more than 600,000 Bangladeshi users on its platform. It indicates, if one platform has such a massive number of crypto users in the country, the total number must be significant. End note Despite the crypto ban in the country, people are using it from different sites, including crypto platforms, exchanges, gambling sites, and anonymous wallets, all of which are difficult to trace. It is crucial to question if crypto is banned in the country, then why are such platforms still available for illegal use? The government aims to focus on safeguarding the nation’s financial stability, but it seems impossible to accomplish while people engage in illicit crypto activities.

The SEC lawsuit, initially filed in December 2020, accuses Ripple Labs of conducting an unregistered securities offering worth $1.3 billion, placing immense pressure on XRP’s valuation and investor sentiment. Despite Ripple’s strategic moves, including the significant acquisition of prime brokerage Hidden Road intended to bolster institutional adoption, XRP remains trapped in regulatory limbo. Prices linger precariously near critical support levels, leaving investors increasingly nervous about the coin’s future and cautious about long-term holdings. Influencers such as Egrag Crypto maintain a degree of optimism, frequently highlighting technical analyses that suggest the potential for dramatic price increases should Ripple emerge victorious or reach a favorable settlement. Yet seasoned professionals like attorney Bill Morgan caution about ongoing risks and prolonged legal battles, emphasizing the potential for delays that could extend well into late 2026 or beyond. This uncertain timeline amplifies investor anxieties, creating a volatile environment for XRP holders and traders alike. The alluring prospect of massive gains starkly contrasts with the grim reality of potential regulatory setbacks, leaving XRP’s fate uncertain and highly speculative.

CEO Brian Armstrong has revealed that the crypto exchange is now purchasing Bitcoin every single week, strengthening its position in the ongoing race among institutions to stock up on BTC. The exchange currently holds $995 million worth of Bitcoin, making it the 10th-largest corporate holder. Armstrong has also encouraged investors to “go long” on Bitcoin, signaling strong confidence in its future as prices inch closer to a new all-time high. We're buying more Bitcoin every week. Long #Bitcoin https://t.co/LleWBXGYTG — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 26, 2025 From Maximalism to Multi-Token Strategy Coinbase launched in 2012 with a Bitcoin-only focus. Back then, Armstrong dismissed altcoins like XRP and Stellar (XLM) as distractions. In a now-deleted tweet from 2014, he claimed Bitcoin was “way far ahead” of the rest – reflecting a clear Bitcoin-maxi mindset at the time. That changed in 2016 when Coinbase added support for Ethereum. Then in 2018, it expanded even further by enabling ERC-20 tokens. During the bull run, the platform added nearly 100 new tokens in just one year. This shift drew criticism from Bitcoin purists who accused Coinbase of chasing trends instead of staying true to BTC. Michael Saylor Cheers Coinbase’s Bitcoin Surge! MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, whose company leads all others in Bitcoin holdings, praised Coinbase’s weekly purchases with a rocket emoji, showing his support for Armstrong’s move. — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 27, 2025 Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey also backed the decision, calling Armstrong the “G.O.A.T.” for doubling down on Bitcoin in such a bold and consistent way. Can Coinbase Catch Up to MicroStrategy? Right now, Coinbase holds 9,270 BTC, while MicroStrategy holds a massive 592,345 BTC. While Armstrong’s commitment to buy weekly is significant, consistency will be key if Coinbase hopes to narrow the gap. In terms of value, Coinbase’s holdings stand at $995 million, while MicroStrategy’s are worth about $33 billion. It’s a big difference but if Coinbase keeps buying aggressively, that could start to shift over time Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Grows Coinbase’s weekly BTC purchases reflect a growing trend: institutions increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a way to preserve long-term value.

The decision , filed on June 26, effectively keeps the door open for further appeals and delays a final resolution. Within hours of the ruling, XRP fell from $2.16 to $2.09, erasing more than $5 billion in market capitalization in under 24 hours. At $123.62 billion, it now holds the dubious distinction of posting the biggest single-day drop among the top 40 digital assets and becoming the most trending crypto asset between Thursday and Friday, according to CoinMarketCap . XRP market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap But while short-term sentiment has clearly taken a hit, not all observers believe the verdict spells trouble for XRP’s longer-term ambitions, particularly regarding a U.S.-listed spot XRP ETF. Lawyer weight in on XRP ETF Fred Rispoli, a legal commentator and vocal supporter of Ripple, argues that the ruling, though headline-grabbing, is unlikely to affect XRP’s standing on secondary markets, which is what ultimately matters for ETF eligibility. SEC v. Ripple Update: This is a long post on my thoughts here but the TLDR is: ""Welcome to the new SEC, for now more or less the same as the last one."" And: Ripple and SEC will settle the appeal for the reduced, agreed upon amount and leave the Torres judgment in place, while the… https://t.co/9y9o4M4uBW — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) June 26, 2025 “Regarding that injunction, it doesn’t affect $XRP on the secondary markets nor will it impact XRP ETF approvals,” Rispoli explained. “And remember, the injunction is just a piece of paper issued by a court… it only substantively matters if the SEC wants it to matter.” In legal terms, Judge Torres’ injunction could theoretically give the court grounds to revisit the case if Ripple is found violating institutional sale restrictions. However, Rispoli emphasized that the SEC would need to actively push for enforcement, an outcome he describes as “extremely low probability.” He also hinted at a broader shift in regulatory posture, suggesting that both Ripple and the SEC may be quietly negotiating a reduced penalty and new guidelines for Ripple’s institutional sales. Such a move would preserve the substance of the Torres ruling while avoiding further escalation. The bigger unknown now lies with the SEC’s leadership. With the commission under political pressure to soften its stance on digital assets, and following the installation of a new Chair under President Trump, there’s growing speculation that an XRP ETF could still move forward, particularly given the rising tide of crypto ETF approvals across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even altcoin ETFs in the pipeline.

Moreover, the upcoming years are expected to be bullish, with a conservative momentum. With an optimistic outlook, we expect the AVAX coin price to reach $50 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $12.36 $30.91 $49.46 Avalanche Price Target July 2025 The price prediction for Avalanche (AVAX) in July 2025 suggests that if bulls regain control and move past short-term EMA hurdles, then AVAX could rally back to the $26.50 resistance level. In a more optimistic scenario, if the 200-day EMA is also flipped, then prices could even reach $33.06 during July or Q3 2025, only if momentum remains strong. However, if momentum doesn’t sustain above the 200-day EMA, then momentum could rise for a brief time, and AVAX might retreat to $20 or $15 support in that upcoming short-term scenario. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) AVAX Price Target July 2025 15.00 26.50 33.06 AVAX Price Prediction 2025 Avalanche (AVAX) is gaining traction among developers, thanks to its high throughput and low fees, making it an attractive platform for gaming applications. Looking ahead, there’s a promising outlook for the AVAX price in 2025. A Bloomberg ETF analyst recently suggested that an AVAX ETF could receive approval by the end of the year, with a 90% chance of success. This potential approval could significantly boost adoption and drive prices higher. Meanwhile a look at its daily technical chart reveals that after a challenging Q1 2025, where AVAX dropped to $14.65, the price showed some recovery in Q2, climbing to $26.50 by mid-May. However, by the end of Q2, it retreated to around $16, facing strong resistance from the 200-day EMA band. From its peak of $55.86 in H2 2024, AVAX is down 68%, marking H1 2025 as a bearish period. The decline from mid-May’s high represents a 33% drop. Interestingly, the $15-$16 support area has been tested three times in Q2, indicating that bearish pressure is weakening at this level. This is increasing investors hopes for H2 to be better than H1. Therefore, if bulls regain control, a short-term rally could push AVAX back to the $26.50 resistance by July 2025. In a more bullish scenario, prices could even reach $33.06 during July or Q3. For the long term, a price target of $50 is feasible, provided that AVAX maintains above $26.50 and closes daily above this level.

With a potential altcoin market in Q1 2025, the ALGO coin price might skyrocket toward a new high. If the network maintains the staggering growth, the ALGO coin price may reach $0.89 in 2025. Conversely, if the network fails to expand, then the price can flip into a bearish trap and dip to $0.45. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.45 $0.67 $0.89 Algo Price Target July 2025 The price prediction for Algorand (ALGO) in July 2025 suggests that if the $0.15 support level holds strong, ALGO may aim for a retest of the $0.24 mark. However, the breach of $0.15 could pull ALGO price lower. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Algorand (ALGO) Price Forecast July 2025 0.09 0.15 0.24 Algorand Price Prediction 2025 The last time a surge in Algorand price was seen was in Q4 2024, it reached a high of $0.613, which marked a 470% gain from the $0.1079 level. But, in Q4 2024, the final month sell-off intensified, stretching into Q1 2025, the price of Algorand fell drastically to a low of $0.1491 by the first week of April, which is a multi-year strong support area for the ALGO price. However, the situation from the second week of April changed as the chart showed a higher-high structure, showcasing that the ALGO price started to recover from the very same multi-year support area. By mid-May Algorand price climbed almost 70% to $0.24 from Q2’s low of $0.150. But, the advance stopped mid-May onwards, as strong supply levels rejected the ascent, pushing the price below 200 day EMA band. In June’s final week, the price came back to April’s low and took support from $0.15 support area. The algorand price is down 71% from Q4 2024’s high and 32% down from mid-may’s high, if short-term bearish elevates then ALGO price might meet 2024’s low of $0.0943, but if the $0.15 level meets strong demand, then it might aim for a retest of the $0.24 mark in July 2025. Moreover, looking at the long-term perspective, if demand increases directly proportional to adoption at an unprecedented rate, then ALGO might clear the targets such as the $0.50 and $0.60 mark, and even hit $0.90 by the end of the year. These targets may sound big compared to its current price at the moment, but on zooming out to the monthly chart. The last three years are a clearly range-bound sideways chart compared to 2021’s high-strength parabolic one.
